"'11-06-01,'0','“Well, it’s not as if we created two new players,” Erik Spoelstra, Miami’s coach, said. “That’s who they’ve been their entire careers. I think it just takes time for players to feel comfortable with each other and a new offensive system and playing with new guys and being in the situation over and over and over.”For Dallas, the outcome was worrisome, especially in light of Nowitzki’s injury. Nowitzki is enjoying a spectacular postseason and had a game-high 27 points on Tuesday. He said he sustained a torn tendon in his left middle finger when he attempted to strip the ball from Bosh with a little more than four minutes left in the game. He will play the rest of the series with a splint over the afflicted finger.“I thought I stripped him clean and then I kind of looked down and I couldn’t straighten my finger anymore,” Nowitzki said. “So I tore a tendon in there. I guess it will be all right. I have to wear a splint for the rest of the playoffs, for a couple of weeks. But it will be all right. It’s on my left hand, so I’ll be all right for Thursday.”“He’s right-handed,” James said of Nowitzki’s injury. “He’ll be all right.”After the injury, Nowitzki converted a jumper and two free throws, but as a one-man show he could not muster a victory for Dallas. The Mavericks can even the best-of-seven series in Thursday’s Game 2 before hosting the next three games in Dallas.On accident, Wade said he reviewed footage of the 2006 finals on Monday. “I see I had no conscience back then,” Wade said of shouldering the scoring load. Now? “Just confidence,” he said. “Guys gave me the ball and put me in a position to do it.”Wade, playing a herky-jerky postseason, forgot a forgettable first half and secured 15 of his 22 points in the second half.His 12-footer opened up a 7-point lead with 4:15 left in the game. Bosh followed with a pair of free throws and, after blocking a shot by Shawn Marion, Wade lined up and followed through on a 3-pointer that extended Miami’s lead to 9 points.James correctly read Dallas's defense and took what it allowed him in the first finals win of his career after being swept by the San Antonio Spurs when he played with Cleveland in 2007. James settled for 24 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists and 4 3-pointers, one in which he contorted, pivoted and leaned away from the rim as the third-quarter buzzer sounded.“Yeah, dare me to shoot, I think that’s pretty much gone,” James said about his newfound touch from long distance.James closed the game in the manner that James does, with a dunk and a free throw when he was fouled by Marion. The performance of Wade and James helped compensate for Bosh, who was only 1 for 9 from the field in the second half.“I think for me going into the fourth quarter, I know it’s winning time,” James said. “That’s when the game is won.”The loss marks the first time the Mavericks have trailed in a series throughout a spectacular postseason run. Dallas mustered little offense beyond Nowitzki and was suffocated by Miami’s defense.“They were more opportunistic tonight than we were,” Carlisle said. “That’s been one of the traits of our run. We’ve been very opportunistic. Tonight, we weren’t as much.”Dallas shot a playoff-low 37.3 percent. Marion played a well-rounded game. Jason Terry, who is the lone holdover from Dallas’s 2006 team other than Nowitzki, scored all 12 of his points in the first half.Miami successfully negated two of Dallas’s supposed strengths. Dallas compensates for defensive mismatches by showcasing a matchup zone defense. But the defense lessens priorities and assignments on rebounding, allowing Miami to find the cracks for 16 offensive rebounds, which helped lead to 15 second-chance points. Paced by James, Miami also outshot Dallas from beyond the arc, with 11 3-pointers in 24 shots to Dallas’s 9 in 22.The Mavericks widened the score with a burst that opened the third quarter. Marion and Nowitzki nailed jumpers and DeShawn Stevenson silenced the crowd with a 3-pointer that extended Dallas’s lead to 8 points, at the time, the largest lead for either team. Spoelstra quickly called a timeout.“The main thing that we were talking about was to just get a good shot at the basket and get another stop,” Bosh said. “That wasn’t our style. That wasn’t the way we want to play defense.”The lead evaporated through scores from Bosh, James and Wade. James’s 3-pointer with 1:09 left in the third quarter provided Miami with its first second-half lead. Before then, the game had featured 10 lead changes and 7 ties. Afterward — with the prodding of Miami’s stars — it did not flip-flop again.“D-Wade actually said that to me,” James said. “Congratulated me after the game on my first finals victory. I mean, it feels good because it’s the first game. And we played well as a team. We got a lot of work to do.”'"
"'11-06-01,'0','As attention to the hiring changes mounted, the Bush administration partly rolled that policy back for the hiring of rookie lawyers in 2007.’s appointee to supervise the division, Thomas E. Perez, went further in a 2009 policy giving career professionals sweeping authority to choose whom to recommend to fill openings for experienced lawyers, a much larger group. Under the policy, if an assistant attorney general for civil rights wants to overrule a recommendation, he must do so in writing. Mr. Perez has not overruled any recommendations..“During this administration, the department has restored the career-driven, transparent hiring process that will produce the most qualified attorneys for the job,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, a Justice Department spokeswoman.analyzed the résumés — obtained via the Freedom of Information Act — of successful applicants to the division’s voting rights, employment discrimination, and appellate sections. The documents showed that the Obama-era hires were more likely to have had experience in civil rights, and they graduated from more selective law schools, than those hired over the final six years of the Bush administration.Specifically, about 90 percent of the Obama-era hires listed civil rights backgrounds on their résumés, up from about 38 percent of the Bush group hires. (There were about 47 Obama-era hires and about 72 in the last six years of the Bush administration.)Moreover, the Obama-era hires graduated from law schools that had an average ranking of 28, according to U.S. News & World Report. The Bush group had a lower average ranking, 42.At the same time, there was a change in the political leanings of organizations listed on the résumés, where discernible. Nearly a quarter of the hires of the Bush group had conservative credentials like membership in the Federalist Society or the Republican National Lawyers Association, while only 7 percent had liberal ones.By contrast, during the first two Obama years, none of the new hires listed conservative organizations, while more than 60 percent had liberal credentials. They consisted overwhelmingly of prior employment or internships with a traditional civil rights group, like the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.Those findings were amplified by a report on Tuesday by The National Law Journal, which analyzed the résumés of nearly 120 career lawyers hired since 2009 across the entire division. Of that group, it reported, at least 60 had worked for traditional civil rights organizations.Robert Driscoll, a Bush administration official at the division who left before the hiring scandal, said that a policy of allowing professional civil rights lawyers to make hiring decisions based on civil rights experience was tactically “brilliant” because it would result in disproportionately liberal outcomes without any need for interference by Obama political appointees.“Career and nonpartisan are not the same thing,” Mr. Driscoll said. “And if you have a requirement that you must have worked in civil rights, then most of the people who have full-time jobs in civil rights are with groups like the A.C.L.U. or the Legal Defense Fund, etc., so then you are going to end up with liberals.”But Joseph Rich, a former voting rights section chief who left during the Bush administration, argued that hiring people to enforce civil rights laws by looking for previous experience working on civil rights matters was not the same thing as looking for a particular political ideology.“You’re not hiring people because they are liberal,” Mr. Rich said. “You’re hiring them because they have terrific experience in civil rights, and that’s what you need.”The politicized hiring practices during the Bush administration corresponded with a significant drop in the enforcement of several major antidiscrimination and voting rights laws, the found. After it took office, the Obama administration pledged to repair and reinvigorate the division.Several civil rights advocates and law professors said the record so far had been mixed. The division has set new records in criminal enforcement — including on matters like human trafficking, hate crimes and police misconduct, while stepping up the enforcement of laws against lending discrimination and preserving access to clinics.But other areas that require more complicated litigation work have produced fewer results so far. The department’s employment section has brought only three cases under a law that prohibits a “pattern or practice” of racial or gender discrimination, and its voting rights section has brought just one case under a law that prohibits election policies that have a racially discriminatory effect — fewer than many division observers had expected.'"
"'11-06-01,'0','“This is what repressive governments do,” he said. “This is what people who don’t want information out in the world do — they try to shut the presses.”Mr. Fanning said “Frontline” included multiple points of view in “WikiSecrets” and provided forums for criticism of the film. Other staffers, speaking anonymously because they had not been authorized by PBS to speak on the record, did not point the finger for the hack directly at WikiLeaks, but some did suggest that it would be hypocritical for any supporters of such a group to try to tamp down on freedom of information.From time to time, other news organizations have wound up in the bull’s-eye of hacker groups, sometimes after they have published unflattering information about those very groups.Last December, Web sites belonging to Gawker Media were forced to stop publishing when hackers gained access and stole the names and passwords of some users. Gawker had been critical of hacker groups like the one called Anonymous that had attacked security firms and Web sites of the Egyptian government.The group that claimed responsibility for the PBS attack this week, called Lulzsec, also hacked Fox.com, the Web site of the Fox broadcast network, earlier this spring and divulged personal information about some of the potential contestants on a reality show. “We don’t like you very much,” the group wrote in a letter touting the successful break-in.Individual subjects of media coverage have also been known to retaliate using hacking tactics: in a well-publicized case that led to a conviction last year, a New Jersey man spread a computer virus that searched for mentions of his name in online articles and tried to shut down the hosts of those articles.The PBS attack appeared to start with Sunday’s publication of a fake news article about the rapper Tupac Shakur being spotted alive in New Zealand. (He died in 1996.) Then, on Monday afternoon, the “Frontline” site was infiltrated, Mr. Fanning said.Comparing it to a rock being chucked through a storefront window, he said, “I don’t believe it will in any way hinder our continuing reporting on these sorts of subjects, but it is a cautionary note.”Among the news sources affected was Tehran Bureau, a well-regarded source of news about Iran that is operated under the “Frontline” umbrella. The Web sites appeared to be back online on Tuesday afternoon.Robert Corn-Revere, a partner at the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine who specializes in First Amendment law, compared the hacking incident to the vandalism of a newspaper box or the theft of the papers from the box. “Something like that is not a protected First Amendment act, even though you’re expressing frustration with a newspaper,” he said.When the Web site for “PBS NewsHour” was disrupted, staffers turned to sites like YouTube, where they posted Monday’s newscast, and Tumblr, where they published transcripts and the news organization’s features.PBS said that visitors to the sites did not have their personal information compromised, as has occurred in other hacking cases.“As this breach shows, there’s more than just personally identifiable information at risk,” said Phil Blank, a security analyst with Javelin Strategy & Research. Many Web sites, he said, fail to take appropriate steps to combat “Web site defacing” and “reputational risk.”In the event of a hacker attack, news organizations, he said, “lose both ways — they lose from the ‘Gee, don’t they take care of their Web site?’ perspective, and they lose from the ‘How do I know the information they’re putting out is accurate?’ perspective.”'"

The agency expects to have results later this summer of an 800,000-person study it commissioned to examine the risks.In the meantime, regulators said doctors and patients should watch for symptoms of blood clots, including leg or chest pain.The Yaz family of products generated $1.47 billion in sales last year for Bayer, or 3.3 percent of the company’s revenue.'"

"'11-06-01,'0','As Libération editor Demorand wrote in an editorial: “Now that voices have been freed, and the ceiling of glass and shame has been bashed in, other scandals may now arise.”After long scorning American Puritanism and political correctness on gender issues, the French are shocked to find themselves in a very American debate about the male exploitation/seduction of women, and the nature of consent.is trying to reverse his spiraling fortunes by shaking off his old reputation as a jumpy and flashy Hot Rabbit and recasting himself as a sober and quiet family man.

Georges Tron resigned on Sunday after the two women in their mid-30s said they had gotten the courage to come forward after the Strauss-Kahn arrest.Tron, it seems, liked to give foot massages and sometimes more.  It got to the point where some women would wear boots if they knew Monsieur Masseur was coming to a meeting.“Yes, my client is a reflexologist,” riposted Tron’s lawyer, Olivier Schnerb. “He’s never hidden it. He has given conferences at the Lion’s Club. It’s a healing treatment.”In Le Journal du Dimanche, Valérie Toranian, the editor of Elle, wrote about the puncturing of ’s “Latin culture of seduction”: “We laugh about our Italian neighbors, but the stone today is in our .” (She probably didn’t want to use a shoe-on-the-other-foot metaphor given the foot fetishist on the loose.)On Tuesday, Libération presented interviews with a parade of women who poured out long-stifled grievances about their paternalistic culture: How they feel they must wear pants to work to fend off leering; how they’re tired of men tu-ing instead of vous-ing and making comments like “O.K., but just because you have pretty eyes”; how they’re fed up with married pols who come to Paris three days a week and sleep with their assistants; how, as Aurélie Filipetti, a socialist representative, complained, male pols and journalists squat on 80 percent of the political space.Filipetti remembers hearing a male representative say during a ceremony, in front of three female representatives, “Hunting is like women. You always regret the shots you didn’t take.”Corinne Lepage, a former environment minister, talked about the de trop dirty jokes, recalling how once, when a female representative mentioned a , a male colleague called out: “With her face, it’s not going to happen to her.”Nicole Guedj, a lawyer and former minister, said wistfully of  male colleagues: “One thinks, ‘I wish you wouldn’t just look at me. I wish you would listen to me.’ ”Roselyne Bachelot, a government minister, warned about lechers: “Something important has happened in these last few days. The lifting of a very real omertà, which had been reinforced by a legal arsenal that protected private life. I think that public men have understood that the respect of privacy now has some limits.”Getting French men to change will still, she said, be pushing up “le rocher de Sisyphe.”'"
"'11-06-01,'0','Can you name three female artists? The people asked that question outside the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art can’t get much beyond Frida You-Know-Who-I-Mean. That’s old, sad news to Lynn Hershman Leeson, the director of “!Women Art Revolution” — “!W.A.R.” — a documentary history of the feminist art movement.Adrian Piper, Betye Saar, Nancy Spero, Martha Rosler and Carolee Schneemann (that’s five for next time you’re asked) are just some of the artists interviewed by Ms. Hershman Leeson, who in the mid-1960s, a young artist herself, borrowed a camera and started shooting the friends and colleagues who passed through her living room in Berkeley, Calif. She continued off and on over the years, wherever she could. (Judy Chicago holds forth in a college bathroom at one point.) These interviews form the backbone of “!W.A.R.,” and like the film, they’re passionate, contentious, funny, sincere, politically attuned. They’d make you nostalgic for the struggle except, as many point out, the struggle continues.The artists talk about how their work was condescended to or ignored, excluded from galleries and museums. (“Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?” the Guerrilla Girls, some of whose masked members appear here, asked in the ’80s.) Ms. Hershman Leeson’s documentary sets out to correct the historical record and goes further, making the case that feminist art — varied, messy, conflicted and engaged with the times — is at the very center of that history.As a matter of principle, Ms. Hershman Leeson shows as much of that art as she can, including her own. She debated with herself about using her work, she says, but decided, enough with omissions. (To that end there’s an archival Web site, rawwar.org.) After all, if this is “!W.A.R.,” omission is the enemy. And Ms. Hershman Leeson’s fighting spirit is contagious.Opens on Wednesday in Manhattan.Written, directed and edited by Lynn Hershman Leeson; directors of photography, Hiro Narita, Antonio Rossi, Fawn Yacker, Lise Swenson and Ms. Hershman Leeson; music by Carrie Brownstein; produced by Ms. Hershman Leeson, Kyle Stephan and Alexandra Chowaniec; released by Zeitgeist Films.

"'11-06-01,'0','As nationwide protests in entered their 12th week, President issued a general amnesty on Tuesday, Syrian state media reported.State television and Syria’s official news agency reported that the amnesty would be broad and would include members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, but details issued late in the day by the government indicated that it amounted to sentence reductions for certain crimes.The announcement appeared to be part of an emerging pattern in Syria, where Mr. Assad had several times issued decrees that appeared to answer protesters’ demands for greater freedom, while his security forces continued to kill and detain those who demonstrated. Human rights activists say security forces have killed more than 1,000 protesters and arrested more than 10,000 people since the demonstrations began in mid-March.Syria’s official government news agency, SANA, announced the president’s amnesty offer in a red banner headline marked “urgent” at the top of its Web site. State television also announced the amnesty in an evening broadcast and, according to The Associated Press, reported that it would cover all crimes and members of all political parties, including the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Membership in the Muslim Brotherhood has been a capital offense in Syria since 1980, and it was not immediately clear what effect, if any, the new decree would have on the organization’s legal status.Later in the evening, however, the Syrian government released more specific details about the nature of the amnesty, via SANA. Though the term “general amnesty” was still used on SANA’s English-language Web site, the pardon appeared to be limited to little more than sentence reductions for some crimes.Mr. Assad’s offer came at a time of growing public outrage, fueled by a video of the tortured and battered body of a 13-year-old boy who had been arrested in April at a demonstration near his home in the southern village of Jiza.'"
"'11-06-01,'0','JUBA, Sudan — Northern and southern Sudanese officials have agreed to a preliminary arrangement on demilitarizing the border between them, the African Union said Tuesday, though some officials from both sides immediately expressed skepticism of the deal, particularly its ability to resolve the dispute over the contested Abyei area.Sudan’s internal north-south border — which will soon mark an international boundary between northern Sudan and the soon-to-be-independent nation of South Sudan — has been the site of intense clashes in recent months. Both north and south have mustered a large number of forces along the divide, and on May 21 the northern Sudanese army and local militiamen seized the Abyei area, setting off fears of a larger border war.But according to a deal reached on Monday night and disclosed by African Union officials on Tuesday, both sides have agreed to establish a demilitarized 12.4-mile-wide zone along the roughly 1,240-mile border, and to have a high-level body with representatives from each side to monitor security arrangements that affect Sudan, both north and south, though its workings are still vague.“The agreement paves the way for further negotiations on key security issues between the parties, to be convened by the A.U. Panel within the week,” an African Union statement said.Still, there was ample skepticism. Both sides have broken treaties before.“The question is, whether the Khartoum army and intelligence implement it?” said Col.

"'11-06-01,'0','If the first week is any judge, Papaya King is on to something here: people were lined up Wilcox Avenue to place an order on Friday, though they seemed as much drawn by the New York mien of the brand as by what they tasted.“I only know about this place from ‘Seinfeld,’ some episode of ‘Seinfeld,’ ” said Todd Smailes, 36, a graphic designer, who lives up the street, and was eating a hot dog with two friends on the sidewalk. “That’s the only reason I heard of it.”Crumpling up a napkin, Mr. Smailes said he preferred Pink’s. “This doesn’t blow me out of the water,” he said. His sidewalk lunch companion, Chris Melkonian, proclaimed that he preferred pricier fare at Dodger Stadium. “Average,” he said.Still, for Papaya King owners — who have two shops in New York now that the famous Greenwich Village outpost is closed — the draw is understandable. Los Angeles consumes more hot dogs than any other city in the country, followed by New York, according to the latest statistics from the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council. “Los Angeles has perfect hot dog weather, year-round,” said Seth Cohen, a principal with Papaya King.The location is near a number of late-night clubs, and it plans to stay open until 3 a.m. to accommodate the buzzing clubgoers who spill out onto the streets. As it is, many of those people traditionally end their night (or begin their morning) by heading for food trucks that offer digestion-challenging bacon-wrapped dogs, known as Danger Dogs.Papaya King’s dogs start at $2.25, while the basic chili dog at Pink’s begins at $3.45 and goes up from there. And because Los Angeles, like New York, is always on the hunt for the next new thing, there has always been something of a fascination with New York here.“Anything imported from New York, it’s going to have that hipster vibe,” Ms. Kleiman said. “In L.A., there’s always room for a visible, iconic place that has a lot of expatriate attachment to it.”Papaya King teamed up with a restaurant and luxury developer, SBE, to open the shop here and, in the year to come, in other locations across the West. Sam Nazarian, the founder of the company, said he was not worried about the homegrown competition, saying the Papaya dog — not to mention the signature Papaya drink — would more than hold its own with the Western audience.“Pink’s is a fast-food stand — it has everything and anything,” he said. “For us, it’s literally all about the hot dog.” Mr. Nazarian said he liked and respected Pink’s, but “L.A., I think, is looking for something new.”That said, Ms. Kleiman, a native of Los Angeles, said that she had eaten a Papaya hot dog only once while on an East Coast visit. “Will I go out of my way to go there?” she said. “No. I am a Let’s Be Frank kind of girl, and I live close to them.”'"

No Republicans voted in favor.The showdown over the issue is likely to continue well into the summer, with consequences for both parties and, potentially, for the economy and Wall Street, where the bond market in particular is watching the partisan standoff closely. Yet for all the talk of crisis should Congress fail to raise the debt ceiling by Aug. 2, when the says it will run out of room to meet all the government’s obligations without further borrowing, the financial markets are likely to yawn at Tuesday’s proceedings.“Wall Street is in on the joke,” said R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the .But beyond this week, Wall Street has reason to be nervous as the issue plays out, said people in both parties and in finance.Investors have grown accustomed to partisan games of chicken that always end with the needed increase in the government’s borrowing authority. But this showdown, many say, is riskier because of the strongly held antispending, antitax views of the many freshman House Republicans combined with the fragility of the economic recovery.“The people who are more politically savvy realize this may not be the normal brinkmanship,” said Senator , Democrat of . Nor, he added, is this standoff like the fight a few months ago over the current year’s spending, which ended with a late-night deal shortly before the government would have shut down.“The thing that people are missing is that in shutting down the government you can go to the 11th-and-a-half hour, and the consequences of not doing it, while significant, are not economy-threatening,” Mr. Warner said. “You can’t go to the 11th-and-a-half hour on the debt limit. You don’t know what’s going to spook the bond markets.”The chief wild card is the House Republican majority, which was elected last November after a campaign defined by voters’ antipathy toward budget deficits. More numerous than the insurgents elected in the conservative waves of 1980 and 1994, many freshman Republicans have no experience in public office and consider themselves citizen-legislators who entered government to shrink it, regardless of the political costs.“The people who have been sent to Washington most recently are bringing a strong message from the Republicans more to the right that really want something done about government spending,” said Joseph E. Kasputys, founder of IHS Global Insight and an official in the Nixon and Ford administrations.Many House Republicans have said publicly that they either do not believe the government will default or that they do not fear it. Many embrace a proposal by Senator , a first-year Republican from , for the Treasury to pay bondholders with incoming revenues and delay other government payments pending a resolution. Treasury Secretary and many on Wall Street call the idea unworkable.Many Republicans have also made comments indicating that they do not understand or do not care that an increase in the debt limit is needed not only for new spending but also to cover Social Security checks, military pay and myriad other obligations previously agreed to, as well as for payments to creditors holding Treasury bonds.Another difference from recent decades, when the parties several times agreed to bipartisan budget-cutting deals to raise the debt limit, is the scale of spending cuts that Republicans are demanding as the price of support — up to $2 trillion in savings over a decade.For Republicans and Democrats to agree this summer on such a far-reaching deficit reduction plan is a hurdle that is all the higher given how far apart the parties are. Republicans oppose any new taxes while Democrats say a balanced package must include higher revenues.Just as the political dynamic is more precarious than in years past, so too, say some analysts, is the economic recovery. The combination “definitely makes it more dangerous” to even flirt with default, said Rick Rieder, a managing director of BlackRock, the world’s largest management firm.“The practical ramifications of it are dramatic, and I truly believe this,” Mr. Rieder said. At some point short of actual default, he said, “you’re going to run down the road where the rating agencies are going to have to react, the Fed is going to have to make a set of decisions, international investors are going to have to interpret what this means, and you could functionally have a self-fulfilling prophecy in terms of the risk while not actually having a default.”“That is such a dangerous path to go down,” he said.Not everyone believes an impasse would necessarily provoke economic damage. But much of the business community is concerned. “Am I the only one who remembers the split screen on TARP?” asked Mr. Josten.He is not. Worriers from Washington to Wall Street increasingly recall how, amid the financial crisis of September 2008, House Republicans voted by a two-to-one ratio against the proposed , better known as the bank bailout. Cable networks split screens, showing stock markets going down simultaneously with the House vote; the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 777 points, its largest single-day point drop.Within days Congress approved a revised bailout and President signed it into law.'"

Edmunds has everything you need to know about buying or selling a used vehicle, including Carfax vehicle history reports, dealership listings and pricing information, expert car reviews, consumer car reviews, car dealership reviews, car price comparisons, car appraisal calculators, images and videos, technical features and specs, user forums and more.At Edmunds, you'll be able to browse thousands of used cars, trucks and SUVs for sale with special offers, appraise your current car, and research the car, SUV or truck of your dreams. You can limit your search to certified pre-owned (or CPO) vehicles for sale and be a click away from articles by our experts that will give you the best car shopping and buying tips and advice. Let's take a closer look at each of these aids to easier used-car shopping.The INVENTORY tab at the top of the page allows you to browse used cars for sale from popular makes such as Ford, Honda, Toyota, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Infiniti, Acura and Subaru. The inventory tool allows you to cast a much wider net than simply visiting your local dealership's website. Start with the make and model of the vehicle that you're interested in. You'll have the option to refine your search by price, distance, model year and mileage. If you're looking for specific options or features, a certain trim level or a specific color, there are more advanced search filters available, including engine type, fuel type, drivetrain, powertrain, airbags, air-conditioning and much more. After you find the car, SUV, truck or hybrid that you're interested in, select the listing to check out the VIN details page for that vehicle and get more information. There you'll find a description of the vehicle from the dealer, vehicle features and options, contact information for that dealership, dealer reviews, a ballpark insurance estimate, and a link to see a Carfax vehicle history report.The APPRAISE tab at the top of the page lets you enter your car's basic information, odometer reading, trim level, and overall condition. Then Edmunds provides you with the True Market Value (TMV) for your used car or vehicle. Edmunds's True Market Value or used car value is is a great starting point for negotiation of a used-car sale between a private buyer and seller. This is an ""as is"" value that does not include any warranties. The final sales price depends on the car's actual condition and local market factors. You can use this used car value estimate to price your car for sale or to negotiate a trade-in for a new, CPO, or previously owned car for sale from a local dealer. The used car value estimate is also useful for assessing retail pricing at a car dealer. You can try it out by clicking the ""APPRAISE"" tab, above. Once you enter your vehicle details, you will receive three estimates for your used car's value: ""Trade-in"" is what you can expect a dealer to offer you for your used car; ""Private Party"" is what you might expect to earn if you sold the pre-owned vehicle yourself; and ""Dealer Retail"" is what you might expect to pay if you were buying this used model used at a dealership. If the vehicle is new enough, you'll also see a price that says ""Certified Used Price."" This price estimates what the dealership might sell it for as a certified pre-owned vehicle.The RESEARCH tab points you to our expert analysis of the make and model of the car you select. You can read our editors’ reviews and learn about each generation of the vehicle you're interested in. From there, you can narrow the focus of your car buying research by selecting a particular model year and learning more by checking out photos of the cars, researching local dealership listings, car valuation, consumer reviews, editors' reviews, pros & cons, features & specs, and safety information. That's a world of information. And we've put it all right at your fingertips.'"

"'11-06-02,'0','And they seem to be getting it right.“They did their homework,” said Bernie Baker, the former Hawaii editor at Surfer Magazine and the contest director for the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing, who cited Nike’s “relentless promotion of youth events” as one of the driving factors in the brand’s success. “When that logo is on the deck of a surfboard, from 200 yards away it’s the same as a Quiksilver logo. You recognize that design.” Nike began teasing the campaign in early May with a 30-second version of the commercial online. Viewers who watched the short could respond to a Facebook page for the campaign debut Thursday, when a three-minute and 30-second version of the commercial will be shown followed by a 23-minute behind-the-scenes film.The spot, which was created by the agency 72andSunny and directed by Lance Acord, shows the athletes performing at night in locations like Whistler, British Columbia; Bali, Indonesia; and New York City.“Facebook is the premier partner and platform to use globally that has the biggest global reach,” said Davide Grasso, the vice president for global brand marketing at Nike.Mr. Acord, who has worked with Nike for the last 15 years, described the filming as “pretty epic” and complex when the crew had to deal with shooting during a blizzard in Whistler, or was forced to improvise when a shipment of cables was not delivered in Bali.The video takes its creative cues from the idea of action sports as a music concert with the athletes lit by flood lights as they perform their sport at night.Mr. Acord said he took a theatrical approach to the lighting and incorporated elements from his experience producing music videos.For Mr. Rodriguez, the commercial was the largest production he had ever been part of. “It definitely was a little challenging,” he said of having to perform tricks like the varial heelflip and the switch hardflip while under a puffing smoke machine and bright lights.The campaign features a contest in which athletes can submit videos showing themselves in action. The videos will run on the campaign’s Facebook page, and visitors to the page will be able to vote on which video they like best. Some of the athletes, including Mr. Rodriguez, will help judge the entries. In addition to special features, Mr. Rodriguez said he would look for “the quality of the skills of course, the best maneuvers, creativity with the editing and the music that they choose.”Winners of the contest will be chosen at the U.S. Open of Surfing, which is held in Huntington Beach, Calif., and completely owned and sponsored by Nike.Nike will also release a 3-D version of the commercial that will be shown on the Fourth of July weekend in movie theaters before films like “Transformers 4.”That spot, at 90 seconds long, will be shown on television on Sunday during the third game of the National Basketball Association finals.According to Kantar Media, Nike spent $108 million in advertising in 2009 and $116 million in 2010.To help design products to tie to the campaign, Nike hired a series of artists to design graphics and T-shirts for the “Just Do It” theme. The campaign is also tied to the debut of a sneaker called the Braata LR Mid Premium shoe, a skating shoe reminiscent of the Nike Dunk.“Nike is one of those companies that epitomizes this culture of design,” said Brent Rollins, 41, a designer for the brand whose T-shirts give the “Just Do It” logo an ’80s-retro feel.Apparel is a big growth area for Nike, and company executives said they expected Nike to be one of the top three brands for sports apparel by 2015 by aiming at professional athletes and then taking the marketing message to a broader audience.“The T-shirt is probably the uniform of this crowd,” said Bastien Renard, Nike’s global marketing director for action sports. “It’s an easy story to deliver. It’s a story with a message as well.”The company has been ramping up its action sports products and branding over the last few years, most visibly with surfing and skating. In 2002, Nike acquired the Hurley brand of skateboard- and surf-oriented apparel to compete directly with brands like Quiksilver, O’Neill and Billabong. A year later, it acquired Converse, the canvas sneakers popular with skateboarders.In 2005, Nike created Nike 6.0, a sub-brand featuring shoes and other apparel for action sports. In 2008, Nike offered millions of dollars in a failed bid to sign the surfer Jordy Smith to its label. Since 2009 it has sponsored the U.S. Open of Surfing, a weeklong surfing competition. This year, Nike produced a short film featuring a cast of female surfers like Malia Manuel and Monyca Byrne-Wickey called “Leave a Message.”The new campaign will hit an international audience as well. Broadcast spots will be shown in countries like France, Italy and Germany, and Nike will use a Chinese social media site, Renren Tudou, in addition to Facebook to show the commercial.Emerging markets like China, India and Brazil are estimated to represent 19 percent of overall sales for Nike, according to research by Edward Jones, and 60 percent of sales come from international markets. Matt Arnold, an analyst who covers Nike for Edward Jones, said, “To have a pair of Nikes elsewhere is a very big deal.”'"

"'11-06-02,'0','Moody’s lowered Greece’s credit rating on Wednesday by three notches to an extremely speculative level because of debt restructuring worries, and warned that more downgrades could come.Citing a growing risk that Greece will fail to stabilize its debt position without a debt restructuring, Moody’s cut Greece’s rating to Caa1 from the previous level of B1, bringing it seven notches into junk territory.The outlook on the new rating is negative, in a sign that another downgrade is likely in the short to medium term.“The first trigger for today’s downgrade is Moody’s view that Greece is increasingly likely to fail to stabilize its debt ratios within the timeframe set by previously announced fiscal consolidation plans,” the ratings agency said in a statement.Moody’s also cited the increased likelihood that Greece’s lenders, the European Union and International Monetary Fund, at some point would require the participation of private creditors in a debt restructuring as a precondition for funding support.“Taken together, these risks imply at least an even chance of default over the rating horizon,” Moody’s said.'"
"'11-06-02,'0','GAZA — Days after Egypt, with great fanfare, opened its border permanently with Gaza, new restrictions have been imposed on Palestinians who want to cross, and the area’s Hamas rulers spoke on Wednesday with frustration and anger.Only three buses, carrying a total of 150 passengers, entered the Egyptian hall at the Rafah crossing on Wednesday, while five others remained stuck on the Palestinian side, Hamas officials said two hours before closing.“Since Tuesday, we are witnessing complications that we cannot understand,” said Salama Baraka, director of the crossing, who blamed “the Egyptian side for the nearly paralyzed movement of travelers.” Local reports said that Hamas was considering shutting the border in protest.On Saturday, the new Egyptian government said it was lifting restrictions that had sharply limited entry from Gaza in the past four years after Israel, with Egyptian cooperation, imposed a closing to pressure Hamas. The new rules said men over 40, children and all women could travel from Gaza through Egypt without prior arrangement.But Egypt has been returning dozens of travelers, Hamas officials say.Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas deputy foreign minister, said that Hamas authorities had contacted the Egyptians for clarification. “On the ground, we face some difficulties,” he said.'"
"'11-06-02,'0','As for Li Na and Marion Bartoli, neither had advanced past the fourth round at Roland Garros until this year, and, like the 30-year-old Schiavone, they are hardly neophytes riding the learning curve. Li is 29. Bartoli, the last French player in the tournament and a Wimbledon finalist in 2007, is 26.But any of them could be the French Open champion in this unusually open year, and on Thursday in the semifinals, Li will face Sharapova, and Bartoli will then face Schiavone.The late-blooming Li has done much of the trailblazing for Chinese singles players, and she is back at it here in Paris after her poised and impressive 7-5, 6-2 victory over the taller and much noisier Victoria Azarenka on Wednesday.Li became the first Chinese player to reach a Grand Slam singles final when she lost in the Australian Open final this year to . Since then, Li has struggled on court and demoted her husband from coach to just plain husband. But she has recovered just in time for the next major under her new coach, Michael Mortensen, and has had the best year of any woman in the Grand Slam events.“I never think I can play semis in Roland Garros; I think about the other three,” Li said.Li is the first Asian player to advance this far in Paris since Kimiko Date of reached the French Open semifinals in 1995. Li said Asian players had struggled with their footwork on clay and the fact that their technique generally emphasized flatter hitting over topspin.But the fourth-seeded Azarenka, a lithe force of nature who is not too fond of Plan Bs, kept giving Li the flat power on which she thrives and kept failing to convert on break points as well. It was a big-hitting match, and to reach the final, Li will have to beat her third blonde power hitter in a row.Sharapova holds a 5-2 edge over Li but has lost their last two matches, both of which were in , , on grass. In their only previous clay-court match, Sharapova won in the fourth round here in three sets in 2009.Under her new coach, Thomas Hogstedt, Sharapova is on a roll after winning in Rome on clay. On Wednesday, she overwhelmed Andrea Petkovic of , 6-0, 6-3, and is now two victories from completing her career collection of Grand Slam titles.Despite the cow-on-ice connection, Sharapova did reach the semifinals here in 2007. But her footwork on clay can still give the impression that she is in hostile territory. She rarely slides, treating the surface as a slippery hardcourt, which is essentially what it is this year in Paris after a stretch of dry, sunny weather.It once looked likely that the era of the Williams sisters would give way to the era of Sharapova, but this will be Sharapova’s first Grand Slam semifinal since she won the Australian Open in 2008.Since then she has overcome a career-threatening shoulder injury, revamped her service motion and maintained her appetite for competition despite all her riches and numerous on-court setbacks — including a 6-0, 6-2 defeat to Dominika Cibulkova at Roland Garros two years ago.“It’s a long process,” said Sharapova, still just 24. “I don’t think the great moments or the great feelings feel as good as when everything comes easy to you.”It did not come easy against Petkovic at this year’s Australian Open, where Sharapova was beaten soundly, 6-2, 6-3, in the third round and looked less than impressed with Petkovic’s victory dance on court. But there has been no more dancing against her since then: Sharapova beat Petkovic in the semifinals in Key Biscayne, Fla., and dominated the critical rallies Wednesday.“There’s no doubt I’ve improved on the surface and no doubt that as the years went on I’ve felt better and better,” Sharapova said. “Towards the end of the clay season for me, I would always feel like: ‘Oh, I’m feeling good. I want to actually play more tournaments.’ ”Win just two more matches, and Sharapova can end this clay-court season feeling much better than usual. She is hardly alone.'"
"'11-06-02,'0','ADP Employer Services, the payroll processing firm, said Wednesday that private employers added 38,000 jobs in May, the smallest increase since September and well below market expectations.The report came in advance of Friday’s monthly employment report for May by the Labor Department. The nonfarm payroll employment numbers are keenly anticipated every month by investors to assess the state of wages, salaries, and ultimately consumer spending.“We had this accumulation of data pointing to slower economic growth,” said Kathy Jones, a strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “I think today’s ADP number probably just tipped everybody over the edge who was hoping we might see a strong employment report on Friday.”Economists said that the ADP survey could have been affected by severe storms in many parts of the country last month, while automobile manufacturers have temporarily laid off workers in response to a disruption in supply chains. Analysts at Capital Economics said in a research note that the dip also reflected a slowdown in the growth in the service sector.Economists at Goldman Sachs revised their estimate of May nonfarm payrolls to 100,000 from 150,000 after the ADP report.“While the ADP report has a mixed track record in forecasting payroll growth, our research indicates it should receive some weight,” they said in a research note. “Moreover, the weakness in the ADP report follows a streak of weaker-than-expected news on both the labor market and activity as whole.”The slower growth in employment along with fewer new orders were factors in the lower measure of manufacturing last month. In its survey of 18 industries, the Institute for Supply Management said its index fell to a 19-month low of 53.5 last month from 60.4 the previous month. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated that the index would decline to 57.1 points.“Pressures from rising commodity costs, plus supply-chain disruptions from Japan’s natural disaster, and extreme weather domestically, have combined to slow manufacturing’s momentum,” said Nigel Gault, IHS Global Insight’s chief United States economist.“This is particularly worrying since manufacturing has been the economy’s shining star,” he added in a research note.Also weighing on investor sentiment was a report that the steady recovery in auto sales stalled in May, as consumers stayed away from new-car showrooms because of higher prices, shortages of some Japanese models, and concerns over the economy. Automakers said that sales dropped 3.7 percent last month compared with the same period a year earlier. Despite the overall decline, sales by Detroit’s Big Three automakers outpaced imports for the first time in more than five years last month.Markets were also down in Asia on Thursday morning after the pullback in the United States.As stocks slumped, investors turned their attention to safer assets, pushing government bond prices higher. The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 1 1/32, to 101 18/32. The yield fell below 3 percent for the first time in 2011. It eased to 2.94 percent, from 3.06 percent late Tuesday.Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, said Treasuries rose in reaction to the latest economic reports. He said the latest statistics suggested “what appears to be a significant slowdown” in the economy in the last month.'"

"'11-06-03,'0','Ms. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, criticized Mr. Romney’s Massachusetts health care plan as her One Nation bus tour headed toward the coastal town of Portsmouth, N.H., for a clambake on Thursday evening.“In my opinion, any mandate coming from government is not a good thing,” Ms. Palin told reporters in Boston, taking aim at Mr. Romney’s past support for a requirement that individuals in Massachusetts buy health insurance.Ms. Palin’s remarks — and even her presence in the state — were clearly intended to tweak Mr. Romney on his big day. Ms. Palin has said her bus tour is not meant to be political. But she arrived in New Hampshire a day earlier than expected and made her comments in time to be included in all of the stories about Mr. Romney’s speech.Mr. Giuliani, who was in New Hampshire on Thursday to speak at a local Republican event, also took aim at Mr. Romney’s health care record, saying: “The reality is that Obamacare and Romneycare are almost exactly the same. I would think the best way to handle it is to say, ‘It was a terrible mistake and if I could do it over again, I wouldn’t do it.’ ”Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, arrives this weekend for several days in New Hampshire. And Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, has said he will compete aggressively in New Hampshire.The attacks by Ms. Palin and Mr. Giuliani highlight what many observers say is a central problem for Mr. Romney as he seeks the nod from Republicans: No matter what he says about the economy and jobs and foreign policy, his rivals have one response: that Mr. Romney was the inspiration for Mr. Obama’s health care plan.In his speech, Mr. Romney barely mentioned the issue, saying only that he “hammered out a solution that took a bad situation and made it better — not perfect, but it was a state solution for a state problem.” That got no applause from the crowd of several hundred people who gathered for a chili cookout with Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, before the announcement.Instead, Mr. Romney and his aides hope to focus voter attention on the credentials they say make him the best choice for reversing the economic policies of Mr. Obama’s administration.On Thursday, Mr. Romney accused Mr. Obama of failing to live up to the promise of economic recovery he made in his 2008 campaign. And he pledged, without hesitation, to repeal the president’s health care overhaul.“We will return responsibility and authority to the states for dozens of government programs — and that begins with a complete repeal of Obamacare,” he said. “From my first day in office, my No. 1 job will be to see that America once again is No. 1 in job creation.”'"
"'11-06-03,'0','“It’s very unusual to deal with a predicted flood,” said Gov. Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, where a number of cities have been scrambling to prepare.Mr. Daugaard said the warning had given state and local leaders more time to build earth and sandbag barriers, like those put up around Pierre, Fort Pierre and Dakota Dunes. He called for voluntary evacuations of affected areas in all three towns.“They don’t call it the Mighty Missouri for nothing,” he added.There are six major dams along the upper stretch of the river that allow federal officials to slow down the sometimes violent rush of water that accompanies the melting snowpack in the region.This year, though, torrential rains unexpectedly filled the reservoir to levels that had been reserved for a record-breaking snowpack, forcing the dams to begin releasing water to make room for the coming melt.“We still have snow, lots of it and it’s just now starting to melt,” said Kevin Low, a river forecaster with the National Weather Service. Mr. Low said the entire river was likely to remain “above to well above flood stage” for weeks.Each of the dams has begun releasing more water than at any time since the system was built more than a half century ago, and is scheduled to continue increasing the discharge in the coming days to the maximum level.That influx of water, which represents as much as a fivefold increase over the normal flow into the river, is scheduled to remain at the maximum level for at least six more weeks. More rain or a fast melt would aggravate the risk.“Even though we have these historic releases, the dams are continuing to provide some flood-risk reduction,” Ms. Farhat said.The threat from the river provoked a mix of reactions in the states that it passes through. Al Berndt, the assistant director of the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, said his many concerns included charts that showed that 10 of 14 levee systems could be topped, as well as the possible impact on two nuclear power plants along the river, both of which are taking protective measures.Mayor Jim Suttle of Omaha, however, was confident that a local levee system that reaches well above the highest predicted levels would keep the city dry, particularly given the advance notice that has allowed workers time to fortify the wastewater treatment plant.“It let us plan,” Mr. Suttle said. “Plan the work and work the plan. That’s why I can say, in all candor, we’re going to proceed with business as usual.”Even as the Missouri continued to rise, the experience along the Mississippi River offered reason for both fear and hope. In southern Louisiana, evacuation orders were lifted and residents were returning; some found their homes destroyed, others undisturbed. The flooding threat is not over — and waters have been slow to recede in parts of the Delta — but it has been far less damaging than initially feared.'"

"'11-06-03,'0','The judge’s letter was received, to no apparent effect. The decision to go for the death penalty had been made by the Justice Department when George W. Bush was president, and ratified by the Obama administration.The murder trial concerned the shooting, on the orders of Mr. Basciano, of another gangster who had run up many infractions of some code of good mobster behavior. In due course, after other mobsters testified against him, Mr. Basciano was found guilty. This week, the jury voted unanimously that he should serve life without parole.It took them just two and a half hours to decide that he should not be executed. The jurors filled out an eight-page verdict sheet, and it is worth the attention of people in Washington who make decisions whether to seek the death penalty. The jurors’ decision was rooted in a sense of fairness: all 12 jurors, in deciding against capital punishment, noted that at least three other people had been directly involved in the same murder ordered by Mr. Basciano, and none of them faced execution. The victim was a violent criminal, a circumstance that contributed to his death. And Mr. Basciano would be in a federal “super-max” prison, confined to a cell for 23 hours a day.“The jurors were able to see this in two and a half hours,” said Richard Jasper, one of Mr. Basciano’s lawyers. “Some of the informants had murdered a whole football team of people. Why was Basciano death-penalty-worthy and these other characters weren’t? Because he didn’t cooperate?”On the verdict sheet, 10 of the jurors signed onto a handwritten note: “There are other members of organized crime that have admitted to an equal or greater number of serious crimes that are not facing the death penalty, much less incarcerated.”Any trial costs money. Because capital punishment is the ultimate penalty, the law requires far more precautions than it does for a garden-variety murder case. So instead of one chief defense lawyer, the court appointed two lead lawyers who specialize in death-penalty cases to represent Mr. Basciano; both were paid $187 an hour. A third lawyer also was named to the defense team, and for a part of the case, a fourth lawyer wrote legal briefs.The final bills for the defense have not been submitted, but as of April, they had reached $4.3 million. The trial transcript ran to more than 9,000 pages, and it was provided to lawyers every day.The jury of 18 people, six of them alternates, sat through a trial that ran more than five weeks. They were taken out of their daily lives; in at least some cases, the businesses continued to pay their salaries.How much did the case cost the government? It is safe to say that the four prosecutors on the case put in just as much time as the defense. They may not have been paid $187 an hour, but then again, their services are part of the overhead borne by the taxpayer.“We don’t prosecute cases based on what it costs,” said Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn. “We just don’t put a price tag on it.”'"
"'11-06-03,'0','The defendant, Stephen Lopresti, 60, would have been disbarred had he been convicted, because of previous convictions for driving while intoxicated. He was arrested in December 2006 after colliding with another car on the Grand Concourse. He told the police that he had drunk four or five beers at a tavern near Yankee Stadium.Among other things, Ms. Torres said that the jurors did not feel the Breathalyzer sample was sufficiently reliable and that neither a videotape of the defendant being tested nor the quantity of alcohol consumed persuaded them that he was drunk. “I drink a six pack, and I’m still walking straight,” she said.Both the arresting officer, Julissa Goris, and the officer who administered a Breathalyzer test, Harrington Marshall, had been caught on wiretaps discussing getting tickets fixed and testified during the trial that they had done so. The defense portrayed them as corrupt and untrustworthy.“The message is clear,” said Adam D. Perlmutter, one of the defense lawyers. “Corruption won’t be tolerated in the Bronx or anywhere.”Ms. Torres said she and the other jurors felt that the two officers were “crooked” because they fixed tickets and suspected that they had had far more tickets fixed than the few they admitted to on the stand.Mr. Lopresti’s lawyers spent a good deal of their cross-examination of the officers last week trying to undermine their credibility because of inconsistencies in what they had said and done and because they had gotten tickets fixed for relatives and friends. Both of the officers minimized the significance of fixing tickets and repeatedly referred to the practice as a “professional courtesy” that officers extended.The officers said they had been promised by the district attorney’s office that they would not be prosecuted for their role in the ticket-fixing scandal.Officer Goris testified that she had asked her union delegate for help to get a ticket that had been issued to her boyfriend’s cousin erased. On another occasion, when her mother received a ticket, Officer Goris said, she went with her to court and spoke to a sergeant there, and her mother did not have to pay any fine.Officer Marshall testified that he had solicited the help of a police union official to make two tickets of family members go away. He also said that officer asked him to help fix a ticket.Because it has been so widespread, ticket-fixing is expected to infiltrate numerous unrelated cases in coming months. In another Bronx trial last month, Lance Williams was acquitted of attempted murder and weapons charges. One of the arresting officers admitted to fixing tickets, though conflicting statements were also at play and jurors did not single out ticket-fixing as the principal factor in their verdict.A grand jury has been hearing evidence in a broad investigation into the age-old practice of ticket-fixing. The authorities anticipate that the inquiry could lead to criminal charges against perhaps two dozen officers and disciplinary action against hundreds.'"
"'11-06-03,'0','“Considering the current circumstances, it is extremely frustrating not seeing E.P.A. take more direct action,” said Matt Rota, director of science and water policy for the Gulf Restoration Network, an environmental advocacy group in New Orleans that has renewed its calls for federally enforced targets. “We have tried solely voluntary mechanisms to reduce this pollution for a decade and have only seen the dead zone get bigger.”Environmental Protection Agency officials said they had no immediate plans to force the issue, but farmers in the Mississippi Basin are worried. That is because only six months ago, the agency stepped in at the Chesapeake Bay, another watershed with similar runoff issues, and set total maximum daily loads for those same pollutants in nearby waterways. If the states do not reduce enough pollution over time, the agency could penalize them in a variety of ways, including increasing federal oversight of state programs or denying new wastewater permitting rights, which could hamper development. The agency says it is too soon to evaluate their progress in reducing pollution.Don Parish, senior director of regulatory relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation, a trade group, says behind that policy is the faulty assumption that farmers fertilize too much or too casually. Since 1980, he said, farmers have increased corn yields by 80 percent while at the same time reducing their nitrate use by 4 percent through precision farming.“We are on the razor’s edge,” Mr. Parish said. “When you get to the point where you are taking more from the soil than you are putting in, then you have to worry about productivity.”Dead zones are areas of the ocean where low oxygen levels can stress or kill bottom-dwelling organisms that cannot escape and cause fish to leave the area. Excess nutrients transported to the gulf each year during spring floods promote algal growth. As the algae die and decompose, oxygen is consumed, creating the dead zone. The largest dead zone was measured in 2002 at about 8,500 square miles, roughly the size of New Jersey. Shrimp fishermen complain of being hurt the most by the dead zones as shrimp are less able to relocate — but the precise impacts on species are still being studied.The United States Geological Survey has found that nine states along the Mississippi contribute 75 percent of the nitrogen and phosphorus. The survey found that corn and soybean crops were the largest contributors to the nitrogen in the runoff, and manure was a large contributor to the amount of phosphorus.There are many other factors, of course, that determine what elements make it from crops into river water, for example, whether watersheds are protected by wetlands or buffer strips of land.John Downing, a biogeochemist and limnologist at Iowa State University, said structural issues were also to blame. Many farms in Iowa, he said, are built on former wetlands and have drains right under the crop roots that whisk water away before soils can absorb and hold on to at least some of the fertilizer.Still, overapplication of fertilizers remains a key contributor, he said. “For farmers, the consequences of applying too little is much riskier than putting too much on.”Hemmed in by the antiregulatory mood of Congress and high food costs, the Obama administration has looked to combat Mississippi River pollution through an incentive program introduced in 2009 by the Department of Agriculture that encourages a variety of grass-roots solutions, from wetlands creation to educating farmers on just-in-time application.The Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative provides $320 million in grant money, which has so far been spread among 700 projects in 12 states, projects proposed by farmers, environmental groups and local governments. So far, the department says the results are quite promising. Phosphorus and nitrogen found in surface runoff from 150,000 acres enrolled in the program have decreased by nearly 50 percent.That amount of land is just a drop in the bucket for the vast Mississippi watershed, but Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack thought it was promising enough to invite the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa P. Jackson, to visit one of the farms in the program.“There is fear, real fear, in Iowa that we’ll take what we’re doing in Chesapeake Bay and transfer it here without regard to what’s already happening on the ground,” she said during her trip in April, adding she appreciated the opportunity “to ensure that isn’t our approach.”Mr. Vilsack said that farmers had come a long way toward understanding their effect on ecosystems downstream and that what they needed were government incentives and creation of private markets — where, for example, farmers who do a lot of conservation could receive payments from farmers who do not — to help them improve environmental safeguards while they also keep food production high.“A lot of folks are basing criticism and concerns on the way agriculture was, not the way it is now,” Mr. Vilsack said in a phone interview.  “We as a nation have an expansive appetite for inexpensive food. To produce more, you have to turn to strategies like chemicals and pesticides.”That stance infuriates Dave Murphy, founder of Food Democracy Now!, an Iowa nonprofit that advocates for smaller organic farms. He argues that voluntary programs are a subterfuge.“As is standard in Iowa and other states, voluntary regulation by the polluters and the industry themselves is the preferred method of getting around any serious environmental enforcement,” he said.Even some farmers do not disagree. Chris Petersen, president of the Iowa Farmers Union, which represents small farmers, said the country’s policy were not working. “We’ve been trying to do this for years, and we are just not turning the corner.”'"
"'11-06-03,'0','Such a requirement was considered by Congress in 2002 when it passed the Sarbanes-Oxley bill that established the accounting oversight board, but was not included in the final version. But the law did require that audit partners be rotated off engagements every seven years.Mr. Doty said he had not decided yet whether it was necessary to require changing auditors. But he made clear that he thought changes had to be made to “more systematically insulate auditors from the forces that pull them away from the necessary mind-set.”Mr. Doty took the post in February, after being appointed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. A securities lawyer who served as general counsel of the S.E.C. from 1990 to 1992, Mr. Doty has said he was outraged by some audits the board had inspected, and would consider changes in a number of areas.On Thursday, he cited one auditor who allowed a company to count a sale in the third quarter, even though the contract was signed in the fourth quarter — a move that allowed the company to meet its earnings target. He mentioned another auditor who helped a company conceal an error by suggesting changes in the company’s accounting policies. In each case, the firm had held the account for decades.Another step the board will consider, he said, is to require that the engagement partner sign the audit. Currently audits are signed by the firm without any indication which partner took the lead. Advocates of such a change say partners might be more hesitant to sign off on dubious accounting if they knew their name would be publicly attached to the audit if problems were later discovered.In addition, Mr. Doty said the board would consider forcing audit firms to disclose the amount of work done on audits by other firms, including foreign affiliates that are not inspected by the board.The board has also announced that it will propose possible changes in the information auditors provide to investors. Currently, auditors either approve statements or they don’t, but do not offer any opinions on the relative quality of accounting choices.Financial statements often include many estimates, and auditors now simply conclude whether an estimate is or is not reasonable. That has been a problem in valuing some securities that rarely trade, with the same audit firm approving widely varying estimates by different clients. One possibility may be for disclosures to be made on the range that the auditor deemed reasonable, and where the estimate fell within that range.'"
"'11-06-03,'0','PARIS — As many as 270 migrants fleeing Libya for Europe may have drowned after their vessel capsized off the coast of Tunisia, the authorities said Thursday.Rescuers from the Tunisian Coast Guard and Navy were able to save 578 men, women and children from the 100-foot fishing vessel, which was crowded with as many as 850 passengers when it ran aground Tuesday about 30 miles from the Kerkennah Islands, said Col. Lotfi Baili of the coast guard, who helped coordinate the operation.Hundreds of passengers fell from the vessel when it listed, he said, and others fell into the water during the scramble to reach the military rescue boats. The Tunisians were overwhelmed by the number of migrants who needed to be rescued, he said, and could use only small vessels because the water was so shallow.The fishing vessel, the Wave, set off from Tripoli, Libya, around noon last Friday, Colonel Baili said, and was carrying migrants from the African nations of Mali, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Morocco as well as from Pakistan and Bangladesh.The survivors were taken to the coastal Tunisian city of Sfax. About 200 have been transferred to a refugee camp at Ras Ajdir, near the Libyan border, and the remaining survivors were expected to be sent there soon, said Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency in Tunisia.The authorities will return to the ship, which is still marooned off the coast, when the weather improves, Colonel Baili said.'"

"'11-06-04,'0','The Pentagon, which has long been concerned about efforts by China and Russia to obtain military secrets, announced separately that it would soon view serious computer attacks from foreign nations as acts of war that could result in a military response.RSA officials noted that Lockheed said it planned to continue using the SecurID tokens, and they said they believed other customers would as well. But security experts said RSA’s reputation had most likely been seriously damaged, and many of its 25,000 customers, including Fortune 500 companies and government agencies around the world, could face difficult decisions about what to do next.RSA’s prospects for holding on to some of those customers “certainly seems bleak,” said Harry Sverdlove, the chief technology officer at Bit9, a firm that provides other types of security products and does not compete with RSA.He and other experts said RSA might need to reprogram many of its security tokens or create an upgraded version to rebuild confidence in its systems.In response to questions on Friday, Lockheed said in an e-mail that its computer experts had concluded that the breach at RSA in March was “a direct contributing factor” in the attack on its network. Government and industry officials said the hackers had used some of the RSA data and other techniques to piece together the coded password of a Lockheed contractor who had access to Lockheed’s system.Lockheed, which makes fighter planes, spy satellites and other confidential equipment, said it had detected the attack quickly and blocked it before any important data was compromised.Lockheed said it was replacing 45,000 SecurID tokens held by workers who need to log into its system from customer offices, hotels or their homes. It also required its employees to change their passwords, and it added a step to its sign-on process.One top RSA official, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity on Friday because of customer relationships, acknowledged that some customers would lose confidence in the devices. “It’s certainly going to have an initial impact,” he said.He said the company would discuss reprogramming tokens with companies. But, he said, in some cases that may require more work than other measures they could take to beef up different parts of their security systems.RSA, based in Bedford, Mass., has declined to specify what data was stolen in March. It has also said that it detected the attack as the hackers were removing the data and that the attack was only partly successful.But independent security experts have speculated that the hackers obtained at least part of the databases holding serial numbers and other critical data for the tens of millions of tokens, and Lockheed’s confirmation that the stolen data played a role in its attack supported that theory.The RSA tokens provide security beyond a user name or password by requiring users to enter a unique number generated by the token each time they connect to their networks.But to make use of the data stolen from RSA, security experts said, the hackers would also have needed the passwords of one or more users on Lockheed’s network. RSA has said that in its own breach, the hackers accomplished this by sending “phishing” e-mails to small groups of employees, including one worker who opened an attached spreadsheet that contained a previously unknown bug.This let the hacker monitor the worker’s passwords. Security specialists suspect that something similar happened in the Lockheed attack, with the hackers using the data stolen from RSA to predict the security codes that the token would generate.Mr. Sverdlove said that in mounting attacks, many hackers now studied Facebook and other social media for information to personalize their phishing e-mails and increase the odds they will be opened. He said that over the last two years, there had been “an exponential increase” in these attacks.Security experts said that the alternatives to the tokens, including computerized smart cards and biometric tools, tended to be more expensive. They said Northrop, another giant military contractor, was shifting from SecurID tokens to smart cards.'"

The A.C.L.U., joined in the suit by Project Vote, says the law should not take effect anywhere until the Justice Department reviews it to ensure that it does not discriminate against members of minorities in five Florida counties that qualify for protection under the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act. The state law, signed by Gov.

"'11-06-04,'0','In the third year of his presidency, Mr. Obama can claim credit for helping to bring the country back from the brink of financial collapse and out of the deepest recession since the Great Depression, but not for a full economic recovery.The jobs report is just one of several recent indicators of continued weakness that underscore how improbable it is that the economic picture will be much better — if it gets better at all — before voters make up their minds next year. And this summer Mr. Obama faces a big test of whether he can reach agreement with Congressional Republicans to significantly reduce a mounting federal debt — a challenge with implications for the economy, as another Wall Street rating firm warned this week, as well as for Mr. Obama’s re-election prospects.“Now, I don’t want to pretend like everything is solved,” Mr. Obama told about 350 Chrysler workers, as he shifted from praising the success of the bailout. “We’ve still got a long way to go not just in this industry, but in our economy.” He compared the economy to a person who had been hit by a truck — “It’s taking a while to mend.”Mr. Obama acknowledged that as happy as the workers were to have their jobs assembling the Jeep Wrangler, “there’s nobody here who doesn’t know someone who is looking for work and hasn’t found something yet.” (“Right!” a man yelled.)“Headwinds” keep buffeting the recovery, Mr. Obama said — lately in the form of high gas prices, economic disruptions from Japan’s post-earthquake devastation and instability in the Middle East. And he warned of more ups and downs ahead.“There are always going to be bumps on the road to recovery,” Mr. Obama said. “We’re going to pass through some rough terrain that even a Wrangler would have a hard time with.” (“No!” another loyal worker shouted.)More than perhaps any of Mr. Obama’s presidential trips to date, this one had the feel of a campaign swing.The president’s factory visit was sandwiched between his stops at Rudy’s Hot Dog, a landmark diner, and at Fred’s Pro Hardware Store near the Chrysler plant, which Mr. Obama visited to illustrate that the bailout had helped not just auto companies but also parts suppliers and the small businesses in the communities around the manufacturing plants.Just like a candidate, he stood coatless and in rolled shirtsleeves at a plant gate during shift change, greeting the departing employees one by one. And more than usual, he went out of his way to greet people, lingering at the airport’s fence when he arrived and crossing the street from the hardware store to glad-hand the gathered locals, one of whom held aloft a hastily scribbled sign that said “Keep Working 4 the Working Class.”Taking credit for the controversial decision to rescue the auto companies has become a staple of Mr. Obama’s stump speeches and is likely to remain so through his re-election campaign, especially given the importance of the industry to the swing states of Ohio and Michigan, as well as to Wisconsin and Indiana; Missouri, another major auto-manufacturing state, increasingly leans Republican and Mr. Obama narrowly lost it in 2008.“In a weak economy it’s all the more important for Obama to have examples like the auto industry where he can point to his willingness to do what he thought was right for jobs even when it was politically controversial to do it,” said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster.But David Winston, a Republican strategist and an adviser to the House speaker, John A. Boehner, a Republican who represents an Ohio district far south of Toledo, said taking credit for segments of the economy would not help if the overall economy remains weak. “It’s the macro-situation that matters in terms of how people are going to ultimately view his success or lack thereof with the economy,” Mr. Winston said. To the extent Mr. Obama boasts selectively, “that tends to reinforce the idea, ‘Maybe he’s disconnected.’ ”Obama advisers, however, see the auto rescue as a valuable talking point beyond the affected states.“The auto companies tell a story about the president’s economic leadership, the tough decision he made and how that’s reaped great results for people all across this country,” said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. “If the overwhelming number of Republicans had had their way two years ago, G.M. and Chrysler would be gone and so would a million jobs in communities all across this country.”'"
"'11-06-04,'0','TOLEDO, Ohio — Chrysler’s chief executive said Friday that a public stock offering remained the preferred method for a health care trust to sell its ownership stake in the Detroit automaker.Chrysler’s Italian partner Fiat has the option to buy the trust’s shares, which account for a 45.7 percent stake in the company, and forgo a public offering. But while the executive, Sergio Marchionne, acknowledged the possibility of a direct purchase, he said a stock offering appeared to be the most prudent exit strategy for the retirees.“I still look at the I.P.O. as the easiest way to monetize it,” Mr. Marchionne said of the stake owned by the United Automobile Workers’ voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA.Speaking after President Obama’s visit to Chrysler’s Jeep assembly plant in this northern Ohio city, Mr. Marchionne also said that a Chrysler stock offering would probably not be done until 2012.“I think we need an additional track record of performance,” he said.The president’s visit came a day after Fiat agreed to pay $500 million to the Treasury Department to acquire the 6 percent ownership stake that American taxpayers have held in Chrysler since it emerged from bankruptcy two years ago.In addition, Fiat paid $75 million to the United States and Canadian governments for the right to buy the big ownership stake held by VEBA.'"
"'11-06-04,'0','WASHINGTON — The computer phishing attack that Google says originated in China was directed, somewhat indiscriminately, at an unknown number of White House staff officials, setting off the Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry that began this week, according to several administration officials.It is unclear how many White House staff members — or those of other departments in the executive branch — might have been affected, according to two officials with knowledge of the investigation. But the intended victims ranged across various functions in the White House, and were not limited to those working on national security, economic policy or trade areas that would be of particular interest to the Chinese government.Administration officials said they had no evidence any confidential information was breached, or even that many people fell for the attack by providing information that would allow a breach of their Gmail accounts.White House classified systems run on dedicated lines and information on those systems, the officials said, cannot be forwarded to Gmail accounts. But investigators were trying to determine if the attackers believed that some staff members or other officials used their personal e-mail accounts for confidential government communications.“Right now,” said one senior official, “that’s a theory, not a fact.”Google disclosed the attack this week and said that it was directed at not only American government officials, but also human right activists, journalists and South Korea’s government. Google tracked the attack to Jinan, China, which is the home to a Chinese military regional command center.'"
"'11-06-04,'0','“Basically, we drilled holes,” Mr. Tarhouni said, explaining how they opened the safe.AMONG opposition leaders, Mr. Tarhouni occupies a unique place. As an economics professor with a populist streak, he bridges a divide between the technocrats who have returned from exile or remain abroad, and home-grown academics and former Qaddafi government officials. He is blunt when describing the rebels’ desperate straits, using expletives to talk about donors lagging in their payments. At the same time, Mr. Tarhouni, who abruptly took a leave from his job teaching economics at the University of Washington to join the revolution, can appear a practiced politician. On a recent tour of the Benghazi courthouse, the emotional heart of the Libyan revolt, he was busy shaking hands and posing for pictures with children.But his primary focus is on finding money, and that has not been easy, not since the rebels robbed the bank. An effort to secure loans from the United States backed by frozen Libyan assets has foundered. “I had two meetings with the Treasury. At the end of the day, they were not productive from my way of looking at things,” he said.And Mr. Tarhouni, the son of a Benghazi merchant, has also been unable to tap Libya’s oil wealth. After attacks on oil installations by Colonel Qaddafi’s soldiers in April, oil production was either stopped or slowed, a distinction the rebels have refused to clarify. Mr. Tarhouni said that full production would not resume until the facilities were secure, but also that the rebels had ruled out hiring mercenaries to guard them.Talking about that decision, Mr. Tarhouni sounded a note of caution rarely heard from his movement, which at times has seemed willing to make almost any deal necessary to remove Colonel Qaddafi, and is almost entirely reliant on foreign powers to keep it in the fight.“I’m not about to start the Iraqi thing,” said Mr. Tarhouni, whose office has been besieged by visits from private security companies. He was also cautious in reacting to an apparent offer of amnesty for Qaddafi officials made over the weekend by Mustapha Abdul Jalil, the chairman of the rebel Transitional National Council — another attempt to quickly end the conflict. The language of the offer was confusing, but Mr. Abdul Jalil seemed to suggest that officials who defected now — regardless of what they had done — would be forgiven by the rebels.Mr. Tarhouni said the issue was more complicated. Some people deserved amnesty, but others, especially with “blood on their hands,” should be held accountable, he said.Mr. Tarhouni’s political activism started when he was in college, first in Benghazi as an undergraduate and later during graduate studies at Michigan State University. His classmates in Michigan included Moussa Koussa, who went on to become one of Colonel Qaddafi’s closest allies. As the Qaddafi government started executing student activists in the mid-1970s, Mr. Tarhouni remembered that he and other Libyan students had to twist Mr. Koussa’s arm to sign a letter “that basically said Qaddafi was a murderer.” Mr. Koussa shocked the Qaddafi inner circle when he defected in late March.MR. TARHOUNI met his wife, Mary Li, a lawyer who works for the Washington attorney general, while they were both students in Michigan. Mr. Tarhouni is on unpaid leave from the University of Washington, and his family, including four children, are still in the United States. One of his sons plans to join him here soon, and Mr. Tarhouni said he planned to put him to work.On a recent Sunday, his daily hunt for money started early, about 8:30 a.m., in a 1930s Italian villa where Mr. Tarhouni keeps his office. He and about 10 aides sat with laptops at a long wooden conference table, figuring out who should deal with the tanker, and how to coordinate payments to cities in the west, under attack by Qaddafi soldiers and desperately in need of money and the ship’s fuel.“I have areas that are besieged, people that are dying every day, and I can’t help them out,” he said. “I’m not sure that this simple, straight message is reaching our friends.” Envoys from the United States and France visited his office, and left, with no answer to his problems. About 4 p.m., he disappeared to try to take a nap, but an aide woke him as soon as he removed his shoes. Later, at a news conference, he urged foreign governments to send money, showing emotion but also a talent for brinkmanship.Later, touring a youth center in a former government security building, he asked the young activists about their monthly finances and spoke frankly about his inability to help. “Unfortunately, we’re bankrupt,” he said. Later, in his car on the way back from visiting a local businessman doing charity work, he fretted about the tanker.“I’m watching a clock,” he said. “I need $90 million.”It is hard to tell what role Mr. Tarhouni and the other rebel leaders will play in the future. They have said they would not run in an election that would follow Colonel Qaddafi’s leaving power, but could run in subsequent campaigns. At the same time, their self-appointed roles have given them broad visibility and recognition in a country with few well-known political leaders.In the evening, walking through the streets by the courthouse, Mr. Tarhouni was mobbed by people who knew him from television or remembered his YouTube appearances during the uprising, when he appealed to Colonel Qaddafi’s soldiers not to fire on protesters.As he walked, he remembered the vibrant city he left behind in 1974: the coffee shop where he and his friends talked excitedly about the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul Nasser and the theater where he saw the region’s best performers, like the singers Fairuz and Abdul Halim Hafez.But the city he saw was a neglected shell.The work of the revolution had made such reflection difficult. “The longer it takes,” he said, “the more you have to remind yourself what it’s about.”'"
"'11-06-04,'0','If he knows where he was, he is not telling. More is known about what did not happen to him. His mother said he was given a rigorous exam by his doctor, who administered a wide variety of tests for drugs and disease. All negative, she said.Jennifer, 50, works nights as a nurse’s aide at a nursing home, and Denzel is the baby of her three children. He had received a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and was struggling in school. “His concentration level is very poor,” his mother said. “He doesn’t complain about anything. He’s a jolly child. He’s a bit withdrawn lately, but I don’t see anything that tells me he’s going to run away.”She was at work and her husband was asleep when the boy disappeared from their brick home in the Wakefield neighborhood of the northern Bronx before dawn on May 17. Denzel ran away from home twice before, but just overnight. The family called the police, and detectives took his school picture from a year ago.No calls. The picture appeared on several Web sites. There was one reported sighting of Denzel, but it was false. Jennifer said she called Facebook, a site Denzel had increasingly visited on their home computer, but Facebook would not give her Denzel’s password without a detective’s request. The police said such a request requires a subpoena, but detectives were able to monitor activity on Denzel’s page, and saw none. Days passed after his disappearance on that Tuesday. The week ended. She was terrified that the boy’s gentle demeanor would bring him harm on the streets.The weekend came and went.Where would he go to use a computer? She visited libraries around her neighborhood. “I asked them to put the picture up inside,” Jennifer said, “but not so he could see it,” lest he panic and flee. The Wakefield branch had a better idea: an investigator for the library, Victor Nieves, attached a flag to his account, so that if Denzel used his card, a note with Mr. Nieves’s number would pop up on a librarian’s screen.Thankfully, the plan did not have time to work. On the night of May 25, Denzel materialized, in the form of a dirty, gaunt boy, at his aunt’s front door in the Bronx. “His eyes were red,” Jennifer said. “Of course, he was skinny. He looked scared.”His mother peppered him with questions. What did you eat? Where did you sleep? Did anyone abuse you? He said no, but little else.“He came out of character, is how you would say it,” said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman with the Missing Persons Squad of the police. “I’m trying to be gentle with the wording. He is a 12-year-old boy.”A psychiatrist examined Denzel on Tuesday, eight days after his reappearance. “The psychiatrist said he’s charming, but not talking,” Jennifer said. He was admitted for more tests. His father thinks hospitalization is an overreaction. The boy needs to talk to someone, that’s all.For his mother, this not-knowing is torture. Her boy is back, but this piece of his 12-year-old life is still missing. She tells herself she should have seen this, as if mental distress were a bloody nose or a skinned knee.“I thought I was doing a good job, but something slipped by me,” Jennifer said this week, in tears. “If someone saw him, they can say, ‘I saw him here, begging.’ That would be something.”'"

"'11-06-04,'0','BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- The smirking “Dallas” oil baron J. R. Ewing always knew how to make an entrance. And Larry Hagman, who brought that infamous TV villain to life, apparently still has the touch.Mr. Hagman, 79, trotted down Wilshire Boulevard here on Thursday evening, alighting at Julien’s Auctions, across the street from Saks Fifth Avenue. Yes, he was on horseback. Joining him was Linda Gray, 70, who played his vodka-swilling wife, Sue Ellen, on that 1980s-era drama. The pair got a motorcycle escort by the Beverly Hills Police Department.Odd? A little, perhaps. But Southern California, sophisticated as it may have become, remains show business country — a place where the bizarre is just part of business. Mr. Hagman’s dramatic arrival was part of a preview event for Julien’s Saturday sale of his stash of memorabilia and estate items, many from his days on “Dallas.”Inside the auction house, potential bidders inspected the goods while eating cubed cheese and scooping guacamole from giant martini glasses. The holy grail, at least for hard-core fans, appeared to be the oil painting of the family patriarch, Jock Ewing, that once hung in the Southfork living room. (Estimated price: $2,000 to $3,000.)Mr. Hagman, his eyes twinkling, said the horses were his idea. “They came to me in a dream,” he said.Why is he selling? “There comes a time, even in J. R. Ewing’s life,” he said, “when you have to downsize.” Besides, he added, even with 413 items on the auction block, “I have more left at home than I know what to do with.”As the “Dallas” theme song trumpeted, Charlene Tilton, the actress who played J. R.’s ne’er-do-well niece Lucy, stood nearby and lamented her lack of forethought about collectibility. “I didn’t save a damn thing,” she said.'"
"'11-06-04,'0','Another, smaller hotel in an abandoned glassworks is still on the drawing board.The new hotels reflect a radical change in the self-image of an island whose history has been inextricably linked with glassmaking since 1291, when Venice moved its glass furnaces to this site, which it considered a safe distance away from the main islands.Since that time Murano’s core industry has had its highs and lows, and the economic roller coaster of recent decades has dulled some of the luster of Murano artistic glass.In the boom years of the 1950s and 1960s, boats weighted down with glass products — miniature animal families, glassware and vases, delicate rococo chandeliers constructed of hundreds of pieces — set sail from here to satisfy insatiable foreign markets.Then, the majority of Murano’s inhabitants, who today number about 4,600, were involved in one aspect of glassmaking or another. Local boys would begin working in the furnaces before they turned 10 and spend a lifetime honing their skills.Things are different today. Official industry figures for annual revenue from artistic glass do not exist but can be estimated to hover around €150 million, or $217 million, according to Gianni De Checchi, secretary of the Confartigianato di Venezia, a trade group for artisans.Ten years ago it was €200 million, he said, with profit margins worn away by rising production costs — especially the cost of energy and transportation — as well as labor costs.“There’s been a massacre of companies,” said Gianluca Vecchi, chairman of Andromeda, a chandelier and lighting factory that he said is facing a bumpy patch. “Too many things have happened in too short a time,” and now “there are no more tears to cry.”In many ways, the island has mapped its own decline.Murano’s current situation “is typical of what happened to other industrial districts in Italy in the past 10 years,” said Stefano Micelli, a professor of innovation technology at Ca’Foscari University in Venice and dean of Venice International University.Comfortable after years of prosperity, many Murano companies did not look beyond their fiery furnaces and failed to evolve toward a more industrial and managerial model, he said.“Instead of selling vases to tourists, they should have thought of ways to look to the future,” he said.Now the island is being forced to imagine a future beyond glass. Proximity to Venice had already fueled a fledgling tourism industry, and in a few short years glass shops catering to day-trippers have colonized waterfront palazzo locations, muscling out residents and traditional retail stores.But Murano is notoriously insular, and previously it has dispensed its hospitality in small doses. It has two hotels and a handful of bed and breakfasts that can accommodate a total of 72 guests. There is not much nightlife. Once the factories shut their doors, so does the island.The influx of new accommodations will change that, or so investors believe.“If Murano becomes another base for tourism, as we hope will happen, then the city will live again, it will be revitalized around the clock,” said Francesco Paternostro, managing director of Lagare, the Milan real estate development group behind the hotel in the ex-Conterie.The group chose to invest in Murano, he said, because demand for accommodations remained high in the lagoon and because it was cheaper than developing in Venice. He is certain that Murano’s characteristic charm holds its own allure. “People will start going to Venice for the day,” and not the other way around, he said.The prospect that China and other developing countries will send millions of tourists abroad, flush with new wealth, is also pushing the change. Venice is already so packed, “one can barely walk around the streets anymore,” said Guido Ferro, whose company has been dabbling in the hotel business here after centuries spent in glass furnaces. “Murano has to transform itself — within limits, of course.”Changes are also on the way via a citywide urban development project, the so-called Urban Structure Plan, or PAT in Italian, which is under discussion in City Hall. It is a broad and fairly contentious rezoning plan that will shape Venice in the coming decades.In Murano, administratively a district of Venice, discussion has centered on the “Sacca San Mattia,” a 7-hectare, or 17-acre, plot of abandoned land that is to be reconverted to industrial and artisanal use. Sacca refers to land that has emerged from the lagoon.Murano’s municipal officials envision transporting some glass factories from the center to this northwestern spot. In Sacca San Mattia, modern glassworks could be built according to more technologically advanced and environmentally friendly criteria alongside other “lagoon-friendly industries,” like boat building, said Erminio Viero, the president of the Murano Municipality, who noted that ideas were still mostly at an embryonic stage.In turn, the vacated buildings in the center could be developed for low-cost housing, which is in perennially short supply here. “A lot of young people leave because they can’t afford to live” in Murano, Mr. Viero said.Local council members hope the changes will bring other investments.“The idea is that Murano won’t live just off of glass, but that new sources of employment will be found,” said Massimiliano Smerghetto, Murano’s council member for culture, sport and youth activities. “We have to work on various axes; the island’s culture, which is tied to glass, new economic energies, and urban development.”The citywide plan also calls for the development of new transportation lines, most controversially an underwater subway that would carry travelers arriving by air to Murano and then Venice, making the island a potential pit stop for air passengers, more than nine million of whom arrived in 2010.Opposition to the subway remains lively, though most Murano residents complain about infrequent and slow transportation to the mainland, which has contributed to the island’s geographical insularity.“We need rapid transport,” said Lorenzo Giordani, who began courting tourist stomachs four years ago when he opened Alla Vecchia Pescheria, a stylish eatery just off the Fondamenta Dei Vetrai where the décor is as studied as the menu. Mr. Giordani’s family is in the glass business, “but I wanted to launch something new,” he said. The restaurant is open daily for lunch but demand at night is slow, so it’s open two nights a week in winter, four in summer.While he is looking forward to the traffic the new hotels will bring, Mr. Giordani acknowledged that the island’s sleepy pace had been a significant calling card. “Murano is beautiful because it is what it is,” he said.Even as some islanders begin to plan for the future, many glass manufacturers are still reeling at how quickly their industry spiraled into crisis mode.Many point to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in the United States, as the beginning of the end, when foreign orders began to crumble and tourists began to stay away. Recovery has been hampered by the financial crisis of the past two years.In little less than a decade, about a third of Murano’s glassmakers — many of whom boast lineages dating back centuries — have shut down or have had to cut back drastically. The industry’s work force has dropped from 6,000 employees in 1970 to about 900 today, according to Gianfranco Albertini, president of the Promovetro Consortium, which manages a trademark for original Murano glass.Manufacturers point to a series of difficulties and growing expenses.Labor costs have increased — when labor can be found. Generational renewal is nearly nonexistent and manufacturers note that it has become nearly impossible to find young people willing to spend 12 hours a day working in front of a hot furnace.The factories have also been struggling with the expense of adapting to E.U. health and environment directives.At the same time, the cost of production has also swelled because of increases in energy and transportation prices.And, as some Murano businessmen said privately, it used to be easier for Italian companies to work in the black economy, cheating on taxes and not putting workers on the books. Increased controls have made such evasion much more difficult.Lower-quality products emerging ever faster from China and Eastern Europe have also made a considerable dent in Murano’s global glass market.Real Murano glass is handmade and can require enormous skill to craft.“The Muranese concept of beauty is directly proportional to the difficulty of creating the object,” explained Fabio Fornasier, a young maestro on the island, who has been among the most successful glassmakers to emerge in recent years.But that beauty has its price. You can take home a made-in-China Murano-style glass for less than €10. Giovanni Moretti, who co-founded his company with his late brother in 1958 and is one of the few Murano glassmakers to have a store devoted to the brand in Venice, sells glasses that can range in price from €90 to €250.“Once you know that, for example, it takes 11 workers to make one glass, I think you can agree that the prices are reasonable,” Mr. Moretti said.Other glassmakers are less sanguine.“If I sell a vase for €800 and a Chinese copy costs €30, there’s no competition,” said Gino Seguso, the son of the late Archimede Seguso, one of the island’s best-known glass maestros. “I can understand why you’d buy it. Of course, you’re losing out on all the mastery and knowledge, but let’s face it, not everyone is an expert and can tell.”To plump up local quality and deter sales of fakes, the Artistico Murano trademark was set up in 1994 to guarantee that glass products are made on the island using traditional techniques that were once so jealously guarded that Renaissance artisans were not allowed to leave Murano to set up shop elsewhere. (They faced severe fines and penalties — sometimes death — if they defied the interdiction).About 45 companies adhere to the trademark.But not everyone has jumped on board. Many of Murano’s best-known manufacturers, like Barovier & Toso, Venini, Salviati, Seguso, and Carlo Moretti, have declined to join, because their brands, they say, are enough of a guarantee.Last June, Italian papers reported that the finance police had confiscated 11 million Chinese glass pieces (vases, glasses and jewelry) with a reported wholesale value of €13 million from three companies (two on Murano, one on the coast) that sold the pieces as locally made.Mr. De Checchi, of Confartigianato, believes that tourism will be good for an island that has depended on an industrial monoculture for more than 700 years. “As long as that reality allows Murano to preserve its history,” he said.Despite the shift toward tourism, for some, Murano “is glass and will always be nothing other than glass,” said Renata Ferrara, who designs delicate and elaborate custom jewelry with hand-made beads.And regardless of the island’s future development, glass will still be part of it, said Mr. Ferro, who is also president of the island’s only glassmaking school, which offers courses and workshops mostly to foreigners.“People come to Murano,” he said, “because they want to see the furnaces.”'"
"'11-06-04,'0','Mr. Boehner’s resolution demands that the administration provide, within 14 days, detailed information about the nature, cost and objectives of the American contribution to the NATO operation, as well as an explanation of why the White House did not come to Congress for permission to continue to take part in the mission. The language suggests that the House may consider funding requests for the Libya operation in a harsh light if not satisfied with the response to its requests for information.The issue is unlikely to be taken up by the Senate, which seems to be taking the opposite tack. Last month, Senators , Democrat of , and , Republican of , both military veterans, introduced a resolution to express support for the Libyan mission.The roughly two-hour debate on Friday concerning both resolutions provided some interesting alliances among far-left and hard-right lawmakers, and a bit of a role reversal in the discussion of executive power and the relevance of Libya to America’s vital interests.“It seems the running shoe is on the other foot,” said Representative , Democrat of , noting that Republicans had accused Democrats of “cutting and running” on military operations in the past. Representative James P. Moran, Democrat of , chided Republicans, saying “to tie the president’s hands is inconsistent with the legacy of this body, which is to do what is necessary to protect American interests.”In contrast, Representative , an Republican who voted for both measures, said: “We’re not going to go to war without the people of this country supporting it. The Boehner resolution I’m going to support, but it doesn’t go far enough.”The United States is providing NATO with intelligence, logistical support and armed drones in what is largely a bombing campaign against Libyan government forces. The administration has contended that it is within Mr. Obama’s power to initiate American participation in the hostilities without Congress because the combat is limited to an air offensive.Last month, Mr. Obama sent a letter to Congress emphasizing that the United States had turned control of the operation over to NATO and that it was primarily providing support to allies.“It is the view of this administration that we’ve acted in accordance with the ,” said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman. “We’ve been engaged in that consultation all along — as I mentioned, three separate briefings have been held just this week for members of Congress. We’re committed to that moving forward.” Mr. Earnest characterized the resolutions as “unnecessary and unhelpful.”The War Powers Resolution says that presidents must terminate hostilities after 60 days if they have not been authorized by Congress; that deadline passed on May 20 without an explanation to Congress from the administration of why it thought it was lawful for the operation to continue.The failure to provide an explanation, after Mr. Obama’s failure to obtain Congressional authorization for the engagement at the outset, upset antiwar factions of his own party in Congress as well as conservative Republicans seeking to rein in both executive power and federal spending.The debate on Friday involved questions about the nature of the conflict in Libya, the country’s importance to American security interests and the role of Congress in authorizing military campaigns.“The American people and the members of this House have questions and concerns that have gone unanswered,” Mr. Boehner said on the floor of the House. “The president of the United States is our commander in chief, and I’ve always believed that combat decisions should be left to the commander in chief and the generals on the ground. But the House also has an obligation to heed the concerns of our constituents and to carry out our constitutional responsibilities.”Members of both parties complained of war fatigue in their districts, and the reluctance of constituents to support another front, although some members emphasized the importance of supporting a continuing operation, even if they did not agree with the way it began.“It is not surprising that there is a desire to simply say, ‘Enough,’ ” said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the Republican who is chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She voted for Mr. Boehner’s resolution, but against the one brought by Mr. Kucinich.'"
"'11-06-04,'0','Mr. Juncker also highlighted “with satisfaction” the fact that Greece was willing to set up a new fund to manage privatization.While the announcement on Friday left many details unknown, it clears the path toward a second bailout for Greece, a little more than a year after an international rescue worth 110 billion euros, or $159 billion at current exchange rates.Officials have been considering whether to make additional loans of up to 60 billion euros to give Greece more breathing room while it struggles with a deep economic downturn.But several euro zone countries, including the Netherlands, had made it clear that if the I.M.F did not make available its share of the next installment of original aid, worth 12 billion euros, they would not step in to make up the difference, let alone offer further help.Under its internal rules, the I.M.F is unable to make such a payment if there is a financing gap in the Greek government’s budget plans.A low level of economic growth has widened the hole in the Greek budget, which has in turn prompted a scramble for more cost-cutting measures.The talks that concluded Friday addressed that issue. The Greek government is set to announce a new austerity plan that envisions raising 6.4 billion euros through spending cuts and tax increases this year. That is in addition to the plan to raise 50 billion euros by 2015 through privatizations.The ministry said the additional measures would be discussed by the government “in the coming days” before being voted on in Parliament.European officials view Greece’s privatization program as central to averting a default. They have been so concerned at the slow pace of asset sales that the Netherlands proposed the creation of an outside agency to manage it.Though the announcement did not state that European officials would be involved in the process, there were suggestions that the Greek government would tap outside experts.Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said he was open “to explore possibilities for further and reinforced assistance should there be a need, for instance in taxation and privatization matters.”The announcement came amid mounting public opposition in Greece to its austerity drive and growing rifts within the governing Socialist Party, which has failed in two attempts to secure a broad political consensus for more austerity measures.European Union and International Monetary Fund officials have pushed the government to persuade all political parties to sign on to the measures to ease their adoption.The Socialist government has a comfortable six-seat majority in Parliament, but several Socialist lawmakers have suggested they might vote against the new austerity proposals.A letter sent to Mr. Papandreou on Thursday by 16 Socialist members of Parliament framed the question being posed continually in the Greek media: “A year after signing the memorandum, we are at a crucial juncture again. Why?”Public opposition to the new measures has been clear. Thousands of Greeks, including many young people, filled the main square outside Parliament for a 10th day Friday, calling on the government to revoke the austerity measures and for foreign creditors to “go home.” The protests have been small by Greek standards but are growing in intensity, and there have been sporadic incidents of stone-throwing at politicians.Government officials have said that some of those incidents have been orchestrated by the Communist Party and Syriza, the radical left party, which are both represented in Parliament.On Friday, members of PAME, the Communist-affiliated labor union, stormed the Finance Ministry offices, which are opposite Parliament, and strung up a banner calling for “an organized overthrow” and strike action.The country’s main labor union, GSEE, which represents around two million workers, has called a one-day strike for June 9 and is joining the civil servants’ union, which represents about 800,000 people, for a general strike on June 15.'"
"'11-06-04,'0','The grand jury, which has been investigating the case for two years, indicted Mr. Edwards on six counts — one involving conspiracy, four involving illegal payments and one involving false statements. If he is found guilty, Mr. Edwards, 57, faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines.Mr. Edwards’s wife, Elizabeth, died of in December. The couple had two young children and an older daughter, Cate, a lawyer, who accompanied Mr. Edwards to court. Mr. Edwards was released without having to post bail, but was ordered to turn in his passport and to avoid talking with potential witnesses.The indictment contends that Mr. Edwards and his co-conspirators solicited $725,000 from Rachel Mellon, the 100-year-old heiress to the Mellon banking fortune, and $200,000 from Fred Baron, Mr. Edwards’s campaign finance chairman.The money, the indictment said, was used to cover up his affair with , a campaign videographer with whom he had a child, and to pay for her prenatal medical expenses, travel and accommodations.The fact that Mr. Edwards tried to cover up his affair is not at issue. The Justice Department says that those contributions from two wealthy patrons were campaign donations and therefore subject to federal campaign finance laws that set limits on the amounts that can be donated and received, and require public reporting. Those two donations were well in excess of the limit of $2,300 that an individual can give.The indictment says the money was actually used for campaign purposes: If the public knew that he was having an affair, his campaign would have been over. (It was over anyway in January 2008, before he confessed to the affair in August, after he lost too many primaries to and . But it might have imploded even earlier if the affair had been known.)“Mr. Edwards is alleged to have accepted more than $900,000 in an effort to conceal from the public facts that he believed would harm his candidacy,” Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer said in a statement. “As this indictment shows, we will not permit candidates for high office to abuse their special ability to access the coffers of their political supporters to circumvent our election laws.”The Edwards defense is that the money was used not for political reasons but for personal reasons: he wanted to conceal the affair from his wife.The Edwards legal team, headed by , who defended President during his impeachment proceedings, says the government is trying an untested theory and applying a too-broad definition of campaign contributions.Their decision to fight the charges reflects their view that the government’s case will not hold up in court. It also reflects the feeling by Mr. Edwards that no matter how much he has disgraced himself — by lying to his wife and the country about the affair, which wrecked his marriage and ended his political career — he does not want to be seen as a felon or lose his law license.The defense team has already retained Scott E. Thomas, a former chairman of the , as an expert witness. In a statement, Mr. Thomas said the government was basing its case on a “novel and misguided theory” that had no precedent. He said he would not consider the payments in question to be campaign contributions or expenditures within the meaning of the campaign finance laws.But the Justice Department said that the contribution limit “applies to anything of value provided for the purpose of influencing a federal election,” including contributions, expenditures and “payments for personal expenses of a candidate unless those payments would have been made irrespective of his/her candidacy.”The indictment included the transcript of a note that Mrs. Mellon sent to Andrew Young, a former aide to Mr. Edwards, in May 2007 — about the time that Mr. Edwards and Mr. Young were looking for ways to raise money to conceal the affair.Mrs. Mellon said she had been “sitting alone in a grim mood — furious that the press attacked Senator Edwards on the price of a haircut. But it inspired me — from now on, all haircuts, etc., that are necessary and important for his campaign — please send the bills to me. ... It is a way to help our friend without government restrictions.”The money from his patrons, which was delivered through checks made out to a third party — one was stashed in a box of chocolates — paid for Ms. Hunter to live in various hotels and in gated communities in North Carolina and . She was often in the company of Mr. Young, who claimed paternity of the child to protect Mr. Edwards.While some legal experts questioned the validity of the government’s case, saying it was applying an overly broad definition of campaign contributions, others say it is important that candidates take campaign finance law seriously.“The alleged payments of ‘hush money’ raise the specter of political influence-peddling in the form of ‘gifts’ to candidates in high-stakes campaigns,” said Meredith McGehee, policy director for the Campaign Legal Center. Not to pursue them, she said, would set a dangerous precedent.'"
"'11-06-04,'0','“The way the tax code was written, it made companies go for capital gains over dividends,” said Jason Trennert, managing director at Strategas Research Partners. “It made people make imprudent decisions. Dividends remind executives four times a year that it’s not their company.”Mr. Trennert said that many clients of Strategas, which has headquarters in New York, are reporting increased interest in dividend-paying stocks. That could produce a chicken and egg situation of companies increasing or initiating dividends if investors are asking for them. The advisers and analysts I spoke to who favored dividend-paying stocks as a crucial part of anyone’s portfolio were divided into two camps.The first offered more sentimental reasons. Kenneth Kamen, president of Mercadien Asset Management in Hamilton, N.J., said he had a relative in his 80s who has held a handful of dividend-paying stocks since the 1970s. Until recently, he reinvested the dividends to buy more shares. But with the stocks now worth more than $1 million and with the average dividend yield of 4.5 percent, the relative stopped reinvesting the dividends and now receives $61,000 a year in income.Mr. Kamen said his relative’s rationale back in the 1970s is still sound: if the company paid a dividend, it was probably sound. “He said, ‘We didn’t have access to all this information,’ ” Mr. Kamen said. “Dividend-paying stocks represented an interesting form of research for him. You can’t fake cash.”The second group considers these stocks to be a counterweight to portfolios excessively weighted toward supersafe investments, since the performance of those investments is going to lag over time.Catherine Avery, who runs an investment advisory company under her name in New Canaan, Conn., said she is telling her clients that 54 percent of the returns in stocks since 1928 have come from dividends. Ms. Avery also notes that companies like Johnson & Johnson and Emerson Electric have maintained unbroken streaks of increasing their dividends — 49 years in the case of Johnson & Johnson and 53 years for Emerson.She said she has been making these points to encourage clients who have resisted investing in equities since the recession to buy stocks again. “They missed two big years in the markets,” she said. “Now we’re reaching out to people and telling them this is your dead last chance to get back into the market at attractive valuations.”The reality, though, is most people own dividend-paying stocks even if they don’t think of them in those terms. At the end of 2010, 373 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index paid dividends. That is nearly 75 percent of the companies in the index that most investors track.What follows is a more detailed assessment of the pros and cons of owning dividend-paying stocks.THE UPSIDES All things being equal, dividend-paying stocks have several advantages.Devotees like to point to their stability over the long term. Haverford Trust, which manages $6.5 billion, has all $3.5 billion of its equity allocation in dividend-paying stocks, said Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford, in Radnor, Pa.If a client 30 years ago had put $1,000 each into Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble and reinvested the dividends, the firm calculates that that $3,000 would be worth $223,982 today. But over that same period, $3,000 invested in the S.& P. 500 would now be worth $64,668, and that money in 30-year Treasury bonds would have grown to $89,399, according to S.& P. indexes.These exercises are always eye-opening but selective. Enron, WorldCom and Lehman Brothers also paid dividends to shareholders, who have long since seen the value of their holdings go to zero.Mr. Smith argued that for passive, long-term investors, which many people are, dividend-paying stocks offer more comfort. “If you’re buying a stock for its dividend yield, why should you care about the day-to-day fluctuation of the stock price as long as it’s paying its dividend?” he said. “Do bond investors worry about fluctuation day to day?”While these stocks are going to lag behind any big rally, they are also going to fall more slowly. “During the bear market, in 2008, when the S.& P. was off 37 percent, we were off 25 percent,” Mr. Smith said.These stocks also offer at least some sort of hedge against inflation. A typical high-quality corporate bond is going to pay the same yield today as it will in 10 years. That could be a problem if the rate of inflation increases since that would effectively erode the value of the fixed coupon.With dividend-paying stocks, companies could raise prices and then increase the dividends to keep pace with inflation. “Dividends play a hybrid role that they didn’t in the past,” Mr. Kamen said. “You don’t get that in bonds.”The tradeoff is a stock’s price could swing widely, whereas a high-quality bond would stay the course.DOWNSIDES The two big risks come from how quickly the economy grows — and thus how much cash companies have to pay dividends — and what policy makers do with taxes.When the extension to the Bush tax codes expires in 2012, dividends could again be taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. This is how they were taxed for much for the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s.“It’s a concern of ours,” Ms. Avery said. But, she added, “we believe there is enough cash sitting on corporate balance sheets that they do have the ability to increase those dividends to make the end product more attractive to investors.”There is third, short-term concern. Right now, low interest rates make dividends attractive. As interest rates rise, which they will eventually, dividend-paying stocks become less attractive because their yields are unlikely to keep pace with the yields from high-quality corporate debt.Jeremy Zirin, chief United States equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management, which has headquarters in New York, said one way to measure this is to look at the relationship between average dividend yield and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Right now, the dividend yield is about 2 percent while the 10-year Treasury is paying 3.5 percent.This means these dividends are about 65 percent of the yield of Treasuries. Historically, when that ratio dips below 50 percent, dividend-paying stocks become less attractive. “We have a ways to go,” Mr. Zirin said.But of course, Mr. Kamen’s relative would say that a decrease in the price of a dividend-paying stock is not all bad: it means the reinvestment plan buys more shares. That was exactly what my grandfather did.'"
"'11-06-04,'0','BANGKOK — Ending a three-day visit to Myanmar, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, warned the country’s leaders that “the winds of change” now blowing in the Middle East could spread if governments do not listen to the needs of their people.“Governments that shun evolutionary reforms now will eventually face revolutionary change later,” Mr. McCain told reporters at a news conference in the main city, Yangon, according to wire service reports.He urged the government to free political prisoners and to assure the safety of the pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who said recently that she was planning to travel through the country on her first foray outside Yangon since being released from house arrest last November.“Aung San Suu Kyi’s last attempt to travel freely was marred by violence, and the new government’s ability and willingness to prevent a similar outcome this time will be an important test of their desire for change,” Mr. McCain said.In 2003, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s convoy was attacked in what some of her supporters believe was an assassination attempt organized by the government. She was returned to house arrest after just a year of freedom.Although the military remains in control in Myanmar, Mr. McCain said a civilian government elected in November “represents some change from the past, and one illustration of this change was their willingness to allow me to return to this country after 15 years worth of attempts to do so on my part were rejected.”'"

"'11-06-05,'0','The Heat certainly can use past failures against the Mavericks as fuel for these next three games. On Nov. 27, Miami’s season turned after a 106-95 loss here that caused a players-only meeting. James also appeared to intentionally bump into Coach Erik Spoelstra on the court, setting off a national news media investigation of the team’s DNA.But the Heat’s superstar chemistry suddenly coalesced into a 12-game winning streak, then extended into victories in 21 of 22 games, with the only loss coming again to Dallas in Miami. The Heat also points to Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals as another exhibit in its ability to deal with adversity, when the Chicago Bulls won by 21 points, before Miami won the series in five games.“It’s up for grabs,” Chris Bosh said. “We know we have to bounce back and put everything into Game 3 and win back home-court advantage.“We can’t mess around and say, ‘Oh, there’s tomorrow, there’s Game 4, there’s Game 5.’ There’s only this next game.”If the players tried to boil down this series to raw basketball emotion, Spoelstra cited a handful of botched possessions late in Game 2.Of the 14 times the Heat had the ball after going ahead by 15 points, he said, there were only three possessions he would want to take back. The Heat continued to play down theatrics by Wade and James in front of the Dallas bench, antics the Mavericks said they had used as a flashpoint for their rally.After Wade drilled a 3-pointer to put the Heat ahead by 15, he held his shooting pose as James ran over and threw a few punches into Wade’s chest, as if Wade had just floored the Mavericks.“I’m more concerned about how we had a lack of execution down the stretch,” Spoelstra said. “That’s much more important to our team than any of the other story lines.“We’re viewed in a different way than most other teams. We have enthusiastic guys, excitable players. I would certainly rather have that than a bunch of zombies out there.”Wade has spent his entire career with the Heat, and he said he could not recall ever beating the Mavericks during the regular season.“Other than the playoffs, this franchise hasn’t played well against Dallas, period,” Wade said. “I haven’t won a regular-season game against Dallas in my career. I’ve been able to pull out five so far in my postseason.“This building, we did something great here,” Wade added, alluding to the title-clinching Game 6 in 2006. “We won one game here. It was the biggest game in our franchise history up until this point.”The Heat and the Mavericks tied for the best road records this season. Until Game 2, the Heat had not lost at home in the playoffs, and the Mavericks have lost two postseason games here.“The mistake we’re not going to make is feel like coming home is going to be something that helps get us over the hump,” Dallas Coach Rick Carlisle said.'"
"'11-06-05,'0','It is a very different system from that of Dr. Kevorkian, who seemed to make up his methods as he went along. He did not appear to screen patients to determine whether they were actually close to death, and he seemed to make no efforts to get counseling for those who might have wanted to live longer.He devised “suicide machines” that could deliver drugs or carbon monoxide gas and could be set off by the patients. He carted the equipment to patients in his battered Volkswagen van and left many of the resulting 130 or more bodies at emergency rooms or even in hotel rooms.Death, certainly — but death with dignity, no.“Under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, we would have put him in jail,” Mr. Stutsman said. “We ended up using him as an example of how not to do it.”Since the act was passed, 525 people have ended their lives under its auspices, according to the state’s 2010 annual report. In 2010, 96 prescriptions were written for the barbiturates used, and 65 people ended their lives.Mr. Stutsman went on to be a founding board member of the Death With Dignity National Center, which promotes similar legislative efforts around the country. They face serious opposition by groups that reject physician-assisted suicide for reasons that include religious belief and concern that such laws would open the door to forced euthanasia.Mr. Stutsman said successful campaigns in Oregon and Washington State showed the value of a strategy of compromise and coalition building.“He was advocating from the margins of the political debate,” Mr. Stutsman said of Dr. Kevorkian. “I was working from the middle of the political continuum — it’s very hard to change public policy from the margins of the debate.”The movement won a major victory in 2006 when the United States Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could not prosecute Oregon doctors who participated in the assisted-suicide law.Peg Sandeen, the executive director of the Death With Dignity National Center, said the ruling helped convince states that their own efforts would be respected — and was, she said, a major factor in the 2008 passage of the Washington State bill.The Montana Supreme Court held in 2009 that no state law restricts the right of its citizens to end their lives with the help of physicians, though the court did not go so far as to say that physician-assisted suicide is a right under the State Constitution.Efforts so far in California, Hawaii, Maine and Vermont have not been successful, though a new bill is before the Vermont Legislature. Barbara Coombs Lee, the president of Compassion and Choices, a group that promotes what it refers to as “end-of-life choice” in legislatures and the courts and was a co-plaintiff in the Montana case, said Dr. Kevorkian “was quite scornful of any effort to change the law.”She called his death “the end of an era.”Noting that he was a polarizing figure — “people either thought he was a saint and martyred or the devil incarnate” — she explained, “To us, he was neither, but certainly pivotal to our movement.”Even at the extremes, she said, he “raised everyone’s consciousness about the problem of end-of-life suffering” and spurred others to look for ways for those with terminal illness to end their lives on their own terms.An “ignominious” death at the hands of Dr. Kevorkian “was a dramatic display of just how desperate people were who are seeking a peaceful end of their terminal disease,” she said.The policy-oriented groups worked to distinguish themselves from the Kevorkian spectacle. One Washington briefing in 1999 was titled “Jack Kevorkian and Physician-Assisted Dying: Not One and the Same.”Still, disagreement has its uses, said Scott Blaine Swenson, who was the executive director of the Death With Dignity National Center from 2001 to 2005. “He was the perfect foil” for the centrist movement that was promoting policy change, Mr. Swenson said. “You need somebody to play against,” he said.Dr. Kevorkian — erratic, loud and playing by his own rules — helped the movement establish rules that voters could live with, Mr. Swenson said.“The truth, I think, is that had a Kevorkian not existed, that folks in Oregon and other proponents of assisted dying would have needed to invent him,” he said.'"
"'11-06-05,'0','Pet owners, or “parents” in industry parlance, are being sold on human-style luxuries and medical care. There are stylish rain slickers, organic foods and even antidepressants for today’s pampered cats and dogs. If more evidence of this boom were needed, consider Neuticles, prosthetic testicles for neutered dogs and cats, at about $1,000 a pair, which, their designers say, help “your pet to retain his natural look, self esteem and aids in the trauma associated with altering.”Make no mistake: this is big business, as a visit to the Pet Expo here shows.Over at one booth, Debbie Bohlken, owner of Claudia’s Canine Cuisine, sits behind a table of brightly-decorated cookies and cakes that wouldn’t look out of place in a bakery. All of these treats are for dogs. She sells her products under the slogan: “Treat Her Like the Bitch She Really Is.”“Will you try one?” she asks.Her dog biscuits, it turns out, taste a bit like ginger snaps.Elsewhere, manufacturers are marketing foods with ingredients worthy of a Michelin-starred restaurant: pheasant, freshwater trout, yak’s milk, organic pumpkin — the list goes on.There is much more to this than food. At the Petzlife booth, one of the owners, Steve Tibbetts, explains that his oral spray is made from “human-grade” ingredients that keep a dog’s teeth and gums healthy and fight dog breath. He says it works for cats, too. And apparently, for people: Mr. Tibbetts sprays the stuff into his mouth. Twice.“People are just ga-ga over their pets,” Mr. Tibbetts says. “They’ll spend money on their pets before they spend money on themselves.”The growth in the pet market last year was driven in part by a 7 percent increase in veterinary services. America’s pet population, like its human one, is living longer. Human medical technologies are increasingly being used for pets. Dogs’ and cats’ owners — particularly those without children at home — are taking better care of them, both medically and nutritionally, experts say.“Pet owners aren’t just looking to provide a home for their pets,” says Bob Vetere, president of the American Pet Products Association. “They are investing in their pets’ quality of life. Oftentimes they do this at their own expense, cutting personal expenses, but not those affecting their faithful companions.”Jessica Taylor, managing editor of Petfood Industry, says that when she started at the magazine four years ago, the pet food industry lagged human trends by a year or more. Now, it is just six months behind, or less.She predicts that blueberries and pomegranates, whose antioxidant wonders have been marketed to humans in recent years, will be the next big thing in pet food.THE pet industry has long considered itself recession-resilient, and it proved just that during the recent downturn, despite some bumps along the way. For instance, shelters were swamped with pets that were given up by owners who apparently could no longer afford them. Fewer people bought pets, in part because pets are often acquired after a home purchase, and there were considerably fewer of those.Sales growth of pet products slowed, particularly among “hard goods” like leashes and bowls. But they were still up — which is more than you can say for many industries. Sales growth of natural pet products slowed to a relatively meager 6 percent in 2009, compared with 43 percent in 2007, according to Packaged Facts.Analysts say the pet industry will continue to rebound, driven by demand for veterinary care and health-related products, including premium treats and chow for dogs and cats.“I’m still very bullish on natural and organic,” says David Lummis, senior pet market analyst for Packaged Facts, noting that such products account for about 7 percent of pet food sales. “There is still a lot of growth there.”In addition, he notes that expected demand for luxury pet products is strong enough to lure companies and even celebrities into the business. Among them: Martha Stewart, Ellen DeGeneres, Fisher-Price and General Nutrition Center, which now offers health supplements for pets.Wall Street is bullish, too. Shares of PetSmart, the pet store chain, are hovering near a record high, at $43.46 a share. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, the company said same-store sales had increased 6 percent over the quarter a year earlier.PetSmart’s main competitor, Petco, is privately owned and doesn’t publicly report its earnings. But Jim Myers, Petco’s chief executive, says his company did not have a single negative quarter throughout the recession. Fewer people traded up to more expensive items during the downturn, but he said they didn’t trade down, either, sticking with a “premium and higher-level range of food products.”“Our perspective is that, thankfully, we are in a pretty emotional category,” Mr. Myers says.At a Petco store in West Orange, N.J., natural and organic products occupy more than half the aisles set aside for dog and cat food. A sign hanging from the ceiling reads, “It’s all natural: the very best natural products for your pet.”A representative for Blue Buffalo dog food, Gina Corbosiero, is to pitch an array of products, which she says are “holistic” and contain antioxidant pellets that are “cold pressed.”Blue Buffalo’s dog food costs as much as $4 a pound, but it isn’t the most expensive line on these shelves. Royal Canin makes dog food for specific breeds. Its Shih Tzu line sells for $6.80 a pound.It’s all too much for Mike Pinkard, 46, who was dispatched to buy some food for his daughter’s new pit bull-Labrador retriever puppy, Taz. Asked what he will buy, he says: “I have no idea. It’s changed so much from when I had a dog.”When Mr. Pinkard was a kid, he says, “It was regular dog food. Make sure you give them water and exercise and you are in good shape.” He settles on a bag of Nature’s Recipe, a midprice natural brand.Are our pets healthier for all of this? Tony Buffington, a professor of veterinary nutrition at Ohio State University, says his students have studied the diet history of thousands of animals and have not yet determined that one pet food is better than another.“We have been unable to distinguish an outcome in healthy animals eating a wide variety of foods,” he says. Asked about the variety at megastores like Petco, he says, “I don’t even go in there anymore. I wouldn’t know where to start.”He adds: “If you put them all in a plain brown bag, you’d probably be fine with any one of them.”ABOUT 62 percent of American households have a pet, with dogs accounting for 40 percent of the total. Cats are second, at 34 percent. Dog and cat ownership has continued to grow slightly in recent years, even as the popularity of other types of pets, like birds, fresh-water fish and reptiles, has declined.But the vendors at the Global Pet Expo, held at the Orange County Convention Center here in April, are betting that pet owners will splurge again.One vendor is offering treadmills and treadwheels — essentially oversize hamster wheels — that let dogs exercise indoors, without the indignities of cracked sidewalks or rain.There are “eco-friendly” pieces of furniture, grooming products and wipes, the wipes made from organically grown bamboo. An Israeli firm hawks dog shampoo containing Dead Sea minerals. Another, Pet Pop of Australia, promotes a vitamin-infused “mountain-spring water” for dogs. The price: $3.30 a bottle, about as much as a gallon of milk.“We actually saw that there was a gap in the market for beverages for dogs,” says Bonnie Senior, a manager at the company. Then there is Jenn Mohr, who says she combined her love of dogs and love of candles to create Sniff Pet Candles. Made of “100 percent organic natural ingredients,” the aromatherapy candles have names like “Day in the Hamptons” and “Field of Dreams” and “promote your dog’s optimum health and well-being,” her company says.Ms. Mohr even designed a candle to address the flatulence of Rufus, her Rhodesian ridgeback. Made with floral ylang-ylang, white tea, myrtle and fennel, the “Fart & Away” candle “won’t completely stop them,” Ms. Mohr says. “But it will help.” The price: $28.Aromatherapy candles aside, pet food, rather than pet extras, dominates the expo. Many vendors were pushing the idea of human grade pet food. Nummy Tum Tum, which sells canned organic pumpkin and sweet potato for pets, acknowledges that the line between pet and owner has been blurred. Last fall, amid a pumpkin shortage, people called to ask if it was O.K. to use Nummy Tum Tum to make pumpkin pies.Answer: Sure. Daniel Stockton, national sales manager, says the company that makes Nummy Tum Tum makes canned pumpkin for pies, too. It simply switches the label. Both are simply pureed vegetables.“What you can do is make some pies out of it, and leave the cans on the counter after everyone has eaten to freak people out,” Mr. Stockton says.Canine Caviar Foods says it makes “the only alkaline-based dog food in America that was specifically designed to prevent cancer.” The ingredients include canned beaver, duck and venison tripe for dogs and cats, as well as a variety of “free-range, grass fed buffalo” treats for dogs.The Honest Kitchen is offering dog food with names like “Zeal” and “Verve” and lists the provenance of the ingredients. There is organic, fair-trade quinoa from Bolivia and “wild, line-caught Icelandic haddock.” Its food is “gently dehydrated” to preserve it.Hill’s Science Diet promotes prepackaged meals to help slim down tubby dogs and cats. American pets, it turns out, have weight problems just like many of their owners.“We show you how to feed your animal to lose weight,” says Mike Gooch, a sales manager for Hill’s Science Diet. “It’s really kind of a paradigm shift in how you control the weight of the animal.”Of course, it would be easier — and substantially cheaper — to feed pets less or take them for longer walks. But Mr. Gooch said that simply isn’t happening for pets or owners.“I would like to see us eat less McDonald’s and Hardees,” Mr. Gooch quips.Bravo Raw Diet is peddling raw food for pets, which, along with refrigerated pet food, is among the hottest trends in the business. Bette Schubert, a co-founder, says dogs that eat raw meat diets — much like their wild ancestors — are healthier than those that eat processed kibbles.Over at the Del Monte booth, Don Terry and Daniel Caulfield take all of this in with an air of bemusement. Del Monte makes old-line dog food like Kibbles ’n Bits, Gravy Train, Milk Bone and Snausages.Neither seems too worried about all these organic and holistic upstarts. “Do you know how many Milk Bones we sell compared to these companies doing $2 million a year?” Mr. Terry asks. “Dogs have lived a long time on Kibbles ’n Bits and Gravy Train.”Mr. Terry, however, isn’t about to pop a Snausage into his mouth.THE idea of eating your dog food to prove its wholesomeness didn’t originate at the Global Pet Expo. Paul Newman sampled his organic dog food on “The Tonight Show” in 2006. The audience howled.These days, pet food makers are eating their own products to make a point and close a sale, wisecracks aside. Ms. Bohlken, of Claudia’s Canine Cuisine, says she ate all sorts of dog treats while tweaking recipes for her products, which now include cookies and microwaveable cakes for dogs. Even now, she says, she will suck on a Puppy Pop when she has a sore throat.Up in Brooklyn, Hanna Mandelbaum and Alison Wiener spent March dining on their dog food, Evermore, a brown mush made from beef hearts and chicken livers, among other things.“My business partner really enjoys the taste,” Ms. Mandelbaum says. “For me, it was a little bit more an acquired taste.”The gimmick generated a huge spike in sales but came at a price: relentless ribbing from friends. Says Ms. Mandelbaum: “They want to know if we have a sudden urge to sniff each other’s butt.”'"

"'11-06-05,'0','They have also had problems hitting early in the draft recently.The past nine first-round picks for Milwaukee since Braun are either gone by trade, deep in the minors or never signed. Six of the top seven prospects as recently as 2009 are no longer with the team.Jeremy Jeffress (2006) was part of the Greinke deal along with the supplemental first-rounder Jake Odorizzi (2008). Matt LaPorta (2007) went to the Indians for Sabathia. Brett Lawrie (2008) was traded for Marcum.The right-hander Eric Arnett (2009) went 1-9 with a 6.70 earned run average in 20 appearances in Class A Wisconsin last year and has not pitched in the minors yet this season. Milwaukee’s 2010 top pick, Dylan Covey, decided to attend the University of San Diego after finding out he had diabetes. With the system thinned, Melvin said the amateur draft that begins Monday is critical for the Brewers. Milwaukee will pick 12th and 15th in the first round, followed by the 70th and 100th picks.“We feel confident in the extra pick we’ll get this year, it might be just as good as what Dylan would’ve been or even more advanced,” said Melvin, who met with the scouting staff extensively over the past two weeks to prepare. “I think the thing we can do better at, we can do better going deeper in drafts.”With Fielder eligible for free agency after the season, the organization must find a way to bridge the gap again while drafting and developing players such as Lucroy, who reached the majors in two and a half seasons while never being considered a top 100 prospect.Melvin said this year’s draft class was loaded with strong college pitchers.Two players that could be around when the Brewers pick are the right-handers Sonny Gray of Vanderbilt and Matt Barnes of Connecticut. They could go for a high school pitcher like the right-hander Taylor Guerrieri or one of several polished outfielders like Mikie Mahtook of Louisiana State or George Springer of Connecticut.“We’re getting into the stages where you can’t say much as far as the strategy goes,” Melvin said. “The list will probably change right up until the last day.”Then, the biggest issue will be signing the players, something that will certainly be part of Milwaukee’s decision-making process this week.Melvin said they wanted to pick the best player available, but that usually means the organization believes they will be able to sign them quickly after the draft instead of waiting until the Aug. 14 deadline.“The signing day has to be moved up. Development is a huge part of what we do, our success,” Melvin said. “It’s important to get them signed early.”'"
"'11-06-05,'0','The trial involved 4,560 post-menopausal women in the United States, Canada, France and Spain who were considered to be at a higher than normal risk of developing breast cancer either because of being over at least 60 or other factors. After a follow-up of about three years, 11 women getting the drug had developed invasive breast cancer compared with 32 of the women receiving a placebo. That is a reduction in risk of 65 percent.But in absolute terms, 1.4 percent of women in the placebo group developed cancer compared with about one-half of 1 percent of women taking the drug.About 94 women would have to be treated for three years to prevent one case of breast cancer, Dr. Goss said. In the trial, exemestane side effects were acceptable, he said. But women who took exemestane had more hot flashes and arthritis than those who had the placebo.Still, whether exemestane will catch on where the other drugs have not remains to be seen.Some doctors and patient advocates said that aromatase inhibitors had known side effects like bone pain and joint pain that caused many women who already had had cancer to stop taking them. For healthy women, that would be an even harder sell.“People are going to think very, very hard about it before they are going to take an aromatase inhibitor in this setting,” said Dr. Eric Winer, a breast cancer specialist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. He noted the study was not designed to show whether women who took exemestane lived longer.Diana Zuckerman, president of the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund, a patient education group, said that the results were promising but that women in the study were followed for only three years, too short a period to judge long-term effects from taking the drug.Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy medical director of the American Cancer Society, said the drugs would be more accepted if there were a way to better predict who was truly at risk of getting breast cancer.Another factor working against broad use is that aromatase inhibitors are now prescribed by oncologists. But for prevention, “They would have to be prescribed by gynecologists and family doctors,” said Dr. George W. Sledge Jr., a breast cancer specialist at Indiana University. “These doctors are not comfortable with these drugs.”Patent protection on the drug expired in April. Generic versions will mean lower prices.But generic competition also means that Pfizer, which sells Aromasin, has little incentive to seek regulatory approval for the drug for preventing breast cancer. The drug could still be available to women off label, but insurers might be reluctant to pay.Pfizer declined to comment on whether it would seek such approval. Pfizer helped pay for the study, and Dr. Goss has received honorariums from the company.Two other studies presented at the conference show that the widely used cancer drug Avastin is effective in delaying the progression of ovarian cancer. But both studies so far have narrowly missed showing that the drug can prolong lives, the ultimate test of a cancer drug. That threatens to embroil the use of Avastin for ovarian cancer in a debate similar to the one surrounding its use in breast cancer.The drug’s manufacturer, Roche, has filed for approval in Europe to market the drug as a treatment for ovarian cancer. But its American subsidiary, Genentech, is still in discussions with the Food and Drug Administration about whether there is enough evidence for an approval. One question is whether it will be necessary to show that the drug prolongs lives, said Dr. Sandra Horning, who runs cancer clinical trials for Genentech. The F.D.A. is now moving to revoke the approval of Avastin for use in treating breast cancer in part because the drug has not prolonged lives in clinical trials. The F.D.A. will hold a hearing on this issue soon.One study presented here involved 484 women whose ovarian cancer had recurred after an initial drug treatment. All received two standard drugs, and half of them also received Avastin.The median time that women lived before their cancer worsened was 12.4 months for those who got Avastin compared with 8.4 months for those who received only the two other drugs.After two years, more women given Avastin were alive, but the difference was not quite statistically significant. Too few women had died to draw conclusions.“It really is not appropriate statistically to say we really know anything about overall survival here,” said Dr. Carol Aghajanian of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the lead investigator. The trial was sponsored by Genentech.The other trial, partly paid for by Roche, involved adding Avastin to the standard drugs used as initial therapy. There were 178 deaths in the Avastin arm and 200 among those who got the standard drugs, a finding that narrowly missed statistical significance. However, in a subset of patients considered to be at higher risk of recurrence, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival.'"
"'11-06-05,'0','At least that was how it used to work. Last year in Paris, Schiavone became the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam title when she, too, was 29. The combined ages of the finalists Saturday made this the most mature women’s Grand Slam final in 13 years.But that won’t be why it will be remembered. Chinese women have won Grand Slam doubles titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon and at the 2004 Olympics, but singles is where the prestige resides in the contemporary game. Although tennis is not yet a sport for the masses in China and its population of 1.3 billion, a mass audience did see Li’s victory on the state sports channel CCTV-5.According to the WTA, an estimated 65 million Chinese watched at least part of Li’s semifinal victory over Maria Sharapova. Saturday’s final, which ended shortly before 11 p.m. in China, was expected to draw similar numbers.“She was already a national hero; she’s just going to go to rock-star status,” said Stacey Allaster, the head of the WTA. “Look at Yao Ming. She’s going to be there.”That could be a big stretch considering the status of basketball and Yao in China. But Li will always be the first Chinese — and first Asian — to win a major singles title.She was a legitimate underdog Saturday. Clay, until now, was her least favorite surface, and she had never won so much as a tour event on it, while clay has long been the surface on which Schiavone can best express her range of shots and tactics. But Li had a fine game plan: returning deep to Schiavone’s body to deprive her of time to prepare and keeping her off balance by attacking her effectively on the forehand side.Li finished with 31 winners to Schiavone’s 12 and served consistently well, putting 76 percent of her first serves into play and winning nearly 70 percent of the points on both her first and second serves. It was all quite a change from last year, when Schiavone beat Li here in straight sets in the third round.“I think she deserve this final,” said Schiavone, who also struggled to win points at the net.Li played her first genuinely shaky game to lose her serve at 4-3 in the second set, but the match swung back her way for good at 6-5 when the chair umpire Louise Engzell overruled a line call that would have given Schiavone break point. Schiavone argued to no avail, then won no points the rest of the way. After the match, she remained convinced that Engzell had checked the wrong ball mark, but declined to use the call as an excuse.For the moment, there are a shortage of proven champions at the top of the women’s game. Serena Williams has not played in nearly a year because of health problems. Her sister Venus has not played since January because of an injury. Justine Henin, the Belgian star who was the finest clay-court player of this generation, is retired, and Kim Clijsters, who beat Li in the Australian Open and likes clay, was unable to play any preliminary tournaments on clay after being injured in a freakish accident while dancing at a wedding. (She lost here in the second round.)Li has capitalized on the instability, but not without some of her own. After the Australian Open, she won just one match in her next five tournaments, but she turned her season back around when she and her husband, Jiang Shan, a former leading Chinese men’s player, agreed that he should stop coaching her.“It’s always tough,” she said of mixing marriage and coaching, “always fighting on the court.”In Madrid last month, she hired Michael Mortensen, who has sometimes helped coach Caroline Wozniacki, the 20-year-old Dane who is now No. 1 in the world. Mortensen said Wozniacki’s father, Piotr, alerted him to Li’s desire to hire a new adviser.“I’ve always loved her game,” said Mortensen, who is Denmark’s Fed Cup captain and works as a television commentator. “I think she’s a very interesting player compared to a lot of the other players who are almost all from the same mold.”Mortensen said he has helped Li refine her technique, particularly on her serve, where she was opening her shoulders too early. Above all, he pushed the concept of keeping tennis in perspective — seldom Li’s strong suit.“She has a temper, and that’s why I have to calm her down,” said Mortensen, who said the only blowup here occurred in the first round when she asked Jiang to leave the court during her three-set victory over Barbora Zahlavova Strycova.Jiang was in the stands for all of Saturday’s breakthrough performance, and when it was over, Li was in tears in the players’ lounge, overwhelmed by achieving their long-term goal — one that arrived with some help from a newcomer.“I have never been to China, but I know it’s a big day for China,” Mortensen said. “I’m happy for them, and for Li Na.”'"
"'11-06-05,'0','Four of the sanctioned persons are members of the Afghan government’s High Peace Council, set up to pursue reconciliation with the Taliban, and a fifth works for the council’s secretariat, Mr. Barrett said. “Is it logical to have members of the High Peace Council on the list?” he asked. “It seems a bit odd at least.”If even a fourth of the 40 names are delisted, it will be more than have been removed in the past two years of efforts by Afghan officials. Last year, seven Taliban were removed from the list, which at its peak had 142 Taliban members on it, but another three were added. There are more than 500 names in all, but the rest are Qaeda figures.Part of the problem in the past has been providing sufficient documentation to satisfy the United Nations bureaucracy that the candidates for delisting were no longer terrorists. In most cases, proposed candidates did not even reach the Security Council. This year, the documentation is expected to be much better prepared, Mr. Barrett said.“I don’t think anybody’s talking about a blanket delisting,” Mr. Barrett said. “This is all selective, it’s all being done to clean up the list, to make the list a more useful representation of the threat.” Removal from the sanctions list is one of the three conditions cited by Taliban leaders for peace talks, along with the release of their prisoners and withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.“This is one of the basic demands of the Taliban,” said Muallavi Arsala Rahmani, a former Taliban minister of higher education who is one of those on the sanctions list. “I am also on the list, and I am a senator and a member of the High Peace Council,” he said. “As long as you have these sanctions against people, you’ll never reach peace.”One of the others being proposed for delisting is Mullavi Qalamuddin, another High Peace Council member, who during the Taliban regime was in charge of the much-feared religious police. It enforced strict codes against women leaving the home or men shaving their beards.Mr. Qalamuddin has been able to travel regularly, despite the travel ban, he said, and he has no foreign bank accounts to be frozen, so being on the list has no practical effect on him. “Still, it does matter to me,” he said. “I am part of this community of human beings, and I want my name to be removed as soon as possible.”In other news, four NATO soldiers were killed in eastern Afghanistan Saturday by an improvised explosive device, the military said in a statement. The victims’ nationalities were not released, as is standard practice.'"
"'11-06-05,'0','NEW DELHI — Led by a prominent yoga guru, thousands of protesters on Saturday staged a huge anticorruption protest in the heart of India’s capital, gathering beneath a vast outdoor tent for a yoga session, followed by a hunger strike orchestrated as a pressure tactic against the government.The guru, Swami Ramdev, had been demanding that the government take various steps to recover so-called black money, the misappropriated cash stashed in foreign banks by some corrupt Indian politicians and business people. After a long, confusing day of speeches, yoga sessions and back-and-forth negotiations with government ministers, Swami Ramdev announced on Saturday evening that the government had acceded to his demands.But his seeming triumph quickly became muddled. A top government minister was simultaneously telling reporters that, in fact, a deal had been struck a day earlier, before the protest actually began. The minister said that Swami Ramdev’s representatives had promised that they would call off the strike on Monday. When the minister’s comment was relayed back to the yoga tent, Swami Ramdev angrily said the fast would go on.Hours later, hundreds of police officers swooped down on the protest, forcibly removed Swami Ramdev and used tear gas and canes to disperse his supporters, injuring some people.A police spokesman, Rajan Bhagat, said officers had detained Swami Ramdev early Sunday, but later released him. The guru had permission to hold a yoga function with 5,000 people, he said. “More than 40,000 people had turned up at the venue, and it was not possible to provide security to them,” Mr. Bhagat told The Associated Press.'"
"'11-06-05,'0','IF you are looking for evidence that Riverhead is undergoing a renaissance, it can be found at 1 East Main Street. This 1929 building, home to offices and shops in the past, reopened in September after a renovation, with the Dark Horse restaurant on the first floor. (There are apartments upstairs.)The restaurant’s owner, Dee Muma, is the woman behind the project. Ms. Muma is also an owner, with her husband, Ed Tuccio, of nearby Tweed’s. The décor at the Dark Horse includes Art Deco posters on the butter-yellow walls, an industrial-looking black ceiling with heat ducts and pipes, wraparound windows, silvery chairs, a room-encircling black banquette and wood tables with paper placemats and cloth napkins.The food was very good, but there is more to a meal than food. Throughout my first visit I was annoyed. Annoyed at the waiter, who seemed to be in a fog. Annoyed at the kitchen, which took more than two hours to get out a simple meal on a midweek night, when the restaurant was nearly empty. Annoyed at whoever had heated the rolls, which were stone cold in the center.I was also annoyed at the $31 cost of a special of two medium soft-shell crabs served with only a small clump of salad (without dressing) and a pool of orange chipotle mayonnaise. (That day I had seen soft-shell crabs at my local fish store for $4 each.) That meal price was not in keeping with most on the menu, which includes a number of entrees under $20, among them steak frites, short ribs and a pork loin T-bone.Still, there was a lot to like at the Dark Horse. The roasted shrimp bisque, an orange-hued soup, was packed with flavor. The clam chowder, a beige brew containing lots of minced clams, potatoes and corn, was also good.The salads — served on tiny plates that made them hard to eat, another annoyance — were delicious. We especially liked the North Fork, with baby spinach, sautéed mushrooms and hard-cooked egg in a bacon dressing. Another hit was an entree-size salad called Henry’s salad (a takeoff on the Harry’s salad served at Tweed’s). It was a mix of greens, local asparagus, red onion, five large shrimp, and lots of bacon and blue cheese in a somewhat sharp red wine vinaigrette. A splash of olive oil from the bottle on the table tamed the dressing.'"

"'11-06-05,'0','Ms. Hanna, 42, said she wanted to release the film as an archive of the band since the members no longer plan to record together. She spends much of her time speaking to students and is in the process of shooting another documentary — the Knitting Factory show was part of it — that will focus more directly on her career and its impact.As the product of a scene that self-consciously rejected star power, she has sometimes balked at being a figurehead, but now she would like to have her say. “I really like to talk about my work in a way that is complicated,” she said.As for the resurgence of interest in riot grrrl, “I think it’s zeitgeist,” said Lisa Darms, who started the Fales archive. “A lot of people are reaching that age when they are looking back.”Ms. Marcus, the author of “Girls to the Front,” agreed that it was part of a 20-year nostalgia cycle. But she added that “people are flocking to these reminiscences because there remains a tremendous hunger” for the kind of liberated, don’t give-a-damn femaleness “that was in full flower in the ’90s,” with nothing quite as potent since.The fashion pendulum may have inevitably swung back to the ’90s, but riot grrrl, with its snarky cut-and-paste zines and carefully built micro-communities, prefigures a lot of youth culture today: targeted communication and social networking (although they did it with letters and flyers, not e-mails and Facebook messages); the lure of the handmade and the local — the craft marketplace Etsy could have been born in a riot grrrl meeting; and an attitude, evident in blogs like Jezebel and the Hairpin, that feminism can be fun. Music, too, has opened up. In the late ’90s, post-riot grrrl and Nirvana, indie rock was decidedly male, with bands like Pavement and Modest Mouse dominating the scene, but now women are on most club bills.“I remember it being weird if you saw a girl in a band, and now it’s not weird at all, it’s just totally normal,” said Amanda Warner, an electronic musician and producer known as MNDR. Ms. Warner, 32, grew up listening to riot grrrl in rural North Dakota and said it influenced her identity as a performer and a person. “I didn’t put on makeup until I was 30 years old — that wasn’t the focus,” she said. “The focus with all my girlfriends was, like, what bands are we listening to.”Even younger artists who tuned into riot grrrl years after its demise found a foothold there.“People like me owe them a huge debt,” said Emma Lee-Moss, a British singer who performs as Emmy the Great. Ms. Lee-Moss, 27, discovered Bikini Kill, its peers and successors — like L7 and Sleater-Kinney — while in college in London and found an artistic template. “It never occurred to me that a girl couldn’t make music,” she said.Supporting other women was a part of riot grrrl’s message from the start, and Ms. Hanna carried it through when she founded Le Tigre with Ms. Fateman in New York in 1998, years after they had been roommates in Portland, Ore. Their goal was to make overtly feminist dance-pop.“We’d have these challenges: Do you think we could write about the intersection between coming out as LGBT or coming out as a sexual-abuse survivor?,” Ms. Hanna recalled. “Can we write a catchy song about that?” When she asked Ms. Samson, their former roadie and a student of queer theory and gender politics, to join the band, it added another dimension to their shows.Ms. Samson, 32, a lesbian who proudly sports a mustache, was shocked by the level of attention her appearance drew onstage. She worried that people came to the shows just to make fun of her. “There were times when I felt so bad about myself and so scared to go out there,” she said. “And the more I thought to myself, ‘This is the coolest thing ever, I am creating visibility for people that don’t have it,’ that just pushed me to go forward.”The Fales library material provides a window onto how that activism developed. Because it was pre-Internet and cell phones, “we had a level of discourse that, honestly, I don’t have now,” said Molly Neuman, the drummer for Bratmobile, who also lent her work.Ms. Hanna’s papers were delivered in her sticker-covered file cabinet, now also part of the collection, and kept in the original folders with her bubble-letter writing. There are notes where she worked out slogans and ideas — “Acknowledge emotional violence as real”; “Cry in public”; “Why aren’t boys called sluts?” — and the files include her correspondence with Ms. Fateman, who also donated to the archive. The letters chart their gushing friendship; as Ms. Hanna struggled with her leadership role over the years, Ms. Fateman, who was studying for an MFA in New York, provided counsel.“It was a very scrutinized position to be the most publicly recognized part of riot grrrl,” Ms. Fateman said. As Ms. Marcus documents in “Girls to the Front,” Ms. Hanna was called sexist for excluding men, and pilloried for taking credit for the D.I.Y. feminist movement. Rolling Stone derided Bikini Kill’s first album as “yowling and moronic nag-unto-vomit tantrums” and riot grrrl suffered immediate strains as it grew.With tension among the bandmates high, Bikini Kill put out its final album in 1996, and riot grrrl as an organized movement, with nationwide chapters, dissolved the same year. Once her work became known, “my joke is always like, I didn’t just hit the glass ceiling, I pressed my naked” breasts “up against it,” Ms. Hanna said.In the aftermath of Le Tigre, Ms. Samson started another band, MEN. Ms. Fateman, 36, opened a West Village salon, Seagull Hair, and had a daughter, now 2. Ms. Hanna, who is married to Adam Horovitz, better known as Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys, looked for ways to broaden her message, which meant abandoning some of the tenets she held as a riot grrrl. “We were all so freaked out about the male gaze,” she said, laughing. “Even though nobody was even trying to photograph us, we were always holding our hands up — ‘Stop taking our picture.’ It was the ’90s, you know?”Now Ms. Hanna, who in conversation is thoughtful but not academic, has grown used to having a camera on her.  At a party for a recent exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art where her work was featured, she autographed posters for fans for hours, all of it filmed for the coming documentary.  The Julie Ruin, her latest band, is not intended to be forthrightly political. “I’m not doing it as a conceptual artist, which is how I did everything up till now,” she said. “I just write what I want to write.”Though she wasn’t directly involved, the most lasting legacy of riot grrrl, she said, was in the advent of female-oriented music schools, like the Willie Mae Rock Camp for Girls. Ms. Hanna teaches classes about electronic recording there. Toy Sugar, from the Knitting Factory tribute, met her at a rock camp event, and were wowed. “She talked about zines — that’s what they were called, right?” said Aziza Akhmatova, 15. “She showed that girls can be rock stars and be girls at the same time. ”The cross-generational potency of that idea was clear at the Knitting Factory, where the line-up included 16-year-old Coco Moore, the daughter of Ms. Gordon and Thurston Moore, of Sonic Youth. As her father snapped pictures from the audience, Ms. Moore performed “Rebel Girl,” perhaps Bikini Kill’s most famous song, with classmates. In shiny leggings and a T-shirt, she strutted around the stage, singing, “Rebel girl, rebel girl, I know I wanna take you home” in a rock star voice that cut through the club.Her mother was nervous about her performance. “Seeing her play this song, particularly, was tearing to me,” Ms. Gordon said after the show. “She’s conventionally attractive, pretty, long hair, feminine, and yet she can sing this song that’s about embracing the power of whatever your sexual persuasion or preference is.”“At some point you can’t worry about ever being a woman in rock, or a girl in rock,” she said. “You just do it.”'"
"'11-06-05,'0','Twice in “The Absolute Value of Mike,” 14-year-old Mike is asked, “What’s your story?” The first time he equivocates, talking instead about the circumstances that surround him. The second time, he evades: “I — I don’t know.” Both are deceptions that come out of a humiliating sadness; because he does know his story. He is the kid whose father is a math and engineering genius, burdened with an un-smart son, one who is bound to disappoint and will probably end up on the street, because he is so much less than his father.Except Mike is wrong. That isn’t his story.That false story, however, ignites the real action in the novel, when Mike is sent to live in rural Pennsylvania for six weeks with a great-uncle who is paralyzed by grief and a great-aunt who defines herself as “a collector of lost souls.” Mike is to participate in an engineering project —the building of an artesian screw — but he soon finds that his father misunderstood the nature of the project altogether; it is actually an artist’s crew that the town is putting together in order to raise money to enable the local minister to adopt a child. To that task, the people of Do Over (Donover, but the “n” in the town’s sign “went missing” long ago) have set their minds. It is seemingly hopeless: the money they would need to raise is beyond all possibility.“The Absolute Value of Mike” is a comedy about deadly serious things. It is also decidedly more comic than either of Kathryn Erskine’s two earlier books, mostly because of its quirky cast and authentic 14-year-old voice, as in this text message Mike sends to his father when asked about the state of his emergency funds: “Aw, and we were planning to blow it all at Big Dawg’s Tattoo and Bar, and then go skinny-dipping in Lake Revival.” But it shares with the author’s previous books one technique in particular: Erskine puts her characters into intensely uncomfortable circumstances, ones bound to create oppositional relationships. In “Quaking” (2007), Matt, a Goth girl, moves in with a Quaker family — not her choice. In the National Book Award-winning “Mockingbird” (2010), Caitlin, whose expression of emotion is dulled by Asperger’s syndrome, lives with a father who is overcome with emotion following the death of his son. Here, Mike, who suffers from dyscalculia (he cannot work with numbers) is set against a brilliant father whose sense of the abstract is profound.But there is another powerful opposition. Mike’s father is unable to speak his own son’s name without hesitation, a metaphor for his inability to connect with another human being. Mike, however, can connect — through empathy, through blunt realism, through confrontation, through understanding. Erskine’s narrative is driven by the question of whether Mike will learn to comprehend the value of that gift.The comedy stems from the misunderstandings he encounters along the way: his great-aunt’s assurance hollered out in the airport that she’ll get him the BVDs that he needs, though he asked about DVDs; his worry that his great-aunt is afflicted with too much gas (“I moved closer to the door”); his misperception of the minister’s request when she pleads with him to help her get a child (“I’m just a kid”). There is much to misunderstand in the town of Do Over.But the novel’s progression is toward clarity. In a series of surprising and moving revelations, Mike comes to understand his father’s social block, his decision to send him away, and his desire to teach him mathematics. And he comes to understand his own dread of becoming an engineer and his inability to speak honestly to his father. Finally and gloriously, Mike understands his own true story, where he finds that, as with absolute values, “different” does not mean “less than.”'"

After two minutes on hold, to the theme song for “ ” — an odd choice for an insurance company — she returns and admits that I am right. Lacy narrates how she is correcting the error as she taps at her keyboard. Then she asks if anyone has ever discussed with me. “You are such a good customer,” she coos.“Would you be interested in receiving a quote? It only takes about five minutes.”“I would be happy to,” I say, magnanimous in my victory.“Very well,” she says. “Let me transfer you.”There is less holding this time — a snippet of what sounds like Wagner. I wonder if there are playlists shared among insurance giants, each song a subliminal nod to catastrophe (percussion) overcome by a prudent level of indemnity (wind instruments).“Hello, my name is Michelle, and I’ll be talking to you about life insurance today.”“Wonderful, Michelle,” I say. Bureaucratic conquest has induced a kind of high in me.'"
"'11-06-05,'0','And then there is Naomi Wolf, the author and feminist, who detected ominous “geopolitics by blackmail” in the coincidence that three antagonists of the establishment — Eliot Spitzer, Julian Assange and Strauss-Kahn — were sidelined by sex charges.“This does not mean that Strauss-Kahn is innocent or that he is guilty,” she blogged the other day. “It means that policy outcomes can be advanced nowadays, in a surveillance society, by exploiting or manipulating sex-crime charges, whether real or inflated.” Hmm.Richard Hofstadter, whose writings long dominated the field of conspiracy studies, hypothesized that conspiratorial thinking — what he called “the paranoid style” — festered on the political margins and often contained an anti-intellectual streak. More recent scholarship by academics like Mark Fenster, Peter Knight and Robert Goldberg suggests that conspiracy theories do not come from a particular personality type, I.Q. stratum or dispossessed fringe; they erupt wherever unfathomable news collides with unshakable beliefs.That is what happened in France, argues Bernard-Henri Lévy, the philosopher-pundit who has been a fierce defender of Strauss-Kahn. Lévy says he does not believe his friend is the victim of a plot — just an American rush to judgment — but he thinks he understands why so many of his countrymen smell a conspiracy. “People begin to believe in a plot, to model conspiracy theories, when they are staggered, literally staggered, clobbered by astonishment,” he told me.Maybe, then, there is a little birther in all of us. Fenster, a law professor and author of “Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture,” says a sense of conspiracy is “almost an instinctive response to strange events.”“I admit I was a little drawn to the D.S.K. plot at first,” Fenster told me. “Then I heard Nina Totenberg explain the case on NPR, and I was ashamed of myself.”Our receptiveness to the outlandish is primed by the fact that we know of actual conspiracies. Watergate happened. Iran-contra happened. One reason so many in France are quick to suspect American perfidy is that the C.I.A. did, in fact, meddle in European affairs during the Cold War.Suspicion hardens into full-blown conviction when people lose faith in authorities, says Knight, who edited “Conspiracy Nation: The Politics of Paranoia in Postwar America.” The present day, he told me, when Internet access has sparked a proliferation of competing, self-appointed authorities, is a particularly fertile time for conspiracy theorists, who might ask: “ ‘Why would you believe The New York Times? Why do they have a monopoly on truth? Surely Twitter and WikiLeaks are just as trustworthy.’ ”Knight added, “As soon as you lose faith that the mainstream media are telling the truth, anything is believable.”My own antidote to conspiratorial thinking is an abiding mistrust in the competence of big institutions. In American pop-culture thrillers, there is a lethal efficiency to whatever sinister organization is behind the evil doings. In my experience, governments, corporations and other powerful institutions are not usually that good at making things happen according to plan, let alone at keeping secrets.The main lesson for those of us who are supposed to traffic in facts — journalists, academics, policy makers — is not to be too dismissive of those who hold beliefs that seem preposterous. There is, of course, a hard core for whom the very fact that The New York Times (or the 9/11 Commission or the Centers for Disease Control) is challenging their version of reality just confirms it. But evidence, laid out dispassionately, engaging without mocking, is still our best recourse.And sometimes it works. You may have missed it, but after President Obama released his birth certificate, polls showed that belief in the birther myth fell by half. As the Strauss-Kahn case makes its way through discovery and trial, the French suspicion of a setup will surely wane.Then again, Knight speculates that doubters may find their cynicism stoked by news that President Sarkozy’s wife is pregnant with their first child, just in time for the presidential campaign.“Carla Bruni pregnant?” Knight mused. “Now that is just too convenient.”'"

It takes several hours’ sailing to reach the heart of the archipelago but you can get a quick fix by taking a ferry to Fjaderholmarna, a group of islands just 20 minutes from downtown. Book ahead for lunch on the deck beside the water at Fjaderholmarnas Krog (46-8-718-33-55; fjaderholmarnaskrog.se). The midsummer menu includes plenty of herring, dill-smoked salmon and oysters. Expect to spend 250 kronor for lunch.On Hamngatan, one of the city’s main shopping streets, two retail titans are squaring off, and national pride is at stake: on one side stands NK (Hamngatan 18-20; 46-8-762-8000; nk.se), the venerable Swedish department store that opened in 1902. Almost directly opposite is the challenger, the Danish design store Illums Bolighus (Hamngatan 27; 46-8-718-5500; illumsbolighus.dk), established in Copenhagen in 1925, which opened its first Swedish store last fall. NK has the edge as far as food and fashion go, but when it comes to cool Scandinavian design, Illums is unbeatable. Here you will find pieces by all the big names of Danish design — Finn Juhl, Hans Wegner, Verner Panton — as well as international brands at all prices.Book a treatment at the Raison d’Etre spa inside the Grand Hôtel (Sodra Blasieholmshamnen 8; 46-8-679-3500; grandhotel.se). The spa feels thoroughly Nordic, with blocks of granite underfoot in the shower and murals with pixilated views of the archipelago. Of course, treatments (from 930 kronor for a neck, back and shoulder massage) include classic Swedish massage.The Old Town, in the heart of the city, has no end of restaurants targeting tourists; it also has some of the best places to eat. Djuret (Lilla Nygatan 5; 46-8-506-40084; djuret.se), whose name means “the animal,” offers a meat-heavy menu that focuses on one meat-and-wine pairing at a time: lamb with Bordeaux, for instance, or veal with Barolo and Barbaresco. However, on June 27 Djuret closes for two months and instead offers a top-notch pork barbecue in the courtyard behind the building, weather permitting. Its name? Svinet, which means “the pig.” No reservations, so arrive soon after it opens at 5 p.m. A three-course meal with wine costs around 550 kronor.The restaurant-bar Riche (Birger Jarlsgatan 4; 46-8-545-03560; riche.se) has been going strong since 1893. It starts to fill up as soon as nearby offices close and is soon crammed with a glamorous, affluent crowd. You’ll most likely hear more Champagne bottles being popped open here than anywhere else in town. If the crush is too much, cross the road to KB (Smalandsgatan 7; 46-8-679-60-32; konstnarsbaren.se), a classic Stockholm restaurant that has a charming bar with murals dating from the 1930s of ale-swilling Vikings and tipsy monks sipping Chartreuse.Stockholm can be a sleepy town on a Sunday, and few restaurants serve brunch. The restaurant at the Moderna Museet (Skeppsholmen; 46-8-5195-6291-5282; modernamuseet.se) has a lavish weekend buffet brunch serving Asian, African, American and European dishes (265 kronor). Reservations are essential as there are only two sittings, at 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. If you don’t have a reservation, visit the cafe and enjoy a simpler meal alfresco on the large terrace.Fotografiska (Stadsgardshamnen 22; 46-8-5090-0500; fotografiska.eu, admission 110 kronor) opened last year in a former tollhouse on the quayside of Sodermalm. It has photographic exhibitions of varying quality (Annie Leibovitz was the opening show, but some subsequent exhibitions have been somewhat ho-hum), but it’s worth visiting the top-floor cafe where you’ll find enormous windows looking out over the Old Town. The view is so spectacular that even if you don’t like the photos on the gallery walls you’re bound to end up snapping a few yourself.IF YOU GORight now the 201-room Nobis (Norrmalmstorg 2-4; 46-8-614-10-00; nobishotel.se ), which opened in December 2010, is the hottest place to lodge.

"'11-06-06,'0','But the efforts were especially apparent at a hearing last month in Washington related to derivatives. Some of the most powerful players in the derivatives market — which is closely controlled by just a small group of banks — argued that the government should allow a slow pace of changes for rewriting derivatives contracts.On Monday, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, spoke about the Dodd-Frank rules in a speech in Atlanta, warning that there were efforts by groups that oppose the reform to starve regulators of the resources they need to put new rules in place.“Those in the U.S. financial community who are supporting these efforts to block resources and appointments are looking for leverage over the rules still being written,” Mr. Geithner said.He specifically focused on derivatives rule-writing, where some financial groups have complained that European rules may differ from the new rules in the United States. He said he hoped regulators in Europe and Asia would create standardized rules to prevent a “race to the bottom.”Regulators in the United States overseeing the process say it is difficult to tell how many of the concerns that financial executives and their lobbyists raise are valid and which ones are exaggerated.“For us, it’s a question of figuring out the legitimate interests of folks who say, ‘Wait a minute, slow down’ because they really want us to get it right, and some of them who really have an ulterior motive of just running the clock out,” said Bart Chilton, one of the three Democratic commissioners of the commodities futures trading agency, which is overseeing most rule-writing for derivatives. “It’s going a lot slower than I had envisioned.”Financial firms argue that slower deliberations may lead to smarter outcomes. Some lawmakers agree, and some voted in recent weeks in Congressional committees to delay derivatives rules at least a year. Many of those rules were to have been completed by the July anniversary of the Dodd-Frank bill.Regulators have been swamped by public comments and asked for more funds and personnel to meet the demands. In April, the C.F.T.C. extended all of its derivative comment periods for a month.“Right now there’s a tacit truce on the deadlines,” said Margaret E. Tahyar, a partner at Davis Polk, which represents financial institutions. “Really, it’s the right thing to have a little bit more time on this. There really hasn’t been anything like this ever before in terms of rule-makings.”Perhaps nowhere are the stakes higher for the megabanks than with derivatives, which insure against many different risks in the economy. Some of the Dodd-Frank rules center on increasing security and transparency in this $600 trillion market. For instance, many are related to clearinghouses, which provide a central repository for money backing those wagers. Some of the changes threaten to cut into banks’ lucrative profit margins.At the derivatives round table in May, bankers and other representatives of financial firms asked for substantial implementation periods on derivatives rules. For instance, Athanassios Diplas, of Deutsche Bank, said the bank would need 18 to 24 months “simply to sign documentation” related to the new rules because of “bandwidth” issues, according to a transcript from the event.He said, “If you think about it even in man-hours or man-weeks or whatever, one client — an attorney can do 100 of these a week, which sounds pretty aggressive — we’re talking about 800 man- weeks.”Stephen O’Connor, an executive from Morgan Stanley, came up with an even more lengthy estimate, saying his clients say it could take an entire day to renegotiate contracts and that could mean “100 man-years worth of effort.”One Goldman Sachs banker, R. Martin Chavez, said that documents on valuing derivatives represented “a mind-bendingly difficult problem you could fill libraries with, with very boring Ph.D.’s on that topic.”One panelist was quick to argue that the bankers were trying to stall the rules. James Cawley, the chief executive who runs an electronic trading operation called Javelin Capital Markets, jumped in, saying, “We don’t think we are putting men on the moon when it comes to documentation.”Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Goldman did not make these bankers available for interviews.Two of the commodities agency’s commissioners, Scott O’Malia, a Republican, and Gary Gensler, the Democratic chairman, attended the round table, with Mr. Gensler leaping out of the audience periodically to pose questions. Afterward, Mr. O’Malia said he disagreed with critics who say “this is a delay tactic.”“The panelists made it very clear they need months, not years,” he said in a speech at the Heritage Foundation.Mr. O’Malia called the agency’s extended comment period “a natural pause.” Mr. Gensler said in an interview that the extension was a good move but that “the American public is not protected until we finalize these rules.”One way that banks can delay progress is by haggling within industry associations over small turns of phrase in legal agreements. The banks lately have been clashing with large customers, like hedge funds, in discussions of new paperwork needed for dealing with trade rejections, situations in which derivatives trades do not go through because of client financing problems. Late last month, JPMorgan Chase was supposed to host a meeting to discuss it, but lawyers for large banks canceled the meeting at the last minute. The banks, large customers say, drafted the documents in ways that favor the biggest banks because it would make it more difficult for customers to use a large number of banks for trading.The issue of whether new documents or rules give advantages to just a handful of banks is particularly relevant because the Justice Department and the European Commission have been investigating this market for antitrust behavior.'"

"'11-06-06,'0','Elizabeth Warren may well be the most popular person in Washington. When she was head of the Congressional Oversight Panel on TARP , her willingness to go after Wall Street, the Treasury Department, and the Fed made her a liberal icon. And her folksy, Midwestern air and her ability to express complex financial issues in simple language turned her into an unlikely media superstar. Warren is now working to set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new government agency inspired by her own work on consumer credit, and in the past couple of weeks almost a quarter of a million people have signed an online petition asking President Obama to nominate her as the official boss of the agency. Yet Warren may also be the most hated person in Washington. The banking lobby sees her as its nemesis, congressional Republicans are openly hostile to her, and conservatives decry her as the exemplary “totalitarian liberal.” At this point, the only way Warren will run the C.F.P.B. is if President Obama makes her a recess appointment, and Senate Republicans have vowed to try to stop even that.Given the intensely partisan nature of Washington these days, the demonization of Warren and the C.F.P.B. is all too predictable. But it’s profoundly misguided, because Warren is far from the anti-capitalist radical that her critics (and some of her supporters) suppose. Indeed, an empowered C.F.P.B. could actually be a boon to business.The core principle of Warren’s work is also a cornerstone of economic theory: well-informed consumers make for vigorous competition and efficient markets. That idea is embodied in the design of the new agency, which focusses on improving the information that consumers get from banks and other financial institutions, so that they can do the kind of comparison shopping that makes the markets for other consumer products work so well. As things stand, many Americans are ill informed about financial products. The typical mortgage or credit-card agreement features page after page of legalese—what bankers call “mice type”—in which the numbers that really matter are obscured by a welter of irrelevant data. There’s plenty of misinformation, too: surveys find that a sizable percentage of mortgage borrowers believe that their lenders are legally obliged to offer them the best possible rate. Since borrowers are often unaware of how much they’re actually paying and why, the market for financial products doesn’t work as well as most markets do. And the consequences of this are not trivial. The housing bubble was a collective frenzy, but it was made much worse by the fact that millions of borrowers were making poorly informed decisions about the debt they were taking on. If people had known more, they might well have borrowed less.You might think that businesses offering better products would have an incentive to make sure that potential customers were able to distinguish between ripoffs and good deals, but it’s not that easy. As the law and economics scholars Richard Hynes and Eric Posner have found, when consumer ignorance is “severe enough” there’s “a limit to how much explaining a creditor can do before losing the attention of its customers.” In an interview in 2009, Warren told me about her own experience with this problem. She talked to a number of banks about introducing a credit card with a higher up-front interest rate but lower penalty fees—a cost-effective arrangement for many people. But the idea went nowhere, because research suggested that there was no way to convince consumers that it was a good deal. In a world where marketing is all about the lowest teaser A.P.R., all businesses have to play the same game, and you end up with a race to the bottom. Look at the housing bubble: any mortgage broker who told customers that he was being paid to push them into certain kinds of mortgages would have lost business, while financial institutions that initially avoided things like no-income-verification mortgages eventually felt compelled to offer them.The C.F.P.B. hopes to change this, largely by insuring that consumers will be told the true terms of a deal, in a simple and clear fashion. (As an example, it recently released two possible mortgage disclosure forms, and both were two pages long.) This would obviously be good for borrowers. But it would help most lenders, too. For all the talk of the financial industry’s power, its performance over the past decade has actually been dismal. Countless lenders have gone out of business, and many of those still standing saw their stock price decimated after they loaned immense amounts of money to people who couldn’t repay it. The banks thought they were taking advantage of uninformed consumers, but they ended up playing themselves. In a more transparent credit market, almost everyone would have been better off.While some bankers accept the need for consumer protection, they maintain that the C.F.P.B. will go too far and end up strangling financial innovation. But, over the past century or so, new regulatory initiatives have inevitably been greeted with predictions of doom from the very businesses they eventually helped. Meatpackers hated the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, but it rescued the industry from the aftereffects of the publication of “The Jungle.” Wall Street said that the creation of the S.E.C. would demolish stock trading, but the commission helped make the U.S. the world’s most liquid and trusted stock market. And bankers thought that the F.D.I.C. would sabotage their industry, but it transformed it by effectively ending bank runs. History suggests that business doesn’t always know what’s good for it. And, at a time when Americans profoundly distrust the financial industry, a Warren-led C.F.P.B. could turn out to be the friend that the banks never knew they needed. ♦'"

"'11-06-06,'0','“Irwin was the person most prominently associated with that shift, the father of preventive dentistry,” Dr. Ira B. Lamster, dean of the College of Dental Medicine, said.Much of the shift was based on Dr. Mandel’s research into the chemistry of saliva and the changes that occur with different oral diseases, information used in both diagnosis and treatment. For example, until his research, it was not known that levels of protein and electrolytes in saliva differ with various diseases. Also, in researching cavities, Dr. Mandel was one of the first scientists to link acidity levels in saliva to the development of decay.Dr. Lawrence A. Tabak, deputy director of the National Institutes of Health and previously director of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, said Dr. Mandel’s research had repercussions far beyond dentistry. “He laid the groundwork for what we today know as the innate immune system,” Dr. Tabak said.One way the body defends itself is with antibodies that are part of the immune system. But another way is with what are called preformed protective molecules, most of them proteins, that can kill bacteria. “Today we call that part of the innate immune system,” Dr. Tabak said. “Irwin was one of the very first to point out the presence of these preformed protective molecules in saliva, but it turns out they are found throughout the body. And that work has now exploded so that many laboratories around the world explore the innate immune system.”Dr. Mandel was also one of the first scientists to point out that saliva could be used as a diagnostic tool for more than oral diseases. “Today, probably the most important saliva-based test is the F.D.A.-approved test for H.I.V.,” Dr. Tabak said.In 1985, the American Dental Association awarded Dr. Mandel its first Gold Medal for Excellence in Dental Research.Irwin Daniel Mandel was born in Brooklyn on April 9, 1922, one of two sons of Samuel and Shirley Mandel. He graduated from City College in 1942, received his degree in dentistry from Columbia in 1945 and soon after became a research assistant at the university. He spent his entire career at Columbia, becoming a professor emeritus in 1992.In addition to his daughter Carol, Dr. Mandel is survived by his wife of 67 years, the former Charlotte Lifschutz; another daughter, Nora Lee Mandel; a son, Richard; his brother, Burton; and two grandchildren.The author of more than 225 scientific articles, Dr. Mandel was something of an unofficial historian of dentistry, once writing about decayed teeth found in the fossil skulls of South African Australopithecine hominids 500,000 to 1 million years old.Looking to the future, Dr. Mandel recognized the challenge in getting people to take proper care of their teeth. He told The New York Times in 1971: “We’d like everybody to take advantage of the new procedures developed by dental science. But we know from experience that many people will not, just as many people continue to smoke and to eat diets too rich in fats despite the medical warnings against such practices.”'"
"'11-06-06,'0','But the production allows a lively cast to try on several styles of theatrical postures — not to mention some ravishing costumes by Susan Hilferty — and to savor lines that are as rich and light as the quenelles at La Grenouille. And in a play that is ultimately a knowing valentine to those who tread the boards, a shivery emotional resonance is guaranteed by the presence of Lois Smith and David Margulies, wonderful actors whose combined years on the stage total more than a century.Ms. Smith brings her been-there-and-loved-it veteran’s aura to the role of the weary sorcerer Alcandre, a Prosperolike figure who works her magic from the Stygian depths of a cave in France. (The role is traditionally played by a man, but you may recall that both Vanessa Redgrave and Helen Mirren have had a go at Prospero in recent years.) The story begins with the arrival of Pridamant (Mr. Margulies), a severe and bilious bourgeois lawyer who drove his son from the house many years earlier and now wants to learn what became of his long-lost progeny.Aided by her put-upon Amanuensis (Henry Stram) Alcandre brings forth a succession of phantasms portraying the adventures of Pridamant’s missing son (the surreally handsome, appropriately theatrical Finn Wittrock). The young man is seen in love, in jeopardy and in extremis, surrounded by a familiar gallery of types: a fair, highborn maiden (Amanda Quaid); her pert and crafty maid (Merritt Wever); and a set of rival suitors, one arrogant and violent (Sean Dugan) and the other an arrant buffoon (Peter Bartlett). Among them, they embody — and discuss — aspects of love with a mix of passion and cynicism that is oh so very French.You may note that I haven’t identified most of these characters by name. That’s because their names change every time they change their clothes. And while they remain more or less true to type, they seem to keep changing their styles of speaking and posturing too. This doesn’t stop them from stirring up emotions in Pridamant that the old man hasn’t felt in years.If you haven’t figured out the great punch line that all these vignettes are leading to, heaven forbid that I should spoil it for you. Let me just say that this play puts very specific demands on most of its cast members, who are portraying not just illusions but also variations on those illusions. The director is similarly taxed, asked to make sure that we are seduced by the narrative in each vignette while maintaining a sense of a metaphysical whole.Mr. Mayer (“American Idiot,” “Spring Awakening”) and his ensemble don’t consistently achieve this double vision. The younger performers in particular often give the impression of parsing their lines as they speak them, with an air of brow-furrowing thought more appropriate to a scene-study class perhaps than an airy pageant of phantoms.But Mr. Bartlett, a purveyor of baroque comic stylings all his own, is quite wonderful in finding layers of identity within one fatuous, self-deluding fool. (He also gets to fling about choice insults like “affronterous pimple” and “presumptuous homuncula.”) He’s flamboyantly funny, but he also suggests the ways in which we all, as actors on the stages of our minds, create illusions about ourselves for ourselves.Mr. Margulies brings rattling emotional thunder to the role of the father, another self-deluder who never quite gets wise to himself. And Ms. Smith, done up like a magisterial madam in a cosmic brothel, and Mr. Stram are a winningly ambivalent pair of accomplices, grudgingly linked by interdependence. Ms. Smith delivers Acandre’s big final speech — which brings to mind Prospero’s “our revels now are ended” soliloquy — with a rueful knowledge that may well bring tears to your eyes.“What in this world is not evanescent?” she asks. “What in this world is real and not seeming?” She goes on in this lovely, lyrical vein before stopping abruptly to tell her client to settle his bill. Ms. Smith is memorably brusque here, reminding us that even sorcerers, like directors and producers and actors, do not live by art alone.By Tony Kushner, adapted from Pierre Corneille’s “Illusion Comique”; directed by Michael Mayer; sets by Christine Jones; costumes by Susan Hilferty; lighting by Kevin Adams; sound by Bray Poor; music by Nico Muhly; fight director, Rick Sordelet; hair and wig design by Tom Watson; production stage manager, Paul J.

"'11-06-06,'0','ATLANTA (AP) — Sidney Spencer hit a tying basket on her only shot of the game with two-tenths of a second left in regulation, Leilani Mitchell made a clinching 3-pointer in overtime and the Liberty rallied to beat the Atlanta Dream, 94-88, on Sunday.Plenette Pierson scored 25 points to lead the Liberty in the opener for both teams, a rematch of last year’s W.N.B.A. Eastern Conference finals, won by the Dream in a two-game sweep.The Liberty took advantage of an Atlanta team missing its top player, Angel McCoughtry, who sprained her left knee in camp.Spencer played just five minutes but sent the game to overtime after a deflected ball led to a quick improvisation, a nifty pass leaving her with an open look on the baseline.Mitchell sealed the victory by sinking a 3-pointer from the corner with 28 seconds left in overtime.Iziane Castro Marques led Atlanta with 19 points, Sancho Lyttle added 18, and Lindsey Harding had 9 assists in her Dream debut. But Harding also missed a late free throw that could have put the game away.'"
"'11-06-06,'0','“This one was the most difficult of all of them,” said Nadal’s uncle and coach, Toni Nadal. “Rafa was more nervous. He couldn’t manage to really hit the ball well and that gives you a real sense of insecurity.”But Federer has been quite a French Open security blanket for Nadal. Their rivalry is one of the greatest in tennis history, yet it has been decidedly short on suspense here.Nadal is now 5-0 against Federer at Roland Garros. Four of those victories have come in finals, and though this match was a thriller in comparison with Nadal’s 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 victory in 2008, it still ended with Nadal’s imposing his topspin forehand and Federer slumping toward the trophy ceremony with most of the crowd commiserating.They do love the French-speaking Federer in Paris, the only Grand Slam city where he has been an underdog during his glory years. But though the chants of “Ro-ger, Ro-ger” helped him scale revivalist heights on Friday in his magnificent ambush of Novak Djokovic, they were not enough to lift the 29-year-old Federer past the 25-year-old Nadal, who had a solid, vocal minority chanting “Ra-fa” his way, too.Federer had his chances, none more significant than the set point he failed to convert with Nadal serving at 2-5 in the first set. Taking the opening set from Nadal in his year of living dangerously at Roland Garros might have caused more doubts to surface. But Federer’s backhand drop shot — a stroke he would use often and effectively throughout the match — landed just wide.Nadal held serve, then broke Federer in the next game and gathered momentum.“That’s how it goes; Rafa is tough,” Federer said. “I definitely thought I got maybe a touch unlucky there and he got a touch lucky.”Nadal then shrugged off a false step late in the second set. Serving for a two-set lead at 5-4, 40-30, heavy rain began to fall. Federer saved a set point to deuce, but the players were forced to leave the court as the rain intensified. When they returned little more than 10 minutes later, Federer saved another set point and broke Nadal for 5-5. Though it felt like foreshadowing, it proved nothing more than a brief respite for Federer, who played a mediocre tie breaker, pressing and making errors in bunches.“Obviously I’m the one who’s playing with smaller margins, so obviously I’m always going to go through a bit more ups and downs,” Federer said. “Whereas Rafa is content doing the one thing the entire time. So it’s always me who’s going to dictate play and decide how the outcome is going to be. If I play well, I will most likely win in the score or beat him. If I’m not playing so well, that’s when he wins.”Nadal is certainly capable of dictating terms, but Federer’s quality of play fluctuated drastically on Sunday.He would rise up for one more meaningful surge in the third set, rallying from a 2-4 deficit. But the match turned again in the opening game of the fourth set when Nadal escaped from a 0-40 deficit on his serve. He later broke Federer at love to go ahead, 3-1. The rest felt like a processional, and when the match ended with a forehand error, Nadal dropped to his knees and cradled his head in his hands before jogging forward to offer his hand and condolences to Federer once more.A thank-you would have been appropriate, too. Nadal held on to his No. 1 ranking because of Federer’s win over Djokovic in the semifinals. Even if the duopoly of Federer and Nadal appears to be over for good, they managed to restore order in Paris this year, and it would be no surprise to see them playing in the Wimbledon final in four weeks.Nadal leads their series, 17-8, and has won their last four matches in Grand Slam tournaments. The last time they played in a major event — in the 2009 Australian Open final — Federer broke down in tears at the awards ceremony after his five-set defeat, muttering, “God, it’s killing me.”This loss did not look nearly so traumatic. Federer is ranked No. 3 now, but he proved here that, when in form and inspired, he remains a member of the ruling class, even with his 30th birthday looming.“It’ s too bad I couldn’t win, but I’m very proud of my run here the last two weeks,” he said in his postmatch remarks to the crowd.Federer remains the leader in Grand Slam singles titles with 16, but Nadal now has 10, and is the second-youngest man to hit that number. The youngest was Borg, who was 24 when he won his 10th at Wimbledon in 1980.Nadal and Borg, who won his titles in Paris between 1974 and 1981, were at their most dominant at Roland Garros. Nadal and Borg lost to just one man here: Borg to the Italian Adriano Panatta (twice); Nadal to the Swedish slugger Robin Soderling in the fourth round in 2009.But Borg and Nadal have more in common than such numbers. They were both long-haired teen idols who maintained career-long connections to their early coaches (Borg had Lennart Bergelin, Nadal has Toni). They each redefined the forehand with their technique and topspin. They were the best movers on clay of their generations and possessed fine two-handed backhands, underrated touch, superb endurance and an ability to block out the distractions and momentum shifts and focus, again and again, on the challenge at hand.Perhaps Borg will make it to Roland Garros when Nadal breaks their tie. Watching Nadal win in Paris even in an off year, it is hard to imagine him not getting to seven.'"
"'11-06-06,'0','Greece’s problems are deepening at a time when the United States is also trying to pare its own gaping budget deficit, a challenge that has grown amid signs that the American economic recovery may be faltering.Indeed, ever since the European debt crisis flared, European policy makers have wondered aloud whether the United States might face its own day of reckoning. Last week, Moody’s Investors Service said it might downgrade the United States government’s top-tier credit rating if Congress failed to raise the nation’s debt ceiling in coming weeks.The Greek government is trying to cut its deficit by 6.4 billion euros by reducing spending and raising taxes, as well as by selling major national assets. Without those pledges, the International Monetary Fund was wary of releasing a new portion of aid promised in its first loan a year ago, and European leaders were loath to come up with new financing. The Greek fiscal crisis worsened after Moody’s warned last week that there was a 50 percent chance that the country would default or restructure its debts within the next five years.European leaders want to avoid such an event at all costs. The European Central Bank has warned that a default or restructuring by Greece could cause a panic about the ability of Ireland and Portugal — which have also received European bailouts — to repay their debts. The result, some say, could be a financial contagion that engulfs other weak euro zone countries, some large European banks and even the European Central Bank, which holds large amounts of Greek debt.Some officials say such warnings are too dire. But many economists say they see any further trouble in Greece as both a political and economic flash point for the rest of the euro zone. The inability of heavily indebted countries to stoke their economies could broaden an economic divide between Germany and weaker nations like Ireland, Portugal and Spain.“Europe is continuing to diverge,” said Alessandro Profumo, a former chief executive of UniCredit, one of the largest banks in Italy, and a member of the board at Bocconi University in Milan. “This cannot continue.”That could leave countries like Germany and France financing hefty new portions of aid for weaker countries for some time to come, a situation that would present fresh political challenges, economists said.“What we can’t afford is a transfer union” in which taxpayers from strong countries continue to foot part of the bailout bill for weaker ones, said Roland Berger, the founder of Roland Berger Strategy Consultants and a former adviser to German national and state governments. “The European population is simply not ready for it.”Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who exerts considerable sway in talks over assistance for Greece and other countries, might have difficulty explaining to voters why Greece should receive more help, even though Germany has benefited greatly from being part of the monetary union. And in France, Mr. Berger said, economic concerns are among the issues that have helped bolster the campaign of a right-wing candidate, Marine Le Pen of the National Front party.'"
"'11-06-06,'0','But Congress Party leaders were hardly apologetic and instead accused Swami Ramdev of trying to deliberately stir up trouble as a proxy for the Bharatiya Janata Party and right-wing Hindu groups. “You cannot allow people like Ramdev to run riot in the capital,” said Digvijay Singh, a powerful Congress Party leader who has been outspoken in his criticism of the swami. “He was trying to incite people. Therefore, the action of the police is justified.”Other Congress Party leaders said Swami Ramdev had deliberately violated a secret agreement to cancel his hunger strike on Saturday afternoon. The swami had focused his protest on the issue of “black money,” the untold billions of misappropriated dollars stashed in foreign banks.Last week, ministers met with him several times to explain government initiatives on the issue as part of their effort to head off the hunger strike, and on Saturday he announced that the government had met his demands. But after the government announced publicly that there had been an agreement and that Swami Ramdev had promised to end the strike, he angrily vowed that the strike would go on.On Sunday morning, the police moved in to break up the protest.Kapil Sibal, the Congress Party’s point man on the issue, said the government delegation actually struck a deal with the swami on Friday. In it the government pledged to take certain actions on black money, he said, while Swami Ramdev agreed that he would strike on Saturday morning but call it off by the afternoon.But when Swami Ramdev continued with his fast into Saturday evening, Mr. Sibal appeared before reporters with a written copy of the secret agreement and accused the yoga guru of breaking their deal.The Delhi police said Sunday that they had broken up the demonstration because Swami Ramdev had a permit to conduct a yoga meditation session with 5,000 people but that the crowd had surpassed 50,000 and he was imploring more people to come to New Delhi to join the strike.Rajan Bhagat, a police spokesman, denied that the police had instigated the confrontation. He said some protesters began pelting officers with bricks after the police ordered everyone to go home. Officers then used tear gas to disperse the crowd.Mr. Bhagat said that 23 police officers and 39 civilians were slightly injured in the ensuing scuffle.'"

The 47 health professionals were arraigned in a closed hearing in a security court. The Shiite majority had been protesting to demand greater freedom, equal rights and an elected government from the Sunni monarchy. During the unrest, the medical professionals said it was their duty to treat everyone and rejected accusations that treating protesters was akin to supporting their cause.'"

"'11-06-07,'0','“My wife is a remarkable woman,” Mr. Weiner said. “She’s not responsible for any of this. This was visited upon her. She’s getting back — getting back to work. And I apologize to her very deeply.”Mr. Weiner and Ms. Abedin have seemed an unlikely couple from the start. They come from very different backgrounds — he is a Jewish man from Brooklyn, she a Michigan-born Muslim-American raised in Saudi Arabia by an Indian father and a Pakistani mother. And Mr. Weiner and Ms. Abedin have very different personalities.He is a fiery, publicity-craving wisecracker with a reputation as a Romeo and a habit of turning up in the tabloids. He can be overbearing and intense and pushes his staff and himself unrelentingly.She is calm, private and glamorous, with a sense of elegance that has earned her attention from fashion magazines. Her close friend Oscar de La Renta designed her chiffon wedding gown, likening her to Scheherazade, the beautiful queen from “One Thousand and One Nights.”But they complement each other well, said friends of the couple, who described Mr. Weiner as a sweet, supportive partner. Ms. Abedin, a practicing Muslim who speaks fluent Arabic, does not drink, and Mr. Weiner has given up alcohol in solidarity with her, they said. He sometimes fasts with her during Ramadan, and often meets her at the airport when she returns from long trips, even in the early morning hours.Friends say that Ms. Abedin had been courted by “a lot of very successful, important people,” but it was Mr. Weiner’s persistence and tenacity, as well as his confidence and sense of humor, that eventually won her over.“I kept on hearing stories of how adoring he was of her and how much he cared about her, and over time it became clear that this was something he was focused on, and it was for real,” said a friend of Ms. Abedin, who asked to remain anonymous because he was commenting on a personal matter. Ms. Abedin got her start in politics in 1996 as an intern in Ms. Clinton’s White House office, and has been her aide since. She and Mr. Weiner met when Ms. Clinton ran for the Senate in 2000, but did not start dating until Ms. Clinton ran for president 2008.At their wedding, Mr. Weiner’s robust premarital dating life was the subject of considerable roasting, and Mr. Weiner made it clear Monday that Ms. Abedin knew about his rakish past, including his use of social media for sexual communication.'"

"'11-06-07,'0','He said that Apple’s upgrades were not necessarily a death sentence for the affected developers. “It doesn’t make those apps obsolete, but challenges them to push their apps one step further than Apple’s,” he said.Developers were putting a positive spin on what Apple’s news might mean for their businesses.Steve Martocci, one of the founders of the company behind a group messaging application called GroupMe, said Apple’s plan to introduce a messaging service called iMessenger positions the two companies as rivals. But Mr. Martocci said he did not see Apple as a direct competitor because GroupMe users are not required to have an Apple device, as with iMessenger.He said the company might even integrate iMessenger into its service: “It could potentially be another way for our users to consume and send messages.”Besides, he said, upgrades due next month will add new features that will broaden the app’s appeal.Marco Arment, creator of Instapaper, a popular service and app that lets people save articles online to read later, said he was not unnerved by the news that Apple was planning to release a similar feature in Safari, its Web browser.“I don’t see it as an evil move or a rip-off,” he said.Mr. Arment said he was confident that his service, which includes social networking features that let people see what their friends are saving to read, was distinct enough to keep his customer base growing.“They didn’t clone the entire app,” he said. “It’s a very small subset of what the application does.”Mr. Arment, who sells his application for $4.99, said he hoped Apple’s new feature would draw attention to the usefulness of such a service. “My biggest problem isn’t convincing people to buy my application; it’s communicating what it is to them,” he said. “If Apple shows people it’s useful to save things to read later, it could really help me.”Mr. Arment, who said that there were close to two million people using Instapaper, said the Safari feature could be a boon to his business.“Fewer than 1 percent of iOS users have downloaded Instapaper,” he said, referring to the Apple operating system. “If I can capture even a sliver of the entire iOS market, that’s all I need to keep my business going.”'"
"'11-06-07,'0','The workout was Animal Kingdom’s last before the Belmont Stakes, where he will try to avenge his Preakness loss to Shackleford in the oldest and longest leg of the Triple Crown. In fact, it will be just the 22nd time that the Derby and Preakness winner have squared off in the grueling mile-and-a-half race, known as the Test of the Champion.It looks as if a field of 11 others will line up and try to spoil the rubber match between Animal Kingdom and Shackleford. One of the most dangerous, the Derby runner-up Nehro, had his final timed tuneup Monday morning as well.With the exercise rider Cesar Garcia aboard, Nehro ran a half mile in 50.88 seconds and galloped out five-eighths of a mile in 1:04.17, both significantly slower than Animal Kingdom. Nehro’s owner, Ahmed Zayat, said he was not worried, however, because his colt was fresh after skipping the Preakness and was bred to relish the Belmont’s trying distance.“I wish the race was tomorrow,” Zayat said of Nehro, who also has runner-up finishes in the Louisiana Derby and the Arkansas Derby. “We’re ready and we will have no excuses. At a mile and a half, you’re going to see a different horse. That’s the final word. We’re ready.”Perhaps more important than the speed and fitness Animal Kingdom displayed in his workout was the lesson Velazquez was able to administer as they worked in company with Corredor Dela Isla.In the Preakness, Animal Kingdom had a slow start and was bothered by the storm of dirt kicked in his face. It forced Velazquez to drop him back even farther from the pack so the colt could gather himself, which the jockey now says left Animal Kingdom far too much to do in the stretch run.So in the opening stages of Monday’s workout, Velazquez parked Animal Kingdom directly behind Corredor Dela Isla so the colt could prepare for any kickback during the Belmont.“I wanted to put him behind the other horse, and I was almost clipping heels,” Velazquez said.Animal Kingdom took the hardship in stride. Once Velazquez moved him alongside his stablemate, the colt motored on.The Belmont will be Animal Kingdom’s fifth race in nearly three and half months, but Velazquez says his colt is still fit and growing.“He had me at hello,” Velazquez said, quoting from the film “Jerry Maguire.” “He knew he had the jockey on top of him because he just played with me. I was surprised at how strong and professional he was. I thought I might have to urge him on the gallop-out, but he did it all on his own.”'"
"'11-06-07,'0','In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has stepped up production by an estimated 200,000 barrels a day, or roughly 2 percent, after lowering exports in April. The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, recently suggested that OPEC would raise output to meet any increase in global demand, although a formal change in the allotment of production quotas for each member is still in doubt.The only fireworks at the meeting are likely to be over possible competing Libyan delegations. The government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi says it will send a representative, even though its top oil official, Shukri Ghanem, recently defected and some OPEC members are actively supporting Libyan rebels.The global market is not short of oil, but inventories are dropping around the world and leading benchmark prices continue to hover at or above $100 a barrel.The International Energy Agency, the advisory organization for industrial countries, has appealed to OPEC to raise production, going so far as to hint that Western countries could release strategic reserves onto the market if needed to stem rising prices.“Oil prices are hurting the economy,” said Fatih Birol, the agency’s chief economist. “I hope to see more oil in the markets soon.”But OPEC’s ability to meet the growing demand appears to be limited. Libya’s 1.3 million barrels of daily oil exports appear to be lost for as long as the civil war grinds on. Production in Venezuela has been diminishing for years. And the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have already increased production so much that they have limited spare capacity left.That leaves Saudi Arabia’s estimated spare capacity of 2.5 million to 3 million barrels a day as the sole significant source for increased OPEC production. Much of that oil, however, would be less-desirable heavy crude that many refineries cannot easily handle.“OPEC has limited options,” said David L. Goldwyn, until recently the State Department’s coordinator for international energy affairs. “The more Saudi Arabia increases production, the less reserved spare capacity exists. Less available spare capacity also makes markets nervous and can defeat the benefits of a production increase.”Oil prices have eased in recent weeks amid more signs of global economic weakness and relative calm in Saudi Arabia, Algeria and other important producers.But the region is far from stable. Unrest in the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain has sharpened sectarian divisions in Iraq, and Iraqi oil installations have experienced attacks in recent months. Syria’s 150,000 barrels a day of oil exports are in jeopardy because of spreading violence.Yemen’s 260,000 barrels a day of production has been virtually halted because of strikes and pipeline bombings. A complete breakdown of order will make it more likely that the country could serve as a base for terrorist attacks on oil facilities in neighboring Saudi Arabia or on the nearby Bab el Mandeb shipping lane, through which an estimated 3.7 million barrels a day of oil passes, according to Middle East experts.“Yemen is a wild card,” said Helima L. Croft, senior geopolitical strategist at Barclays Capital. “It could be the failed state in the middle of the gulf and it threatens the stability of the largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia.”'"
"'11-06-07,'0','Dan Poynter, an author who took a recent trip to New York City to attend BookExpo America, said he had changed his travel habits because of taxes. In 2010, Mr. Poynter said, he stayed for more than a week when he attended BookExpo, But this year, after seeing how high the hotel taxes were, he cut his visit in half.“I was shocked when I went to check out and saw that they tacked on like $49 a day in taxes,” he said. “I just don’t want to spend the money and give it to New York City when they’re gouging us.” The tax on hotel rooms in New York City is 5.875 percent, plus $2 per room for the bed tax, plus 8.875 percent in combined city and state sales tax. In Mr. Poynter’s case, his hotel room last year cost $313 a night plus a $27.78 sales tax, $18.39 in city taxes, a $2 occupancy tax and a $1.50 Jacob K. Javits Convention Center tax.New York City’s taxes on visitors, in fact, ranked second in the nation in a study published last year by the Global Business Travel Association. The highest taxes in the association’s list of 50 destinations were levied by Chicago. There, the combination of hotel room, rental car and restaurant taxes in the city center are estimated to cost travelers an average of $38.75 a day.By contrast, visitors to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., would pay an average of $21.22 in daily taxes if they stayed in the city center.The bed tax, the largest component of the total taxes borne by visitors, is usually used to finance the development or expansion of convention centers and to market the destination. Doug Ducate, president and chief executive of the Center for Exhibition Industry research, says a convention center is typically a municipality’s largest expenditure. Cities issue bonds to pay for construction of new convention centers or expansions of existing centers, and the bed taxes help pay the cost of the bonds.In 2009, when the recession cut into business travel and convention bookings slowed markedly, travel tax receipts around the country also plummeted. Even Las Vegas, a city that has weathered previous recessions relatively well, struggled. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which markets the city and operates the Las Vegas Convention Center, earns 80 percent of its revenue from bed taxes, its president and chief executive, Rossi Ralenkotter, said.“We saw a decline not only in our visitor counts, but our convention counts as well as the average daily rate,” he said. “Our budget declined $67 million over two fiscal years,” he added, even with a recent countywide hotel tax increase, because that money was earmarked for other purposes.In recent months, the tide has been turning. Mr. Ralenkotter said the average daily room rate rebounded by 10 percent in the first quarter of this year, and visitor numbers had increased as well.Even if Las Vegas could have raised its hotel tax to make up the difference, it might not have wanted to. Higher hotel taxes can have drawbacks for cities. Raising taxes too high can make a destination less attractive, especially for large event bookings or price-wary groups. For this reason, cities are sometimes cautious in escalating taxes on out-of-towners. San Francisco contemplated raising its 15.5 percent hotel tax by an additional two percentage points last year, but rejected the measure after vociferous criticism from local businesses.High taxes on airfares, combined with fuel surcharges, have created another burden for travelers, especially those taking trans-Atlantic flights, Robert Mann, an airline industry consultant, said. In fact, passengers who seek lower prices by flying multiple carriers may wind up paying more in taxes than those who book through a single carrier, Mr. Mann said, because taxes and fees are generally levied at the point of origination. Two one-way tickets means two originations, which could potentially mean two sets of additional charges.Some American travelers near the Canadian border even drive to airports in Canada to find some relief from high taxes. “I think there are some folks who fly through Toronto, for example,” Mr. Mann said. “It can sometimes be less expensive than some of the U.S.-imposed taxes, especially for international journeys.”'"
"'11-06-07,'0','But the efforts were especially apparent at a hearing last month in Washington related to derivatives. Some of the most powerful players in the derivatives market — which is closely controlled by just a small group of banks — argued that the government should allow a slow pace of changes for rewriting derivatives contracts.On Monday, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, spoke about the Dodd-Frank rules in a speech in Atlanta, warning that there were efforts by groups that oppose the reform to starve regulators of the resources they need to put new rules in place.“Those in the U.S. financial community who are supporting these efforts to block resources and appointments are looking for leverage over the rules still being written,” Mr. Geithner said.He specifically focused on derivatives rule-writing, where some financial groups have complained that European rules may differ from the new rules in the United States. He said he hoped regulators in Europe and Asia would create standardized rules to prevent a “race to the bottom.”Regulators in the United States overseeing the process say it is difficult to tell how many of the concerns that financial executives and their lobbyists raise are valid and which ones are exaggerated.“For us, it’s a question of figuring out the legitimate interests of folks who say, ‘Wait a minute, slow down’ because they really want us to get it right, and some of them who really have an ulterior motive of just running the clock out,” said Bart Chilton, one of the three Democratic commissioners of the commodities futures trading agency, which is overseeing most rule-writing for derivatives. “It’s going a lot slower than I had envisioned.”Financial firms argue that slower deliberations may lead to smarter outcomes. Some lawmakers agree, and some voted in recent weeks in Congressional committees to delay derivatives rules at least a year. Many of those rules were to have been completed by the July anniversary of the Dodd-Frank bill.Regulators have been swamped by public comments and asked for more funds and personnel to meet the demands. In April, the C.F.T.C. extended all of its derivative comment periods for a month.“Right now there’s a tacit truce on the deadlines,” said Margaret E. Tahyar, a partner at Davis Polk, which represents financial institutions. “Really, it’s the right thing to have a little bit more time on this. There really hasn’t been anything like this ever before in terms of rule-makings.”Perhaps nowhere are the stakes higher for the megabanks than with derivatives, which insure against many different risks in the economy. Some of the Dodd-Frank rules center on increasing security and transparency in this $600 trillion market. For instance, many are related to clearinghouses, which provide a central repository for money backing those wagers. Some of the changes threaten to cut into banks’ lucrative profit margins.At the derivatives round table in May, bankers and other representatives of financial firms asked for substantial implementation periods on derivatives rules. For instance, Athanassios Diplas, of Deutsche Bank, said the bank would need 18 to 24 months “simply to sign documentation” related to the new rules because of “bandwidth” issues, according to a transcript from the event.He said, “If you think about it even in man-hours or man-weeks or whatever, one client — an attorney can do 100 of these a week, which sounds pretty aggressive — we’re talking about 800 man- weeks.”Stephen O’Connor, an executive from Morgan Stanley, came up with an even more lengthy estimate, saying his clients say it could take an entire day to renegotiate contracts and that could mean “100 man-years worth of effort.”One Goldman Sachs banker, R. Martin Chavez, said that documents on valuing derivatives represented “a mind-bendingly difficult problem you could fill libraries with, with very boring Ph.D.’s on that topic.”One panelist was quick to argue that the bankers were trying to stall the rules. James Cawley, the chief executive who runs an electronic trading operation called Javelin Capital Markets, jumped in, saying, “We don’t think we are putting men on the moon when it comes to documentation.”Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Goldman did not make these bankers available for interviews.Two of the commodities agency’s commissioners, Scott O’Malia, a Republican, and Gary Gensler, the Democratic chairman, attended the round table, with Mr. Gensler leaping out of the audience periodically to pose questions. Afterward, Mr. O’Malia said he disagreed with critics who say “this is a delay tactic.”“The panelists made it very clear they need months, not years,” he said in a speech at the Heritage Foundation.Mr. O’Malia called the agency’s extended comment period “a natural pause.” Mr. Gensler said in an interview that the extension was a good move but that “the American public is not protected until we finalize these rules.”One way that banks can delay progress is by haggling within industry associations over small turns of phrase in legal agreements. The banks lately have been clashing with large customers, like hedge funds, in discussions of new paperwork needed for dealing with trade rejections, situations in which derivatives trades do not go through because of client financing problems. Late last month, JPMorgan Chase was supposed to host a meeting to discuss it, but lawyers for large banks canceled the meeting at the last minute. The banks, large customers say, drafted the documents in ways that favor the biggest banks because it would make it more difficult for customers to use a large number of banks for trading.The issue of whether new documents or rules give advantages to just a handful of banks is particularly relevant because the Justice Department and the European Commission have been investigating this market for antitrust behavior.'"
"'11-06-07,'0','Several makers of children’s vaccines announced Monday that they would lower prices in the world’s poorest countries, a move that could save donors billions of dollars and help bring the vaccines to more children (above, a polio vaccination in Congo).GlaxoSmithKline cut the price of its rotavirus vaccine by two-thirds. Merck offered to do the same with its cervical cancer vaccine and to reduce the cost of its rotavirus vaccine by an unspecified amount. Indian companies like the Serum Institute and Panacea Biotec said they would cut their prices on a vaccine protecting against five diseases.The announcement — made jointly by vaccine manufacturers and the GAVI Alliance, which collects donor money — comes in anticipation of a pledging conference in London next Monday at which GAVI hopes to raise at least $4 billion.It also comes 10 days after the United Nations Children’s Fund — which actually orders and distributes the vaccines bought by GAVI — for the first time publicly posted the prices it paid each year for the last decade. That revealed wide disparities in prices charged by manufacturers and showed that prices drop when Indian competitors enter the field.Daniel Berman, deputy director of the global access campaign for Doctors Without Borders, said the cuts “will really make a difference.” He did not know how much Unicef’s disclosure influenced the cuts, but said donors have a “growing awareness” of paying unnecessarily high prices.'"
"'11-06-07,'0','“Everything happens automatically, and there is nothing new to learn,” he added.At the center of iCloud is a new version of iTunes that will allow users to download on any device any song they have ever bought. Songs on a person’s iTunes library that were not bought from Apple can be added for $25 a year, Mr. Jobs said.The iTunes in the Cloud service is available now. The other iCloud services will be available in the fall, when Apple releases the new version of its mobile operating system, iOS 5.The iCloud service also works with documents, apps and photos through a new service, Photo Stream, that automatically uploads photos taken with an iPhone or iPad. And it will replace MobileMe, a failed $99-a-year service that allowed people to synchronize their calendar, e-mail and contacts across devices.At the event, other top Apple executives showcased new versions of the Macintosh and iOS operating systems, which include scores of new features. But most attention was on the iCloud services, which analysts and industry insiders said would have more lasting impact on consumers, and were superior to and reached beyond those of competitors.“This is a milestone in computing,” said Mike McCue, a veteran Silicon Valley executive who now heads Flipboard, a popular news app for iPhone and iPads. “The fact that you no longer have to think in terms of files and folders is a big deal.”Mr. McCue said that while other services, like Dropbox, allow users to access files across devices, Apple’s solution is simpler. “It doesn’t feel like a techie thing at all,” he said.Others said they worried that iCloud would strengthen the position of Apple, which has long been criticized for controlling its mobile devices too tightly. Although some of iCloud’s features will work with non-Apple PCs, the service will tie Apple’s gadgets more closely together, giving the company more power to dictate terms to developers and users.“The new services from Apple are a step in the right direction but only if all your devices are Apple devices,” said Ben Drury, chief executive of 7Digital, a digital music company in Britain. “Their platform is essentially closed and proprietary — customers are forced into choosing Apple for all their devices.”A linchpin of iTunes in the Cloud, as the new music service is called, is that Apple has reached deals with the major record labels and music publishers to license their recordings. Amazon and Google offer similar music services.But because those two companies did not obtain licenses from the labels, users have to upload their own music libraries — and any new song purchases — to the Web before they can access them on other devices. The process can take hours, if not days, for people with large collections.By cementing the deals with the music industry, Apple can save users that time-consuming step. What is more, Apple, which is already the world’s largest distributor of music, is expected to find a ready audience in its millions of iTunes users, virtually guaranteeing that its service will leapfrog the offerings from Amazon and Google.“Yes, Google and Amazon get to say that they were first,” said Mike McGuire, a media analyst at Gartner. “But what often happens to the people who were first is that they get the arrows in their backs.”Mr. McGuire said Apple’s service was superior. “When you buy something new, it’s now automatically on all of your devices. You don’t have to think about it,” he said.The new mobile operating system features include services that make it easier to post items like photos on Twitter, and a Newsstand service where people will have access to all their newspaper and magazine subscriptions. Apple is also revamping the iOS camera, its Safari browser and e-mail software.Apple is reducing the price of its new Mac operating system, to $29 from $129 and adding features. That new operating system will automatically save all documents that a person is working on, and will bring the flavor of Apple’s mobile devices to the Macintosh.For instance, a new Launch Pad service displays applications in small icons much as they appear on an iPad, and the trackpad recognizes additional multi-touch commands that are common on Apple’s touch-screen devices. The new Mac operating system will be available in July.As on previous recent occasions, Mr. Jobs, who is on medical leave, appeared gaunt Monday. The crowd of about 1,500 Apple developers, who lined up around a city block to enter the Moscone Center West in downtown San Francisco, cheered wildly when Mr. Jobs walked onto the stage.And while he did not address his health, when a person in the crowd shouted, “We love you,” he responded, “It always helps, and I appreciate it.”'"
"'11-06-07,'0','TAL RABIN: Even when we do make it to the conferences, I think that there is still something different about the way that we promote ourselves.I remember standing next to one of my co-authors, and he was talking to some other guy, and he was telling him, “I have this amazing result. I just did this, I just did that.” And I was sitting and thinking there, what result is he talking about? Until he got to the punch line. It was a joint result. It was a result of mine also. I would have never spoken about my result in the superlatives that the guy was speaking about it.MS. KOLATA: What would you have done?DR. RABIN: I would have said, you know, “I have this very interesting result, and we achieved very nice things.” But not “This is the best thing since we invented the wheel, and here it is.”DR. APRILE: I think I wouldn’t do it as nicely as you.DR. KING: But women can help each other out a lot in this way because we know this about our younger women colleagues. We can introduce them to our colleagues. We can say: “Diane has a fabulous result. She needs to tell you what it is, and don’t move until she has told you.”JOY HIRSCH: There is one very important component here that is worth raising, and I think that is the need for institutional procedure and commitment to bring women on board. When I was at Yale, I was the chairman of the Status of Women Committee for a long period of time. During that time Yale as an institution had a major commitment to raise the visibility and the numbers of women, and we did exactly as you described without a compromise at all in quality. It is not that we just teach our women to be self-promoting and to be excellent. We must also, I think, take the responsibility of teaching our institutions to be receptive and proactive and even aggressive in this manner.DR. APRILE: And it is not just the top. It should also be the colleagues and the ones closest to you. You have to have women involved in search committees.MS. KOLATA: So what you are describing, as I understand it, is getting a lot of people into the beginning positions. But then how do you keep them?DR. KING: I think the choke point is going from a postdoc to an assistant professorship to a tenure-track position. In my experience the largest remaining obstacle is how to integrate family life with the life of a scientist.MS. KOLATA: And you have advice for women?DR. KING: At institutions where there is child care on site, where it is subsidized, where there are enough places for assistant professors to have their children, women do well. And at institutions where it is assumed that you will make your own arrangements, women do less well. There is good data on this. We need institutional commitment.DR. APRILE: It is by example that young women see that you can be both a successful scientist, the best, but also the best mother and the lover, and the wife. You can do everything, so I think you need to have more examples of those.DR. HIRSCH: I think it is important to develop a style in the laboratory where these issues are open and can be talked about. And what happens is that men become involved too.MS. KOLATA: It must be exciting for your children to grow up with a mother who has such passion for what she does.DR. APRILE: It depends on the child. The second of my daughters used to say, “Mommy, why can’t we have dinner at 6 p.m. like everybody else?” They finally accepted these crazy hours that I had to live with.DR. RABIN: I am a child of a working mother. My mother was a very high-ranking lawyer in the Israeli Department of Justice, and I think she is the best mother in the world. And what I can say about her is that although she worked long hours, she was always available to me when I needed her. So somehow I think it is easier for me, because I can go and work without the guilt, because I know you can be a great mother. Whether I am or not is a different question.DR. HIRSCH: The great discovery for me was the middle of the night. It’s all done, and everybody has gone to bed. You can go to your computer and sit down and work. The middle of the night has been what saved my life as a scientist.DR. RABIN: What I do feel as a mother is that sometimes I hear these young women graduate students talking. They are saying, “Yes, the baby is going to be born, I am going to be back doing research within a week,” and so on. And I think that one important thing to remember is that these children are going to grow. And if you miss out on their babyhood and then childhood and so on, these times are gone. You should think how to balance these things and get the research done but not forsake these things that are never coming back. The research is going to be there two years down the road, three years down the road, but there are things that are very precious that should not be missed out on.MS. KOLATA: Would you encourage your daughter to be a scientist?DR. KING: My daughter is now 36. Both her parents are scientists — her father is an ecologist and I am a geneticist — and she said that she was not going to be a scientist, that the life was just too tough or too grueling. She went to Brown, and she did linguistics. Loved it. Now she works for the Berkeley Humane Society and organizes huge projects for them — writes grants, organizes large groups of people doing work. So in many ways, there is not that much difference between her daily life and my daily life.DR. HIRSCH: I think the judgment about whether someone should be a scientist or not is a very serious one, because the life of a scientist, whether you are a woman or you are a man, is very difficult. It is a nonstandard life. It is a life with constraints and obligations that don’t come with other types of professions. If my daughter has to ask “Should I be a scientist?” the answer is no. But if my daughter says to me, “I was born to be a scientist. I can’t be anything else. This is my life,” then you say, “You go, girl.”DR. APRILE: I couldn’t have said it better.DR. RABIN: The truth is that I feel differently. I think that the life of a scientist is a fantastic life. I think it is exciting because every day there is something new that you can go and think of. There are challenges, no doubt, and the times when you can’t solve things. So I think it is all a wonderful life. And not to mention even things like time flexibility, traveling around the world, meeting a lot of exciting people. I think that these are fantastic jobs.I did not grow up with this feeling that, yes, I am going to be a scientist. In fact, in Israel you have to register, you have to apply to a specific school that is not liberal arts. I was good at math. I said, O.K., computer science. And things evolved with time until I knew that this was the path that I wanted to take, and it was also a little bit dependent on the successes that I had that kept me going. So sometimes I think at the onset it is not 100 percent sure, but it evolves.DR. APRILE: I kind of disagree, honestly, at least in my field, in my life. You have to be very tough, and this is a very hard life and you are always exposed. You have to be extremely strong. You have to face the competition. If one of my daughters were really dying for being a scientist, there would be no question I would support them. But if I have to encourage them, to push them in that direction, there is no way.DR. HIRSCH: I think it is important to look at this from the point of view of the field of science. It is very important that diversity be represented in the field of science. And so from the point of view of the science — not our daughters — then I think it is necessary to have women and a woman’s point of view. Her ability to collaborate, her ability to think differently, is important for the trajectory of the field. But I really agree with you, Elena. You have to be tough. You have to be made of steel.DR. HIRSCH: Yes, thank you. I hope it is not everybody’s experience, but it has been mine, and I say that from the point of view of a very successful woman. I have been made of steel, and thank heavens, because I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t.DR. RABIN: But this is something that I feel has developed in me. I do not think that I was this warrior that I am today when I started out in the field. I am like that today, but I wasn’t like that when I was 20.DR. APRILE: Even if they are not scientists, these daughters of ours, they have had the best example in their life, and they will carry that example and that passion that they see in us, in me and you, with them. And so you never know what will develop along the way. And if they don’t practice science directly, they are going to change the world in other ways. Just because they have had the examples they have.DR. KING: They will change the world. They don’t have to do it our way.'"
"'11-06-07,'0','“We think users should be aware of this disturbing campaign,” he said.Google officials had said last Wednesday that hackers in Jinan, a coastal city in eastern China’s Shandong Province, had sought to gain access to the Gmail accounts of hundreds of American government officials, Chinese political activists, military personnel, journalists and Asian officials. The attacks used a polished version of a rudimentary technique, called spear phishing, to trick recipients into revealing their e-mail passwords. American officials said they had no evidence that any confidential information was breached, or even that many people fell for the attack.In January 2010, Google tied hackers in the same city to a more sophisticated and wide-ranging assault on its computer systems. The company has not suggested that the Chinese government was behind those attacks, though speculation to that effect has been widespread, particularly since the company’s services have been plagued with unexplained disruptions.In the days after Google’s latest accusation, Chinese users of Gmail and the popular Google Maps service have seen connections slow to a crawl, while the same services used through private networks have remained trouble-free.Chinese officials have attributed Google’s service problems to technical issues that do not involve the government, and they have denied any government role in hacking Google computers or e-mail accounts. On Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson called hacking a criminal activity and said that China also suffered attacks by hackers.Google has lost significant share of the market over the last few years, as it suffered both hacking attacks and government censorship of its Web searches. The company moved its search operations last year to uncensored servers in Hong Kong.After commanding more than a third of China’s market for online searches in 2009, Google saw its share decline by the first three months of 2011 to 19.2 percent, a 2 percent drop from the last quarter of 2010, according to the Chinese research firm Analysys International.The biggest beneficiary of Google’s losses appeared to be Baidu, a Chinese Internet portal.China’s state-owned mobile-telecommunications companies also have dropped Google’s mobile search service for competing products.Google nevertheless has said that its revenues from mainland China operations are increasing year over year. The company considers its biggest opportunity in China to be display advertising and selling ads to Chinese companies that appear on Web sites outside China. The company has more than 500 employees in China and hundreds of business partners.'"
"'11-06-07,'0','More than half the people in a small Iowa town fled on Monday as the Army Corps of Engineers worked to build an emergency levee to hold back the rising Missouri River, officials said.The Missouri is expected to reach record levels in the next few weeks because of melting snowpack in the Rocky Mountains, heavy rainfall and releases of water from upstream reservoirs in Montana and North and South Dakota.On Sunday, the river temporarily breached a levee in Atchison County, Mo., leading the authorities to direct about 600 residents in low-lying areas of Hamburg, Iowa, to leave within 24 hours. The Red Cross set up a shelter at a nearby high school.The levee was repaired Sunday evening after National Guard troops in a Black Hawk helicopter dropped 22 half-ton bags of sand to shore it up, said John Benson, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.“It appears at this point that they’ve got it stopped,” Mr. Benson said on Monday.But as a precaution, the Corps of Engineers was building a makeshift berm on Monday to back up the levee in case it failed or was topped by water, officials said.Water levels in the Missouri and some tributaries have been rising for weeks. Flooding has already occurred in Montana and the Dakotas and along the Platte River in Nebraska.The corps plans to increase its release of Missouri River water from the Gavins Point Reservoir on the South Dakota-Nebraska border from the current 110,000 cubic feet of water per second to 150,000 cubic feet of water per second on June 14, officials said. That will relieve pressure upstream and cause the Missouri to crest near Hamburg about June 20, said Kristopher Lander, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service.'"
"'11-06-07,'0','“I don’t have a tick-tock on the different actions that different members of the administration took in support of this nomination,” Mr. Carney said in response to a question from a reporter. “We strongly supported it. We thought he was highly qualified. We regret that it’s come to this and he’s withdrawn his nomination.”The withdrawal leaves two empty seats on the Fed’s seven-member board, which, along with selected presidents of the Fed’s regional banks, sets monetary policy. The position of vice chairman for supervision, created last year as a top bank regulatory post, also is vacant.President Obama has not nominated a head for the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees national banks, or a new chairman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits and cleans up failed banks. There is no nominee to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The White House has said for months that it will submit nominations “as soon as possible.” On Monday it promised action “in short order.” It is widely expected to nominate the F.D.I.C.’s vice chairman, Martin J. Gruenberg, to replace Sheila C. Bair, who ends her term as chairwoman in July. Mr. Gruenberg, seen as relatively noncontroversial, could be packaged with other nominees in the hope of a halo effect.Democrats say that they hold Republicans responsible for preventing votes. In addition to derailing Mr. Diamond, Republicans forced the withdrawal earlier this year of a nominee to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and have said they will not allow a vote on any nominee to lead the consumer agency until the bureau is restructured.There are also strategic considerations. A senior White House official said that the Obama administration had to weigh the costs of trying to pressure Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, to push for cloture votes in the face of Republican opposition.“We could go for a symbolic cloture vote. It would burn 30 hours on the clock. That’s 30 hours that the Senate is in session. So it’s a big ask of Harry Reid to say ‘put aside your legislative agenda and go for a cloture vote,’ ” the official said.Mr. Diamond focused his criticism on Republicans in a sharply worded opinion article published Monday in The New York Times. “We should all worry about how distorted the confirmation process has become, and how little understanding of monetary policy there is among some of those responsible for its Congressional oversight,” he wrote.Mr. Diamond said that Republicans were mistaken to treat his expertise in labor economics as irrelevant to decisions about monetary policy. “Understanding the labor market — and the process by which workers and jobs come together and separate — is critical to devising an effective monetary policy,” he wrote.Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee, reiterated on Monday his belief that Mr. Diamond had lacked the necessary qualifications.“It is my hope that President Obama will now nominate someone capable of garnering bipartisan support in the Senate,” Mr. Shelby said in a statement Monday. “It would be my hope that the president will not seek to pack the Fed with those who will use the institution to finance his profligate spending and agenda.”Mr. Shelby added that he had great respect for Mr. Diamond and wished him the best.The Fed board of governors has long been populated with a mix of people including lawyers, bankers and economists with a wide range of specialties. Mr. Shelby himself has voted for a labor economist on at least one previous occasion: he supported the 1994 nomination of Janet Yellen, now the Fed’s vice chairwoman.But the nomination became a proxy for a broader fight between the White House and Congressional Republicans over the government’s role in the economy. Mr. Diamond publicly supported a continuing Fed program to stimulate growth by purchasing $600 billion in Treasury securities. Mr. Shelby and other Republicans described the program as a backdoor method of lending the government more money.'"
"'11-06-07,'0','“There’s usually no issue with credit or income qualifications,” Mr. Varchola said, “so it’s just a lot smoother.”On the Upper East and West Sides, he said, there is strong interest from families for apartments with several bedrooms. His downtown clients, who typically work in the creative industries, tend to value location and design over space and even amenities, he said, and expect Sub-Zero or Viking appliances and remote-controlled sound systems and window coverings.Other five-figure rentals offer a number of amenities. At 15 Broad Street in the financial district, James Cox of Prudential Douglas Elliman is marketing an apartment he described as being at the “low end of the high-end rental.” At $12,000 a month, the two-bedroom apartment has almost 1,900 square feet of interior space, but its real draw is the 1,200-square-foot terrace with sweeping views of Lower Manhattan, Midtown and beyond. That, and the building’s extras, like a single-lane bowling alley, basketball court, gym and pool in the basement and a billiards room, party space and parklike common terrace on the seventh floor that offers a full-frontal view of the frieze over the New York Stock Exchange.As prices rise, so do the expectations, said Dennis R. Hughes, a senior vice president at Corcoran Group Real Estate. For about $20,000, he said, he was able to find one client, a divorced businesswoman moving from a town house, a 2,300-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment in TriBeCa with outdoor space and views of the Hudson River. For $45,000, a renter could have a 4,500-square-foot, five-bedroom apartment in a prewar doorman building on Fifth Avenue with a spa in the basement.And for $85,000, Prudential Douglas Elliman is marketing a full-floor loft at 25 Bond Street with 7,326 square feet inside, five bedrooms, six and a half baths, fireplaces and terraces. It even comes with a movie star, Will Smith, staying just below.But all that pales in comparison with the most expensive rental listed in the city, a mansion at 4 East 80th Street that is available, furnished or not, for $210,000 a month. The house is a 35-foot-wide French Gothic limestone with more than 18,000 square feet of space just off Central Park. Paula Del Nunzio, the Brown Harris Stevens agent marketing the house, said the biggest worry in finding a tenant was not the income requirements (about $8.4 million to $9.5 million, going by the industry standard of 40 to 45 times the rent), but the way a resident might treat the house.“You would check and be sure they had other homes in other places of similar magnitude, that they would be quite accustomed to that kind of environment,” Ms. Del Nunzio said.Despite the stratospheric price tag, the rent is, in an extremely narrow sense, a bargain. The house, built for a Woolworth daughter and more recently owned by the health club entrepreneur Lucille Roberts, is also for sale at $90 million. Assuming a 20 percent down payment and a 30-year fixed loan at 5.5 percent, it would cost $408,808 a month, before insurance and taxes.“You could look at it that way if you wish,” Ms. Del Nunzio said. “The thing is, what it’s really about would be instant gratification, and instant status — instant presence in New York.”'"
"'11-06-07,'0','More Americans are praying about their health, researchers have concluded.Scientists analyzed data on 30,080 adults ages 18 and older who took part in the National Health Interview Survey in 2002 and on 22,306 adults who participated in 2007.Forty-nine percent of adults said in 2007 that they had prayed about their health during the previous year, up from 43 percent in 2002. In 1999, only 14 percent of survey participants said they had prayed about their health.Among those least likely to pray were people who exercised on a regular basis; researchers speculated they may not have had any health concerns. Those with higher incomes were also less likely to pray.According to the analysis, published in the May issue of the journal Psychology of Religion and Spirituality, the use of prayer has increased in recent years among adults of all ages. Women, black people, older and married individuals and those whose health status had changed — for better or worse — were more likely than others to pray. People with episodes of depression and dental pain also turned to prayer at high rates.“We were surprised,” said Amy Wachholtz, director of health psychology at University of Massachusetts and co-author of the paper. “Our best guess is that it has to do with 9/11, but that’s an untested hypothesis. There doesn’t seem to be any other primary, overwhelming issue that would have so globally affected people.”'"

"'11-06-08,'0','British Airways has agreed to pay $89.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit charging that it had conspired with other airlines to fix prices for hauling cargo.Two Chilean carriers — Lan Airlines and Lan Cargo — and Aerolinhas Brasileiras of Brazil also agreed to pay $66 million to settle similar accusations, according to Hausfield, the law firm that brought the cases and announced the settlements. It said it has now settled with 11 airlines around the world, for a total of almost $434 million. Other settlements were reached with Lufthansa for $85 million and Air France-KLM for $87 million.The British Airways settlement covers actions from 2000 to 2006. The settlement still needs approval by a federal judge in New York. British Airways did not immediately respond to a request for comment.An affiliate of the law firm is suing British Airways in London. The firm said that litigation is not affected by the settlement in the United States.The accusations also resulted in a broad criminal investigation. So far, 21 airlines including British Airways have agreed to pay fines totaling more than $1.7 billion. Nineteen executives have been charged with wrongdoing, and four have gone to prison.In November, the European Union fined 11 airlines — including British Airways — a total of $1.1 billion for fixing prices on international cargo, leading to higher prices for businesses to move their goods. The European Commission, the European Union’s competition watchdog, said “the carriers coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts” from December 1999 to February 2006.'"
"'11-06-08,'0','Does this sound too elitist for the average American? Remember when the idea that millions of people would spend $5 for a latte seemed absurd?Todd Carmichael, the founder of La Colombe Torrefaction in Philadelphia, said that TSG officials told him that they had bought 90 percent of Stumptown Coffee Roasters and wanted to expand in the specialty coffee businesses and eventually sell the businesses to a company like Nestlé, Coca-Cola or Starbucks.Jeff Dreyfuss, who owns the Metropolis Coffee Company in Chicago with his son Tony, said a TSG official told him that the highly regarded roasters like his “had everything but were undercapitalized, and that his group had a lot of capital that they had to use quickly.”According to Mr. Carmichael, Alexander S. Panos, the managing director of TSG who has been spearheading its specialty coffee push, said that the company had a $900 million fund.Independent coffee companies could use some of that cash. The high-end coffee scene is expanding — it’s never been easier to find a beautifully crafted cappuccino made with small-batch beans and local milk.But the costs of making a great cup of coffee have never been higher. The index price for high-quality Arabica commodity beans was 62 cents a pound in 2001; last year, it was $1.96 a pound; on Monday, it was $2.77. Beans for these high-end coffee bars can be $30 or more a pound.Adam Craig, an owner of Culture Espresso Bar on West 38th Street, has raised coffee prices once since the shop opened in 2009. Customers noticed. “Somebody came in and ordered the ‘I’ll have the 25 cents more than yesterday’s coffee,’ ” he said.At the same time, financing for expansion has tightened up.“If you want to grow your business you have to do it somehow, and if you can’t get a loan, you have to sell equity, unless you have a really, really well-off grandpa,” said James Freeman, the owner of Blue Bottle Coffee in Oakland, Calif. He said he’d met with two representatives from TSG in March, but would not say what they discussed.Neither Mr. Panos, of TSG, nor Duane Sorenson, Stumptown’s founder, would comment for this article. But in an interview last week about TSG’s investment in Stumptown, Mr. Sorenson said the investment would let Stumptown put even more into its coffees. “It’s really exciting because we have the resources to move forward and make great coffee,” Mr. Sorenson said. He said they planned to have two more coffee bars in Brooklyn, add a bottling facility there for cold-brew coffee and add roasters in Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.They were less forthcoming about long-term plans.But some in the coffee industry warned that investors and roasters might not share the same goals.“Any investment company is interested in return,” said Tim O’Connor, the president of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. “And that may not be where the coffee company’s greatest interest has been. There has always been that dynamic between the investment company wanting a return, and the coffee company wanting to do good in regards to the growers, the coffee and the customers.”'"
"'11-06-08,'0','There’s no denying the “aww” appeal of a man and an elephant walking down a street, hand in trunk. That is one truth in “One Lucky Elephant,” a sweet, heart- and trunk-tugging, modestly sized documentary — except for its 10,000-pound title subject — about a circus man and the wild animal he foolishly bought, helped to train, loved like a (captive) daughter and finally, tearfully, tried to do right by, mostly by letting her go.When David Balding met Flora, the African elephant at the center of this drama and the former star of his St. Louis circus, she was a baby. Born in Zimbabwe in 1982, she was orphaned at 2, perhaps during what is called a culling, the polite word for the organized killing of animals for population control. As it sometimes is on the harder questions, the documentary tends to be frustratingly vague on Flora’s origins, though the Web site for Mr. Balding’s circus, circusflora.org, states that she was orphaned by ivory poachers. Whatever the case, he bought Flora when she was still shorter than he and before long had her trained to stand on her head and lie down for the one-ring circus he helped establish in 1987.By the time Flora was a teenager, Mr. Balding, realizing that she would probably outlive him — African elephants can live up to 70 years — decided that he needed to find her a new home, no easy task. In 2000 Flora performed for the last time, an event documented by the director Lisa Leeman. (The filmmakers learned about the retirement through Miriam Cutler, the documentary’s co-producer. Ms. Cutler is the resident composer for Circus Flora and wrote the bouncy, whimsical score, suggestive of the cafe-jazz sound of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra.) After immortalizing that final performance, the filmmakers kept shooting, tagging after Mr. Balding for the next decade during his long, difficult goodbye to Flora.Mr. Balding is as much an attraction in the movie as Flora, and only somewhat less charming. He’s a big bear of a man, fuzzy and round, with obvious health issues — as the movie goes on, he uses a cane, crutches, a wheelchair and a motorized cart to get around — and a sympathetic screen presence. His fondness for Flora registers as entirely real and deep, whether he’s shooing her away as he talks to the camera — her trunk undulating around his body, she appears to be trying to pick his pockets in one scene, presumably for treats — or taking their last bow under the big top. His regret over adopting this majestic animal feels equally sincere, and it’s his remorse, as much as the shots of Flora in action, that impresses.There’s no denying Mr. Balding’s love for Flora, which at times threatens to overwhelm the movie, flooding it with tears when clear-eyed thinking — and by someone other than Mr. Balding — would be better. “One Lucky Elephant” is on the side of Flora and her captured kind, but it also hedges. Using a weave of original visuals, including talking-head interviews, along with stock footage, television news clips and archival photographs, it is an engaging, if shallow, 84-minute-long story about a man trying to right a wrong that the movie itself doesn’t adequately explore. Ms. Leeman includes some images of the young Flora being trained, for instance, but because Mr. Balding does most of the talking (in voice-over he admits that one trainer’s methods were harsh), the cruelty of the elephant instruction feels soft-pedaled.Flora is loved but, pace the title, it’s a stretch to call her lucky. Intent on entertaining you no matter how disturbing the material, Ms. Leeman perhaps doesn’t see it that way, which may explain why the movie bogs down in its last third, as Mr. Balding bickers with the sanctuary where he placed Flora. Animal people sometimes say the wackiest things, but here, alas, they never satisfyingly address the ethical questions of what it means to capture and keep wild animals. Happily, while this movie’s head may not always be in the right place, its heart is: it ends with an appeal to learn more at the movie’s own Web site, oneluckyelephant.com, where you can find a link to Ahali Elephants, a charity formed to help Flora.'"
"'11-06-08,'0','Sampler programs — bits and pieces from different artists — are a gamble for both presenters and audiences. Perhaps everyone will show the same kind of work? Perhaps all the lighting will be dim and the costumes brown? Perhaps the styles will be so widely disparate or obscure as to leave watchers with furrowed brows?The Gotham Dance Festival, presented by the Gotham Arts Exchange, has taken that gamble, presenting two weekends of sampler matinees during its two-week run at the Joyce Theater. The first batch had Kyle Abraham, Faye Driscoll and Gregory Dolbashian, all showing recent or new work. (Next weekend, Ashleigh Leite, Julian Barnett and Sydney Skybetter get their turn.)That’s a pretty good lineup, and Sunday’s matinee was frequently absorbing, and more entertaining than many contemporary dance experiences. Mr. Abraham, whose “Quiet Dance” opened the program, is always a commanding presence onstage, silky smooth in his transitions and impulses even when he’s lashing his arms, whipping his legs around his body or convulsing his torso. Dressed in dark blue, he moves alone like this, in silence, at the start of the piece before being joined by a quartet in light yellow.They echo his movements as slow, jazzy piano music (“Some Other Time” by Bill Evans) begins, but while Mr. Abraham joins them briefly, he essentially remains solitary. At the end, he reappears in yellow even as all the others have changed to blue. It seems a little schematic, and the choreography looks less compelling on the other dancers (all excellent), but it’s good to see Mr. Abraham, best known for his solo work, stretching his wings with a group.There’s a schematic aspect too to Mr. Dolbashian’s new “Like the Eagle,” a quintet set to sound bites of people talking about creative inspiration. The dancers are wonderful in the fluid, inventive mix of angling shoulders, quick turns and unexpected, off-balance partnering. But “Eagle” is often overly literal, with the dancers’ gestures matching the soundtrack, giving the piece a stolid air of didacticism.'"
"'11-06-08,'0','Woods’s situation is complicated by his history of injuries to the left knee and by the four operations he has had, most recently a major reconstructive surgery to his anterior cruciate ligament in June 2008. These factors could be complicating his ability to come back from the injury as quickly as he had hoped.The same is true of what he has called a mild strain to his Achilles’ tendon, which was ruptured in 2008.Woods will be replaced by the first alternate Michael Whitehead, a 23-year-old amateur from Sugar Land, Tex. Whitehead earned his spot at sectional qualifying Monday at the Dallas Athletic Club.“We are disappointed that Tiger Woods, a three-time champion, will not be able to play in the 2011 U.S. Open,” the U.S.G.A. executive director Mike Davis said. “We completely understand that he is not fully recovered from his injuries and we wish him a speedy recovery.” About an hour after the release appeared on his Web site, Woods wrote on Twitter: “Not playing in US Open. Very disappointed. Short-term frustration for long-term gain.”Just how short-term Woods’s frustration will be is open to conjecture, just as the picture was clouded by the way the injuries occurred — while hitting a golf shot. Woods had taken his stance in the pine straw next to the Eisenhower tree at the 17th hole in the third round of the Masters, with both knees deeply bent. He had some 200 yards into the green, and took a big cut at the ball. He made solid contact, but he slipped on his follow-through, and his knees appeared to spin out of the shot.This raises another question: is Woods an old 35? He missed the Wells Fargo Championship four weeks later and withdrew after nine holes of the Players Championship the next week.At a May 23 news conference from Aronimink Golf Club, Woods dismissed conjecture that he might miss the U.S. Open and said reports about the severity of the injury were overblown. It is now obvious that they were not.“It’s been a frustrating and difficult year, but I’m committed to my long-term health,” Woods said. “I want to thank the fans for their encouragement and support. I am truly grateful and will be back playing when I can.”For now, Woods’s absence from another major championship — this will be the third he has missed since the summer of 2008 — will make it increasingly difficult for him to reach his goal of breaking Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major championship victories. As recently as last week, Nicklaus said he still believed that Woods, who has won 14 majors, could do it.That was before Nicklaus, or anyone else, knew Woods would be out of the picture at Congressional, a course where he is the last person to win a pro tournament — the 2009 AT&T National.'"
"'11-06-08,'0','“We’ve said all along that we’d take a disciplined approach, where we could take a path to profitability,” Roberts said in a conference call. “It was responsible.”Still, Comcast is paying considerably more than Fox to keep the Olympics in the NBC family than General Electric did for the Vancouver and the Games. Neal Pilson, a former CBS Sports president, said, “I think Brian felt some pressure to validate the merger, and I think this also establishes that, as everyone felt, the Olympics were more important to NBC than they were to any other network.”ESPN and Fox bid as if they did not feel they had to win the auction. In a statement, ESPN said: “We made a disciplined bid that would have brought tremendous value to the Olympics and would have been profitable for our company. To go any further would not have made good business sense for us.”Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said Comcast’s winning bid was out of character for a company that has been “relatively cautious.” But, he added: “I think it’s fair to say that at this price, the Olympics are going to be a loss leader for Comcast and they will have a negative effect on short-term earnings. Still, strategically, it’s possible they can pay for themselves.”By combining NBC’s broadcast and cable networks with Comcast’s sports assets, which include the Versus sports channel, the Golf Channel and 11 regional sports networks, Roberts said he believed his Olympic could turn a profit. Mark Lazarus, the chairman of the NBC Sports Group, said that there were more ways to make an Olympic profit “than the old NBC was capable of doing.”NBC’s Olympic cable coverage has in the past been on the USA, MSNBC, CNBC, Bravo and Oxygen channels. The old NBC was personalized by , who ran the network’s sports division for nearly 22 years until resigning last month in a salary dispute that was the climax of a power struggle with Comcast executives. Ebersol had been critical to every Olympic bid since the acquisition of the rights to the 1996 Summer Games; he also engineered two pre-emptive bids within a few months in 1995 that brought NBC the rights to every Olympics from 2000 to 2008, at a cost of $3.5 billion to General Electric.The timing of Ebersol’s departure puzzled Barry Frank, an executive vice president of I.M.G. and a former Olympic negotiator. “Why would you let Dick Ebersol go, and a month later, buy four Olympic Games, when what Dick did best, better than anyone else, is produce the Olympics?” he said Tuesday.Clearly, Comcast felt it could could replace Ebersol in NBC’s executive suite with Lazarus, and replace Ebersol in the Olympic production control room with some of his disciples. Comcast is also ending Ebersol’s practice of tape-delaying many sports, especially the most popular ones, like and gymnastics, and more recently, , to build a four- or five-hour prime-time program.Even as NBC introduced online streaming, Ebersol nonetheless delayed showing some events during the 2008 Summer Games in and even more last year in Vancouver.But fans grew angry with NBC’s ways as they found it increasingly easy to learn the results of Olympic events, or watch events live on pirate Web sites. Lazarus said NBC felt it was time to make all events available live, to all coasts, on television, on broadband, and perhaps through other technologies.“We have a smart plan to let the superfan watch events live and not detract from prime time,” Lazarus said. “We don’t think that streaming will affect the shared experience of families watching together at night.”NBC will still have a traditional package in prime time, with taped and live coverage.Comcast did not reveal any production plans, but one addition to the lineup of networks, probably in time for London next year, will be Versus. Comcast’s hope is to use the Olympics as a way to raise its number of subscribers and the monthly fees they pay. “If you can add 20 or 30 million subscribers,” Pilson said, “and raise fees by 30 or 40 cents a sub, that’s significant money.”The auction began Monday with Fox’s presentation, which was followed Tuesday by ESPN’s and NBC’s pitches. After NBC’s presentation, all three networks deposited sealed bids in a plexiglass box. Fox dropped in four envelopes, ESPN put in two and NBC dropped in a thin envelope and a noticeably thicker one. The I.O.C. deliberated for several hours and did not tell ESPN and Fox they had lost until well after informing NBC of its victory.What I.O.C. officials saw inside the envelopes were the details of the Comcast/NBC bid: $775 million for Sochi, below the $820 million paid for the money-losing Vancouver Games; $1.22 billion for Rio de Janeiro in 2016; $963 million for the 2018 Winter Games — which will be in ; Pyeongchang, , or , — and $1.41 billion for the 2020 Summer Games.“We were blown away by the NBC presentation and the passion the team has for the Olympics” Richard Carrion, the I.O.C. member in charge of the auction, said in the conference call.But he added, “I’d be less than honest if I said the dollars didn’t come into play.”'"
"'11-06-08,'0','LONDON — The News of the World formally apologized to the actress Sienna Miller on Tuesday for systematically, and illegally, intercepting her cellphone messages in the mid-2000s and using the information to publish articles about her private life.The apology comes as part of a settlement between Ms. Miller and the newspaper, which also agreed to pay her £100,000 in legal fees and damages, about $164,000. It is the latest development in a long-running drama in which the newspaper has had to contend with growing evidence that its practice of hacking into the cellphones of public figures, politicians and celebrities was widespread and pervasive.At least four other people who say their phones were hacked into have reached out-of-court settlements with the newspaper; numerous lawsuits against it are still pending. The newspaper has offered to settle with at least seven other possible victims of its phone-hacking practices.For several years, News of the World said that its phone hacking had been limited to a single case — that involving its former royals editor, Clive Goodman, and a private investigator hired by the paper, Glenn Mulcaire, both jailed in 2007 for illegally intercepting voice mail messages of members of the royal household. But that claim began to lose credibility as more evidence came to light, and this year the company admitted that it had hacked the phones of eight public figures, including Ms. Miller, in the mid-2000s.Meanwhile, the police are conducting a criminal investigation. Two News of the World editors and a reporter have been arrested in connection with the case.'"

"'11-06-09,'1','Wade Corbett, a certified rink rat, likes his water frozen and his skate blades sharp. As director of the skating school at Sky Rink at Chelsea Piers, Mr. Corbett, 64, coordinates lesson programs for aspiring skaters from “age 3 until death,” his way of saying that, with the proper instruction, anyone can learn to skate. He laced up his first skates at 25 at the original Sky Rink in Midtown. He lives on the Upper West Side with his “significant others,” two cats.Dance fever: My mother sang in a gospel choir, and my brother and sister had a music act they performed at amateur hour at the Apollo Theater. When I saw the dancers at the Apollo, how they moved, I decided right then I had to become a dancer. It was 1958 and I was about 11.Ballet lessons: My mother brought me to the International School of Dance at Carnegie Hall; it was 10 lessons for just $15. God bless the ’50s. I studied classical dance and performed with the International School, but I was not a prima. And then I started to have back problems from lifting too many girls who loved their ice cream!I tried acupuncture, chiropractors, you name it, but I pretty much gave up dance. I had a job as a bookkeeper at United Cerebral Palsy on 34th Street.A misstep: I had never been skating in my life, but when I was about 25 a friend from Toronto who played hockey suggested we go to Sky Rink. It was a night session at Sky Rink, and the moment I glided onto the ice and started moving, I thought, Hey, I can do this! I saw some skaters doing pirouettes and decided to try one. I planted my toe pick and that was the last thing I did for several months. It was the worst fall I’ve ever had. I told my friend, “I’m never doing this again!”Back to the rink: But as soon as I felt better, I went back to Sky Rink and learned how to skate right. My first coach was an associate of John Curry. I would describe my style as artistic, not flashy. My best jump was the double flip. In 1989, I left Cerebral Palsy to be a full-time skating instructor at Sky Rink.'"
"'11-06-09,'1','Online piracy is a huge business. A recent study found that Web sites offering pirated digital content or counterfeit goods, like illicit movie downloads or bootleg software, record 53 billion hits per year. That robs the industries that create and sell intellectual products of hundreds of billions of dollars.The problem is particularly hard to crack because the villains are often in faraway countries. Bad apples can be difficult to pin down in the sea of Web sites, and can evade countervailing measures as easily as tweaking the name of a Web site.Commendably, the Senate Judiciary Committee is trying to bolster the government’s power to enforce intellectual property protections. Last month, the committee approved the Protect IP Act, which creates new tools to disrupt illegal online commerce.The bill is not perfect. Its definition of wrongdoing is broad and could be abused by companies seeking to use the law to quickly hinder Web sites. Some proposed remedies could also unintentionally reduce the safety of the Internet. Senator put a hold on the bill over these issues, which, he argued, could infringe on the right to free speech. The legislation is, therefore, in limbo, but it should be fixed, not discarded.The bill defines infringing Web sites as those that have “no significant use other than engaging in, enabling, or facilitating” the illegal copying or distribution of copyrighted material in “substantially complete form” — entire movies or songs, not just snippets.'"
"'11-06-09,'1','Scott Brown, a veterinarian at Pfizer Animal Health, said that Pfizer’s own studies of 3-Nitro had all found it safe, but that the F.D.A.’s trial led the company to suspend sales of the drug while Pfizer did a “full scientific assessment” of the drug. That assessment will also include another smaller-selling arsenic-based feed medicine called Histostat, or nitarsone, that was not studied by the F.D.A. and whose sales have not been suspended.“Inorganic arsenic is cancer-causing, and action on this drug is long overdue,” said Dr. Michael K. Hansen, a senior scientist with Consumers Union.Each year, the United States produces $45 billion worth of broiler chickens, the kind used for meat — about 37 billion pounds in 2010, according to the Agriculture Department. That equals about 80 pounds a year for each American, according to the National Chicken Council, which represents major companies like Perdue and Tyson. Georgia, Arkansas and Alabama are the biggest producers.Richard Lobb, a spokesman for the chicken council, said 3-Nitro was used widely “but certainly not universally” by the industry. Mr. Lobb said that questions about roxarsone’s safety had been raised in the past but “we’ve always been able to show that there’s really no reason to be concerned about human health.”Environmentalists have long been concerned that the waste from chickens treated with roxarsone, when used as fertilizer on crops, causes arsenic to leach into water supplies and estuaries. Even cattle are exposed, since chicken litter is sometimes included in feed.About 90 percent of roxarsone’s use is in chickens, although the product is also used to a more limited extent in turkeys and swine, said Dr. William Flynn of the F.D.A.’s Center for Veterinary Medicine.The F.D.A. once routinely conducted its own studies of animal and human drugs, but limited budgets led the agency to eliminate much of its scientific and laboratory capacity over the years. The roxarsone study is a triumph for agency scientists but one unlikely to be repeated very often. The agency asked for $183 million in additional funds for food safety efforts next year, but House Republicans have instead proposed cutting $87 million.“This is exactly the kind of thing we try to direct research efforts towards,” Dr. Flynn said.Roxarsone is still approved for use in chickens and swine in Canada, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam and in poultry only in Chile, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Brazil, Australia, Pakistan and Jordan.Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, proposed legislation in 2009 banning roxarsone. “I’m relieved the decision was made to make our poultry safer and healthier and hope the F.D.A. will take the final step and ban roxarsone altogether,” Mr. Israel said.Pfizer has promised not to resume sales of the drug until it has resolved F.D.A. concerns about it.'"
"'11-06-09,'1','The work — a monotype print titled “Le Marché” (“The Market”) — had hung in the small Museé Faure in Aix-les-Bains until the day someone spirited it out of the building. Ms. Davis bought it four years later from the gallery in Texas, J. Adelman Antiques and Art Gallery, which had taken it on consignment from Emil Guelton.Nearly two decades later, when Ms. Davis’s print appeared in Sotheby’s catalog with an estimate of $60,000 to $80,000, the Art Loss Register contacted the auction house to tell it that the print had been stolen. The French police reopened the case and, according to court papers, showed Mr. Guelton’s photograph, along with others, to a museum guard who had been on duty that day in 1981. She identified him as the thief. The United States government then brought the successful forfeiture claim against Ms. Davis. The print is now in the possession of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and officials could not say when the work might be returned to France.The museum guard, Jacqueline Rivollet, came to the United States to testify in federal court that she had been a “meter and a half” from Mr. Guelton on the day of the theft. She looked him in the eye as he entered the museum, she testified, and later she saw him run down the stairs and emerge from the stairwell with something under his jacket. The print was discovered missing later that day.Ms. Davis’s lawyer, Barbara Hoffman of New York, said she did not find Ms. Rivollet’s identification credible because, among other things, the guard had once described the thief as being in his 20s, but Mr. Guelton would have been 40 at the time of the theft. The photograph that Ms. Rivollet was shown to help identify him was taken in 1998 when he was 58, she said.Mr. Guelton has not been prosecuted for the theft by French authorities, Ms. Hoffman said. “He’s living on a boat in the South of France and has a pied-à-terre in Paris,” Ms. Hoffman said.The prosecutors who brought the case, from the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, declined to comment on Mr. Guelton’s legal situation.Ms. Hoffman said that a more valuable artwork was stolen from the museum the same day as Ms. Davis’s Pissarro, and French officials have not pursued that work with similar gusto. That piece, a Renoir oil painting titled “Buste de Femme,” sold at Sotheby’s in 1987 for $154,000 to a Japanese collector.Sotheby's said it was looking into the matter.Ms. Hoffman said that her client did significant due diligence at the time she bought the print, contacting an expert on Pissarro who authenticated it. No one suggested that it might be stolen. But because of the legal parameters of the government’s case, Ms. Hoffman said, she was not allowed to introduce that evidence in court.Ms. Davis, who is herself an artist as well as an interior designer, said she was very disappointed. “No matter how you look at it, I end up the loser, period, end of story,” she said. She added that she had had displayed the print in all her homes over the years — first in Texas and then in New York, where she lived for over a decade and worked for Ralph Lauren.“I went through a period of time where I really liked collecting art,” she said. “Fortunately most of my artists are still living, or were” at the time she purchased their work, “so there’s no problem with the title.”'"
"'11-06-09,'1','Kerouac, it seems, saw the making of the painting as a high point of his 1966 trip to Italy. According to Paul Maher Jr. in his 2004 biography of the writer, Kerouac wrote to his agent, Sterling Lord, that “apart from visiting the Vatican, singing poorly in a Rome nightclub and painting a Pietà with the Italian artist Franco Angeli in his studio, he did not see the sense in having gone to Italy at all.”Angeli too seemed to think highly of the collaboration, holding onto the painting — a composition of roughly sketched haloed figures congregating around a cross — until 1970 or so.“He didn’t want to sell it, he was very attached to it, but Franco always needed money,” said Armenia Balducci, the actress and screenwriter who bought the painting with her husband, Gian Maria Volonté, the movie actor and leftist, and kept it after they separated. (Mr. Volonté died in 1994.) It now hangs in the dining room of her home near Piazza Navona. “It’s certainly something special, a glimpse onto their sense of spirituality, perhaps.”Although both Angeli and Kerouac are known as anti-establishment figures, there is none of that in the Deposition painting, which is a traditional, if modern, representation of a well-known theme. But most people familiar with the men agree that its subject matter was likely chosen by Kerouac.“My father was an atheist, he came from a family of atheists, they were definitely not religious,” said Angeli’s daughter, Maria, who runs the Archivio Franco Angeli in Rome and said it was unusual for her father to paint such a spiritual scene. “He was very political and against symbols of any kind.”On the other hand Kerouac, who was born into a family of observant Catholics of French Canadian heritage, frequently turned to religious themes in his own paintings, of which there are hundreds, said Edward J. Adler, a former professor of painting at New York University and the author of “Departed Angels: The Lost Paintings,” which catalogs the works.“Al Aronowitz, a reporter for The New York Post in the 1950s, said that he’d interviewed Kerouac, who told him that if he hadn’t been a writer, he would have been a painter,” Mr. Adler said in a telephone interview. Kerouac’s notebooks at the New York Public Library are thick with “little sketches,” he added.Douglas Brinkley, a Rice University professor and the editor of Kerouac’s journals, said in a phone interview that “when he rediscovered his Catholic heritage, he embraced the iconography, drawing crucifixes and rosaries in his notebooks,” and painting popes.“Kerouac embraced the pageantry of Catholicism,” he said, adding that he also painted many Buddhas.For Kerouac, who sought comfort in God from a life riven by alcoholism and depression, religious themes like the Crucifixion and the Resurrection “were not a joke,” Mr. Brinkley said. “There is no blasphemy in Kerouac.”Angeli and Kerouac’s Deposition has captured the favorable attention of the Vatican, which last week published an article in its house newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, trumpeting the “fervent” Catholicism that also pervades much of Kerouac’s literary work. Sandro Barbagallo, the paper’s art critic, wrote that the painting “helps to further demonstrate the profound religious sensibility of the American writer who spent his life on an endless search.”'"
"'11-06-09,'1','“This is a $5 trillion business and if we fail to be serious players in the new energy economy, the costs will be staggering to this country,” said Hal Harvey, a Stanford engineer who was an adviser to both the Clinton and the first Bush administration and is now chief executive of the San Francisco-based energy and environment nonprofit organization Climate Works. Although the 2009 stimulus bill provided a burst of funding — $45 billion — that has now tapered off, he said, “We’ve let energy policy succumb to partisan politics.”The aggressive entry of Britain into the field over the last few years shows the power of government inducements to redesign a nation’s energy economy away from traditional fuel. The country’s Green Deal, as it is called, is currently being spearheaded by the Conservative-led coalition government. In Britain, reducing carbon dioxide emissions was one of the few policies supported by political parties of both the right and left, which both accepted that climate change was a serious problem and saw clean technology investment as a growth opportunity rather than an onerous obligation.“We are determined to harness the industrial benefits of the low-carbon economy ahead of the rest of the pack — we see it as a competitive advantage,” said Gregory Barker, Britain’s minister of state for energy and climate change. Last month, Mr. Barker led the first British green trade delegation to the United States; it included a wind energy company and a battery maker, but also Adnams Southwold, a famed brewery that now makes beer using less energy and water, and the Mark Group.President Obama has vowed a switch to cleaner energy, and some states, like California, have taken aggressive measures. But the current patchwork of government inducements remains generally insufficient as a draw for American companies and investors to jump into new fields like wind power, energy-efficient appliances or even mass-market insulation, because upfront costs are large and profits uncertain.Energy Department officials express frustration that they cannot do more at a crucial juncture without the support of Congress. Dr. Arun Majumdar, senior adviser to Energy Secretary Steven Chu, said that the department’s $5 billion budget for research should be tripled as it currently financed less than 5 percent of proposed projects. He said the country needed better low-cost financing methods to bring companies into the market, as well as stricter energy-efficiency standards to stimulate customer demand.“We want this ecosystem to grow and thrive like I.T. and biotechnology,” he said, adding he was “concerned” it would not. While he agreed the United States remained a hotbed of good ideas, he said, “in actual downstream deployment we are at risk of falling behind — we are falling behind already.”Of the three largest operators of wind farms doing business in the United States, only one, NextEra, is American. Iberdrola is Spanish and Horizon Wind Energy is a subsidiary of Energias de Portugal. Among manufacturers making components for the industry, just one American company, General Electric, is in the top 10. The others include Suzlon (India), Vestas (Denmark), Goldwind (China) and Enercon (Germany).Tighter energy-efficiency standards for machinery and appliances established in Europe, Japan and China have “primed the demand pump” for companies in those countries to develop innovative designs that use less energy than United States products, said Stefan Heck, head of McKinsey’s global clean technology practice. California is the only American state to adopt similarly high standards.With less ambitious targets for things like emissions reductions and far lower financial incentives than are common elsewhere, United States policies have had a lackluster incubator effect. The United States’ Energy Star Program, for example, offers homeowners who buy energy-efficient appliances or add insulation to their homes a tax credit equal to 10 percent of the cost — with a cap of $500.When David Slap recently hired the Mark Group to insulate his four-bedroom house in Penn Valley, Pa. — motivated by drafts and a fear of rising fuel prices — he paid over $5,000, all of it out of pocket.Contrast that to the subsidy program offered in Britain. Power companies in Britain have been required to progressively reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and this year 68 percent of that reduction had to come from subsidizing professionally installed insulation in customers’ homes. Low-income and elderly customers got the home improvements free. Others paid less than $1,000 to insulate a four-bedroom home, the full cost subsidized 40 to 60 percent. Residents recouped their investment in 12 to 18 months as fuel bills after insulation typically decreased 20 to 30 percent.“This policy framework allowed the industry to mature — we became cheaper, the quality improved,” Mr. Rumble said. The company developed a mobile infrared scanner operated from a van that could screen 1,000 homes an hour for heat loss as it cruised by.Other British initiatives included money for new offshore wind farms, payments to homeowners who generated electricity and heat with renewable power, and loans for installing rooftop solar panels that could be progressively repaid from savings on home energy bills.With its extensive experience in retrofitting homes in Britain, the Mark Group is expecting success in United States markets like Philadelphia, where the business is largely the province of small local contractors.Some federal incentives may be on the horizon, though many will require Congressional approval. The Energy Department has pressed hard for a new home energy score program that would rate homes for energy efficiency just as cars are rated for gas mileage; that rating would be available to potential buyers.Will United States companies be able to compete on the world market in the future?Not unless the country invests more in basic research in renewable energy and energy efficiency, said Emily Carter, a professor of energy and the environment at Princeton University. “If we don’t invest in ways to efficiently produce sustainable energy, then I worry that once we stop importing from the Middle East, we’ll simply find ourselves importing from China.”'"
"'11-06-09,'1','For the facelift to the first floor, which includes the kitchen, living room, dining area, office and a bathroom, they enlisted their son, who earned an architecture degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, a university in Zurich known for producing visionaries like the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.The planning involved over two years of family negotiations. The parents wanted to update the exterior to give it a new look; the son didn’t think it was necessary. The son wanted a sunken level; the parents thought it would be too complicated. “Even buying furniture was a democratic process,” said Pe Hadzimanovic, who is writing a book about architecture.The budget ballooned from an initial $100,000 to $200,000 (including furniture).Once the design details were complete, out went the gray carpeting, and in came the off-white Italian travertine stone bought in Zurich that “reflects light,” Mr. Hadzimanovic said. Now none of the rooms on the first floor are completely enclosed. The only interior door left is to the first-floor bathroom. In the white-walled entrance foyer, there is now a custom-made, two-sided closet of lacquered fiberboard that holds jackets and purses on the foyer-side, and books and files on the adjacent side, in an office. A rectangular opening 10-inches wide and 20-inches in height, carved into the closet, offers a peek onto the office, which is furnished with a Poul Henningsen PH Snowball lamp and an ochre-colored Eames fiberglass armchair. The cut-out, a motif employed throughout the house, is also aligned to give Mr. Hadzimanovic an unobstructed view down the length of the house onto the back garden while he works. (The cut-out has also turned into a cat door for the Hadzimanovics’ Russian Blue to easily slip into and out of the room.)Off the foyer is the kitchen, which Pe Hadzimanovic doubled in size, adding more than two dozen teak-paneled drawers and cabinets. He also installed a nearly 12-foot-long glass panel along one wall, one-and-a-half-feet high, to give a view onto the Cypress trees that skirt the side of the house. “I feel linked with nature when I’m in the kitchen,” said Ms. Hadzimanovic, speaking in Serbian. Another cut-out, a 20-by-20-inch square opening, is wedged between a new Electrolux range and Gaggenau wall oven, and also aligned to view the backyard.Next to the dining area, the living room is brightened with large glass panels that look out onto the back garden, with its manicured lawn and towering evergreens. Closest to the glass panes is a tan leather chair whose ultra-thin legs are made from the gas springs of a car (about $5,900), and an origami-inspired, laser-cut white metal floor lamp , both from the Zurich firm Strala. Six Eames Lounge Chairs from a.spring form a rectangle around a 19th-century prayer rug from Turkmenistan (about $9,400), bought during a mother-and-son shopping trip to Madayan Carpets in Zurich. Pe Hadzimanovic, who has penchant for tinkering even on iconic pieces, decided to fit each Eames chair with a dark veneer crafted by a woodworker in Germany.“We had had the velour sofa, the leather sofa — it was time for something different,” his father said. But of the Eames chairs, he conceded, “Perhaps they are too good, too special.”The chairs, however, were a minor issue compared with the renovation’s final stage.Last summer, Mr. and Ms. Hadzimanovic left for a three-month vacation on the Croatian coast, weary of the renovations. They gave their son carte blanche with the first-floor bathroom.When they returned, the couple found a new industrial-looking bathroom with a toilet centered in the middle with exposed pipes. (Friends have referred to the bathroom as the “Centre Pompidou.”)Ms. Hadzimanovic objected to the hard, black rubber floor, likening it to “the floor of a cheap train,” Pe Hadzimanovic recalled. His father was taken aback by the shower and sink handles, actually $60 green and red enameled hose valves from a hardware store. The son was eager to start work on the second-floor bathroom. But his father had an immediate reply: ""No, I’ve had enough of renovations for now.”Summing up her feelings about the overhaul, Ms. Hadzimanovic concluded: “I am very happy because it was done by Pe.”'"
"'11-06-09,'1','Mr. Crocker testified at a moment when Mr. Obama’s national security team is debating how many American troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan next month, the date set by the president for the beginning of force reductions after he sent 30,000 additional American troops to stop erosion on the American side in late 2009. Most of those forces were sent to the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar, both Taliban strongholds, where the United States was losing the war.In the months since then, the United States has had military success in both provinces, but in the mantra of commanders, the gains are “fragile and reversible” and they are nervous about risking what they have won by pulling out too quickly.At the same time, some White House officials have lost patience with the strategy and are urging a steeper withdrawal, particularly since ’s death in May and growing anger in Congress about the cost of the war.Pentagon officials said Wednesday that they expected General Petraeus to offer the president several withdrawal options, from high to low. The officials said that a low number would be 3,000 to 5,000 troops departing in July.Neither the military nor White House officials offered a high number, or, more important, said what the pace of withdrawals of the 30,000 surge forces might be. A separate agreement with the Afghan government calls for the departure of all foreign forces by the end of 2014, but that is not under debate right now.In preparation for Mr. Crocker’s hearing, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s Democratic majority staff issued a comprehensive review of American nation-building efforts in Afghanistan that painted a picture of poor planning and inefficiency.The use of much of the billions of dollars spent on aid projects has been ill thought out, the review said, while the efforts have drawn the best and the brightest Afghans away from government jobs, where they are badly needed.Too much money funneled into Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries in the world, has fueled corruption and waste, the report said. For example, one current program authorizes the payment of up to $100,000 a month to Afghan provincial leaders for local projects, which the reported called “a tidal wave of funding” that can be difficult to absorb efficiently and fairly.The State Department and the , known as U.S.A.I.D., now have about 1,300 civilian employees and contractors in Afghanistan, more than double the number, 531, in January 2009. The government “may want to consider a smaller civilian footprint,” the review suggested.Perversely, American financing is now paying some of the most talented Afghans “inflated salaries,” up to 10 times what they might make working for the Afghan government, and these high salaries encourage “a culture of aid dependency” while undermining efforts to improve the Afghan government, the review said.The report was not uniformly negative. The authors point to positive effects of the American aid program — a sevenfold increase in the number of children being educated, for example. But they question some central assumptions behind the nation-building work, specifically the notion that poverty, joblessness and lack of education have fueled extremism and insurgency.figures quoted in the report seem to contradict that assumption: Some of the most insurgency-plagued Afghan provinces, like Helmand and Kandahar, have relatively low poverty rates, less than 30 percent, while more peaceful provinces in central and northern Afghanistan have poverty rates as high as 58 percent, as in Balkh Province.“It is generally not the case that a lack of schools or roads drives conflict,” the report quotes Rajiv Shah, the administrator of U.S.A.I.D., as saying. “Often the situation is far subtler, having to do with local power dynamics or long-held grudges.”The State Department and U.S.A.I.D. now spend about $320 million a month in Afghanistan, for a total of $18.8 billion over the course of the war so far. That makes Afghanistan the single largest recipient of American aid, ahead even of Iraq. Even so, the aid figures are dwarfed by American military spending in the country.'"

Stocks have come under pressure recently because of several weak economic reports, especially the labor market.The weakness was highlighted by Mr. Bernanke’s comments late Tuesday. He acknowledged that the recovery has slowed, but offered no hint that the Fed was considering any more stimulus to accelerate growth.“Investors are repricing the slowdown after Bernanke crystallized it,” said Jason L.

"'11-06-09,'1','The owners, who are already derided here for spending money on luxury homes rather than on new players or security, were in danger of not meeting their payroll; indeed, it was considered something of a milestone when Mr. McCourt was able to meet his payroll at the end of May.A team that used to be associated with championships was mired in the middle of the National League West on Wednesday, struggling to get to a .500 record. Attendance has slipped so much that The Los Angeles Times ran a front-page article last week showing a picture of empty bleachers, with the headline “Dodgers’ fans are going, going ...”Can you blame Dodger fans for thinking that it’s time to send the bums back to ?“We go to games two or three times a year because of my affection for baseball,” Mr. Hamlin said. “I’d be very surprised if I go back this year. Very surprised. There are police officers on the field. There are police officers in the stands. The parking lot after the game made it look like watching the Mideast on television.”Mayor sighed when asked about the team he grew up with, attending the first games at Dodger Stadium and seeing players like pitch. “I think the entire city wants to get out of this purgatory,” he said. “I think everyone is frustrated.”Attendance this year is down sharply; through 31 home games to date, it has averaged 35,787, compared with 43,489 last season — the biggest drop in the major leagues, according to ESPN.com. And those numbers may be somewhat overstated, given that many season-ticket holders appear to be leaving their tickets in the drawer and staying home.Asked about all the empty seats, Josh Rawitch, a spokesman for the Dodgers, said, “We believe it is a number of factors.” He declined to elaborate.Many of them, though, are self-evident. The financial turmoil surrounding the McCourts means that the team is essentially bereft of the big-name stars who attract fans even to teams with losing records, which the were able to do with the pitcher Stephen Strasburg (at least until he hurt his arm last year). And it is tough being a losing team in any city.More than anything, though, the opening day attack and the police presence in the stadium since then have made baseball here seem like anything but a family pastime. Dodger fans say the days when the biggest hassle of going to a ballgame was plotting ways to avoid the traffic, no small challenge for a stadium on the edge of downtown, now seem almost quaint.Fans are beginning to draw unwelcome comparisons to the rough and threatening crowds that used to attend Raider football games before the team decamped to , Calif., in 1994, many of whom would sport gang colors and tattoos.“When I got here, Dodger fans were unbelievably different than the fans I knew from New York,” said Woody Studenmund, a season-ticket holder and an economics professor at Occidental College who was born in , N.Y. — home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame — and moved here 30 years ago.“They were polite, upbeat and seemed to make an effort to cheer even when good plays didn’t work,” Professor Studenmund said. “Until this sea of blue arrived, it was not surprising to see fights in the left field bleachers or other parts of the stadium. The whole crowd has become tougher.”There seems little reason for hope on this season’s horizon. The McCourts will probably be dislodged as owners, though no one knows when that might happen. No one knows, either, how long it will take the team to repair its bond with the city.“I think the damage is so severe that it will take many years to get past this,” said David Carter, the executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the . “They didn’t create the damage and ill will overnight. You have to go back and look at how amazing the Dodger brand once was. It will bounce back.”“But it won’t bounce back overnight,” he added. “I think fans are interested in just getting past this era and to the point where you can go to a Dodger game and just think about and talk about baseball.”'"

"'11-06-10,'0','Gov. Rick Perry has made no secret of his disdain for federal health reform or for one of its key tenets, a Travelocity-like state insurance marketplace in which consumers could choose from public and private health plans.The threat of Mr. Perry’s veto pen even derailed legislation by one of his fellow Republican “anti-Obamacare” colleagues, who fears that if state lawmakers do not implement a health insurance exchange of their own, the federal government will do it for them — in his view, an even worse fate.But among Mr. Perry’s gubernatorial peers, his stance on the health insurance exchange appears to be losing popularity: Politico reported last week that the Republican governors Haley Barbour of Mississippi, Mitch Daniels of Indiana and Scott Walker of Wisconsin are taking steps to comply with that piece of the law — even as they continue to oppose the federal health care program over all.Meanwhile, despite Mr. Perry’s stated opposition to a federally-mandated health insurance exchange and the state’s participation in lawsuits aimed at overturning federal health reform, officials at the Texas Department of Insurance acknowledge that since last fall, with the help of a $1 million grant from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, they have been working quietly to plan for a health insurance exchange.“We’ve been going full speed ahead on implementation, doing the due diligence so that we can be on time with what the law says,” said John Greeley, a spokesman for the agency.'"
"'11-06-10,'0','The gas-rich land of the Marcellus shale has offered some of the hottest wildcat real estate in recent years. But if Exxon Mobil’s recent $1.7 billion acquisition is any indication, the days of eye-watering prices are over. The oil titan is paying barely half the price such acres were fetching last year, as the frenzy has shifted to Texas. Cheaper real estate may even make gas assets look appealing again.Exxon is paying about $5,000 an acre by buying Phillips Resources and TWP, two private drillers in the Marcellus, which spans Pennsylvania, New York and West Virginia. This may not seem like such a steal when compared with 2006 prices of around $100 an acre. Even so, it does suggest that energy land values are coming off the boil.The property boom reached its peak when Chesapeake Energy doled out $17,000 an acre in early 2010, according to research from IHS. Mitsui and India’s Reliance Industries both paid $14,000 an acre in the spring of 2010. As recently as December, Exco Resources was willing to pay $9,000.There are good reasons the froth has come out of Marcellus. Gas prices have been in the doldrums and are running about a third their 2008 peak. Meanwhile, state regulators are taking a tougher line on hydraulic fracturing, supported by a skeptical public. This has sent energy firms flocking to the oilier Eagle Ford Shale, which is now experiencing a property boom of its own. Marathon Oil paid $20,000 an acre for oil-rich land in Texas earlier this month.But with less hype built into land values, the Marcellus is looking like a good bet again. The glut of gas that depressed prices is finally clearing. And because of its proximity to the New York market, gas from the Marcellus sells for a premium. Shell’s announcement that it is mulling a new petrochemical plant in the region suggests more demand may be on its way.'"
"'11-06-10,'0','Only a few of Williams’s prose pieces come close to matching the transcendent force of his best plays. The limits imposed by dramatic structure and spoken dialogue reined in his natural tendency for poetic bombast and symbolism. Despite the grittiness of its subject, “One Arm,” as a story, is essentially a lyrical allegory in which the third-person narrative is as dominant as that in a Grimm’s fairy tale.You can see why Williams might have thought the story, once too daring for mainstream consumption, would be appropriate for a movie in the late 1960s, when the sexual revolution was under way. But on the evidence of Mr. Kaufman’s stage version, Williams could never entirely bring sweet, anguished and hopelessly metaphorical Ollie down to earth.Set in the swinging ’60s instead of the more securely closeted ’40s, “One Arm” relies on a scene-setting (and theme-announcing) storyteller, a stone-broke writer named Sean (Noah Bean), whom Ollie meets in New Orleans. Sean speaks in passages lifted (sometimes whole) from the short story.“The loss of his arm had apparently dulled his senses,” he says of Ollie, adding, “Now he could feel no shame that green soap and water did not remove well enough to satisfy him.”It would take more than soap and water to wash away the cobwebs that cling to Sean, as a device and a character, and to Ollie’s well-worn path to a violent end. But the multipurpose cast members — who also include Todd Lawson, Christopher McCann and Larisa Polonsky — don’t overplay their naturally exaggerated roles. And the suitably chiseled Mr. Elder brings as much credible life as anyone could to a man of flawed marble.Designed as a world of shadowy ephemera by Derek McLane (set) and David Lander (lighting), the show has the right look for what is essentially a tone poem. The use of 1960s garb (by Clint Ramos) and music was probably a mistake, though. In that hedonistic decade, Ollie registers more clunkily than need be as a quaint and noble anachronism.Mr. Kaufman (the director of the current “Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo” on Broadway) made his name by combining the roles of archivist and dramatist with the superb “Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde” (1997), and a passionate researcher’s curiosity informed his “Laramie Project” (2000) and his “33 Variations” (2009), which starred Jane Fonda as a Beethoven scholar. Perhaps inevitably, “One Arm” is sketchier and hoarier than either of those works.For those of us interested in all things Tennessee Williams, “One Arm” delivers a couple of juicy bonuses, including a scene in which Ollie is picked up by a nurse (Ms. Polonsky) who has some of the enlivening eccentric fussiness of the great Williams heroines. And the climactic scene in which Ollie, in a prison cell, is visited by a divinity student (Mr. Lawson) speaks volumes about Williams’s compassion for fleshly frailty.I couldn’t help thinking of an earlier, better-known encounter between a man of the cloth and a whore, in the immortal W. Somerset Maugham short story “Rain” (which has been adapted for the stage and, many times, the screen). For the cold-eyed Maugham, that meeting and its disastrous consequences offered an occasion to attest cynically to human hypocrisy. In Williams’s hands, a similar clash of sensibilities becomes a keening paean to all the loves lost to fear, contempt and inhibition.By Tennessee Williams; adapted for the stage and directed by Moisés Kaufman; sets by Derek McLane; costumes by Clint Ramos; lighting by David Lander; music and sound by Shane Rettig; associate director/dramaturge, Jimmy Maize; dialect coach, Doug Paulson; fight director, David Anzuelo; dramaturge, David G.

"'11-06-10,'0','The very nature of putting on the epic “Ring” serves to announce an opera company’s creative values.There are some “Rings” that favor anachronism, like Stephen Wadsworth’s 2000 production for the Seattle Opera (scheduled to be remounted in 2013) with its robed characters cavorting amid picturesque pastoral landscapes. Meanwhile, the neon light-gashed, abstract version for the Los Angeles Opera in 2010, directed by Achim Freyer, exists at the opposite end of the aesthetic spectrum.The San Francisco Opera’s take on “The Ring” tries a multifaceted middle ground. This approach reflects the populist vision of its general director, whose tenure since 2006 has combined bringing in big stars like Placido Domingo and instituting simulcasts at the ballpark with occasional world premieres, like the coming opera about the Sept. 11 attacks, “Heart of a Soldier.”In contrast to the company’s solidly traditional previous production of “The Ring,” in 1999, which sought inspiration from the lushly Romantic landscape paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, the director Francesca Zambello’s relatively low-tech, character-driven new cycle — featuring set designs by Michael Yeargan and conducting by Donald Runnicles — has elements that are at once traditional and contemporary.The San Francisco Opera is trying to help modern audiences connect with Wagner’s complex work.“You can see this ‘Ring’ and get right into the mythology of it,” Mr. Gockley said. “It creates a bridge to the mythology that’s more familiar to our audiences today than the lofty gods with horns and spears.”Actually, Wotan, the head deity (played by the American baritone Mark Delavan) does carry a spear on stage, proving that some traditions die hard.But Ms. Zambello’s “Ring” breaks with custom and connects with audiences through its innovative use of multiple settings. Instead of unfolding in one time and locale, the action occurs over four distinct periods of American history.“Das Rheingold,” (which received a “preview” run in 2008) takes place in the Gold Rush era, partly in a cavernous gold mine where the power-hungry dwarf Alberich holds sway. For “Die Walküre” (which audiences saw in preview last season), the story moves to the boom-and-bust years of the 1920s and ’30s with Wotan presiding over a vast corporate empire. “Siegfried” picks up the story in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.“Götterdämmerung” is staged in a dystopian future. “It’s like ‘Mad Max,’ Ayn Rand and ‘The Handmaiden’s Tale’ rolled into one,” Ms. Zambello said.But the overall feel, with the emphasis on psychological realism, is one of approachability. Unlike the Metropolitan Opera’s in-progress production of “The Ring” directed by Robert Lepage, which has so far alienated many audience members by emphasizing cumbersome design concepts over the storytelling, Ms. Zambello “tells the story straight,” said Steven Sokolow, president of the Wagner Society of Northern California, one of around 150 fan clubs dedicated to the composer around the world.In this “Ring,” little separates gods from humans because of the intimate interactions between the characters. Wotan and his wife, Fricka (Elizabeth Bishop), go from being the perfect romantic couple in “Das Rheingold” to sworn enemies in “Die Walküre.” And the top god relates to Brünnhilde (Nina Stemme) like a soccer dad chastising his offspring for missing practice.But trying to be all things to all people comes with drawbacks.The production is unlikely to attract many “Ring” newbies with its hefty $120 price tag. And while bold approaches to “The Ring” often garner criticism, they also get people talking: opera buffs are still arguing over Patrice Chéreau’s 1976 version set in the Industrial Revolution.Ms. Zambello’s middle-of-the-road production may satisfy audiences and opera accountants today, but as any X-Games gold medalist knows, with less risk comes less reward.'"
"'11-06-10,'0','To the auditing industry, the fact that investors tend to blame auditors when frauds go undetected reflects unrealistic expectations, not bad work by the auditors. The rules say auditors are supposed to have a “healthy degree of skepticism,” but not to detect all frauds.“There is a significant expectations gap between what various stakeholders believe auditors do or should do in detecting fraud, and what audit networks are actually capable of doing, at the prices that companies or investors are willing to pay for audits,” stated a position paper issued in 2006 by the chief executives of the six largest audit networks.Note that last part. They suggested that if investors were really worried about fraud, they should consider paying more for a “forensic audit” that would have a better — but not guaranteed — chance of spotting fraud. Don’t like our work? Pay us more.There is no doubt that some companies are easier to audit than others, and that Sino-Forest falls on the harder side. While it has headquarters in Toronto and Hong Kong, its operations are — or at least are claimed to be — spread out over much of China. The company says it manages nearly two million acres in forest plantations across China. Muddy Waters says that is a lie, and that its actual operations are much smaller.Investors trying to decide whether to believe the Muddy Waters report, with its detailed assertion that the company’s claims are contradicted by Chinese records, would love to know just what Ernst did to check. What records did it inspect? Which tree plantations did it visit? Who did the work? Was it people from Ernst’s Toronto office, which signed the report, or people from a Chinese affiliate? How many auditors did the work, over what period of time?Ernst’s audit opinion does not say, which is no surprise. Virtually every audit opinion in the world says almost the same thing, with no details about the company being audited. Auditors are paid millions of dollars to produce a report that no one thinks is worth reading.On June 21, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which regulates auditors in the United States, plans to ask for public comments on whether to require auditors to do more and say more.One idea the board is expected to consider is requiring auditors to disclose more about what they did, and did not, do. Ideally, auditors would point to things that they could not audit. There are a lot of them now, and sometimes they are crucial.“The foundation” of the Sino-Forest fraud, stated the Muddy Waters report, “is its convoluted structure whereby it runs much of its revenues through ‘authorized intermediaries.’ ” Those organizations supposedly process tax payments owed to China on wood production, the report said, thereby assuring the company “leaves its auditors far less of a paper trail.”Auditors could be called upon to specify where they thought fraud was most likely in a given company or industry, and what they did to confront the risk. Investors could have a chance then of comparing the work of differing audit firms, as one firm disclosed it had checked something other auditors did not mention.If an audit was expected to call attention to possibly critical information that was not available to the auditors, perhaps there might be pressure from investors on companies to make that information available. In any case, investors could better understand what the auditors knew — and did not know — in reaching their conclusions.The problems with audits now go well beyond questions of fraud. A critical element for many banks is the valuation of securities that trade infrequently, if at all. There may be a wide range of possible estimates, and the auditor now must simply conclude the estimates are within that range. If so, it signs off.To make things worse, the estimates may have come not from the company being audited, whose work the auditor can examine, but from a pricing service that views its models as proprietary, making them virtually impossible to audit. That fact is something investors should know, but now do not.Nor do auditors disclose information about how reasonable an estimate is. In some cases, a wide range might be defensible, and investors have no way to know whether a company was particularly conservative or aggressive in its estimates. The oversight board may consider asking that companies disclose what they deem to be the range of reasonable estimates, and why they chose the one they did. Then the auditors could comment on that.If auditors enforced some consistency on ranges, then financial statements of different companies might be more comparable, even though they chose different estimates.The accounting oversight board is also expected to ask if it is time to end the “one grade fits all” audit model, in which every company is deemed to “fairly” present its results. Perhaps a second grade could be added, like “presents adequately,” for companies that push the envelope but do not violate the rules.In addition, auditors could be called upon to discuss the risks the company was taking. They could also be asked to call attention to some of the most critical disclosures in the footnotes, something that French auditors already do.If much of that happened, audit opinions could become a lot more interesting to read. Investors might actually learn something, and they might be able to form opinions about differences in audit firms.Another long-overdue change would be to have the lead partner on an audit sign the opinion in the annual report. Now, the firm signs, and investors have no way of knowing who was responsible. If an audit signed by a certain partner later blew up, that could be devastating to his or her career if investors shied away from any companies whose audits he later signed. Would that make auditors more careful? Perhaps.This week, as the controversy over Sino-Forest raged, Canadian regulators began an investigation and the company indignantly defended itself. “I have spent 17 years building Sino-Forest and I can promise investors we are not guilty of the charges levied against us,” said Allen Chan, the chairman. “Our financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young a leading international audit firm....”Its board appointed a special committee of three directors, all Canadians who served on the company’s audit committee and including a former Ernst partner, to investigate. The committee hired PricewaterhouseCoopers, another member of the Big Four.Investors seemed confused. After the plunge of last week, the shares bounced around on extremely heavy volume this week. They rose a bit on Thursday to 5.15 Canadian dollars ($5.26), but were still down 72 percent from the price of 18.21 Canadian dollars just before the charges were aired last week.Moody’s said it will review its ratings and “seek to assess the veracity of the claims” made by Muddy Waters. It gave details of what it would check.But Ernst was mute, unwilling to either defend its work or discuss how it had reached its now-questioned conclusion that the financial statements “present fairly” the company’s condition. Investors who relied on the audit will just have to wait.“It would be inappropriate to make any comment while the work of the special committee is ongoing,” said Amanda Olliver, a spokeswoman for the audit firm in Toronto. “In any event,” she added, “our professional obligations prevent us from speaking about client matters.”'"
"'11-06-10,'0','Mr. Simmons said they were negotiating with the lenders to restructure the loans. If the talks were successful, he said, they would put a “substantial” sum of money toward retiring some of the debt.“We are very close to a solution that works for the lenders and for us,” Mr. Simmons said. “We continue to maintain the property for the benefit of the tenants.”Riverton’s owners, Stellar Management and Rockpoint, declined to comment. They tried to restructure their loans by reinvesting as much as $40 million, said real estate executives who work with Laurence Gluck, Stellar’s chief executive. But after one of the lenders refused to go along with the deal, the senior lenders foreclosed last year, with the property’s value estimated to be less than half the $250 million debt.Harold Shultz, a senior fellow at the Citizens Housing and Planning Council and a former city housing official, said that both deals emerged in an era when investors stopped looking at complexes like Savoy Park and Riverton “as housing and started looking at them as commodities.” Mr. Shultz and others estimate that there are as many as 100,000 overleveraged apartments in the city’s working-class neighborhoods.“They mistook Harlem for Fifth Avenue and 79th Street,” Mr. Shultz said of the banks. “The only surprise is that it took this long.”Riverton, seven buildings with 1,232 units and a grassy courtyard, between 135th and 138th Streets, from Fifth Avenue to the Harlem River, was built in the late 1940s by Metropolitan Life Insurance as part of a “slum clearance” program led by Robert Moses. At the same time, MetLife built the larger Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village complexes north of 14th Street, but refused to rent those apartments to blacks and Hispanics. (The new owners of those complexes, Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock, defaulted on their loans in 2010 and relinquished control to lenders; they had not refinanced.)Despite its bitter roots, Riverton developed a cachet within Harlem and was home to tenants like Samuel R. Pierce Jr., a former secretary of housing and urban development; the jazz pianist Billy Taylor; and former Mayor David N. Dinkins. “It was the crème de la crème,” said Nellie Hester Bailey, director of the Harlem Tenants Council.Stellar and Rockpoint bought Riverton in 2005 for $132 million, with a $105 million mortgage. A year later, the partners refinanced Riverton, more than doubling the debt with $250 million in new loans.The new financing enabled the partners to repay the original loan, recoup their investment and establish $53 million in reserve money to cover renovations and any shortfalls in revenue, leaving them with an additional $60 million. But the rental income covered less than half of the debt service, and turnover was slow. They converted 10 percent of the apartments to market rates — not the 50 percent the owners had projected in loan documents. The complex’s default served as a warning bell on Wall Street for dozens of overleveraged apartment building deals.The main lender on the refinancing, Deutsche Bank, eventually packaged the loan with other mortgages as a commercial mortgage-backed security and sold it to investors. The use of mortgage-backed securities, many of them filled with bad loans, was a major contributor to the most recent financial collapse.CW Capital, which represents investors in the Riverton debt, took control of the complex last year. The company declined to discuss Riverton’s financial history.Delano Village, seven buildings with 1,800 apartments built in the late 1950s just to the north of Riverton, was bought by Vantage and AREA in 2006 for $175 million, including a $128.7 million mortgage. A year later, the new owners refinanced, nearly tripling the debt on the property to $367.5 million.The new financing allowed the partners to recoup their investment, repay the original mortgage and establish $87 million in reserve funds. That left the partners with about $100 million.Vantage, with AREA and other partners, was in the midst of buying more than $2 billion worth of apartments in Harlem, Washington Heights and Queens. It set about making improvements like a new security system, a new boiler and fixed-up brick work, and won state approval to recoup some of those costs over a seven-year period by raising tenants’ rents, as Riverton’s owners also did.Vantage, which was the operating partner at Savoy Park, also sent lease termination notices to roughly a fifth of its tenants, claiming that they were not entitled to rent-regulated apartments because it was not their primary residence, their name was not on the lease or they were in arrears on the rent.Tenants at Savoy Park and other Vantage properties complained to the attorney general’s office that Vantage was harassing them with false eviction claims. About 115 tenants who were sent eviction notices left Savoy before the cases got to housing court. Of the 158 cases that did go to court, Vantage was successful in evicting 44 tenants. The attorney general’s office, then headed by Andrew M. Cuomo, reached a settlement in 2010 with Vantage over the 9,500 apartments controlled by the company in which Vantage promised to change its policies and pay $1 million to tenants who had suffered harassment and to finance nonprofit organizations that provide free legal advice to tenants.As at Riverton and Stuyvesant Town, lenders extended large loans for Savoy Park based not on actual rental income but on income projections that turned out to be significantly overstated. According to Realpoint, a credit rating agency, the net cash flow at Savoy Park never rose much higher than $7 million, about a third of the annual loan payments. Realpoint estimates that the value of the complex has fallen to $98 million, and one executive familiar with the property suggested that it was now worth about $120 million — either way, far less than the $367.5 million in loans.Several tenants of rent-regulated apartments interviewed at the complex last month said that the owners were slow to make repairs and that carpets laid in the hallways by the landlord were infested with bedbugs. “Things are not good here,” said Valerie M. Orridge, a retired nurse who has lived there since 1959. She pays $870 a month for her two-bedroom apartment, and will pay $910 come August. “It’s just impossible to get repairs done.”But a newcomer, Mike Brown, had a different impression of Savoy Park. He moved into a one-bedroom, 600-square-foot apartment with two roommates two months ago and is thrilled with the place, especially when compared with the dingy apartment he had in Newark. The market-rate rent is $1,500 a month, and the newly renovated apartment has a laminated parquet floor, new GE kitchen appliances and a new bathroom.“I like the location,” Mr. Brown, 28, said. “Everything is clean. It has a nice vibe to it.”Mr. Simmons, one of the owners, said Savoy Park would not follow Riverton into foreclosure, and Neil Rubler, his partner, said that “deregulating apartments has never been a key component of our business plan.”But David Hershey-Webb, a lawyer who represents tenants at Savoy Park, scoffed.“Tripling the debt and deregulating go hand in hand,” he said. “That’s what sparked the speculation.”'"
"'11-06-10,'0','Now, three months later, the market is not so sure.“Investors used to think, ‘This is a utility. What’s the government going to do, let it fail and let Tokyo go without power?’ ” said Yasuhide Yajima, the senior economist at the NLI Research Institute, an arm of Nippon Life Insurance. “But now their confidence is completely shaken,” he said. “They’re racing to offload their holdings before the share price hits zero.”One cause for concern, analysts say, is the inability of a gridlocked government to complete a financial rescue plan for Tokyo Electric. To appease public anger over the disaster, the government has vowed to hold Tokyo Electric fully liable for the compensation claims that are likely to roll in from farmers, fishermen and others whose livelihoods have been disrupted in the crisis.A government plan drawn up last month places no limit on the company’s liabilities, even though Japanese law would allow for such a cap following natural disasters. But the plan, which must still be approved by a divided Parliament, also calls for a fund that would use taxpayer money to help Tokyo Electric compensate victims and continue to provide Tokyo with power, while avoiding insolvency. Under the plan, the company will eventually pay back the fund in full.The problem, analysts say, is that it is virtually impossible to know how large those claims could eventually be — and whether the government would have the means and commitment to cover them.In a recent estimate, Shigeki Matsumoto, an analyst at Nomura Securities, predicted the total would come to around 5 trillion yen ($64 billion), including 3.2 trillion to 3.3 trillion yen ($40 billion to $41.2 billion) in payout to farmers and fishermen — two years’ worth of agricultural and fisheries output in the plant’s vicinity. Nomura also projected 0.6 trillion yen in compensation to displaced families.A Bank of America-Merrill Lynch estimate puts the sum as high as $130 billion. (By comparison: BP’s compensation fund for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is $20 billion. )“Estimating damages at this point,” Mr. Matsumoto said, “is difficult.”Amid these uncertainties, Japan has resisted offering a blanket promise to back Tokyo Electric’s compensation payouts.The country already has a gargantuan public debt, which totals more than twice its gross domestic product. And raising taxes to pay for a bailout — or allowing the company to raise electricity rates to meet financial obligations — would be a tough sell for the fragile government of Prime Minister Naoto Kan. Investors fear the government may lean instead on Tokyo Electric’s creditors to ease the burden on taxpayers. Last month, Yukio Edano, the top government spokesman, spooked markets by suggesting that the banks that financed Tokyo Electric in the crisis’s early days could be asked to write off at least some of their debt, a measure some analysts equated with intimidation.Ratings agencies responded by slashing Tokyo Electric’s credit rating to junk status, to B+ from BBB.“Standard & Poor’s now believes that some politicians think banks should share the burden in some form, which may fall into our definition of default,” S.& P. said in a statement last week. “We now think such a scenario is more likely than previously thought.”The ratings agency said it viewed a default on the utility’s 5 trillion yen ($62 billion) in corporate bonds as less likely than a restructuring of its debt from financial institutions.Meanwhile, the head of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Atsushi Saito — who was once the president of a state-sponsored organization that assisted ailing companies, — shocked investors when he suggested in an interview last week with local media that Tokyo Electric should go through court-led restructuring, similar to the path Japan Airlines had taken since declaring bankruptcy last year.The spread on Tokyo Electric’s five-year credit-default swaps spiked to a record 1,150 basis points, up 200 basis points from last Friday, after Mr. Saito’s reported remarks. That spread suggests that it costs $1.15 million to insure $10 million of Tokyo Electric’s debt against default.The weak government is also clouding Tokyo Electric’s outlook. Mr. Kan survived a no-confidence vote last week, but only after offering to resign once the reconstruction was in full swing. But it is unclear when he would leave, who would succeed him, and whether any policies decided now would be honored by the next government.“The only certainty at this stage is that Kan will step down,” Cameron N. Umetsu, an economist at UBS, wrote in a note on Thursday. “Everything else still seems to be up in the air — hardly a confidence booster for those investors desperately seeking guidance.”In a sense, it is because Japan allowed Tokyo Electric to become too big to fail that it must now deal with the consequences of its potential demise. Led by Tokyo Electric, Japan’s 10 electricity companies have long resisted efforts to liberalize the market, leaving them with virtual monopolies in their respective regions.Tokyo Electric is Japan’s biggest corporate bond issuer, representing about 8 percent, or about 5 trillion yen, of the country’s 70 trillion yen corporate bond market. And because many of Japan’s largest banks hold shares in Tokyo Electric, they have already taken a direct hit from the utility’s difficulties.The Tokyo Metropolitan Government owns about 3 percent of Tokyo Electric’s shares, and the city’s finances have been thrown into disarray as share prices plunge and dividends are canceled.“It’s impossible to see where this is going,” said Mr. Yajima of the NLI Research Institute. “The government needs to take the lead and send clear signals, because markets won’t wait.”'"

"'11-06-10,'0','The Vision Festival, a hand-sewn New York institution now in its 16th year, presents avant-garde jazz as a form of religion, complete with saints and sacraments, a clergy and a congregation. The sheer range of music gathered under its umbrella — detailed compositions as well as top-to-bottom improvisations, in all manner of instrumental lineups — suggests a house policy of ecumenicalism. On some nights, though, the festival organizes itself around a single artist, yielding fully to his doctrine. (It’s usually a he.)Peter Brötzmann was that person this year: the recipient of a Vision Festival lifetime achievement honor and the main attraction at the Abrons Arts Center on Wednesday night. A German saxophonist with a history of Stateside collaboration, Mr. Brötzmann is famous — insofar as any European free-jazz musician can be famous — for a hardheaded, fulminating style devoid of any trace of bathos. Trying to describe it sends you grasping for overheated metaphors: blowtorches, hellfires, certain Congressional libidos.So he’s not someone you associate with the sacred. But here, anchoring three of Wednesday’s four roughly hourlong sets, he did embody an orthodoxy. His sound, on several single-reed instruments, was a constant instigation, brusque or shrieking, giving off tremendous rhythmic energy but rarely submitting to a tempo. He has abundant nonstandard technique, a vocabulary, but what impresses in his playing isn’t the execution so much as the force of presence. He recently turned 70, and he sounds almost invincible.He changed tactics and instruments often during his three sets, responding to the texture of each different band. But his voice as an improviser was recognizably the same as on one of his earliest and best-known albums, the free-jazz touchstone “Machine Gun,” which landed as a blunt provocation in 1968.The evening’s first ensemble resembled a two-headed beast, with Mr. Brötzmann joined at the front line by Joe McPhee and flanked by a pair of bassists, William Parker and Eric Revis. Their output was interspersed with meditative lulls, and Mr. McPhee, who played pocket trumpet as well as saxophone, presented a soulful contrast to Mr. Brötzmann. The set’s final stretch featured both on clarinet, over a light pizzicato bass vamp that evoked an African thumb piano, and while Mr. Brötzmann’s tone suggested a dull, rusted blade, Mr. McPhee’s was sharp and clear.'"
"'11-06-10,'0','JOHANNESBURG — After months of feuding, Somalia’s bickering leaders on Thursday agreed on a compromise that extends the transitional government for one more year but, at the same time, led to the dismissal of the popular prime minister.Hundreds of civilians — and government troops — immediately indicated their displeasure over the firing by setting huge bonfires and erecting roadblocks in the streets of Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu. Soldiers abandoned dozens of positions across the city, and civilians marched en masse through the bullet-pocked neighborhoods, waving pictures of Prime Minister Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. Many soldiers called him the only honest person in the government and said that under him they had been paid for the first time.“We have enemies, whom we have been fighting against every day at the front lines, but now we have got another enemy behind us, which is very disappointing,” said Omar Hassan Mohamed, a government soldier, alluding to the rivalries within the Somali government.The political squabbling started several months ago, when Sharif Hassan Sheik Aden, the speaker of Somalia’s Parliament, threatened to call elections in August. The mandate for Somalia’s transitional government, which is weak and survives solely on international support, was scheduled to end in August but Somalia’s president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, has refused to step down.Western powers seemed unsure what to do, because although Sheik Sharif has a reputation for being indecisive and ineffective, the United States and other Western countries have invested millions of dollars in propping up his government as a bulwark against Islamist insurgents who control much of Somalia. Susan Rice, the United States’ ambassador to the United Nations, recently threatened to cut off aid to the Somali government if the leaders could not solve this impasse.On Thursday in Kampala, Uganda, the impasse was broken when Sheik Sharif and Sharif Hassan agreed, in front of Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, to work together for one more year and to hold elections before August 2012.'"
"'11-06-10,'0','UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations nuclear watchdog voted Thursday to report Syria to the Security Council, citing Syria’s construction of a covert nuclear reactor and its failure to cooperate with investigators, diplomats said.The vote, supported by the United States and its European allies, coincided with growing pressure for the international community to condemn the violent crackdown by the Syrian government against pro-democracy protesters. United Nations human rights officials say reports suggest that more than 1,100 have been killed since March.With 17 votes in favor and six against, the 35-nation board of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency adopted a resolution rebuking Syria for failing to cooperate over the past three years with an investigation into Dair Alzour, a remote site in the Syrian desert which was bombed by Israel in 2007. American intelligence reports contend it was a covert reactor designed by North Korea and intended to produce plutonium for atomic bombs.Citing a lack of confidence that Syria’s nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and pointing to a history of concealment by Damascus, the I.A.E.A. resolution says that the destroyed Dair Alzour site was “very likely a nuclear reactor and should have been declared by Syria.”The 15-member Security Council has the power to rebuke Syria by urging it to cooperate with the I.A.E.A. and imposing sanctions against the country, as it has done in the case of Iran’s nuclear program. But Russia and China, two veto-wielding members of the Security Council, voted against the resolution, underlining international divisions over how to approach Damascus and signaling that punitive measures against the Syrian government were unlikely.'"
"'11-06-10,'0','Publishers were still digesting news about Apple’s adjustments to the policies on Thursday, but there were early indications that they liked what they saw.In February, Apple introduced a subscription mechanism for iPhone and iPad apps that required companies to offer customers the option of buying content like magazines or music through its payment system. The rules also barred companies from offering a better deal to customers if they paid for a subscription elsewhere, say on a company’s own Web site. Apps that did not comply were not authorized on Apple devices.Under the new rules, companies can sell the subscriptions to their content on their own Web site at any price they choose, and make that content available in iPhone and iPad apps. Publishers are no longer required to offer users the option to purchase the content directly from within their app, but if they do, the transaction must go through the iTunes store, and Apple will still get a 30 percent cut. And publishers are still not allowed to put “buy” buttons in their apps that circumvent the iTunes stores, say by directing users to their Web sites.Apple’s prior rules sparked concerns among many publishers. But relations between Apple and some major media companies warmed in recent weeks, after Apple showed flexibility on another sticking point: its willingness to give magazine publishers data about subscribers that signed up through iTunes.Hearst and Condé Nast, the second and third largest American magazine publishers, recently reached agreements to sell subscriptions through Apple. The New York Times has also agreed to sell subscriptions through Apple’s App Store. Time Inc., the largest magazine publisher, is still negotiating with the technology giant but has cut a deal in which subscribers to Sports Illustrated, Time and Fortune can read the magazines free on the iPad as long as they verified their identities.Others have sought ways to bypass Apple’s rules completely. For instance, The Financial Times, the British daily, on Tuesday introduced a mobile Web app that worked in a similar way as an iPad or iPhone app, but could be made accessible through a Web browser. The goal was to circumvent Apple’s store and the commission.The music service Rhapsody, which had criticized Apple’s earlier rules as unworkable and had threatened to remove its app, said Thursday that it was still reviewing the new rules. A Condé Nast spokeswoman called the changes “great news” but said the magazine company, which sells GQ, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker on the iPad, still had “to look carefully at this development.”Executives at Hearst, which will begin selling subscriptions for Esquire, Popular Mechanics and O, The Oprah Magazine soon, were still sorting through Apple’s changes and had no comment on Thursday. Time Inc. should not be affected much by the changes because it has not reached an agreement yet with Apple to begin selling subscriptions. Those talks continue.Apple’s previous rules surprised some analysts because of their potential to alienate media companies. The company has long courted content makers and app developers, not so much because of the revenue it generates from selling their wares, but because having a large supply of content and apps helps the company sell the gadgets that account for the vast majority of its revenue and nearly all of its profits.As the largest distributor of music, for example, Apple generates a hefty stream of revenue for major labels. But the iTunes store accounts for just a sliver of its own revenue, and the company has said in the past that it generates virtually no profit from the store. In the most recent quarter, Apple said the sale of apps, music and content combined brought in just $1.6 billion of the company’s $24.6 billion in revenue.“The more content there is in their ecosystem, the better their devices sell,” said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. “Why they had decided to tighten the rules on content publishers is hard to explain. I think they overreached.”'"
"'11-06-10,'0','WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously upheld a $290 million award against Microsoft in a patent dispute. The case was brought by a Canadian software company, i4i Limited Partnership, which said a version of Microsoft Word had infringed its patented method for editing documents.At the trial, the jury rejected Microsoft’s argument that the patent was invalid. Before the Supreme Court, Microsoft said the trial court had subjected its invalidity defense to an overly demanding standard.Microsoft had been required to prove its defense by clear and convincing evidence, and the company said it should have only needed to meet the more relaxed standard of a preponderance of the evidence. Under that standard, Microsoft would have had to prove only that it was more likely than not that the patent was invalid.The question in the case (Microsoft Corporation v. i4i Limited Partnership, No. 10-290) was what Congress meant on that point in the Patent Act of 1952, which said only that patents are “presumed valid” and that “the burden of establishing invalidity” rests “on the party asserting such invalidity.”Though the law did not expressly specify a standard of proof, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court, said Congress must have codified the general understanding about the appropriate standard, one reflected in a 1934 Supreme Court decision. The presumption that patents were valid, Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo wrote, was “not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.”'"

That can be seen by what could be called the private sector international balance of payments, which measures the part of a country’s current-account surplus or deficit that is not accounted for by government borrowing.

"'11-06-11,'0','Steven Ballmer is going through a rough patch. Not only did the influential hedge fund manager David Einhorn call for him to step down from the top job at Microsoft, “to give someone else a chance,” Microsoft stock jumped right after he said it.Investors’ frustration is not hard to understand. Over the last 10 years, Microsoft’s stock price has flat-lined as those of rivals Apple and Google soared. The biggest American company by market capitalization in the late 1990s, it was surpassed by Apple last year. Last month, I.B.M. briefly overtook it for the first time in 15 years.This is probably little consolation, but Mr. Ballmer’s plight is an example of one of the core strengths of American capitalism: the ease with which new technologies emerge to challenge the most entrenched colossus.Sure, Microsoft missed a few boats. It misunderstood the importance of Internet search. It’s missing the smartphone and tablet revolution. But figuring out the next big thing is not easy. Over the last 25 years the number of industrial companies in the S.& P. 500 has fallen by half.Technology upends companies in different ways. It allows new firms to deliver better products and services in a more efficient way; it also creates new goods and services for consumers to want. Eastman Kodak, the fifth-biggest company in the S.& P. 500 in 1975, was almost destroyed by digital cameras and is no longer in the index. General Motors, fifth biggest in 1985, was hobbled by rivals that could make more fuel efficient cars. Microsoft still rules the PC desktop. But that will matter less and less as users migrate to tablets and more computing takes place in “the cloud.”There is another lesson in Microsoft’s long slide. It is about how far corporate behemoths will go to stop technology that threatens their dominance. Ten years ago, Microsoft tried to use its virtual monopoly of the operating system to strangle potential rivals and their new technologies. Fortunately, it failed. But the new rising behemoths will likely try similar tactics on whatever new gizmo challenges them.'"
"'11-06-11,'0','“These incidents are exacerbated by austere battlefield conditions, combat stress, fatigue and cultural misunderstandings,” Colonel Simons said.Nonetheless, he added, “the threat of infiltration is real.”The attacks are increasing as NATO forces are racing to train and build up the Afghan Army and the police to a force of 395,000 by 2014. The buildup is critical to American and NATO exit strategies, which include turning over all combat and security duties to the Afghan forces over the next three years. But the pace is also putting strains on Afghan agents to screen the flood of recruits.One of the worst attacks occurred in April, when an Afghan Army pilot shot and killed eight American service members and a contractor during a meeting of foreign and Afghan officers on the military side of Kabul International Airport. At least three NATO soldiers have been killed in two attacks since then.The attacks have continued despite efforts to improve screening of recruits and crack down on the illegal sales of police and army uniforms.The Taliban frequently take credit for the attacks, and say they have recruited young people across the country to join the national security forces as sleeper agents. NATO officials say that they have no evidence that infiltration is widespread or that any insurgents have successfully joined the service with the intent of attacking coalition forces.Whether the infiltration is widespread, the claims are hard to contest, and serve to shake popular confidence in the growing army and police forces.Adding to that distrust is the problem of Afghan soldiers and police officers — and impostors dressed like them — attacking military installations and government compounds.Afghan intelligence officials on Friday could not say how many of these attacks have happened. But the list is lengthy and growing, said Lutfullah Mashal, a spokesman for the National Directorate of Security, the main intelligence agency.Many of the attacks involved insurgents using army or police uniforms and fake government identifications, he said. “But there were also those types of attacks in which enemies had infiltrated our national forces and then carried out the attacks, and we are seeing an increase in these attacks,” Mr. Mashal said.Last month, an Afghan soldier with eight months on the force helped a suicide bomber obtain an army uniform and identification needed to carry out an attack inside the national military hospital, one of the worst attacks in the capital this year. The attack killed six people who were training to be medics and wounded more than 20 other people, including several medical students.In April, a police officer who had recently joined the force entered the tightly secured police headquarters in the city of Kandahar, killing the police chief, a widely admired figure from his days as an anti-Soviet fighter.The Security Directorate arrested nearly a dozen people this week in connection with an April suicide attack on the Defense Ministry that killed two Afghan soldiers, an Afghan intelligence officer said. The people arrested included “high-ranking” officials with the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry, which oversees the Afghan National Police, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the case.Coalition forces sharply escalated the training of the Afghan counterintelligence agents in November, after a well-regarded Afghan border policeman opened fire on American soldiers in Nangarhar Province, killing six. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack, but investigators now believe that the soldier acted out of personal distress, including his father’s insistence that he accept a marriage contract with a young girl.The new American agents will presumably work with their Afghan counterparts, whose job is to identify possible insurgents among Afghan forces and to look for signs of service members who, acting either out of financial or personal stress or because of threats to their families, might fall under Taliban influence. Nearly 200 Afghan agents were in the field as of April, and that number is expected to more than double by year’s end.'"
"'11-06-11,'0','Epidemiologists in the United States said they were perplexed that it took German authorities so long to identify the culprit.“I’m just staggered,” said William E. Keene, a senior epidemiologist of the Oregon Public Health Division. “This is basic outbreak investigation 101. This is on the high end of suspect vehicles. You always rule out raw milk, you always rule out ground beef, you always rule out sprouts. It just happens in the beginning steps.”After a series of outbreaks of sprout-related illnesses in this country and abroad in the 1990s, the F.D.A. began encouraging sprout growers, known as sprouters, to take steps to sanitize their seeds and test their products for pathogens before sale.The agency also warned the public that uncooked sprouts were a risky food, saying that children, the elderly, pregnant women and those with weak immune systems should not eat raw sprouts. The bacteria that can contaminate sprouts can be destroyed by cooking.The F.D.A. says there have been at least 30 outbreaks of disease associated with sprouts in this country since 1996. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group that tracks food safety, said that its review of government data revealed 45 sprout-related outbreaks since 1990, including 2,500 illnesses. The group said that it was aware of one death, in a salmonella outbreak in 2003.One of the most severe E. coli outbreaks ever recorded, in Japan in 1996, was associated with radish sprouts. About 10,000 people, many of them children, fell ill.Bob Sanderson, president of Jonathan Sprouts in Massachusetts and the head of the International Sprout Growers Association, said that it would be wrong to draw conclusions about the safety of American sprouts based on the German outbreak, since growers there may use different methods than their counterparts here. “Fresh food is the most nutritious food and inherently prone to these problems,” Mr. Sanderson said of sprouts and other vegetables. “That’s what makes it fresh. It’s not sterile.”Mr. Sanderson’s company recalled alfalfa and some mixed sprouts in April after routine federal testing found salmonella in them. Mr. Sanderson said that no illnesses had been associated with his products. After the recall, he said, he improved his testing methods.Some sprout growers complain that the strong chlorine mixture recommended by the F.D.A. to sanitize seed can be dangerous for workers to handle.Mr. Sanderson said that he used a lower concentration of chlorine for that reason, but he feels that the tests his company conducts on sprouts as they are growing are sufficient to catch any problems.Sidney Chang, the owner of Chang Farm, another Massachusetts sprouter, recalled some of his sprouts two years ago after tests found listeria, another dangerous bacteria. Since then, he has built a new, more modern facility and now sanitizes his sprouts with a hot-water process. He also uses a less concentrated chlorine wash.Experts say they believe sprout seeds can become contaminated in the fields where they are grown. Bacteria can hide inside damaged seeds, where sanitizing steps may not always be able to reach them.Michelle Smith, an F.D.A. senior policy analyst, said that a single bacterium surviving in a kilogram of seed can be enough to contaminate a batch of sprouts because the way they are grown allows bacteria to spread.Dr. Smith said that the F.D.A. expected to include new rules for sprouts as it wrote regulations as part of a major food safety law that went into effect this year.'"
"'11-06-11,'0','However, the inspector general determined that Mr. Jaczko had not broken any law or violated any commission standard of conduct, and the report makes clear the complicated nature of multimember federal commissions like the regulatory agency. While all of the members vote on policy decisions, the chairman deals with most fiscal questions alone.In deciding not to spend more agency money on Yucca, Mr. Jaczko was not acting in secret, the report makes clear. It says that of the other four commissioners, two were told of the decision but may not have understood what they were told. A third did not return phone calls from the chairman’s office but did raise questions to the commission’s lawyers in a way that made it clear she knew of the issue.Mr. Jaczko admitted to the inspector general that he sometimes loses his temper but denied violating any procedures or misleading the other commissioners.In a telephone interview on Friday, he said that Yucca Mountain was a contentious issue that had generated controversy for years. “All along, my goal has been to make sure we preserve the agency function and focus on safety,” he said. “If that means I have to take heat, that’s my job. I’m here to make the hard decisions and take responsibility for those decisions, and that’s what I’ve done.”The report further inflamed the long-running battle over how and where to store about 70,000 metric tons of the radioactive waste produced by the nation’s 104 operating nuclear power stations and about a dozen more than have been retired. Proponents of Yucca Mountain, on which about $10 billion has already been spent, say that it provides the safest available disposal of waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.Others, including Mr. Obama and Energy Secretary Steven Chu, say that the material can be safely stored for decades above ground in casks at the nuclear plants where it is produced.Mr. Bell, the inspector general, is scheduled to appear before a House committee next week to be questioned about his report.Representative John Shimkus, the Illinois Republican who heads the subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee that will review the report, said that the inspector general’s findings confirmed his worst suspicions.“The report reveals a calculating and political N.R.C. chairman who has abused his authority, who sought to suppress scientific reports and withhold information from fellow commissioners — strategically working to rig the system in a no-holds-barred effort to derail the Yucca Mountain repository,” Mr. Shimkus said in a statement on Friday.“The I.G. provides a disturbing glimpse of Chairman Jaczko’s concerted effort to obliterate the work of the last 30 years,” he said, “exhibiting complete disregard for the scientific research, bipartisan collaboration, and billions of taxpayer and consumer dollars invested in this national effort to safely and permanently store nuclear waste.”Mr. Jaczko was nominated to the commission in 2005 by President George W. Bush under strong pressure from Senator Reid, on whose staff Mr. Jaczko then served. He was opposed by the nuclear industry, which is unusual for an regulatory commission nominee. Not having run a nuclear-powered Navy submarine or worked in a nuclear power plant, he is still viewed with suspicion by the industry.Senator Reid defended Mr. Jaczko, saying the inspector general’s report had largely exonerated him.“The N.R.C. inspector general report affirmed that Chairman Jaczko has acted within the law, N.R.C. guidance and his authority in closing out Yucca Mountain project licensing,” Mr. Reid said on Friday. “It’s time for House Republicans to move on and help find real solutions for safely managing nuclear waste.“Yucca Mountain is dead,” he said. “The project is terminated now that Republicans and Democrats alike voted to zero out its funding, and the administration’s policy is clear that Yucca is not coming back and the U.S. will pursue much safer, workable alternatives.”'"

"'11-06-11,'0','LONDON — Brian Lenihan, who as Ireland’s finance minister led the nation’s effort to fend off bankruptcy during the worldwide economic collapse, died on Friday at his home in Dublin. He was 52.The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Adam Ledwith, a spokesman for the Fianna Fail political party. Mr. Lenihan had been treated for the disease since December 2009.A lawyer by training, Mr. Lenihan became finance minister in May 2008 just as the Irish economy, whose rapid growth had won it the nickname the Celtic Tiger, started to falter. A month into the job, Mr. Lenihan described the timing as a “misfortune,” but things would get far worse.The collapse of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent freezing of global credit markets exposed years of reckless lending by Irish banks to support an inflated property market. Mr. Lenihan was suddenly faced with huge losses at the country’s largest banks that threatened not only the survival of the banking system but also that of the Irish economy.In a controversial decision, Mr. Lenihan guaranteed deposits and much of the Irish banks’ debt. The mere promise, he thought, would be enough to stop a panic in the market and avoid a collapse of the banking system. But his bet failed, leaving the government to pay the bill. Ireland’s budget deficit ballooned. Investors balked at buying more of the country’s debt, and in the end the government was unable to shoulder the costs alone. Reluctantly, Mr. Lenihan negotiated a $93 billion rescue deal with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in November 2010. In a BBC radio interview in April, Mr. Lenihan recalled how he felt before agreeing to the bailout.“I have a very vivid memory of going to Brussels on the final Monday and being on my own at the airport and looking at the snow gradually thawing and thinking to myself, This is terrible,” he said. “I had fought for two and a half years to avoid this conclusion. I believed I had fought the good fight and taken every measure possible to delay such an eventuality. And now hell was at the gates.”'"
"'11-06-11,'0','“Hillary Clinton would be widely regarded as an eminently qualified candidate for that job,” said Edwin M. Truman, a former official at the I.M.F. who is now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “If it’s not a candidate as strong as Hillary Clinton, it would be that much more difficult.”The White House also denied the report, carried by Reuters, about Mrs. Clinton, while the Treasury Department declined to discuss its deliberations. But officials there said the administration was determined to maintain American influence over the World Bank, both because it viewed the bank’s development work as important and because the United States is its largest financial contributor. The rumors about Mrs. Clinton may have been an effort by administration officials to reinforce the point.Congressional support is critical, Mr. Truman said, because the World Bank is seeking additional capital — something lawmakers would have to approve. The administration, he said, worries that Congress might react to the United States’ giving up the presidency of the bank by declining to give it more money.In some ways, the World Bank would be a perfect fit for Mrs. Clinton. Friends said she had expressed interest in working in the field of development after leaving the State Department. She has also made it clear that she does not plan to stay on as secretary of state if President Obama is reelected.Former President Bill Clinton has voiced interest in running the World Bank; his name was mentioned before Paul D. Wolfowitz got the job in 2005, and two years later, when Mr. Wolfowitz was replaced by the current president, Robert B. Zoellick. Mr. Zoellick, whose term expires next year, is well regarded and the White House could opt to push him for another five-year term. But he is a Republican who has long been viewed as a potential Treasury secretary in a Republican administration.None of this would have surfaced now, officials said, but for the complex drama set off by the resignation of Mr. Strauss-Kahn after he was charged last month with sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper in New York.The French government moved swiftly to seek support for Ms. Lagarde to replace Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who before his arrest had been a likely Socialist candidate for president. And she won immediate support from other European countries. A Mexican central banker, Agustín Carstens, is also mounting a spirited bid for the managing director post at the I.M.F., but with the deadline for nominations looming, Ms. Lagarde has been viewed as having built a daunting lead.The White House has remained noncommittal, with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner saying that Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Carstens are both “talented candidates.” But diplomats said the United States had signaled to France that it would not block Ms. Lagarde’s candidacy if she gathered support in the developing world. She won endorsements this week from several African countries.As for the bank, Mrs. Clinton said, “It’s a very important institution, and obviously we want to see the World Bank well led.” But just in the case there was any lingering ambiguity, she added, “I am absolutely dedicated to my service as secretary of state.”'"

"'11-06-11,'0','Several people who were injured when a tornado devastated Joplin, Mo., last month have become sickened by an uncommon, deadly fungal infection and at least three have died, although public health officials said Friday that a link between the infection and the deaths was not certain.Also on Friday, the death toll from the tornado was raised to 151.Eight tornado victims have fallen ill from the mysterious infection, and each had “multiple injuries and secondary wound infections,” said Jacqueline Lapine, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Citing confidentiality rules, officials declined to discuss the treatment or condition of the patients.The fungus that causes the infection, which is believed to be mucormycosis, is most commonly found in soil and wood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is studying samples from the eight Joplin patients. “It is a very aggressive and severe infection,” said Dr. Benjamin Park, chief of the epidemiology team in the C.D.C.’s Mycotic Diseases Branch. “It is also very rare.”Mucormycosis enters the body either via a puncture wound or when a victim breathes in its mold spores, officials said. Those who have weakened immune systems have a mortality rate as high as 90 percent.

"'11-06-11,'0','Clearly, the romance at the forefront of “Any Night” has a very dark side. It’s easy to spot the clues in the script, by its stars Daniel Arnold and Medina Hahn: the small indiscretions that anticipate bigger ones, the mysterious family tragedies with questionable veracity, the warnings of death. It all points in one direction: meet cute, leave bloody.The young caretaker Patrick (Mr. Arnold) is a sweet, solitary tech nerd, but he seems somewhat odd when he tells his new boarder, Anna (Ms. Hahn), who moves into (where else?) the basement, that her predecessor was a “whack job.” Anna has night terrors, a violently angry ex-boyfriend and a paranoid streak. The fact that she’s a dancer isn’t the only thing that evokes “Black Swan.” Discussions of violence and invasions of privacy offer heavier hints, but this DualMinds production from Canada is so slickly executed you easily lose sight that, at its heart, it’s a junky thriller, cobbled together from countless stalker and obsession movies.The play’s construction is sturdy and occasionally sly, but the dialogue lacks wit or drive. He’s rigid and shy, while she’s an artist with a wild streak. (You can tell because when they dance he does the robot and she shakes in violent jolts.) Mr. Arnold does nice work as the unassuming romantic, although the part calls for another register that he doesn’t quite reach.Ms. Hahn is far more successful accessing the chewy center of the material, evoking vulnerability, desire and fragility in broad strokes. The woman knows how to swing a knife.The real achievement of this play, though, is that it takes a variety of film genre conventions and translates them to spare, low-budget theater with ease. Give the director Ron Jenkins credit for never including an unnecessary prop or effect for a cheap shock. The show finds a theatrical vocabulary to substitute for cinematic quick cutting by juggling multiple story lines and using clever, off-kilter transitions. A result is a play that zips by, maintaining suspense by keeping the audience slightly off balance. You know something weird is going on, but you are not entirely sure what.'"

"'11-06-11,'0','“The tough ones come in waves,” said Bill Miller, a big-league umpire since 1999. “I’ve had five or six in one game at first base. Do you have a ground-ball pitcher? You got Jose Reyes or Ichiro running down the first-base line? If you do, a routine ground ball to the shortstop can be an extremely close play.”A year ago, the umpire Jim Joyce made one of the most famous umpiring gaffes in history, costing pitcher Armando Galarraga, then with the Detroit Tigers, a perfect game when he blew the call at first on what should have been the 27th and final out. And St. Louis Cardinals fans with long memories remain convinced that the first-base umpire Don Denkinger’s missed call in the ninth inning of the sixth game of the 1985 World Series handed the championship to the Kansas City Royals.Interestingly, both Denkinger and Joyce left the field thinking they had made the right call only to learn otherwise shortly thereafter. The plays were similar: each was a ground ball that was taken by the first baseman, who tossed to the pitcher covering the bag. The umpires couldn’t use their ears; on soft tosses like those, especially in a big situation with the crowd roaring, it is tough to hear the ball land in the glove. In each case, the umpire’s eyes lied to him.Partly because of television’s increasingly close scrutiny, umpires are facing more thorough evaluations this year than in the past. Major League Baseball staff observers visit stadiums often enough to watch and evaluate umpires in slightly more than half their games; this year, for the first time, tapes of close plays in otherwise unobserved games are being examined for umpire performance as well.Plays at first base play a large part in all of this, and they are distinctively challenging for umpires for a number of reasons. For one thing, the runner coming down the line from the plate (in umpire parlance, the batter-runner, to distinguish him from someone already on base) does not have to maintain contact with the bag. He is not only allowed to touch it and steam past it, he is expected to.This gives rise to the possibility that ball and runner can arrive at exactly the same time — or at least seem to — and the canard that a tie goes to the runner. (At least one place in the rulebook implies that the opposite is true. Rule 7.01: “A runner acquires the right to an unoccupied base when he touches it before he is out.”)In any case, as umpires will tell you, they do not have the luxury of declaring a tie. Either the ball beats the runner or the runner beats the ball: they must decide.“The human eye will never, ever be able to compete with that hi-def, slo-mo cam,” said Winters, a crew chief who has been in the big leagues since 1990. “If we’re going to be judged by that criteria, we’ll never keep up. Our percentage is something like 98, but the 2 percent will kill you. You work so hard to be as perfect as possible, knowing that perfect is not possible. When it’s that close that they have to go to super slo-mo, so be it. That’s about as good as I’m going to get.”Another distinction at first base is that the vast majority of outs do not require tags, so the call rarely involves the fielder touching the runner with the ball.Instead, the call is most often made with the two significant elements of the play — the ball in the fielder’s glove and the runner’s foot on the base — at some distance from each other, far enough apart that the umpire cannot keep both in his line of vision. From the earliest days of their training, umpires are taught how to cope with this: on most infield ground balls, establish a position 15 to 18 feet from the first-base bag and at a right angle to the perceived path of a true throw.For big-leaguers, this is only a guideline. Many, working from experience and knowing that disaster for an umpire most often begins with a player’s mistake, will cheat on the 90-degree angle to be more prepared for an errant throw and a sweep tag.“Your spot is not as important as being stopped and having your eyes in the right place,” Winters said.Alfonso Marquez, who has been in the big leagues since 1999, gave an example of having his eyes in the wrong place, in this case too close to the ground.“I was in Baltimore one time,” Marquez said, “and Brian Roberts hit a grounder to the shortstop, and I went down on one knee and took the play that way. And Roberts slid headfirst, and I had no idea when he touched the bag. Needless to say, that’s the last time I went down on a knee.”And if the ground ball is into the hole between first and second or up the first-base line, the umpire can be in danger of ending up in the path of a fielder or the batter-runner, or having to swivel his head quickly to follow a throw, so the guidelines become more complicated, and the umpire’s position less specifically prescribed.In any case, the umpire is taught to get set in position, focus his eyes on the base, and listen for the sound of the ball hitting the glove. If he determines the ball has arrived first, he then immediately shifts his eyes to the glove to make sure the fielder has secure possession of the ball.Of course, sometimes it’s possible to take in the fielder and the runner in a single glance, but big-league umpires say their experience teaches them to use every tool at their disposal all the time.“You can see the ball and the glove, but you don’t want to umpire that way,” Marquez said. “I try to use my ears on every play.”Jim Evans, who umpired in the American League from 1971 to 1999 and now runs one of two sanctioned professional umpire schools, said that on the occasions when sound will not be helpful — on a soft-toss play with the pitcher covering first, for example — the umpire has to anticipate that and keep his distance from the bag so he can make the call using only his eyes. But most of the time, he said, you use your eyes to determine two things — whether the fielder’s and runner’s feet touched the bag and did the fielder have secure possession of the ball — and your ears for a third: When did the ball arrive?“I would have a play in a real game and know I got it right,” Evans said, “and later I’d watch it on replay without the sound and I couldn’t tell.”Like all situations calling for an umpire’s judgment, plays at first are made more complicated by the unforeseeable. A routine ground ball to the shortstop suddenly turns problematic when the throw pulls the first baseman off the bag, or if it short hops into the first baseman’s glove with a hint of a bobble. Even a good throw, if it causes the first baseman to step directly toward the umpire and obscure his view of the bag, can create trouble if there’s a question whether the first baseman’s foot remained in contact with the base long enough.A final complication is the savvy first baseman who “cheats,” that is, tries to fool the umpire by lifting his foot off the bag just before he snags the throw, suggesting by such misdirection that the ball arrived sooner than it did and possibly gaining an extra split-second of umpire judgment.“Is it a lost art today? You don’t see it too much,” said Keith Hernandez, now an announcer for the SNY network but a former Gold Glove first baseman who learned the art of cheating, he said, from an old Dodger, Ron Fairly. Umpires, he said, are on the lookout for two things: when the ball arrives and when the runner hits the bag.“It’s hard for them to triple-task, and I’m not one of their two keys,” Hernandez said. “There’s a trick to it, a technique. It has to be a play where it’s going to be close. You can’t get a whole step; maybe you can get a half-step. As you stride out you come off the back. You have to be smooth. And you only come off six inches or so.”Asked how often it worked, Hernandez said not too often, but that it might have gotten the Mets to the World Series in 1986. In the second inning of Game 5 of the National League Championship Series, the Houston Astros had men on first and third and one out, and the batter, Craig Reynolds, grounded to second. The Mets tried to turn a double play and the umpire Fred Brocklander called Reynolds out.Reynolds, Hernandez said, “clearly beat it, but I cheated and we got the call.”“It cost Houston the game,” as the Mets won in the 12th inning.“You’ve got the juggled ball, you’ve got the swipe tag, you’ve got the pulled foot,” he said. “A blind person can call a play at first base if it’s just a matter of ‘Did the ball beat the runner?’ ”'"
"'11-06-11,'0','Studies of workers like embalmers exposed to high levels of formaldehyde have found increased incidences of myeloid leukemia and rare cancers of the nasal passages and upper mouth.Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer at the , said that formaldehyde is both worrisome and inescapable. “It’s the smell in new houses, and it’s in cosmetics like nail polish,” he said. “All a reasonable person can do is manage their exposure and decrease it to as little as possible. It’s everywhere.”Consumers can reduce their exposure to formaldehyde by avoiding pressed-wood products or buying only those that are labeled as U.L.E.F. (ultra-low-emitting formaldehyde), N.A.F. (no added formaldehyde) or C.A.R.B. (California Air Resources Board) Phase 1 or Phase 2 compliant.Styrene is mostly a concern for workers who build boats, car parts, bathtubs and shower stalls. Studies of workers exposed to high levels of styrene have found increased risks of leukemia and lymphoma and genetic damage to white blood cells. There is also some evidence that styrene increases the risks of cancer of the pancreas and esophagus among styrene workers, the report found. Consumers can be exposed to styrene from the fumes of building materials, photocopiers and tobacco smoke.As for styrene’s presence in plastic utensils and other consumer products, Dr. Brawley likened the risk from such products to that of coffee and cellphones — uncertain and slight.An industry spokesman said the action will hurt small businesses.“It will unfairly scare workers, plant neighbors and could have a chilling effect on the development of new products,” said Tom Dobbins of the American Composites Manufacturers Association. “And our companies are primarily small businesses, and this could hurt jobs and local economies.”Cal Dooley, president and chief executive of the American Chemistry Council, a trade association that represents companies that make and use polystyrene and formaldehyde, rejected the report’s conclusions. “We are extremely concerned that politics may have hijacked the scientific process,” he said.Some in the industry have promised to continue fighting the report, and will appeal elements of its findings. But some manufacturers already have begun using alternatives to formaldehyde in their products.This is the 12th cancer list released by the toxicology program at the , and each has been controversial. In 2000, controversy erupted over the ninth report’s listing of secondhand smoke and tanning beds. The 11th report’s listing in 2005 of , which is used in mothballs, caused similar concern.That this latest report would warn about formaldehyde and styrene has been suspected by industry since shortly after the release of the previous report, and industry groups have fought the process behind its release ever since. As a result, the government added numerous public comment periods to the process, and even after it was written, officials at the delayed the report’s release for months to cope with industry complaints.“Industry held this report up for four years,” said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the . “They have tried to create the impression that there was real scientific uncertainty here, but there’s not.”The report also lists aristolochic acids, found in plants and sometimes used in herbal medicines, as a known carcinogen and added to the list of probable carcinogens other substances like captafol (a fungicide no longer sold in the ), finely spun glass wool fibers (used in insulation), cobalt-tungsten carbide (used in manufacturing), riddelliine (plants eaten by cattle, horses and sheep) and ortho-nitrotoluene (used in dyes).Aristolochic acids are sometimes used in herbal medicines to treat conditions like and . In 2001, the warned against the use of products containing aristolochic acids after seeing an increase in kidney disease among users.

Animal studies have shown that glass wool fibers cause lung , but there is little evidence from human studies of a risk.'"
"'11-06-11,'0','WASHINGTON — Government scientists are expected today to declare styrene a likely human carcinogen, a move that manufacturers have long feared. Styrene is used to make those ubiquitous white foam coffee cups and food containers and is widely used in building materials.The primary risk to the general public from styrene exposure, however, comes from breathing indoor air, since its use is widespread in building materials and the exposure that comes from coffee cups and food containers is small. Still, styrene in food and water are risk factors, according to government scientists. Tobacco smokers are also exposed to styrene.Formaldehyde is also expected to be declared a possible carcinogen in the Report on Carcinogens, put together by the National Toxicology Program, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. Studies suggest that exposure to formaldehyde — used widely in the funeral industry and building materials and even found in some popular hair treatments — could cause a form of leukemia.Manufacturers have been lobbying fiercely for years against both designations, saying that no good studies have shown that either chemical causes cancer. Spokesmen for manufacturers said they would appeal the designations.“It will unfairly scare workers, plant neighbors and could have a chilling effect on the development of new products,” said Tom Dobbins, a spokesman for the American Composites Manufacturers Association. “Our companies are primarily small businesses, and this could hurt jobs and local economies.”Styrene, an important component of polystyrene, is used primarily in the manufacture of plastic packaging, thermal insulation in buildings, and disposable cups and food containers.

"'11-06-11,'0','FIVE years ago, a survey of the euro zone would have shown two star countries. They were growing rapidly and running government budget surpluses. Their national debts were low. Other countries sought to emulate their success.The outstanding countries were Spain and Ireland.Today, of course, the picture is far different. The two countries’ national economies are shrinking, not growing. Ireland has received a bailout from Europe, and while Spain can still borrow money, it is forced to pay at least two percentage points a year more than Germany, a spread the Spanish government says it cannot afford to pay indefinitely.At the time the two economies appeared to be impressive, there was one indication that could have provided a warning. Each country’s private sector was borrowing heavily overseas. Those loans were fueling rapid economic growth that, in turn, produced rising tax collections, allowing national governments to run budget surpluses.In principle, there is nothing wrong with debt-financed growth. What matters is whether the borrowed money is going to create productive enterprises and purchase valuable assets that will generate future profits to repay the debt.But in bubbles, that is not likely to happen. In Ireland and Spain, as in the United States, property booms led to overinvestment in housing, and to plunging property prices when the bubble burst. What was important was that during the boom years, the financial systems of many countries completely failed to channel money into productive investments.'"
"'11-06-11,'0','The extreme example of this is Dharun Ravi, the former Rutgers University student accused of using a webcam to spy on his roommate’s intimate encounter with another man. The roommate committed suicide several days later. Mr. Ravi is now facing criminal charges in the case. Whatever the outcome of the trial, Mr. Ravi’s online reputation will be forever affected.“What we see when kids do something stupid is the target of the attacks going after the parents,” said Peter Piotrowski, senior vice president for claims in the private client division of Chartis.Even though children are living at college, their primary residence is assumed to be their family home. The lawyer for the person suing can claim that the parents should have been better monitors of their children’s Internet activity, Mr. Piotrowski said.If your reputation is damaged, the economic consequences can be substantial. But there are steps people can take to alter their online reputation and protect themselves against lawsuits for defamation and libel. What follows is a discussion of the options.DAMAGED REPUTATION The speed at which someone’s reputation can be damaged, even with false information, makes combating defamatory remarks tough.The college student who received Mr. Weiner’s picture said that she had awakened to find her name all over the Internet. Reversing that kind of damage takes time.“I used to say until about two to three years ago that there are a lot of things you can do to solve these problems yourself,” Mr. Fertik said. “I stopped saying that. It’s become so technically complicated to solve this.”Technology companies are not the only resource for cleaning up a reputation. Security and investigative firms can also help.Christopher Falkenberg, president of Insite Security, said his firm had resorted to face-to-face meetings with people who posted damaging information as well as the search engine companies that linked to it.Sometimes, of course, the damaging information is true, or the site refuses to remove the information. Then, firms like Reputation.com and security consultants resort to burying the information as best they can. “You hope people won’t go to the third or fourth page,” Mr. Falkenberg said.Yet doing any of this costs a lot of money. Reputation.com advertises an annual membership fee of $99, but Mr. Fertik said that costs could easily reach $10,000 for a prominent person who wanted to make a scandal harder to discover through Internet searches. (He said Mr. Weiner was probably out of luck: “It would take a long time and more money than he has.”)For the detective work, the costs escalate quickly. Michael J. Hershman, president of the Fairfax Group, a risk and reputation management firm, said burying negative information could cost $500 to $1,000, but persuading search engines to expunge incorrect information could cost several thousand dollars more. Getting that information removed from aggregating Web sites like Intellius or PeopleFinder can add another couple of thousand dollars.Costs can spike into five figures when a firm is asked to find the people responsible for the defamatory blog post or Twitter message. “If you’re going to hire a firm like ours to find that person, it’s hit or miss,” Mr. Hershman said. “We can’t guarantee success. It’s not as easy as going to the search engines.”SUED FOR DAMAGE Then there are the costs for someone accused of damaging another person’s reputation. Lawsuits for defamation and libel are expensive to defend and expensive to settle.The singer Courtney Love, for instance, recently paid a fashion designer $430,000 to settle a lawsuit brought after Ms. Love sent out a defamatory Twitter post about the woman’s work.High-end firms like Chubb and Chartis offer coverage against such suits in their personal injury category — as opposed to bodily injury, which almost all homeowner policies have. But if, for example, a parent or child defames someone, the costs could quickly exceed the coverage in a basic policy.Mr. Piotrowski said Chartis recently paid out $75,000 to cover the legal fees of a client who had forwarded an e-mail that defamed a nonpublic person in town. “She forwarded this e-mail onto her own circle of friends and it got forwarded on and on,” he said. “She did nothing to modify it or put any commentary on it.”It probably would have been smarter if the woman had not forwarded the e-mail, but she was fortunate to have the insurance to cover her legal costs and more fortunate still to have the case dismissed.Many people might not be this lucky. Jeanne Salvatore, spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, said people might not know if they had coverage against defamation in their homeowner’s policy. One solution is an umbrella policy that offers coverage for libel and defamation (as well as coverage above and beyond existing policies), she said.The cost of an umbrella policy is often quite low for the amount of coverage. Kevin Desmond, personal lines manager for northern New England at Chubb, said it could be as low as $350 a year for $5 million of coverage.“The threat was always when kids reached driving age, they became scary individuals,” he said. “Today, from their bedroom they have access to their world. Their parents may not really realize their kids can have an impact on them.”Unlike the situation a generation ago, dings to people’s reputations can follow them through life. “It’s a shame that if you’re a professional person and you’ve spent your lifetime learning something, the Internet doesn’t know that about you,” Mr. Fertik said. “It just knows that you gave a quote about the cafeteria food at your college and ran a marathon.”For some people, being known for that would be just fine.'"
"'11-06-11,'0','In the United States, a rash of sluggish indicators — especially related to the job market, manufacturing, consumer confidence and home sales — has economists worried about a stalled recovery. The nervousness was heightened this week when the chairman, , said the economic recovery remained uneven but did not say the Fed would continue to intervene. Investor enthusiasm has cooled with signals from the Fed that it will end its purchase of $600 billion dollars in at the end of June.The continued political wrangling over the raising of the has fueled additional concerns. said last week that it might downgrade the United States rating if lawmakers did not increase the nation’s debt limit “in coming weeks.”“The marketplace is spooked,” by the recent bad economic news, said Ciaran O’Kelly, head of equities at Nomura in the United States.Whether the uncertainty for investors and the markets will lift, or whether stocks will continue their decline, is as unclear as the muddled economic signals. But Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group, said the markets were finally coming to a realization of how much worse things had become.“This is not rocket science,” he said. “Up until a month or two ago, investors thought the headwinds against the recovery were transitory. But they may now last a lot longer.”In addition to the Dow’s decline, the 500-stock index fell 18.02 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,270.98. The Nasdaq composite index was down 41.14 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,643.73, and that exchange is down for the year.“The markets on the whole are reacting to what we think is a slowdown period of both the U.S. and the broader economy,” Jason D. Pride, the director of strategy at Glenmede, said.“And to put a cherry on top of the scenario, as far as downside pressures, you have this significant unease surrounding exactly what is going to come from the Greek debt issues.”Mr. Pride said the financial markets were plowing through uncertain times.“We are going through a period where the economic expansion is likely to be coming in a bit softer than in the past,” said Mr. Pride. “Anytime you have a slow period like this, the concern that we are going to have a relapse starts coming up in the minds of investors.”While the Dow is now down seven of the last eight trading sessions, it is still up by nearly 3 percent from its lowest close this year, which was 11,613.30 on March 16.In the United States on Thursday, stocks had risen after the nation’s trade data showed the highest exports on record, reaching $175.6 billion in April. The gains ended a six-day losing streak and were the first time stocks rose in June.Phil , chief equity market Strategist at Federated Investors, said Friday’s decline likely was a retracing of Thursday’s rally as the weekend approached.“The fact that today is a Friday might be significant,” he said. “Investors have a tendency to not want to be long over a weekend. And the reality is that this euro zone and sovereign debt issue is very much in play.”As stocks fell, prices rose, partly riding the wave of recent strong sales of short and long bonds. The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 7/32, to 101 10/32. The yield fell to 2.97 percent, from 3 percent late Thursday.“The bond market does look to be in a sound position with momentum on its side after the Treasury’s successful sale” this week, said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.Energy stocks led the declines on the broader equities market, falling 1.88 percent, after reports that would increase production.Crude oil in New York fell $2.64 to close at $99.29 a barrel.fell 1.72 percent to $79.78. was down 1.54 percent at $99.67; declined 2.54 percent to $83.66 and was 2 percent lower at $48.The S.& P. was weak across the board, with consumer discretionary, industrials and materials among the sectors declining more than 1 percent.Financial stocks were also lower by more than 1 percent during the day, but closed down by about 0.7 percent.There is little relief in sight, Mr. Orlando said.“We have had a steady drumbeat of weak economic news,” Mr. Orlando said. “There is really nothing on the horizon to suggest in the very near term that trend is going to change.”'"

But Clara Luper was a seminal figure in the sit-ins of the civil rights movement.Ms. Luper, who led one of the first sit-ins — at a drugstore in Oklahoma City 18 months before the Greensboro action — died Wednesday at her home in Oklahoma City, her daughter Marilyn Hildreth said. She was 88.Ms. Luper was a history teacher at Dunjee High School in 1957 when she agreed to become adviser to the Oklahoma City N.A.A.C.P.’s youth council. The youngsters asked what they could do to help the movement.On Aug. 19, 1958, Ms. Luper led three other adult chaperons and 14 members of the youth council into the Katz Drug Store in Oklahoma City, where they took seats at the counter and asked for Coca-Colas. Denied service, they refused to leave until closing time. They returned on Saturday mornings for several weeks.The sit-ins received local press coverage. Eventually the Katz chain agreed to integrate lunch counters at its 38 stores in Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas and Iowa. Over the next six years, the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter held sit-ins that led to the desegregation of almost every eating establishment in Oklahoma City.'"
"'11-06-12,'0','But Mr. Hamilton, 75, was never in their camp. Over the years, he had watched work crews try to shore up the Old Man with cables, anchoring spikes and epoxy glue, and he agreed with geologists that the spot was too fragile.“We needed a different way,” he said, “to get back that whatever-it-is that grabbed everyone in the heart.”A nationwide contest was held. The Old Man of the Mountain Legacy Fund, a nonprofit group led by Mr. Hamilton, received 36 ideas for a memorial and chose three finalists. The winning design, by two artists in Essex, Mass., had two parts: a series of five huge boulders which, when viewed in alignment, would form the famous profile; and the seven profilers, whose bumpy tops form the outline of the Old Man’s face when lined up with the cliff.“We’re not naïve enough to think it’s ever going to be the kind of attraction it was,” Mr. Hamilton said. “But it will at least give people with feelings for the Old Man a sense of closure and his presence.”There are mixed feelings about the project in this region of the White Mountains, 145 miles north of Boston. Kim Cowles, a Franconia resident, said that the profilers did not wow her personally, but that she respected the intent.“There are people, especially future generations, who would have only heard stories and seen pictures,” she said. “But now they can have a better idea of what the Old Man was.”The profilers and a new plaza where they stand cost $250,000, all of it raised through private donations. Some donors have bought paving blocks for the plaza, inscribing them with messages for the Old Man: “Rest Well,” “Fallen Rock Star.” One is Mr. Hamilton’s own, repeating what he said every night for years as he passed the Old Man on his way home from work: “Good night, Boss.”The next phase of the project, the boulders, will cost $3 million, none of which has been raised. Mr. Hamilton had hoped to have it built by the 10th anniversary of the Old Man’s fall, but he concedes that is impossible.He hopes, though, that the profilers will draw more visitors to the park, which saw attendance plunge once the Old Man was gone. Morbid curiosity kept the place busy the summer after it fell, Mr. Hamilton said, but the crowds then ebbed sharply.Visitors to the Flume Gorge, also in Franconia Notch State Park, dropped to 131,919 in 2006 from 172,113 in 2002, according to state parks officials. And riders on the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway dipped to 74,525 in 2006 from 99,389 in 2002.Attendance figures have started rising again, according to John DeVivo, the general manager of the Cannon Mountain Ski Area and Franconia Notch State Park, but not to pre-2003 levels.Steve Heath, who owns the nearby Franconia Village Store and fly-fishes near the viewing area, said that as many as 50 cars would be parked there on summer nights before the Old Man fell.“Now the only people there are the fly fishermen,” he said. “You can’t ever replicate it, but they almost had to do something.”On a brilliantly sunny morning, Mr. Hamilton watched silently as a trickle of visitors encountered the profilers in the viewing area. Debby Reynolds, a tourist from Wheeling, Ill., figured them out after a minute and showed her husband Raymond what to do.“Hon, stand right here and look up,” she said.“Aha!” he replied. Mr. Hamilton’s face, wizened like the Old Man’s, lit up.Asked what she thought, Mrs. Reynolds, who had seen the Old Man as a child, allowed, “It’s kind of neat.”Ginny Nickerson of Deerfield, N.H., was more effusive. Her husband, Paul, an engineer, had read about the profilers and explained how they worked.“I was one of the people who cried when he went,” she said of the Old Man. “But this really does it for me.”Mr. Nickerson added, “It’s pretty hard to bring your children here and say, ‘Up there used to be.’ This helps, it really does.”Sue Clough of Gilford, N.H., raved about the profilers — “Phenomenal,” she said. But her husband, George, barely acknowledged them, fixing his gaze on the side of the cliff instead. He has never recovered from the loss, Mrs. Clough said.“To me,” Mr. Clough said softly, “it looks like an open grave.”Morning turned to afternoon, and the viewing area emptied. Mr. Hamilton considered how to ensure that the profilers were a success. A sign with instructions would be necessary, it seemed.“Once they get it, they get it,” he said.'"
"'11-06-12,'0','“She’s a top deal,” Julia’s owner, John Johnson, said as she escorted him around the grounds of his 15-acre estate outside Minneapolis. “She’s won awards. She looks at you, she’s got the most beautiful face.”“It’s a lot of money,” he said matter-of-factly. “It’s the speed, the smartness, the quickness — and you would not believe the roughness that she has inside. She’s like a little pit bull when she bites. She has that model face, and then opens the gums up and lets you have it.”Mr. Johnson said he got his first protection dog after receiving personal threats while he was running the Northland Group, a debt-collection company in Minnesota that he founded and eventually sold three years ago. Now he has six protection dogs, all German shepherds, and normally takes a couple in his car whenever he goes out.“It’s for both security and companionship,” he said as Julia nuzzled his leg, looking like a gentle enough companion. But when an intruder emerged near the tennis court of his estate, all it took was one command, “Packen!” (the bite command from the German word for “seize”), to send Julia racing across the lawn.She sunk her teeth into the intruder’s arm, which was encased in padding for a demonstration, and hung on even as he lifted her off the ground in a vain attempt to shake free of her. She let go only upon being commanded and then stood guard over her new prisoner, barking and threatening to bite again whenever he made a move to escape, which he wisely did not try.Julia’s was a controlled ferocity, which trainers distinguish from the anger manifested by ordinary dogs. When two dogs try to intimidate each other, they stiffen, growl, bare their teeth and stare intently. Protection dogs are trained to continue looking around and protecting their owners, not establish their own dominance.And, when commanded, they are supposed to switch instantly from attack mode to pet mode.“The dog has to get along with children,” Mr. Prather said. “The client is often a guy on his second family. He travels a lot, leaves his wife alone with the kids in a large house — maybe 30,000 square feet, so big you don’t even know what’s going on at the other side of the house. He wants peace of mind and a dog that his wife can handle. We don’t sell tank-stoppers.”The price tag for a protection dog has risen because of increasing demand in the United States, Latin America (especially Mexico), the Middle East, Asia and other places, said Mr. Prather and Wayne Curry, the owner of Kraftwerk K9 in Rochester, Wash.“I’ve turned down offers of more than $200,000 for one of my champion dogs,” said Mr. Curry, who added that he knew of a dog that had sold for more than $400,000 because of its bloodline and breeding potential. (Although Julia’s offspring most likely would have commanded top prices, Mr. Johnson said he had no time to breed her and instead had her spayed shortly after buying her in January.)To clients who can afford the $50,000 price for a typical well-credentialed dog, there are lots of ways to rationalize the price.“When you compare the costs of a full-time bodyguard versus a dog, the dog makes a lot of sense,” Mr. Curry said. “And the dog, unlike the bodyguard, can’t be bought off.”Mr. Prather said one client, a well-known entertainer, came to him after first trying to ward off a stalker by hiring bodyguards.“The stalker stabbed one of the bodyguards, got out of jail and started showing up again,” Mr. Prather said. “Then they got a canine, and they haven’t seen the stalker since. People just have an innate fear of animals with sharp teeth. We don’t want to be on the menu.”Mr. Prather’s dogs are trained for three years in Germany before they go to South Carolina, where they receive further training and are put to the test of family living. Before her sale, Julia lived for four months in the home of November Holley, the company’s vice president and head trainer.“I’ve probably trained a thousand dogs, and she’s the best I’ve ever seen,” Ms. Holley said. “The total package. Did absolutely everything you wanted, no questions asked. Good with kids, good with horses, good with cats. A perfect lady in the home.”Julia also proved her mettle as a babysitter, Ms. Holley added. “If my daughter Kailee was outside in the woods, I’d say, ‘Julia, where’s Kailee?’, and she’d go out and find her. She was like a person.”At her new home in Minnesota, Julia has a part-time trainer, Jeremy Norton, who also works as a firefighter in Minneapolis. Mr. Norton agreed that Julia was a special dog, but he smiled a bit uncomfortably when asked to explain the $230,000 price.“It’s in the eye of the beholder,” he said. “That’s as politic an answer as I can muster. I mean, Julia’s nice, but that’s half my house. There’s no way to wrap your head around that.”'"
"'11-06-12,'0','Only a churl would suggest that every word Jackson says about the Mavericks free agents DeShawn Stevenson, Tyson Chandler and J. J. Barea and the Heat free agents Mario Chalmers and Mike Bibby should be parsed, shaken and stirred. In such moments, what is he? The Warriors analyst? The ABC coach?In sports TV, who is this hurting? Even ESPN’s new ombudsman, which goes by the august name of the Poynter Review Project, has not weighed in. Maybe it will decide the subject is not as worthy as “The Decision.” After all, networks have long employed coaches, managers and players for game and studio jobs. (ESPN is virtually a halfway house for those caught between the booth and the locker room.)Many ex-coaches leave after a year or two. Some come and go and come and go (see: Doug Collins).Some never head back to sidelines or dugouts, like John Madden.A few, like Jackson, have kept calling the postseason for a network after being hired to run a team.One champion of this particular discipline is Doc Rivers. He was hired to coach the Boston Celtics in April 2004 yet continued to call ABC’s playoff games for another six weeks, through the N.B.A. finals.The Celtics were 36-46 that season and were swept in a first-round playoff series before he was hired.He had time to hire his staff, drive to Boca Raton to woo the free-agent-to-be Mark Blount and study for the finals. Whew! Between Games 2 and 3 of that year’s Lakers-Pistons finals, Rivers took a red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Chicago to attend a predraft camp with the Celtics. At the time, he was asked why he had not left ABC to spend every waking minute with the Celtics. He told The Boston Herald: “That’s just the way it is. I don’t worry about that at all. I just look at it that this is an obligation that I have to fulfill.”And didn’t that work out O.K.? In Rivers’s fourth season, the Celtics were N.B.A. champions.Collins spent slightly longer as a coach/analyst (or was it analyst/coach?) in 2001 when he was hired by Michael Jordan to coach the Washington Wizards while still employed as NBC’s lead N.B.A. game commentator. Collins has bounced frequently between coaching (he’s on his fourth team, the Philadelphia 76ers) and TV analysis on NBC and TNT. He’s lucky he’s so good at analysis because he burns out as a coach. As Wizards coach, he got to exult on TV in May 2001 as the dismal Wizards (19-63 in 2000-1 ) were awarded the No. 1 draft pick and then returned to his other job, calling games with Marv Albert.Jackson is likable enough to hope that he succeeds as a coach and does not suffer the fate of Matt Millen. Millen was a fine N.F.L. analyst at Fox Sports. After being named the president and general manager of the Detroit Lions, he called one last playoff game and then led the Lions through more than seven years of ignominy. Jackson must hope that he is, as he would say, better than that.'"
"'11-06-12,'0','Since its independence from Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea has clashed with almost all of its neighbors, most recently marching troops into Djibouti. Eritrea’s government prides itself on self-reliance and has steadily pushed out most international organizations, including several United Nations agencies and private aid groups. Few tourists or journalists ever visit.According to Eritrea’s Foreign Ministry, about 10 armed men working for Protection Vessels International arrived by boat at the remote island, which is known as Romia, in late November. Eritrean officials said the men took extensive still and video images of the island, its vegetation, its potential water supply and possible anchorage spots. Their actions were proof, the Eritreans said, that the men planned to set up a base there.In late December, some of the men went to Eritrea’s main port, Massawa, to get fuel and food. They were apprehended by Eritrean Navy officials, who discovered the arms cache and the computer files — which the contractors had tried to erase — that showed the surveillance activities.Mr. Gibbins did not deny that the contractors had stored guns on the island. He said bad weather and equipment problems had forced the contractors to make an unscheduled stop in Massawa, and they did not want to cause any alarm by showing up with the weapons.“This was a fuel resupply and repair, nothing more, nothing less,” Mr. Gibbins said.He said his company was a leading provider of armed escorts for ships passing through the pirate-infested waters off Somalia’s coast. “We carry weapons as part of our work,” he added.The Eritrean government says legal proceedings are continuing, but it has refused to allow British diplomats to visit the contractors. The British government, in return, has barred Eritrean diplomats from traveling outside London without written permission, according to Reuters.Eritrea also said that Protection Vessels International sent an agent posing as a tourist into the country. Mr. Gibbins did not deny the allegation. He said the company was in a rush to provide help for the unscheduled stop in Massawa and had dispatched an employee from Djibouti.“A standard method of moving in and out of any country for business is a tourist visa,” he said.Mr. Gibbins said he was mystified by the reports of the “poison-tipped” bullets, and suggested that the Eritreans were confused by tracer bullets, which have red-painted tips.'"
"'11-06-12,'0','MANY restaurants on Long Island claim to serve fusion cuisine, but Asian Bistro Next Door in Woodbury delivers on the promise with dishes like a perfectly cooked, crisp-skinned salmon atop a mélange of wild mushrooms, accompanied by a miso-truffle cream sauce. Then there is the minced chicken flatbread, which includes Thai basil, a soy reduction and Spanish Manchego cheese. Perhaps the ultimate marriage of East and West is the miso Caesar salad, with white miso and white anchovy fillets in the dressing.Asian Bistro Next Door opened in April in the quarters that housed Graffiti for many years, until that restaurant moved to the large space next door in November. Nicholas Hannides, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, is the owner of both places.Asian Bistro Next Door has the sleek, high style favored these days by upscale Asian restaurants. The color scheme is black and red, with a wall covered in wide strips of fabric in various shades of red. Tables and chairs are black and bare, accented by red napkins. Dramatic hanging lights are covered with panels of sheer fabric.The friendly, attentive staff members, who greet all comers in Japanese, are as stylish as the décor. Waitresses wear slinky black-and-red dresses slit to the thigh.The menu has 21 small plates as well as 18 entree-size selections, so diners can choose a traditional multicourse meal or take the small-plate route, which presents a chance to sample more dishes.My favorite among them was the mint beef lettuce wrap: tender sirloin grilled until rare and tossed with a chili-soy sauce, fresh mint leaves, a bit of toasted rice and red onions, with a stack of bibb lettuce leaves on the side. Though listed as a small plate, this was an entree-size dish. Less substantial but equally appealing was the lemongrass crab cocktail: three small bowls filled with lump crab splashed with lime juice and sitting on a nest of julienned mint, cilantro and lemongrass.'"

"'11-06-12,'0','MOST people know the scenario: It’s been days, maybe weeks, since the big convention, and you are finally sifting through the hodgepodge of business cards you’ve stuffed in a bag, jacket or desk drawer.A few cards conjure faces. As for the rest, who are all these people?Since the advent of the digital address book, the pitfalls of the traditional business card have cluttered the path from handshake to hard drive. Several Web sites and smartphone applications try to solve that problem by replacing the card; in some circles, it is already becoming a relic.Gina Trapani, founder of the influential blog Lifehacker, said the business card is already close to extinct in places like tech conventions. “I see people exchange Twitter handles, I see people scan each other’s badges,” and send one another quick e-mails from their phones, she said. “But I definitely don’t see people handing out cards anymore.”An app for the business networking site LinkedIn.com makes it easier to share contacts in person using Bluetooth.

Because that hit comedy written by and Annie Mumolo and directed by , turns out to be one of the few occasions this summer when you can enjoy a movie about and with women released by a major studio. From now through August, American films will again be almost all male, almost all the time (the occasional decorative gal pal notwithstanding) as this year’s boys of summer — the Green Lantern and Captain America, Conan the Barbarian and — invade the multiplex, seizing media-entertainment minds and your dollars.Mind you there are a few high-profile girls and women here and there, including the title character of “ ,” with as the romance- and etiquette-challenged teacher who at one point washes a car in slow motion while wearing a midriff and hot pants. Evidently nothing says new motion picture entertainment better than a female movie star in Daisy Dukes bending over and sudsing a car as if she were in a 2005 video.Mostly, this summer’s distaff stories look a lot like those from previous years: smaller dramas and romances from studio divisions and independents. In “Friends With Benefits,” and play acquaintances who try to keep the romance out of the bed just as and did in “ .” (Perhaps the filmmakers should have combined their efforts, ditched the guys and banked on a matchup between Ms. Kunis and Ms. Portman, paired so memorably in “ .”) The Danish director Lone Scherfig (“ ”) has the dewier-looking “ ,” a romance across the years with and .

Ms. Breillat has spent her career making the kind of pushy, aggressively impolite (incorrect) movies about women, sex and desire that are almost unknown in the outside the avant-garde. American women working in the commercial field, both studio and independent, tend to skew softer and safer, quirkier and cuter, and, really, considering how tough a sell that women’s stories are, it’s no wonder. The American independent filmmaker wrote, directed and stars in “The Future,” a relationship story that works quirk and cute hard, every so often piercing through its insistent whimsy to get at something like life.Considering the gender segregation that characterizes American film — “Bridesmaids” for her, “ ” for him — it’s no surprise that Ms. July isn’t the only performer who’s provided herself a juicy role.

"'11-06-13,'1','“A lot of fight for a little dough,” the theme declares.The campaign borrows a page from jokes that began appearing online in 2005, which became known as “Chuck Norris facts,” “Chuck Norris-isms” or “Chuck-isms.”The japes are in the form of boldly exaggerated statements about Mr. Norris’s prowess as a fighter, a man’s man and a human being.Some samples: “Chuck Norris can divide by zero,” “Chuck Norris played a game of Russian roulette with a fully loaded gun and won” and “Chuck Norris’s tears cure cancer. Too bad he has never cried.”The tone of voice that infuses the Chuck-isms, heavy with hyperbolic humor, is being used a lot in advertising lately as marketers seek to signal consumers with a nudge to the ribs that they know that we know they are trying to sell something.Examples include the “Most interesting man in the world campaign” for Dos Equis beer and the “Man your man could smell like” campaign for Old Spice.Mr. Norris does not appear in person in the Era campaign, as he has in infomercials for Total Gym fitness equipment. Rather, his likeness is seen on a tongue-in-cheek seal that appears in the ads.The seal is a circle that contains a drawing of Mr. Norris, the words “Chuck Norris approved” and three stars. Mr. Norris’s head and cowboy hat break out of the top of the circle, as if — in keeping with his tough-guy image — he cannot be confined.The seal is also being added to bottles of Era liquid, which are being redesigned this summer to display a new brand logo.The campaign, which is now under way, is the creation of the Toronto office of Leo Burnett Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe. Leo Burnett Toronto also creates campaigns for three other Procter laundry products: Bounce fabric softener, Cheer detergent and Gain detergent.The Era campaign takes a tack that is similar to the tones of recent campaigns for Cheer and Gain, which also use humor to try to garner attention.Cheer has run ads with an over-the-top English laundress character as well as soap-opera spoofs in the form of a mock serial, “Brighten Bay.”And Gain ads promise a “Good’er morning” with the scent of Gain. In one spot, a man getting dressed is captivated by how his shirt smells.Those on Madison Avenue with long memories may be surprised that Procter, once known for its earnestly straight-faced advertising, is now having some fun with its campaigns.But in a category like detergents, which is as prosaic as consumer marketing gets, a few laughs may help an ad stand out.“We’re always looking for ways to connect with our audience,” says Tara Murphy, brand manager for Era, Cheer and another detergent brand, Dreft, at Procter in Cincinnati.“Humor is a great way for a marketer to break through and get a message across,” she adds.Era had long been sold on its stain-fighting abilities. In March 2010, Procter reduced the brand’s list price as part of attempts to revamp its overall marketing in light of how consumers were changing their behavior because of the financial crisis and the recession.Like General Motors, which for decades had buyers climb a price ladder from lowest (Chevrolet) to highest (Cadillac), Procter has now priced its detergents that way. The hierarchy, from bottom to top, is Era, Cheer, Gain and Tide.The position for Era is “tough on stains, easy on your wallet,” Ms. Murphy says, and the brand “goes after consumers who want great stain-fighting at a great price.”“Era fills the need for those who want that straightforward performance at that right price,” she adds, “stain-fighting without the extras.”The campaign is intended to “bring the no-nonsense personality of Era to life through innovative marketing,” Ms. Murphy says, “using light humor to speak to this consumer in a unique way that is unexpected for laundry.”Mr. Norris is “a get-it-done kind of guy,” she adds, which “fits with Era.”In one commercial, two mimes on a city street are holding each other and sobbing.“Era detergent once took down a makeup stain with such ferocity,” a stern-voiced announcer says, “mimes everywhere started to cry — for real.”“Era,” the announcer concludes. “So much fight, it’s Chuck Norris approved.” As the bottle appears, a sound like a whip cracking is heard. Then the seal is stamped on screen next to the bottle as a metallic ka-chong kind of sound is played.In a second spot, two gunslingers are face to face in a showdown. Suddenly, one is distracted when a dollop of something red turns up on his neck.“Era detergent once karate-chopped a cocktail-sauce stain so hard,” the announcer snarls, “it sent it back in time.”In a third commercial, a Chinese man in a store is holding a teacup in his hand when almost all of it vanishes and he is left with only the handle.“Era detergent once head-butted a tea stain so hard,” the announcer says, “a cup of tea on the other side of the world felt it.”The same attitude is evidence in a banner ad for Web sites. The headline reads, “Era makes grass stains, stain themselves.”The posts from Procter on facebook.com/eradetergent take a similar tack.“Era once tackled a bacon grease stain with such force,” reads one, “other bacon grease stains started referring to Era as ‘the detergent that can’t be named.’ ”Another post refers indirectly to a sound effect from the commercials.“You don’t just buy Era, you hire it to open a bottle of Whoooppshh on stains,” it says. “Let’s practice the whiplike sound, Whoooppshh.”Another post reads: “It’s getting late in your dark laundry room. No worries, Era is on patrol.”Most of the Facebook users leaving comments on the Era page are getting into the act.“It’s Chuck Norris approved,” writes someone identified as Carlos Griego. “Got to work.”Someone identified as Brian Scott Hamilton writes that Era’s “secret ingredient” is “one drop of Chuck Norris blood,” adding, “His DNA can kill anything, even stains.”Someone using the name Michael Campbell writes: “It must be good if Chuck Norris approves of it. I’ll get kicked square in the face if I said different.”A couple of people leaving comments offer their own versions of Chuck-isms.“Chuck Norris doesn’t wash his clothes,” writes someone with the name Scott Forsyth. “His clothes wash him.”And someone identified as Bill Young writes, “There is nothing to fear but Chuck Norris himself.”There are, of course, negative comments, too. “Why do people like Chuck Norris?” writes someone identified as Christina Ferris. “He’s annoying and not a very good actor.”And someone identified as Sonia Francis writes: “Era is the boom with clothes. The commercials stink.”The fact that most comments are positive does not surprise Kim Koster, senior vice president and deputy global category leader for fabric mcare advertising at the Leo Burnett Toronto office.Through research, the agency and Procter learned that “our target consumer has a lot of affinity” for Mr. Norris, says Ms. Koster, who jokes that her status as “the deputy” fits right in with the actor’s roles in Westerns.Like Mr. Norris, the target consumer, primarily a woman ages 25 to 54, is “a fighter,” Ms. Koster says, “fighting to get the job done on a budget.”As a result, describing Era as offering “a lot of fight for a little dough” is “where we needed to be,” she adds.Despite Procter’s reputation for staid advertising, the wink-wink tone of the campaign makes sense because “the world is changing,” Ms. Koster says.“We have to find new ways to connect to our consumers,” she adds.Ms. Koster and Ms. Murphy say the campaign works even if consumers do not recognize that the statements being made about Era and Mr. Norris are exaggerated for effect, echoing the so-called Chuck Norris facts.“Whether you are in on the Chuck-isms joke or not, he has such credibility because of who he is,” Ms. Murphy says.“They know him, they recognize him, they believe him,” she adds.Mr. Norris was brought together with Procter and Leo Burnett Toronto through Platinum Rye Entertainment, an agency in New York and Beverly Hills, Calif., that is part of the Omnicom Group.A reporter e-mailed a spokeswoman for Procter some questions to be answered by Platinum Rye about how Mr. Norris became involved in the campaign and what he thinks about its humorous nature.When the spokeswoman, Sarah Pasquinucci, sent the answers, she said they had been written by Mr. Norris himself.The campaign seems “a good match,” Mr. Norris writes, adding: “It’s for Era, a brand, like me, that’s been around awhile. A brand you can trust.”The campaign is “the start of an effort to present a seal of approval that demonstrates and authenticates that the entity in or on which it appears is something I believe in,” Mr. Norris says.“This is the right opportunity for me,” he adds, “and the best environment imaginable for launching my seal of approval.”As for the humor, Mr. Norris writes: “I believe that for satire to work, it has to be based on widely held truths — on something that’s real.”“The scope and range of people young and old around the world that have been having fun with my public image over the years has amazed me,” he adds. “It’s very humbling.”“I don’t think the humor would work if people didn’t understand who I am and that I believe in the characters I portray and the values they are committed to protect,” Mr. Norris says.“They are the kind of values we all want to believe in,” he concludes.Although Procter declines to discuss the budget for the Era campaign, Ms. Murphy says that it represents a return to prominence for a brand that “hadn’t been advertising nationally for a while.”According to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP, Procter spent nothing to advertise Era in major media in 2007, 2008 or 2009. Ad spending last year totaled $7.3 million, Kantar reported.If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.

Under the new rules, agents will be allowed to search such databases without making a record about their decision.Mr. German said the change would make it harder to detect and deter inappropriate use of databases for personal purposes. But Ms. Caproni said it was too cumbersome to require agents to open formal inquiries before running quick checks. She also said agents could not put information uncovered from such searches into F.B.I. files unless they later opened an assessment.The new rules will also relax a restriction on administering lie-detector tests and searching people’s trash. Under current rules, agents cannot use such techniques until they open a “preliminary investigation,” which — unlike an assessment — requires a factual basis for suspecting someone of wrongdoing. But soon agents will be allowed to use those techniques for one kind of assessment, too: when they are evaluating a target as a potential informant.Agents have asked for that power in part because they want the ability to use information found in a subject’s trash to put pressure on that person to assist the government in the investigation of others. But Ms. Caproni said information gathered that way could also be useful for other reasons, like determining whether the subject might pose a threat to agents.The new manual will also remove a limitation on the use of surveillance squads, which are trained to surreptitiously follow targets. Under current rules, the squads can be used only once during an assessment, but the new rules will allow agents to use them repeatedly. Ms. Caproni said restrictions on the duration of physical surveillance would still apply, and argued that because of limited resources, supervisors would use the squads only rarely during such a low-level investigation.The revisions also clarify what constitutes “undisclosed participation” in an organization by an F.B.I. agent or informant, which is subject to special rules — most of which have not been made public. The new manual says an agent or an informant may surreptitiously attend up to five meetings of a group before those rules would apply — unless the goal is to join the group, in which case the rules apply immediately.At least one change would tighten, rather than relax, the rules. Currently, a special agent in charge of a field office can delegate the authority to approve sending an informant to a religious service. The new manual will require such officials to handle those decisions personally.In addition, the manual clarifies a description of what qualifies as a “sensitive investigative matter” — investigations, at any level, that require greater oversight from supervisors because they involve public officials, members of the news media or academic scholars.The new rules make clear, for example, that if the person with such a role is a victim or a witness rather than a target of an investigation, extra supervision is not necessary. Also excluded from extra supervision will be investigations of low- and midlevel officials for activities unrelated to their position — like drug cases as opposed to corruption, for example.The manual clarifies the definition of who qualifies for extra protection as a legitimate member of the news media in the Internet era: prominent bloggers would count, but not people who have low-profile blogs. And it will limit academic protections only to scholars who work for institutions based in the .Since the release of the 2008 manual, the assessment category has drawn scrutiny because it sets a low bar to examine a person or a group. The F.B.I. has opened thousands of such low-level investigations each month, and a vast majority has not generated information that justified opening more intensive investigations.Ms. Caproni said the new manual would adjust the definition of assessments to make clear that they must be based on leads. But she rejected arguments that the F.B.I. should focus only on investigations that begin with a firm reason for suspecting wrongdoing.'"

He assumes some duties that had been handled by Andy Sareyan, who before he left the company was serving as consumer brands president. Mr. Porter had most recently been chief executive at the Publishing Group of America, New York. The hiring of Mr. Porter was part of a series of executive changes at Meredith after the appointment of Tom Harty as national media group president; the other changes involve executives who oversee magazines like Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle and Fitness.¶Nina DiSesa joined the New York office of R3:JLB, formerly known as Jones Lundin Beals, as creative management consultant, overseeing a series of creative management workshops. She had most recently been chairwoman of the flagship New York office of McCann Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann Worldgroup unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.¶Shareholders of the Publicis Groupe, Paris, agreed to raise the age limit for members of the board to 75 from 70. The decision means that Maurice Lévy, chairman and chief executive, will be able to remain chairman after the expiration of his current term on Dec. 31. Mr. Lévy is 69 and will turn 70 on Feb. 18, 2012.¶Orbitz Worldwide, Chicago, said it would review its policies related to buying commercial time on television programs. The review came after complaints from activist organizations representing gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and the transgendered, which were made as part of an effort called “Drop Fox,” urging advertisers to stop buying commercial time on the Fox News Channel unit of the News Corporation.¶The Chevrolet division of General Motors agreed to become the official automotive sponsor of “The X Factor,” the new reality talent competition series on Fox Broadcasting, part of the News Corporation. The sponsorship mirrors that of the Ford division of Ford Motor on another Fox talent competition show, “American Idol.” In another example of dueling sponsorships between the two series, just as Coca-Cola is a sponsor of “American Idol,” Pepsi-Cola agreed to become a sponsor of “The X Factor.” ¶A second rating agency, Moody’s, has upgraded the unsecured debt and revolving credit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, New York, to investment grade. The Moody’s decision followed one by another rating agency, Fitch. The third, Standard & Poor’s upgraded Interpublic a notch last month but still does not rate it as investment grade.

"'11-06-13,'1','THE Arab Spring is inching its way into Saudi Arabia — in the cars of fully veiled drivers.On the surface, when a group of Saudi women used Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to organize a mass mobile protest defying the kingdom’s ban on women driving, it may have seemed less dramatic than demonstrators facing bullets and batons while demanding regime change in nearby countries. But underneath, the same core principles — self-determination and freedom of movement — have motivated both groups. The Saudi regime understands the gravity of the situation, and it is moving decisively to contain it by stopping the protest scheduled for June 17.The driving ban stems from universal anxiety over women’s unrestrained mobility. In Saudi Arabia that anxiety is acute: the streets — and the right to enter and leave them at will — belong to men. A woman who trespasses is either regarded as a sinful “street-walker” or expected to cover herself in her abaya, a portable house. Should she need to get around town, she can do so in a taxi, with a chauffeur (there are 750,000 of them) or with a man related to her by marriage or blood behind the wheel.Although the Islamic Republic of Iran could not implement similarly draconian driving laws after the 1979 revolution, given that women had driven cars there for decades, the theocratic regime did denounce women riding bikes or motorcycles as un-Islamic and sexually provocative. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, proclaimed in 1999 that “women must avoid anything that attracts strangers, so riding bicycles or motorcycles by women in public places involves corruption and is forbidden.”The Saudi regime, like the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Taliban in Afghanistan, the military junta in Sudan and the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria, ordains the exclusion of women from the public sphere. It expects women to remain in their “proper place.”'"
"'11-06-13,'1','The most recent episode began after American officials tracked a North Korean cargo ship, the M/V Light, that was believed to have been involved in previous illegal shipments. Suspecting that it was carrying missile components, they dispatched a Navy vessel, the destroyer McCampbell, to track it.“This case had an interesting wrinkle: the ship was North Korean, but it was flagged in Belize,” one American official said, meaning it was registered in that Central American nation, perhaps to throw off investigators.But Belize is a member of the Proliferation Security Initiative, an effort begun by President George W. Bush’s administration to sign up countries around the world to interdict suspected unconventional weapons. It is an effort that, like the military and C.I.A. drone programs, Mr. Obama has adopted, and one of the rare areas where he has praised his predecessor.According to American officials, the authorities in Belize gave permission to the United States to inspect the ship.On May 26, somewhere south of Shanghai, the McCampbell caught up with the cargo ship and hailed it, asking to board the vessel under the authority given by Belize. Four times, the North Koreans refused.As in the 2009 case, which involved the North Korean vessel the Kong Nam 1, the White House was unwilling to forcibly board the ship in international waters, fearing a possible firefight and, in the words of one official, a spark “that could ignite the Korean peninsula.” Moreover, the Americans did not have definitive proof of what was in the containers — and a mistake would have been embarrassing.“There is always a chance that the North is setting us up for a raid that they know will find nothing,” one official said. “So we want to make sure we don’t fall into a trap.”By happenstance, a group of senior officials from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — including a representative from Myanmar — was in Washington while the slow-speed chase was occurring 8,000 miles away. On May 27, when the group visited the Old Executive Office Building opposite the White House, Gary Samore, the president’s top nuclear adviser, addressed the officials, urging Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia to fully join the nonproliferation effort.He then surprised the Asian officials by telling them he had a “sensitive subject” to raise, and described the American suspicions, providing the group with a picture of the ship on its way to Myanmar. He reminded them that under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874, which was passed in response to the North Korean nuclear test in 2009, its vessels are to be inspected if “reasonable grounds” exist to suspect that weapons are being exported.“The Burmese official in the room protested that we were making accusations,” said one American official familiar with the exchange. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has denied stockpiling missiles or buying parts from North Korea. It repeated those denials during recent visits to the country by a midlevel State Department official and by Senator John McCain.American officials dismiss those denials, pointing to years of evidence of missile-related purchases during both the Bush and Obama administrations. But they concede they are mystified about Myanmar’s motives. The missiles that they believed were aboard the M/V Light have a range of about 350 miles, meaning they could hit parts of India, China, Thailand or Laos — all unlikely targets.The message apparently got across. A few days later, long before approaching Myanmar, the cargo ship stopped dead in the water. Then it turned back to its home port, tracked by American surveillance planes and satellites, and suffering engine trouble along the way.'"

"'11-06-13,'1','Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the Republican People’s Party, congratulated Mr. Erdogan on his success, but emphasized that he and his party would be scrutinizing the government’s approach to upholding democratic principles as any push for a new constitution went forward.The current Constitution was prepared after a military coup in the 1980s, and many here believe that it elevates protections for the state above those of citizens, at the expense of individual rights and freedoms. Under Mr. Erdogan’s stewardship, the government restored political and economic stability after years of turmoil, though opponents say the gains have come at the price of an increasingly autocratic exercise of power.Supporters credit Mr. Erdogan with elevating Turkey’s profile in the Middle East, turning the country into an increasingly assertive regional player at a time when several of its neighbors are locked in sometimes violent struggles for democracy. One of most violent, in Syria, Turkey’s neighbor to the southeast, has sent thousands of refugees spilling over the border.Mr. Erdogan has moved the country further up the road, although sometimes a bumpy one, to European Union membership. His party has brought the country strong economic growth of 8.9 percent, though unemployment remains stubbornly high at nearly 12 percent and income distribution remains uneven.But his party has moved from the reformist approach it took in the early years of its rule, leaving an opening for opponents like the Social Democratic Republican People’s Party, which had some success in the current balloting for 550 seats in Parliament in winning back centrist Turks wary of the conservative tack the ruling party has taken.“I support some of the party’s politics for stability in the country,” Bahar Forta, 62, a dermatologist, said as she was leaving a polling station at a high school in Sisli, an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Istanbul. “However, I also see that the power they hold — almost like a single-party system — will ultimately pave the way for an autocratic regime.”For many younger voters, their biggest concerns were violations of civilian liberties.“There is a thin line between stability and democracy,” said Mustafa Guler, 27, a computer technology consultant, who was on his way to vote.“Freedom for minorities is still an issue, alcohol use is controlled by a government agency,” he said, adding: “Even leave all that aside — what can be more absurd in this day and age than to close down YouTube? My vote is to break their majority.”Many Web sites, including YouTube, have been blocked in recent years by the government Internet Monitoring Agency, often without explanation.Critics point to the fact that Turkey currently has more than 60 journalists in jail, many charged with crimes related to their published work, according to the Turkish Press Association.At least two — Nedim Sener and Ahmet Sik, both investigative journalists critical of the A.K.P. and supportive Islamic organizations — have not been notified of their charges since their arrests in March.Despite these shortcomings, some liberal circles have praised government efforts in challenging the status quo of the powerful military, which has staged three coups and until recently maintained a virtually untouchable place in Turkish politics.The government oversaw a controversial trial of a group accused of plotting a coup against the ruling party in 2003. The investigation included the arrests of hundreds of officers, retired as well as active duty, tarnishing the military’s image and effectively eliminating it from politics.'"
"'11-06-13,'1','Audacious. That is the best way to describe the recent DC Comics announcement that it was renumbering its entire DC Universe line of comics: by September 52 series will have begun anew, each with an issue No. 1.Though comic book publishers resort to these restarts regularly, many collectors continue to snap up No. 1 copies in a belief that they, like the legendary Action Comics No. 1, which introduced Superman, will go up in value. Beginning a series at No. 1 is also a chance to grab new readers, who may be turned off by trying a comic book that has had, say, 543 previous installments. In the past many of these restarts still built on what had come before. But by starting fresh, DC means to signal that a degree in comic book lore is not necessary to understand these stories: it will be like experiencing Superman for the first time.From one standpoint this move looks like a stunt or a last gasp for the comic book industry, which has been dealing with reader attrition thanks to event fatigue, insular story lines, higher prices and the immersive world of video games. In 2006 Civil War, a tremendously popular event story line involving all of Marvel Comics’ heroes, had first-issue sales of more than 350,000 copies. This year the first-issue sales of its latest event, Fear Itself, were estimated around 130,000. (Expect more such stunts from Marvel. Last week the company announced that in October its long-running Uncanny X-Men series will publish its last issue, No. 544, and while no restart has been indicated, it’s not difficult to imagine a “new beginning” somewhere around the corner.)The move by DC also includes making the comics available for digital download on the same the day they arrive in stores. That is certainly no slam dunk for the publisher or the larger industry. “The main risk here is that if the digital delivery takes a big chunk out of comic book shop grosses, it could doom a lot of retail outlets,” Mark Evanier, a comic book historian, said in an e-mail exchange. DC needs those stores, he added, “to sell hardcover collections and action figures and other merchandise.”And while this renumbering is meant to offer fans a point at which to jump on the ride, for some it may be a place to jump off. “A certain part of the readership is put off by the nonpermanence of their comics. They know that a dramatic change — the hero getting married or killed, say — will be undone before long,” Mr. Evanier wrote.One of the new flagship series affected by the DC announcement is Justice League, written by Geoff Johns, who is the company’s chief creative officer, and illustrated by Jim Lee, a co-publisher, who has had a strong hand in refining or redesigning the costumes of the DC heroes. The men attended a panel at the Hero Complex Film Festival in Los Angeles on Saturday night and said that the first Justice League arc will take place in the past.'"

"'11-06-14,'1','The Securities and Exchange Commission moved to halt new share offerings in two companies after their independent auditors resigned.Investigators say that China Intelligent Lighting and Electronics and China Century Dragon Media failed to disclose that their independent auditors had quit after questioning the accuracy of financial statements, according to separate orders released Monday.The S.E.C. is seeking a so-called stop order to keep the firms and shareholders from selling stock under the faulty statements, the agency said in a statement.The S.E.C. formed a task force last year to investigate Chinese companies trading in the United States amid concerns that some might be doctoring financial statements to lure investors. The agency and exchanges have halted trading in more than a dozen firms since the inquiry began.The auditor for China Intelligent Lighting and Electronics of Guandong quit on March 24, citing accounting fraud involving forged bank statements, according to a June 10 S.E.C. order made available on Monday. The firm did not disclose the auditor’s claims until April 12, according to investigators. In a separate order, S.E.C. lawyers said that China Century Dragon Media made misleading statements after the company’s auditor resigned, citing an inability to verify bank records.Michael Quinn, a lawyer for China Intelligent Lighting and Electronics at K&L Gates, said the company on June 10 “filed post-effective amendments seeking to withdraw the registration statements that are at issue in the S.E.C.’s administrative proceeding, which would have the same effect as what the S.E.C. seeks to accomplish in this action.”'"
"'11-06-14,'1','Beazer Homes has fired its chief executive about three months after he agreed to give back $6.5 million in bonuses and profits from the sale of company stock in a deal with federal regulators.The executive, Ian McCarthy, had accrued those gains at a time when investigators said the company was committing accounting fraud. He acknowledged no wrongdoing.Allan Merrill, the company’s chief financial officer, will take over, the company said Monday.It also announced that Robert Salomon was named executive vice president and chief financial officer. Mr. Salomon joined Beazer in 2008 as the company’s chief accounting officer.She said Mr. McCarthy would receive a severance package, the terms of which would soon be filed with regulators. She said Mr. McCarthy was eligible for the severance package because he was not fired “for cause,” but was replaced because the board wanted a leadership change.Mr. McCarthy did not have a listed phone number in the Atlanta area, where Beazer is based.The surprise announcement sent shares sliding 5 percent, or 15 cents, to $3 a share Monday.“Our understanding is that this was not a long-planned transition and that the board had met a handful of times without management’s knowledge in order to decide what changes would be in the best interest” of shareholders, said Josh Levin, an analyst with Citi Investment Research.'"

"'11-06-14,'1','South Carolina’s governor, Nikki R. Haley, wants to make the dispute an issue in the presidential campaign, while Congressional Republicans have threatened to cut the labor board’s financing and have urged President Obama to withdraw the nomination of Lafe Solomon, the board’s acting general counsel, who brought the Boeing case.“It is absurd, in this country that represents free enterprise, that one unaccountable, unelected, unconfirmed acting general counsel can threaten thousands of jobs,” said Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina. “This is something you would expect in a third world country.”Although the president appoints the board’s top officials, the agency operates independently. Several Republicans have accused President Obama of carrying water for organized labor by having the board bring the case. Mr. Solomon and Obama administration officials say the White House has had nothing to do with the dispute.The White House has been largely silent about the case, although numerous Congressional Democrats have assailed Republicans for attacking an agency that they say is merely enforcing the law and protecting workers’ right to strike.Mr. Solomon brought the case after the machinists’ union filed a complaint, arguing that the South Carolina plan was illegally taking jobs from Washington State. As a remedy, he wants Boeing to move the 1,000-employee production line, which will initially build three planes a month, to Washington.Mr. Solomon said in an interview that he spent three months in settlement talks with both sides before the board filed the case, and that contacts continue intermittently. “Nothing would make me happier than to reach a settlement,” he said.In a speech last week at a conference at the New York University School of Law, he added: “I felt and still feel these parties have a longstanding relationship with each other. They have a deep past together and have a deep future together, and it would be advantageous to all if a settlement could be worked out.”Many legal specialists say the N.L.R.B. and the machinists’ union have a good chance of winning before the administrative law judge in Seattle and in the next stage of the legal process, an appeal to the Democrat-dominated, five-seat labor board in the District of Columbia. The case before the law judge is expected to last weeks as the board and Boeing spar over which documents to turn over to the other side.Boeing and some legal specialists say the company is likely to win in the federal circuit court that would hear appeals after that.But no one wants the case to drag on for years.The machinists’ union has hinted that it might drop the case if Boeing pledged to locate some future production in Washington State — perhaps the Air Force replacement tanker or the next-generation jet after the 787 Dreamliner or both.Tim D. Neale, a Boeing spokesman, said the company was open to a settlement, although he said the machinists were demanding too much.“We always like to keep an open line of communication with the union in situations like this, but at this point it’s unclear to us what a reasonable settlement would look like,” he said. “Our position continues to be that the complaint should be withdrawn. It should never have been brought in the first place because, given legal precedent, it will not withstand the scrutiny of the federal courts on appeal.”Boeing insists that the machinists’ union has nothing to complain about because the company has hired 2,000 unionized workers in Washington since it announced plans to open the South Carolina assembly plant.But Tom Wroblewski, president of the local at Boeing’s Puget Sound operation, said most of those 2,000 workers were temporary and many worked on a surge line that might close once the South Carolina operation gets up to speed.Several aviation consultants said Boeing could be reluctant to invest further in the South Carolina plant while the N.L.R.B. case hangs over its head.Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm, sees one possible route toward a settlement. He said production demands were so great for the Dreamliner that Boeing could expand its long-term production of aircraft to at least 10 a month in the Puget Sound area, from the planned seven, while still keeping the production line in South Carolina. That way, he said, Boeing could say the union cannot complain that its members had been hurt by creating the South Carolina production line. He said Boeing has recently talked of assembling 17 Dreamliners a month.The union hopes Boeing will commit to build its next-generation Dreamliner in Washington at a so-called supersite that would combine final assembly as well as component production. “Here in Washington State, we have the world’s most skilled work force for aircraft production,” Mr. Wroblewski said.He also suggested that Boeing could continue operating the plant in North Charleston, even without the Dreamliner, by moving some of its parts production from foreign contractors to the South Carolina plant. Analysts said that was an unlikely solution because it might involve breaching overseas contracts.Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group, predicts it will be very hard to reach a settlement. “There’s nothing to talk about here — there’s no halfway,” he said. “The strategy on the union’s side is to pursue this as much as they can while they have a political ally in the White House.”Joseph G. Marra, a Seattle lawyer who represents management in labor cases, said the machinists’ union has Boeing “over a barrel” in this case.“Executives from the company made statements about how they’re going to transfer work because people engaged in strikes or legal disputes,” he said. “As a former N.L.R.B. attorney, I think that’s a fairly straightforward case. This is not something that is unusual in the annals of the board. They would bring this case whether the investment was for $200 million or $200.”Nonetheless, Lea B. Vaughn, a labor law professor at the University of Washington, said she doubted the courts would ultimately require Boeing to move the South Carolina production to Washington because it would hugely interfere in a company’s investment decisions.“It’s hard for me to imagine an order that’s going to stand up in the long run in litigation because of the amount of investment they’ve made there,” she said.'"
"'11-06-14,'1','WASHINGTON — Facing intense opposition from Congressional Republicans and industry over a broad range of new air-quality regulations, the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that it was delaying by two months the release of a proposed rule on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other major pollution sources.The rule would have a major impact on the nation’s efforts to reduce emissions of gases blamed for climate change, and its postponement is the latest step by the E.P.A. to slow the issuing of regulations that critics say will slow economic growth, drive up energy costs and reduce employment.Its delay is a tacit admission that the regulations pose political, economic and technical challenges that cannot be addressed on the aggressive timetable that the agency set for itself early in the Obama administration.The agency said it was pushing back the new greenhouse gas proposal to the end of September to allow more time to consider comments from generators of electricity, environmental advocates and others during public-comment sessions. Officials said they still expected to have a final rule in place by May 2012.Scott Segal, a utility industry lobbyist in Washington, said the agency’s caution signaled an understanding that the new rule would have a profound effect on the price, supply and reliability of electricity by forcing modifications to, or the shutdown of, dozens of older power plants. He said the agency had several other major rules pending that would affect power plant operators.“This action admits the premise that the agency has literally overloaded itself with rule-makings,” Mr. Segal said. “They need to take more time.”But Frank O’Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch, an environmental advocacy group, expressed fear that the agency was backtracking on critical air-quality actions in the face of Congressional and industry pressure.'"
"'11-06-14,'1','As the Missouri River continued to rise to record levels, two protective levees ruptured Monday, sending floodwaters pouring over fields and toward small communities in Missouri and Iowa. The breaches had been expected in both Hamburg, Iowa, and Big Lake, Mo. Despite the construction of secondary levees to hold back the water, evacuations were under way because of concerns that those hastily built barriers might also fail. The dam-controlled river, which has caused flooding from Montana to Missouri because of record rain and snow, is expected to remain at flood levels for the next two months.'"
"'11-06-14,'1','The youngest brother, Willie, became perhaps the best amateur in history after Jones. Known as Willie the Wedge for his adroit bunker play, he won the United States Amateur in 1938 and 1948 and the British Amateur in 1947. He also played on three winning Walker Cup teams, captaining the 1951 squad.The brothers flooded the United States Open from the 1920s through the 1950s, a stretch when the tournament hardly seemed official without a Turnesa in the field.Seventy years ago, three of them — Jim, Mike and Willie — played in the 1941 Open at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth. This would have set a record for the most siblings in the tournament, except that three Turnesas had already done it: Joe, Mike and Phil played in the 1932 Open at Fresh Meadow Golf Club on Long Island. And the 1942 Hale America National Open, held in lieu of the wartime-canceled Open, featured Mike, Joe and Jim.In 1946, six brothers played in the same Open qualifier, but only Mike and Willie made it into the field. Joe, who won 15 PGA Tour events, lost the 1926 Open to Jones by a stroke on the final hole.The last of the seven brothers, Willie, died in 2001 at 87, a year after Mike. But the Turnesa dynasty continues, and not just with Marc, who has been grinding it out on the PGA Tour and won in Las Vegas in 2008.There are four other Turnesas teaching golf in the New York metropolitan area. Marc’s father, Mike Jr., 65, is the longtime pro at Rockville Links Club on Long Island. Marc’s brother, Mike III, 35, is an assistant pro at Saxon Woods, a public course in Westchester.Marc’s uncle Jim Turnesa — Jim and Mike Jr. are Mike’s sons — is a teaching pro at the Westchester Golf Range in White Plains, where decades ago, the Turnesas often practiced and taught. Jim is assisted by his son, Chris, 25, an aspiring teaching pro who is an insurance salesman by day.“It may not be seven touring brothers in contention for major championships, but we’re still carrying on the Turnesa name in our own way,” Jim said recently after teaching lessons in sweltering heat in an area at the end of the range beside an uneven artificial putting green and the parking lot, a long way from this week’s United States Open.For all of their elite achievements, the seven brothers also spent considerable time as teaching pros at New York metropolitan area clubs, a tradition carried on by Jim, Chris, Mike Jr. and Mike III.Jim, who charges $110 an hour, teaches his father’s advice about avoiding the tendency to swing “over the top” of the ball by having the student visualize pulling his left hand toward his left pocket when starting the downswing. Michael Magnone, a member at Knollwood Country Club in Elmsford, N.Y., learned from Mike Turnesa years ago and is now a student of Jim’s.“The Turnesa brothers won because they had a simple approach to the game, and Jim has the same approach,” Magnone said. “Like his father, he doesn’t have a lot of tricks. They both try to get you to move off your right side on the downswing and follow through.”Although each of the current Turnesas competes in local tournaments, the family stardom now falls to Marc, who is said to have his grandfather Mike’s putting stroke and the short game of his great-uncle Willie.In their later years, Willie and Mike watched Marc dominate junior tournaments and critiqued his game at Knollwood, their home club, where Mike served as the head pro for 44 years. They would offer Marc tips and regale him with tales about playing against Sam Snead and Hogan.“Whatever city I’m in, people always come up and say, ‘Hey, are you related to the famous golfing Turnesas?’ ” Marc said. “They may say, ‘I caddied for Mike’ or ‘I knew Joe.’ It’s flattering. It never gets old.”Marc played in only one major before this year’s Open, missing the cut in the 2009 P.G.A. Championship, a tournament that his great-uncle Joe lost in the finals to Walter Hagen in 1927, and his grandfather Mike lost in the finals to Hogan in 1948.Other near victories by the brothers contributed to something of a bridesmaid’s curse, a family jinx against winning a major that was eventually broken when Jim won the P.G.A. in 1952.The seven Turnesa brothers grew up with nearly 50 courses within a 15-mile area of their home, clubs that produced stars like Gene Sarazen and Tony Manero. They were spoken of as if they were a circus act or a biblical tribe, and it was said that they were to golf what the Kennedys were to politics. They competed against legends like Hagen, Jones, Hogan, Sarazen and Byron Nelson. They hobnobbed with Babe Ruth, Ed Sullivan, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. In 1938, RKO flew the brothers to Bermuda to make a short newsreel film, “The Golfing Brothers,” with the three youngest professionals playing against the three oldest for a bottle of Champagne.Born to Italian immigrants who spoke little English, the Turnesas grew up poor. Their father, Vitale, was a greenskeeper at Fairview Country Club in Elmsford and he was known to taste the soil to determine its mixture of nutrients. He was a nongolfer who continually chased his sons off Fairview’s fairways and worked too many hours to pay much attention to their accomplishments. The boys taught one another the game and would practice as they walked to school, hitting shots back and forth in open fields. Mike’s widow, Mary Turnesa, said her husband would talk of how the brothers slept in the same bed and wore holes in the living room rug from practicing at night.Now 97, Mary sat at Knollwood last week reeling off stories of how she cooked big Italian meals for Sullivan, Hope and Dean Martin. The brothers set up a makeshift course around their house and called it Turnesa Country Club, she said, and would work shagging balls, caddying and winning local caddie tournaments.The boys’ mother, Anna Turnesa, a devout Catholic, kept a religious shrine in the living room and would haul off the trove of trophies and medals won by her sons, and donate them to church charities.“How does that happen that you have that many brothers in the game and they all accomplished what they did?” Marc said. “I guess it was a different world then. All they had was golf, and they helped each other with their games.”When asked to compare the seven brothers to the current Turnesas, he jokingly said, “Tell them to get their act together.”Marc’s brother, Mike III, said he had no interest in taking up the grueling life of a touring pro. He pointed out that the pool of competitive golfers was much deeper today, and life was much less single-minded.“We didn’t come up like those seven brothers did,” he said. “They had no money, and they got hold of a used club and all they did was practice.”Mike III has been teaching golf since he was a teenager. He shrugs off the pressures of the Turnesa pedigree and jokes that his grandfather left him with stories about the legends he played with, and a “big duck-hook.”He added: “As a kid, I used to hit a big old slice, and once when I was at Westchester Golf Range, my grandfather told me to use my right hand more. I started doing that, and now to this day, I can’t stop hooking it.”Six of the seven brothers had children, but most of them were girls. Willie’s son, Charles, is not an avid golfer, and Joe’s son, Joe Jr., played competitively and went on to become a fixture on the PGA Tour for decades, but for furnishing tour players with equipment as an executive with Titleist.As for the next generation of Turnesas, the three younger Turnesa men are unmarried.“We’re working on it,” joked Chris, who gathered with other family members for dinner last week at Knollwood, whose hallways are something of a Turnesa museum, lined with old photographs and exhibits.Mike Jr. stood near the club room accepting congratulations from members for Marc’s having qualified for the Open. He gazed at old photographs of his father and his uncles playing in the Open. A picture of his son would soon freshen the display.Someone observed that it was June again at Knollwood and another Turnesa was playing in the national championship.'"
"'11-06-14,'1','In 2006, after Russia turned off the flow to Ukraine in the dead of winter, the European Commission cranked up plans developed a few years earlier to build a pipeline, called Nabucco, that would deliver gas to Europe from the Caspian region and bypass Russia.A year later, Gazprom and Eni, a major Italian energy company, introduced plans for South Stream. At the same time, Russia also has sought to deny Nabucco vital gas supplies in Asia and woo away its customer base in the West, in a contest that has been compared with the intricacies of a chess game.In one instance in 2007, Vladimir V. Putin, then the president of Russia, agreed with the leaders of Turkmenistan to build a new pipeline north, to Russia, depriving Nabucco of potential supplies of gas.Two years later, Mr. Putin traveled to Turkey to secure an agreement allowing Gazprom to carry out environmental and seismic tests necessary for building South Stream, just one month after European governments signed a transit agreement with Ankara for Nabucco.It is no surprise, therefore, that both projects remain plagued by uncertainties. One big reason for skepticism is the cost.The South Stream bill is estimated to be at least 15.5 billion euros, or $22.3 billion. That is about double what Nabucco was expected to cost, at least initially, largely because Nabucco would not run under such a large body of water as the Black Sea, and because Nabucco would carry less gas.Many analysts say that they expect Gazprom, the most important backer, to revise South Stream’s price tag upward this year, as the prices for necessary commodities like steel and cement climb.At the same time, new sources like shale gas and liquefied natural gas are putting downward pressure on natural gas prices, making it harder for potential investors to forecast adequate returns.Nabucco will have to deal with similar pressures. But it also would have public backing, including exemptions from European Union rules requiring it to share its infrastructure, as well as financing from the European Investment Bank.Marcel Kramer, the Dutch-born chief executive of South Stream, denied during a recent interview that his pipeline was little more than Moscow’s attempt to squash Nabucco.“To do such a major exercise as a sort of defensive move would be highly irrational,” Mr. Kramer said. “There is no doubt that this is very serious, and money is being spent — considerable amounts of preparatory money is being spent — by Gazprom itself.”Mr. Kramer emphasized that a growing number of blue-chip European energy companies including EDF, the French utility that is Europe’s largest electricity company, and Wintershall, a German oil and gas unit of BASF, were already expressing support for South Stream, showing that it was a “project of European interest.”The main question for Europe, however, is the source of the gas, not who owns the pipeline.Disputes between Russia and Ukraine — long the established route for sending Russian gas to Europe — have led Gazprom to cut supplies in the past five years, leaving downstream parts of Europe without enough fuel to heat homes in winter.Since then, European leaders have made finding non-Russian sources a priority.Nabucco has been plagued by one delay after another, however, largely because the consortium of energy companies behind it has no firm supply contracts lined up. That makes it more difficult to secure financing.Reinhard Mitschek, the managing director of Nabucco Gas Pipeline International, said last month that gas should start flowing in 2017, three years later than was originally planned. But he did not announce any firm deal with a supplier. Talks with the Azeri government to obtain gas from the Shah Deniz II field in Azerbaijan, for example, have so far not yielded a solid commitment.In fact, Russia has long held influence in the Caspian region and wants to tap natural gas there, too. Iraq also could choose to export its gas in liquefied form to world markets rather than sending it through pipelines to Europe.South Stream is already serving to “sow doubts among central Asian countries about the viability of Nabucco,” said Mr. Egenhofer, the energy expert.South Stream’s backers say that Europe needs to reinforce its access to Russian gas at a time when Europe’s domestic production, in areas like the North Sea, is falling and unrest in the Arab world is raising questions about reliability from sources there.Countries like Germany also may end up driving demand for gas higher by shuttering nuclear power plants in the wake of the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, countering suggestions of possible oversupply.“There are several reasons to think the market will tighten again,” said Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Eni, the joint-venture partner with Gazprom in South Stream, speaking last month in Brussels at a promotional event for South Stream.Yet despite reporting a profit of around ¤19 billion in 2010, Gazprom faces its own financing challenges.Gazprom and the Russian government are pressing the E.U. authorities to relax rules requiring operators like South Stream to open up pipelines to competitors, saying that would affect its rate of return and make the project extremely difficult to carry out.In the meantime, Gazprom still needs to lock in its European partners.EDF is looking at the “technical feasibility and viability” of South Stream, Bruno Lescoeur, the head of gas for southern Europe, said in Brussels last month.Stefan Leunig, a spokesman for Wintershall, said his company was still negotiating the precise amounts of gas it would take from South Stream as part of a deal with Gazprom that could lead to an investment of 1.5 billion euros or more to help build the offshore part of the pipeline.Sven Pusswald, a spokesman for OMV, an Austrian energy company that is also working with Nabucco, said a definitive study on the cost and the route of the pipeline was necessary “before we’re able to proceed” with South Stream.With neither South Stream nor Nabucco beginning operations anytime soon, some experts say the real danger for Europe may be continuing to focus on new pipelines rather than improving existing routes.“Frankly, neither of these pipelines make economic sense,” said Massimo Di Odoardo, a senior global gas analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It would be much cheaper for Russia and Europe to accept their interdependence and get to work making Ukraine an even more reliable gas corridor.”Romano Prodi, the former president of the European Commission and former Italian prime minister who turned down an appeal in 2008 by Mr. Putin to lead South Stream, said a decision like that was ultimately one for European leaders.There was still the possibility that shale gas could “completely disrupt the market,” he said, reducing the need for imports over all. But during an interview, he underlined that reserves of shale gas in Europe — and the public acceptance of the environmental impact of extracting shale gas — were still in question.The same applies for new pipelines.“They are not out of reality,” but would require great political will to push either through, he said.'"
"'11-06-14,'1','Even young adults without major medical problems often go without regular health care after leaving their pediatricians. One cause is poor access to insurance, as young adults age out of their childhood coverage, public or private. The transition years are a high-risk period in this regard. A report released in May by the Commonwealth Fund found that in 2009, a third of the 19- to 29-year-olds in this country had no coverage, though it predicted improvement with the Affordable Care Act, the health care law enacted in March 2010.There are few distinct medical dividing lines between pediatric care and adult medicine. Pregnancy has been one traditional marker; get pregnant and you move on to the women’s clinic (other reproductive health needs are often met by pediatricians, including adolescent medicine specialists).Indeed, in recent years pediatricians have had to do some catch-up learning about a number of conditions that we used to think of as belonging more to adult medicine — hyperlipidemia and Type 2 diabetes, for instance, or high blood pressure. This is in part a result of the growing population of obese teenagers, along with a fuller awareness of the importance of finding and treating early stages of adult chronic diseases.Conversely, adult specialists have increasingly needed to learn how to handle adults with a range of problems once limited to pediatric practices.When I was doing my residency during the 1980s, we took care of adolescents with cystic fibrosis, knowing that many were unlikely to live past their 20s — it was a pediatric disease, and the experts were pediatricians. Not that long ago, there were relatively few grown-up survivors of complex congenital heart disease, for example, or childhood cancer, or congenital H.I.V. infection.But life expectancy for all these patients has lengthened significantly, necessitating a deliberate effort to create adult centers with adult expertise in these diseases — places to catch young patients as they exit pediatric care. And cystic fibrosis is often cited as a particular success story, with those adult centers functioning well for the patients who now live for many decades past leaving pediatric care.Dr. Mary R. Ciccarelli, associate professor of clinical medicine and pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, directs a program called the Center for Youth and Adults with Conditions of Childhood. “In the past, what we’ve done is feel successful because youth have survived to 18,” she said of children with these complex medical problems. These days, success should mean that an 18-year-old with such a condition is not only surviving, but also learning the skills to manage all the different health care pieces going forward — “a much taller order.”Dr. Renata Arrington Sanders, assistant professor of pediatrics and adolescent medicine at Johns Hopkins University, has developed tools for pediatric providers to assess certain checkpoints of maturity that young patients need to function as adults in the health care system — knowing your medical history, knowing how to obtain and transfer your records, knowing how to get and refill prescriptions, how to contact an insurance company.The goal is to get doctors, and parents, thinking along these lines early in a child’s adolescence. “People think, ‘I don’t need to do this till 18,’ ” she said. “Eighteen is probably too late.”There is no established ritual for leaving your childhood doctor, whatever I may have imagined as my patient marched across her high school stage. But helping a family make that transition successfully may be one of the most important services a pediatrician can provide. As the valedictorian’s cliché goes, commencement is supposed to represent a beginning, not an ending.'"
"'11-06-14,'1','The odds that a Medicare patient will die after undergoing one of eight high-risk operations have fallen sharply, an analysis of medical records has found.Fewer hospitals are performing these procedures, and the hospitals that do them are high-volume facilities that tend to have more experience caring for high-risk patients, the researchers found. But that trend does not fully account for the decline in deaths.Patients who had surgery to repair abdominal aortic aneurysms experienced the steepest decline in mortality in the analysis. Their death rate fell to 2.8 percent in 2007-8 from 4.4 percent in 1999-2000 — a 36 percent drop, due mostly to new medical technology, the researchers said.Death rates also fell among patients after operations to treat cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, lung and bladder, and among those who had had coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement and carotid endarterectomy, according to the study, published this month in The New England Journal of Medicine.The declines in mortality translate into about 2,000 fewer deaths each year, said Dr. John D. Birkmeyer, director of the Center for Healthcare Outcomes and Policy at University of Michigan and the paper’s senior author. Much of the improvement stems from a new emphasis on patient safety, Dr. Birkmeyer added.'"
"'11-06-14,'1','Middle-aged women who were single when they had their first child are in worse health than similar women who were married when first giving birth, suggesting that the stress of being a single parent has long-term health consequences, a new study has found.The report, published June 2 in American Sociological Review, is one of the first to assess the health of single mothers. Researchers analyzed data on 3,400 women taken from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which tracks the health of a nationally representative sample of people who were ages 14 to 22 when the survey started.The mothers were asked at age 40 to rate their health with a type of self-assessment considered a highly accurate indicator of health and future mortality.Both black and white women who had children outside of marriage ranked their health as worse than women who had their first children while married. That was not the case, however, for Hispanic single mothers, who are more likely to have children in long relationships that closely resemble marriage, the authors said.The findings are of concern because unmarried women account for almost 40 percent of births in the United States, up from 10 percent in 1960, said Kristi Williams, an associate professor of sociology at the Ohio State University and the paper’s lead author.'"
"'11-06-14,'1','Sunscreen is supposed to protect skin. But some people suspect that a chemical in sunscreen, absorbed through the skin, may be even more hazardous than the sun’s rays.The concerns stem from a small body of research indicating that oxybenzone, which blocks ultraviolet light, may mimic the effects of estrogen in the body and promote the growth of cancer cells. One study found that rats eating high doses of the chemical experienced side effects like abnormal uterine growth.But in March, researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York published an independent report examining all the evidence on the subject and concluded that the alarming findings from early animal studies relied on unrealistic dosages. In rat study, for instance, the animals were fed levels of oxybenzone that would never be achieved in humans through normal exposure to sunscreen.The researchers also reviewed the data on oxybenzone tested on humans. Men and women do seem to absorb small levels through normal sunscreen use, but there was no evidence that it set off hormonal changes. Nor did the researchers find evidence of toxicity. While the idea of a compound in sunscreen being absorbed through the skin may sound alarming, the report’s authors pointed out that this commonly occurs with skin care products.For those who have reservations, some sunscreens are now made without oxybenzone, though they may not offer the same ultraviolet protection.Exposure to oxybenzone, through normal sunscreen use, is safe, studies find.'"

"'11-06-15,'0','A night on Broadway that was elusive for so long — the opening of “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” — came at last on Tuesday and included a reunion that once seemed truly improbable: Julie Taymor, the musical’s director of record, on stage for the curtain call hugging onetime collaborator Bono and the producers who ousted her.After months of setting theater records, like a $70 million budget and 183 preview performances (compared with the usual 30), “Spider-Man” unfolded flawlessly before a buoyant celebrity audience that included former President Bill Clinton sitting in Row N beside his old friend Bono, of U2, the show’s composer with his band mate the Edge.Ms. Taymor looked tan and hale and smiled broadly as she returned to the Foxwoods Theater three months after the producers and Bono and Edge — her fellow creators for nine years — removed her as part of a creative overhaul of the show.Before the performance, Ms. Taymor walked the red carpet outside the theater and was deluged by photographers, cameramen and reporters asking variations of the same question: How do you feel?Perhaps her most memorable response was to one television reporter who asked, referring to the musical, “Do you miss being a part of this?”'"
"'11-06-15,'0','Apple’s reality distortion field has enveloped J. C. Penney. The department store chain poached Ron Johnson, the man behind Apple’s stores, to be its eventual chief executive. The hiring helped lift J. C. Penney’s market value by nearly a fifth, or $1.2 billion, before edging back a bit at the end of trading on Tuesday. It is true that Mr. Johnson also spent 15 years at the retailer Target, but Apple’s halo looks too wide.When Apple opened its first retail stores in Tysons Corner, Va., and Glendale, Calif., a decade ago, the concept was widely derided as folly. Almost no one could understand why consumers would be more inclined to buy computers and gadgets in an Apple store instead of in any number of other electronics shops. After all, places like Circuit City offered a wider selection of brands for comparison.But Mr. Johnson pulled it off — and in style. Circuit City is long gone while Apple commands some of the highest sales per square foot of any retailer. Its more than 300 stores worldwide generated $10 billion in revenue in the last fiscal year and accounted for almost one in every eight dollars of Apple’s operating income. And Mr. Johnson is no one-hit wonder, either. He was instrumental in one of the more unlikely retail transformations, turning Target from a dowdy Midwestern chain into a popular destination for chic suburbanites.Still, investors may be expecting too much. A little Apple marketing goes a long way. New iPads and iPhones practically sell themselves. Wrangler jeans and American Living polo shirts don’t. J. C. Penney also lacks Apple’s rabid fan base and a commensurate product development team.There’s a simple measure of the exuberance. Mr. Johnson undoubtedly has contributed to Apple’s powerhouse status. But Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, can claim a far larger role reinventing a nearly bankrupt company into one worth more than $300 billion. When Apple announced Mr. Jobs was going on indefinite medical leave in January, the share price fell 2 percent. However great Mr. Johnson’s retailing prowess, his appointment probably doesn’t justify a stock move at J. C. Penney of almost an order of magnitude larger.It’s back to the classroom for Glencore investors. Just when they were getting their head around its moving parts, the commodity trader — which went public in an initial offering last month — has shown it can be unpredictable.'"
"'11-06-15,'0','“We’re being squeezed on all sides,” he says.Each month, the National Federation of Independent Business surveys the owners of small businesses about how they are doing and where they think the economy is going. One question asks whether businesses plan to increase or decrease the number of employees in the next three months. Economists then calculate a net hiring figure by subtracting the percentage of companies that plan to downsize from the percentage that plans to expand.In May, the share of companies that planned to shrink their work forces was one percentage point higher than the share of companies that planned to expand them, the first time since last September that this indicator was negative. And even though it was slightly negative, this index, a fairly reliable indicator of hiring decisions, has been trending downward all year.The unemployment rate has been stubbornly high in the last year, primarily because companies have stopped hiring, not laying off more workers. Although layoffs were at a record low in April, the latest monthly data available, Tuesday’s survey suggests that workers may soon be challenged by both sides of the employment ledger.With wages relatively stagnant in recent months, the ’s consumer sentiment survey found that workers’ expectations for their families’ income growth over the next year were at a record low. This is the first recovery in which, seven quarters in, there have been zero gains in aggregate wages and salaries.Stagnant wages, coupled with the recent stock market slide and further declines in housing prices, have left consumers feeling not well-off enough to significantly increase their spending, which would encourage hiring.“One thing you’ve got to understand is that we do not hire workers for the sake of hiring workers. We hire them to do jobs,” Mr. Goodnight said. “If we don’t have the work coming in, nothing will make me hire another person.”When asked about the “single most important problem” facing their businesses, about one in four cited “poor sales,” according to the federation’s survey. Uncertainty over regulations is also mentioned frequently. About a third of businesses blame either “ ” or “government requirements” for their current troubles, leading some economists to attribute the recent slide in overall business optimism to ’s protracted debates over tax policy, financial changes and health care.Meanwhile, larger businesses, sitting on mountains of cash, have been weathering the weak recovery relatively well.The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook survey, also released on Tuesday, is a less closely watched report that relies on responses from the chief executives of larger companies. It found that the number of large companies expecting their American work forces to grow in the next six months far outnumbers those that anticipate shrinkage.“What we’ve had is a tale of two recoveries,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. “Between large businesses and small businesses, it is literally the best of times and the worst of times.”Several factors have helped larger companies succeed, economists say., a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President , said, “Larger businesses have consistently had more going for them in this recovery.”He added: “They have better access to markets. They have greater ease in exporting abroad where some economies are growing faster than ours. All that shows up in their profits.”The one potential bright spot in the small-business survey involves industries that have had the smallest job growth but now seem willing to add jobs, according to William C. Dunkelberg, the chief economist for the federation.These include construction and nonprofessional services like restaurants, which was crippled by the housing bust. Manufacturing, which had been the engine of job growth for many months before scaling back in May, also showed promise.'"
"'11-06-15,'0','Several cities are known to be relatively hospitable to the travelers, among them San Francisco, New Orleans, Philadelphia and Richmond, Va. In New York, the group has become such a fixture in Tompkins Square Park that the area where members have generally assembled — near the park’s western edge, just south of the Temperance Fountain — is known as Crusty Row.There, the travelers could typically be found relaxing on wooden benches and whiling away the hours talking (adventurous tales of illicit rail travel were popular), drinking (preferred beverages included cheap vodka, malt liquor or “space bags,” the name given to the silvery bladders found in boxes of wine) and smoking (self-rolled cigarettes predominated).Dozens of the nomads would set up what seemed like semipermanent encampments along the row, at one point designating their territory with a black flag emblazoned with a skull and crossbones. Many would arrive at the park shortly after the 6 a.m. opening time and remain until the midnight curfew, leaving in between only to avail themselves of free meals handed out on Avenue A or to ask for spare change on St. Marks Place.Last summer, a steady flow of the travelers frequented the park from May through September. During that time, a local photographer, Steven Hirsch, documented the visitors’ presence and recorded their stories on a blog, crustypunks.blogspot.com. This year, Mr. Hirsch theorized that the visitors were steering clear of their usual haunt to avoid a blizzard of summonses that he said the police began issuing late last summer for infractions like drinking in public or lying on a bench.A street poet who goes by the name L.E.S. (for Lower East Side) Jewels, a Crusty Row regular who lives in New York year round, agreed with Mr. Hirsch. On a recent afternoon, he sat on a bench in Tompkins Square Park, away from the Row, and ruminated in rhyme on the absence of his more mobile comrades:“It’s a park, it’s for all, for all to be,and Tompkins Square now is just a memory,it ain’t like it used to be.drinking vodka like I do anywhere,next thing you know you got a pair of cuffs on,and those silver bracelets, they ain’t no fun.”Over the years, some people who frequent the park have expressed distaste for the travelers, saying that too many drink alcohol openly and that they tend to create a disorderly atmosphere. Others have been more tolerant, arguing that whatever harm the travelers cause is only to themselves. Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community Board 3, suggested that many East Village residents had accepted the visitors.“People just don’t make a big deal about them,” Ms. Stetzer wrote in an e-mail, adding, “At least they are quiet.”On a recent afternoon, Crusty Row was empty, save for a few parkgoers. Levent Gulsoy, 55, gazed toward the empty row of benches where the travelers used to gather. “That’s not a good sign,” he said. “When one species disappears, others tend to follow.”'"
"'11-06-15,'0','When he qualified last week by winning a playoff in Vero Beach, Fla., he said he could not hold back his emotions.“I know what some people say, he’s never had to work for anything — silver spoon and all — and his grandfather gives him everything, but that’s just not true,” he said. “You don’t inherit golf ability. I’ve had to work for this my whole life, and I’m finally here. I earned this. No one gave this to me, and that feels so good.”Saunders, who is lankier than Palmer but has similar large hands, played basketball before homing in on golf when he was 10 or 11. He made the high school golf team when he was a seventh grader and later won a Florida state championship.He was a natural, said his father, Roy Saunders, but the family never pushed him to play, particularly because they knew it came with a price: playing in Palmer’s shadow. But for Sam Saunders, the sport was there for the taking. His parents, Amy and Roy, run the Bay Hill Club in Orlando, and his grandfather owns it.Advice on the game from his grandfather came early, but not too often. Palmer’s first tip for Sam Saunders was to show him the proper grip and say, “Here it is, don’t change it.” Now Saunders calls Palmer, whom he calls by Palmer’s family nickname, Dumpy, maybe once a month to ask him about his playing experiences. They never talk about the technical part of the game, Saunders said. Palmer is one of just two people he relies on for golf advice. The other is his father.“He certainly has the physical ability, because he’s very strong and tall, so he’s just working on the mental attributes right now,” Palmer said by phone from his home in Latrobe, Pa. “In the not-too-distant future, this will fall into place. It’s just a question of him keeping the confidence in himself. Once that come together, I think he will improve drastically.”Palmer said he had just one piece of grandfatherly advice for Saunders, whom he plans to talk to later this week: “I think he will do better and mature faster if he finds a young lady and marries her.”Saunders, though, just wants to keep life simple. After dropping out of Clemson after his junior year, he has been trying to earn his PGA Tour card for two years.He has made the cut at only two of seven tour events this year, and his best showing this year was at Pebble Beach, where he tied for 15th. But he is still proud that he has been paying his own expenses and now owns his own townhouse in Orlando, Fla. His parents said they were pleased that he was so independent.“He wants so badly to play great golf and succeed on his own, but having the pressure of being Arnold Palmer’s grandson isn’t easy,” Roy Saunders said. “He tries to be nice about it and is grateful, but it’s like dragging around a gorilla the whole time. I can see how hard he is trying to gain that mental toughness.”This week at the United States Open, Sam Saunders will not have Palmer around to remind him of his background. Palmer, 81, was at Congressional for several hours on Monday to conduct business, but flew home that night so he would not be a distraction. Saunders said he was not even aware that Palmer had been there.So, when Saunders arrived at the United States Open on Monday, there was no hubbub as he signed the scroll of players and received a gold clip with his name and the words “U.S. Open player” on it.He remembered seeing a glass case at his grandfather’s house that displayed similar gold clips from the majors Palmer had played in. There were rows and rows of them, a treasure of accomplishment, Saunders said, as his eyes sparkled.Now Saunders plans to start a collection of his own.“Someday, I will earn my PGA Tour card, and I will be a known as Sam Saunders,” he said. “Someday, people will say, ‘That’s Sam Saunders, did you know his grandfather is Arnold Palmer?’ ”'"
"'11-06-15,'0','The Wisconsin Supreme Court cleared the way on Tuesday for significant cuts to collective bargaining rights for public workers in the state, undoing a lower court’s decision that Wisconsin’s controversial law had been passed improperly.The Supreme Court’s ruling, issued at the close of the business day, spared lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Capitol from having to do what some of them strongly hoped to avoid: calling for a new vote on the polarizing collective bargaining measure, which had drawn tens of thousands of protesters to Madison this year and led Democratic lawmakers to flee the city in an effort to block the bill.Republican leaders had warned on Monday that if the Supreme Court did not rule by Tuesday, they would feel compelled to attach the same measure to the state’s budget bill, which is expected to be approved this week.Four months after the fight began, the decision ended, at least for now, lingering questions about when and whether the cuts would take effect, but it also underscored the state’s partisan divide, which seems to grow wider by the day. The ruling was 4 to 3, split along what many viewed as the court’s predictable conservative-liberal line. One of the dissenting justices even raised the specter of a “partisan slant” by the other side.The majority of the justices concluded that a lower court was wrong when it found that the Legislature had forced through the cuts in collective bargaining without giving sufficient notice — 24 hours — under the state’s open-meetings requirements. The measure passed in early March, three weeks after the State Senate’s Democrats fled to Illinois to block the vote from occurring.'"
"'11-06-15,'0','Mr. Balas and Mr. Morales cited Mr. Holder’s letter in their pleadings, and Judge Donovan quoted it approvingly in his 26-page opinion, and stated, “The Holder Letter demonstrates that DOMA cannot withstand heightened scrutiny.”Mr. Balas and Mr. Morales were legally married under California law, and wanted to file jointly for bankruptcy. The trustee, the federal officials who oversee the bankruptcy process, moved to dismiss their petition under the Defense of Marriage Act. They then asked Judge Donovan to allow them to file jointly, and Monday’s decision was the result.Adam Winkler, a professor at the law school at the University of California, Los Angeles, called the decision “a powerful statement about the status of gay rights today.” Professor Winkler said, “it shows the effect of Eric Holder’s letter in shaping legal decisions that came after it, almost as if it’s a precedent in the case.”Mary Bonauto, the civil rights project director for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, the group that brought the Massachusetts case, said she was not surprised to see another judge agree with the earlier decision, because the law “advances a blatant legal double standard.” Ms. Bonauto added, “In our system of justice, it’s the job of courts to call that out.”One of those who signed Judge Donovan’s opinion, Judge Sheri Bluebond, said that a signing by other judges is “an unusual occurrence, but it is certainly not unprecedented.”Judge Bluebond said bankruptcy judges signed on to their colleagues’ decisions when “threshold questions” were brought before one judge and the others in that district “so the bar would know where we stand,” and whether they would be able to file in those courts. While 20 judges signed the opinion and there are 24 in the Central District of California, Judge Bluebond said, “the fact that some judges did not sign on to it does not mean one way or another what their views on that issue are.”“There could have been procedural reasons or just logistical reasons that they did not sign on,” she said.It is unclear whether an appeal will be filed. Judge Donovan noted that the House Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, which is leading the Congressional action, requested a brief delay in proceedings while it considered whether to intervene, but that “no further pleadings and no challenge” had ensued.“The government’s nonresponse to the debtors’ challenges is noteworthy,” Judge Donovan wrote.A spokesman for Mr. Boehner, Brendan Buck, said the ruling would not be appealed.“Bankruptcy cases are unlikely to provide the path to the Supreme Court, where we imagine the question of constitutionality will ultimately be decided,” Mr. Buck said. “Obviously, we believe the statute is constitutional in all its applications, including bankruptcy, but effectively defending it does not require the House to intervene in every case, especially when doing so would be prohibitively expensive.”'"
"'11-06-15,'0','MOSCOW — The 26 elk lips were just the tip of the pile. The items the Russian customs agents reported seizing Tuesday were exotic even by the standards of Russia’s border with China, where wildlife smuggling is rampant: 1,041 bear paws, lynx fur, unspecified claw parts and five tusks from the extinct woolly mammoth.Officials said they discovered the cargo after a dog alerted them to the contents in the bed of a Chinese driver’s seemingly empty truck. On closer examination, officials found a secret compartment with the cache of contraband.“The illegal cargo weighing almost 1.4 tons was detained by border guards and customs officials” a statement explained. The items were individually wrapped, the statement said, though it did not say if the compartment was refrigerated. The elk lips alone weighed 143 pounds.Smuggling is generally blossoming in Russia’s Far East. The long border with China, closed for decades, is now open for travel and trade.“China is a vacuum cleaner for Siberian wildlife,” said Aleksei L. Vaisman, a senior coordinator for Traffic Europe-Russia, which is sponsored by the conservation group WWF, which monitors trade in wild animals. The largest cache of bear paws he knew of previously was 787 paws (one paw shy of 197 full sets of four).'"

Because Robert Newton and Kerry Diamond, the owners, have turned a century-old pharmacy a few doors away into Smith Canteen, a cafe. They left the wood shelves and trim, tin ceiling and tile floors and added counters and tables. The coffee and espresso dispensed from a marble bar is from Counter Culture, and the iced coffee is dynamite. Pastries, like whole-wheat croissants with spinach filling, start the day. By lunch, there are sandwiches like duck confit banh mi, salads and items like a sweet pea quiche.

Keith McNally’s SoHo restaurant feels like a lost brasserie that was uncovered during routine construction work on Spring Street.At Maison Premiere, the set-dressing is taken to another plane. You don’t believe the place has been sitting on Bedford Avenue for ages. Instead you feel as if you’ve slipped through a wormhole to the French Quarter in the late 1800s. Telephones and lightbulbs are still an implausible rumor. Absinthe is not just legal but safer than drinking water.The pains the designers took with the interior can stagger the imagination. Is the toilet really flushed by pulling a chain on a wood tank on the wall? (Seems that way.) Was all the liquor behind the bar decanted into antique bottles?

"'11-06-15,'0','MOSCOW — A Moscow court on Tuesday cleared a prominent human rights campaigner of defamation charges, ruling that he had committed no crime when he accused Ramzan A. Kadyrov, the leader of Russia’s tumultuous region of Chechnya, of complicity in the murder of his colleague.It was a rare and widely unexpected defeat for Mr. Kadyrov, who had requested that the authorities file criminal charges against Oleg P. Orlov, the chairman of Memorial, a human rights group. The Chechen leader has long dodged accusations of involvement in the torture, kidnappings and murders that rights groups say have accompanied his Kremlin-backed efforts to bring order to Chechnya after years of open warfare.From the beginning, Mr. Kadyrov’s opponents considered the case against Mr. Orlov to be part of an effort to silence the din of criticism surrounding the Chechen leader. In a country where courts are often manipulated by the authorities for personal and political gain, few, particularly Mr. Orlov, thought he stood much chance of beating the charges.“It is a miracle,” Mr. Orlov said outside the courtroom after the verdict had been read. “I considered this to be a political trial and obviously a lost cause.”Few opponents of Mr. Kadyrov have gotten off so easily.The case of Natalya K. Estemirova, Mr. Orlov’s colleague at Memorial and an indefatigable critic of the Chechen leader, is more typical. Ms. Estemirova was kidnapped from her home in Chechnya’s capital, Grozny, in July 2009 and later shot to death.Hours later, Mr. Orlov called a news conference, telling reporters there that he was certain Mr. Kadyrov was in some way responsible for the murder. The Chechen leader had openly clashed on several occasions with Ms. Estemirova, a former teacher who documented abuses by the security services in Chechnya. He had once appeared to make a veiled threat against her young daughter.'"
"'11-06-15,'0','Since Mr. Johnson did not seem to be in line for the chief executive job at Apple, the move to J. C. Penney, based in Plano, Tex., gives him a chance to run a company. Still, it was seen as a surprising step at a time when Apple’s retail stores continue to thrive.“My lifetime dream has been to lead one of the large great retailers, to reimagine what it could be,” said Mr. Johnson, who was vice president for merchandising at Target Stores before joining Apple in 2000.“In the U.S., the department store has a chance to regain its status as the leader in style, the leader in excitement,” he said in an interview. “It will be a period of true innovation for this company.”Investors cheered the hire, with Penney shares rising 17 percent, to close at $35.37.Yet the job ahead will be very different from Mr. Johnson’s role at Apple, which already had a cult following when he joined it. And Apple’s imprint got bigger and bigger with a its rat-a-tat hits, from the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad.“Apple sells best-in-class product and faces basically little to no competition,” said Michelle Clark, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “J. C. Penney, on the other hand, operates in an intensely competitive industry and sells merchandise that is undifferentiated versus peers and in fact has been lagging peers.”J. C. Penney’s sales in 2010 were $17.76 billion, up 1.2 percent from the prior year, but still more than 10 percent below 2007 sales.J. C. Penney had first contacted Mr. Johnson three or four years ago, Mr. Ullman said.This time, the wooing of Mr. Johnson started with two activist investors. In November, Pershing Square Capital Management and Vornado Realty Trust bought 26.4 percent of J. C. Penney stock. In January, William A. Ackman from Pershing and Steven Roth from Vornado joined the Penney board, and as part of that arrangement, got to appoint an additional director. While Mr. Johnson was intrigued by the possibility, he did not want to become just a board member, and asked for the chief executive position, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.“Ron Johnson is the Steve Jobs of the retail industry,” Mr. Ackman said in an interview.Still, Penney seems to have limited Mr. Johnson’s role. He will have the marketing, product and merchandising functions reporting to him. But all other major departments, including finance, stores, JCPenney.com, corporate communications and legal will continue to report to Mr. Ullman.“His role is more like that of a chief merchant than it is of a C.E.O.,” said Ms. Clark of Morgan Stanley.To make up for Mr. Johnson’s stock options at Apple, he will receive restricted Penney stock worth $50 million as of Monday’s close. With the jump in stock price, it was worth more than $58 million by the close on Tuesday.He is also investing $50 million of his own money in J. C. Penney by buying warrants on the company’s stock. In 2017, the warrants will give him the right to buy more than seven million shares at $29.92 a share, meaning that if he can raise the stock price he stands to make a hefty profit.Mr. Johnson’s annual salary will be $1.5 million, and he will be eligible for a bonus of 125 percent of that amount if he meets certain targets. Still, “this guy has become enormously wealthy on Apple stock options,” said Charles Wolf, an analyst with Needham and Company. “He certainly doesn’t need the money.”During his tenure at Apple, Mr. Johnson received total compensation valued at $141 million, according to Equilar, an executive compensation research firm. The analysis excludes the years 2008 and 2009, during which Mr. Johnson realized additional stock gains valued at more than $100 million, Equilar said.Mr. Johnson did not specify what his plans were for Penney.“I don’t have a priority list,” he said. “I have so many ideas in my head that I can’t quite sort them out, to tell you the truth.”As for his experience, he said: “Apple has taught me, really, what breakthrough innovation is and how to energize teams to accomplish that. I’ve seen that happen on the product side at Apple; we’ve done that in our stores. I think that’s what I bring.”While Mr. Ullman, who has been chief executive for seven years, has been praised for bringing in brands like Liz Claiborne, MNG by Mango and Sephora into Penney’s stores, his tenure has been marked by the recession, when the company’s middle-class shoppers cut way back on spending.'"
"'11-06-15,'0','The Producer Price Index, which reflects commodity prices for manufacturers, rose 0.2 percent in May, according to seasonally adjusted figures provided Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The increase was slightly higher than the 0.1 percent analysts had forecast, and it was below the 0.8 percent rise in April.The increase in May in the index was attributed mostly to prices for energy goods — including gasoline and electricity — which rose 1.5 percent, the eighth consecutive monthly advance. The food component of the index declined 1.4 percent.Analysts suggested that the markets were helped after data from China pointed to an increase in industrial output as well as a rise in consumer prices that was in line with forecasts. That helped markets in Asia move higher, and the momentum continued in trading in Europe and the United States.“It is a pretty powerful relief rally,” said Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at First American Funds.The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 123.14 points, or 1.03 percent, to 12,076.11. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 16.04 points, or 1.26 percent, to 1,287.87. The Nasdaq composite index average climbed 39.03 points, or 1.48 percent, to 2,678.72.The stock market had been in a six-week slump, partly fueled by concerns over the pace of the global and domestic economic recovery, and concerns over sovereign debt problems in the euro zone.Protracted political wrangling over the national debt ceiling in the United States also has been a factor. Moody’s Investors Service said early this month that it might downgrade the United States credit rating if lawmakers did not raise the ceiling “in coming weeks.”On Tuesday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, warned about the consequences of continued delay, saying even a short suspension of payments on principal or interest on the Treasury’s debt obligations could severely disrupt financial markets.He also said that interest rates soared as investors lost confidence, as seen in a number of countries recently.“Although historical experience and economic theory do not show the exact threshold at which the perceived risks associated with the U. S. public debt would increase markedly, we can be sure that, without corrective action, our fiscal trajectory is moving us ever closer to that point,” he said.On Tuesday, the yield on the Treasury’s 10-year note, which is linked to interest rates on mortgages and other borrowing, rose to 3.10 percent, from 2.98 percent late Monday. Its price fell 1 point, to 101 7/32.Stocks, however, kept their momentum throughout the day.J. C. Penney rose nearly 17.5 percent to $35.37, after the retailer announced that the head of Apple’s retail stores would lead its company.The Apple executive, Ron Johnson, will replace Myron E. Ullman III as Penney’s chief executive on Nov. 1, the retailer said.“The markets have been in a corrective stage, and I think we have reached levels now that perhaps we can see some renewed interest in terms of valuations,” said Peter Cardillo, the chief market economist for Avalon Partners.'"
"'11-06-15,'0','Apple described the agreement as limited in scope.“Apple and Nokia have agreed to drop all of our current lawsuits and enter into a license covering some of each other’s patents, but not the majority of the innovation that makes the iPhone unique,” Apple said. “We are glad to put this behind us and get back to focusing on our respective businesses.”Analysts said the financial impact on Apple was likely to be small.“I don’t think it is material,” said Charles Wolf, an analyst with Needham & Company. Investors appeared to agree, sending Apple’s shares up about 1.8 percent, to $332.44.Mr. Wolf said most of the Nokia patents appeared to cover highly technical internal components, which he described as the “plumbing” of mobile devices. The iPhone’s distinctive look and feel did not infringe on Nokia’s patents, he said. The mobile phone makers had been embroiled in more than 40 patent lawsuits in Germany, Britain and the United States since 2009 over basic technologies relating to a handset’s user interface, power management, antenna and camera.Florian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst in Starnberg, Germany, said the announcement was a victory for Nokia, which in the first quarter ceded its long-held lead in global cellphone revenue to Apple. The iPhone is the world’s best-selling smartphone.Mr. Mueller said while Apple benefited by settling its legal differences with Nokia, it was likely that the patent settlement with Apple involved “significant” payments by Apple to Nokia.“I’m sure Nokia had to go down from its maximum demands because otherwise there wouldn’t have been a settlement,” Mr. Mueller said. “But the deal structure is very telling: A combination of a payment for past infringements as well as running royalties is a clear indication that there’s serious money in this for Nokia.”Mr. Mueller said the agreement was the first fruit of a new Nokia strategy to more aggressively defend its patent portfolio, which includes more than 10,000 groups of handset patents developed over the past two decades. Nokia has said it invested more than 43 billion euros ($62 billion) to develop its patent archive.“Having proven its ability to defeat Apple after the most bitterly contested patent dispute that this industry has seen to date is clear proof of” the effectiveness of Nokia’s more aggressive strategy, Mr. Mueller said. “Other companies whom Nokia will ask to pay royalties will have to think very hard whether to pay or pick a fight.”Mr. Mueller said Nokia might now turn its sights on Google, the maker of the Android open-source phone operating system, which is the world’s fastest-growing mobile operating system. Mr. Mueller asserted that Android was technologically similar to Apple’s iPhone operating system and might invite a legal challenge from Nokia.'"

"'11-06-16,'1','Asian markets followed suit on Thursday, with a 1.9 percent drop in Australia and South Korea. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong declined 1.8 percent.There has been “a complete loss of confidence,” said Francis Lun, managing director at Lyncean Holdings in Hong Kong. “With Greece on the verge of default, there are now fears that there will be a wider financial crisis.”In many of the fast-growing emerging nations, inflation pressures and rising interest rates are adding to investor nervousness. On Thursday, India raised its key interest rate for the 10th time since early last year.Likewise, the authorities in mainland China have been reining in bank lending for the last 18 months, as well as raising interest rates. Another rate increase is widely expected to come within weeks as Beijing continues its battle to contain inflation.“Liquidity is being squeezed by the government’s determination to bring down property prices and tighten rates,” Mr. Lun said.Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific have performed poorly this year as a result. Most major indexes in the region are now below where they began the year, and several stock market debuts have performed poorly. Some companies have even shelved their public offerings as a result.The weak market sentiment on Thursday prompted Prada, whose high-end handbags and apparel are popular with Asia’s increasingly affluent shoppers, to lower its price range to 39.50 to 42.25 Hong Kong dollars, from a previously announced range of 36.50 to 48 Hong Kong dollars, according to a person with direct knowledge of the listing, who spoke anonymously because the information was not yet public.A price at the upper end of the lowered range would bring Prada $2.3 billion, from the previous maximum of $2.6 billion. Prada is to price its shares on Friday and start listing on the Hong Kong exchange on June 24.Meanwhile, shares in Samsonite, which had been only moderately oversubscribed, dropped as much as 10.6 percent early in the day. Although they recouped some of those losses later on, the shares were well below the issue price of 14.5 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.86, by late afternoon, closing at 13.38 dollars, down 7.7 percent.Samsonite, which was bought by the British private equity firm CVC Capital Partners in 2007, had previously been forced to price its shares at the lower end of its indicative range, bringing it proceeds of $1.25 billion, rather than the maximum $1.5 billion it had hoped for.Still, the decisions by companies like Samsonite and Prada to seek a listing in the Asian financial hub, rather than on an exchange closer to home, reflect an overall shift in the center of economic and financial gravity toward fast-growing countries in Asia.About a dozen non-Asian companies are aiming to list in Hong Kong this year in a bid to tap a cash-rich investor base and to raise their visibility in what is a central market for their goods.“We feel at home here,” said Tim Parker, the Samsonite chief executive, amid a clatter of camera shutters at a listing ceremony at the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday, adding that the company planned to build its business in China, India and other parts of Asia.'"
"'11-06-16,'1','Members of New York City’s powerful municipal labor coalition met on Wednesday to discuss a financial rescue package that could prevent thousands of teachers from losing their jobs.But after hours of heated debate, they ended the meeting the same way they had started it: deeply divided over whether they should offer Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg a lifeline.“It was clear there’s still a lot of mistrust of this administration,” Michael Mulgrew, president of the teachers’ union, said in an interview.In the budget he released last month, Mr. Bloomberg said the city would have to eliminate 6,100 teaching jobs, most of them through layoffs, to balance its books. The committee is weighing whether to plug the hole by giving the city undetermined millions from a reserve fund set up 25 years ago to offset rising health care costs for active and retired municipal employees. The fund, which is run by the city and the labor committee, contains about $400 million.City Hall still regards the plan as its most plausible alternative to avoid the layoffs, but a final agreement remained only a distant possibility on Wednesday, with some union leaders wondering how it would benefit their members and many others questioning whether the city really needed their money.'"

"'11-06-16,'1','BERLIN — The Czech Republic announced Wednesday that it was withdrawing from plans to participate in the United States missile defense program out of frustration at its diminished role in the system, which was conceived as a deterrent against a potential threat from Iran.The administration of President George W. Bush had initially proposed stationing 10 ground-based interceptors in Poland and a radar facility in the Czech Republic. But in September 2009, the Obama administration scrapped those plans and proposed a revamped program with an unspecified role for the Czechs. Two months later, it offered the Czech Republic the possibility of hosting a separate early warning system.The shift prompted accusations from Republican critics who accused President Obama of betraying allies under pressure from Russia, while officials in Eastern Europe, who viewed missile defense as a symbol of American support for the region, expressed discomfort at the change in policy.The Czech defense minister, Alexandr Vondra, who met Wednesday in Prague with Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn III, said that the conditions offered by Washington were not good enough. “We will seek other possibilities of how the Czech Republic may participate in the allied system in future,” he said. “They gave us an offer and we assessed that.”Mr. Vondra, a former Czech ambassador to the United States, was previously an outspoken proponent of Czech participation in missile defense, even as his center-right party faced deep resistance from a skeptical public. But at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels last week, Mr. Vondra dismissed the revamped Czech role as “a consolation prize.”“Our ideas about the future cooperation are more colorful than just a room or two with some screens there,” he said.'"
"'11-06-16,'1','Virtually any issue that contradicts official Saudi policy now pops up online, including the status of prisoners being held without trial or a call to boycott municipal elections this September.Louai A. Koufiah, a Twitter enthusiast, quipped: “Saudis cannot go out to demonstrate, so they retweet!”Essam M. al-Zamel, who helped start the municipal election boycott campaign, boasts that he cannot gather 30 people in a room, but that he can reach more than 22,000 instantly on Twitter.But wherever the public goes, the government follows.After Saudis thronged Twitter, activists noted a rash of new users without pictures who described themselves in patriotic terms and attacked government critics. Since the default picture on Twitter is an egg, they earned the nickname #saudieggs.“My purpose in life is to be a watchdog to protect my religion, my state,” read part of one such user’s information.Abdulaziz AlGasim, a lawyer and activist in the capital, Riyadh, is convinced that such users work for the government because in attacking him they used information unknown to the general public. “Oh, this is a famous egg!” he said laughing as he flipped through his account, pointing out how they try to provoke factional or sectarian fights.Previously, government critics were nervous about seeking out allies, never sure whom to approach. But the combination of bold opinions online and monitoring whom the “eggs” attack has expanded contacts between activists nationwide.Seeking to highlight the plight of prisoners held for years without trial, activists recently put a video on YouTube called “Absent Saudis.” It featured the distraught relatives of some of the 16 men imprisoned in 2007 for what Bassem Alim, a defense attorney, said was taking rudimentary steps toward creating a political party and what the government said were links to terrorism. They were only formally charged last August.The video response was called “Saudis Are Present,” featuring an interview with the father of a Saudi girl killed in an attack by Al Qaeda and mixed in with pictures of famous Saudi dissidents.“Keep them locked up!” screams the zipper running across the bottom of the screen. “Side with the country against them and distribute this video.”Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied any government role in such counterattacks. Its main online effort was seeking out Qaeda ideology, he said. “It is not our way to challenge individuals or social networks on the Internet. That is nonsense,” he said.While social media was once almost solely the playing field of the liberal elite, Saudi activists say it has become more democratic this year, with more varied voices.The religious conservatives are catching up. Gone are the days when they issued one fatwa reported by the newspaper Al-Watan that commanded women to avoid writing “LOL,” or laughing out loud, because the very idea of a woman laughing might arouse male strangers.Two Saudi conservatives started a special YouTube channel, CH905, to highlight the work of the most prominent clerics in the Sahwa or Wahhabi traditionalist movement in the country. (The telephone number for directory assistance is 905.) One cleric called for the Saudi government to tear down the mosque around the Kaaba, the sacred shrine in Mecca toward which Muslims turn when they pray, and put up a new, stacked structure so that men and women circulate on different floors. Others have attacked proposals for co-education in early elementary school.Saudis who follow social media closely say that the crosscurrents, particularly on Twitter, have had a moderating affect. The more extremist religious figures and the hard-core social liberals have adopted flexible attitudes on some issues — seen as an attempt to increase followers and an indication that the different camps no longer talk solely among themselves, they said.The women’s driving campaign shows what online organizing can accomplish — and what it cannot. Ms. Sharif, a 32-year-old information technology specialist working for Aramco, the state oil company, announced her campaign in April, and Saudi activists said they expected women at least in the hundreds to drive on Friday. But her open challenge to the government in posting the videos alienated countless supporters who thought she should have simply waited until the announced date.Supporters believe the nine-day jail sentence was a deliberate attempt by the monarchy to eradicate any kind of online movement inspired by Tunisia and Egypt. It most likely had the desired effect of scaring off many women.But it has not squelched the robust online debate. Some men suggested that Ms. Sharif, a single mother, was simply looking for a husband. Supporters, even Abdel Aziz Khoja, the minister of information and an avid Twitter user, weighed in, saying, “My personal opinion is that a woman has the right to drive as long as she respects public etiquette and Islamic behavior.”Younger women are particularly defiant, with a group of five 20- to 30-year-olds detained in Riyadh last Thursday for taking driving lessons. One brazenly kept posting to Twitter even when thrown into a holding tank by the morals police: “We are waiting in a tiny, dirty, dusty room!”One weakness in online movements is that their organizers often stay hidden to avoid government wrath.In March, nobody knew exactly who was calling for street demonstrations. The day was suddenly named after Hunain, a famous battle in Islamic history that Shiite Muslims revere more than Sunnis. Numerous activists think the government planted the name online to try to turn the protests into a sectarian issue.Saudi activists said they recognized that social media alone would not bring changes, although it exposes issues and links organizers.“If you can reach the public, it will put pressure on royal family to modernize,” said Mr. AlGasim, the Riyadh lawyer, who found that even his 72-year-old mother had signed a democracy petition online. “Change will come from demonstrations, not from talking.”'"
"'11-06-16,'1','“Well, It’s a Start” (editorial, June 11), about the efforts of the New York State comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, to fix our broken system of campaign finance, gives me real hope that Albany can finally move toward voter-owned, publicly financed elections.Until we change New York State’s campaign finance laws to a system of public financing of elections, money will matter more than ideas or experience in deciding elections, and the stream of Albany scandals will continue.It is time to end pay-to-play politics in Albany, and the comptroller’s office is a good place to start.Those of us who have spent years fighting for reform will always be disappointed until all campaigns are run free from the corrupting influence of big money, but if we must get there one office at a time, so be it.Kudos to Comptroller DiNapoli for supporting reform, and volunteering his office as the first step.

"'11-06-16,'1','JACQUELYN ORTIZ scours her favorite cheap-and-chic fashion outposts once or twice a week to stock up on a season’s worth of flowing dresses, tank tops, sandals and tees. “In the summertime I do a lot more shopping,” said Ms. Ortiz, who works at an advertising agency in New York.Yet she finds that she is spending less. She can afford to indulge in an occasional mini-splurge, since she rarely parts with more than $30 on a single clothing purchase, and even less on accessories: feathers for her hair, headbands or the $10 fedora that crowns her summer wardrobe. In keeping with the season’s carefree spirit, she snaps up eye-catching pieces that she may wear the next day, then simply forget.“In the summer,” she reasoned, “you’re in the office one minute, and on the jitney to the Hamptons the next. If you’re feeling spontaneous, you might jump into a pool in your silly clothes. So you need to be buying something easy, adaptable — and maybe disposable.”A halting economy, steamy pavements and long hours at the office have done little to dampen her enthusiasm, or for that matter that of her peers. She typifies a breed of budget- and style-wise New Yorkers who haunt fashion chains like H & M and Mango to engage in a bit of ritual hunting and gathering.Their frequent store visits and swift response to trends suggest that they have returned to the kind of recreational shopping that has been rare of late, but which, in its pre-recession heyday, was as popular a pastime as a jaunt to the beach. They shop because it’s easy (fewer layers to impede their progress or obscure their bright new clothes) and, as some will tell you, just because they can.Sure, apparel sales have slowed, at least outside the luxury sector. “The fashion consumer is being more cautious than ever,” said Howard Davidowitz, a retail consultant in New York. At a time, he said, when 80 percent of the population is still struggling to make ends meet, “they really are watching their dollars.” But even a lethargic recovery has done little to curb an acquisitive streak that is ingrained in the consumer psyche.'"
"'11-06-16,'1','He noted that the market has grown faster south of the Mason-Dixon line (notably in Florida and Texas — as well as in California) than north of it. But in the last year, sales of such shirts have had such an uptick that Eric Jennings, the men’s fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue, found himself needing a way to describe them. Some 80 years ago, such garments were called sport shirts. Today that term is most likely to apply to polo shirts. As Mr. Jennings and this writer have found, the shirts are not easy to classify. Event shirt? Cocktail shirt? “For lack of something better, we’ve been calling them restaurant shirts,” he said. “That’s where they all seem to be headed.”There is no base line of ostentation for what makes a shirt restaurant-caliber. But a simple stripe won’t do, nor will a run-of-the-mill gingham or check — not unless they’re put under a microscope and blown up about 10x (as they say in the optics racket). No, think graphic, think floral, think paisley. Just don’t think too hard or you’ll never have the nerve to wear one.“The first time I got my husband one — it was flowered — he said, ‘There’s no way I am wearing that,’ ” Ms. Davis said. “But I said, ‘You’re going to put it on, and I’m going to give you a Scotch, and then we’re going out to dinner.’ No one made fun of him, and he actually got a lot of compliments.”Remember, though: Even go-for-broke means fine-tuning the style. Worn untucked, shirts that are too big and baggy run the risk of looking like sloppy holdovers from the ’90s. Likewise, long tails on a shirt usually mean they were designed to disappear, so tucking in a restaurant shirt means your pants better meet the GQ standard.“Slim, low-waist jeans or khakis,” said Madeline Weeks, GQ’s fashion director. “Worn with an interesting belt, like the ones at Barbara Shaum in the East Village.”If you plan to leave your tails untucked, the shirt should look as if this was meant to be, with a slim and short cut. Topman has a great selection, several in floral patterns that are more groovy than girly. Another option is a shirt in a stout fabric like oxford cloth or cotton canvas that will hold its crisp shape throughout a summer night. The outsize plaids at Thom Browne are nigh on perfect, so get them while you can. With the economy still sputtering, they may be the only huge checks you’ll see this year.'"
"'11-06-16,'1','The Oakland Institute, a social development group based in California, warned this month in a report of a “land grab” under way, whereby investors including hedge funds are driving farmers off their land in Africa to make way for new industrial farming projects to profit from rising food prices.Mr. Gandur said that despite concerns about the effects on farm markets, he thought that ethanol had a viable and profitable future, if managed properly.The Addax project will be the largest investment so far in Sierra Leone’s agricultural sector and includes a new sugar cane estate, an ethanol refinery and a biomass power plant for the refinery and the national electricity grid.Construction begins this year, and the project is expected to be operational in 2013. It employs over 500 people and will create more than 2,000 jobs, according to Addax. The land will be leased from local landowners and tribal chiefs.According to Addax Bioenergy, the deal follows evaluations of the social, environmental and economic effects with the government and local nonprofit groups. The memorandum of understanding was ratified by Sierra Leone’s Parliament last November, and according to local news media reports, it was supported by the political opposition as well.Mr. Gandur is no stranger to controversy, having worked in commodities trading and mining throughout his career in places where others tread warily, like Nigeria and Kurdistan.He built his oil unit, Addax Petroleum, from scratch before selling it in 2009 to Sinopec, the Chinese oil company, for 8.4 billion Canadian dollars, or $8.6 billion at current exchange rates, taking $3.5 billion himself.Addax says that it complies with social and environmental standards from the African Development Bank, the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation and the European Union. These include commitments on child labor, setting aside part of the estate for food production and sponsoring a farmer-training program developed with the United Nations.“That’s why I don’t feel guilty of doing anything immoral,” he said during a recent interview. “On the contrary, if other countries cope with the same model, we can give a chance to Africa to employ people. Without being naïve, it’s a good way to bring back agriculture in Africa.”But according to the Oakland Institute, by early 2011, close to 500,000 hectares, or 1.2 million acres, of farmland in Sierra Leone had been leased to or were under negotiation for lease by foreign investors, representing almost 10 percent of 5.4 million hectares of land suitable for farming by small landholders, which employs about half the population. It also cited food security risks and questioned the level of genuine interaction between the project and illiterate local farmers.“The conditions surrounding agricultural investments in Sierra Leone are ripe for exploitation and conflict,” the institute said.Duncan Pruett, an adviser on land rights at Oxfam, said that generally, biofuel production in poor countries “is a double blow for poor and hungry communities.” Land, he said, was often given away to investors or governments on abusive or unfair terms, and large-scale plantations often created little employment or food for local consumption. And diverting food into biofuel production “is also a key driver of high and volatile food prices, which spell hunger for millions of men, women and children,” he said.Mr. Gandur is not shy about saying his intent is to make a profit, not to be a charity. But he said that by operating under the “watch and auspices of international bodies,” he thought his project could “be used as a model for other companies.”In any case, Mr. Gandur, 62, said he expected the bet on ethanol would be among his last major business forays. An avid collector of antiquities and postwar European paintings, he has turned his attention to finding a home for his collection.Mr. Gandur’s family, which has been referred to as the Rothschilds of the Middle East, has rich European roots. His father was a doctor, whose family emigrated to Egypt in the early 19th century. They had Italian ancestry and were ennobled in Austria in 1863. His mother’s side had Ukrainian-Georgian roots. In 1921, they fled Russia, where they had run the Odessa docks, for Constantinople, before resettling in Paris.In 1961, when Mr. Gandur was 12, the family fled Egypt for Switzerland after the second wave of nationalizations under Gamal Abdel Nasser. They lost much, though they had previously shifted wealth to Europe.Mr. Gandur initially studied Egyptology, but around age 25, he joined the commodities trading firm Philipp Brothers. In 1987, he started the Addax & Oryx Group, named after two African antelopes, with partners.The group grew fast, buying oil concessions in Nigeria, under the government of Gen. Sani Abacha; Kurdistan, after the toppling of Saddam Hussein; the Ivory Coast; Gabon; Cameroon and Benin. It also held gold mining concessions in Tanzania.“In 1995 and 1996, nobody wanted acreage in Africa,” he said. “Oil was $9 and upstream was not in fashion,” he said, referring to exploration.He has been wounded by insinuations that he had to grease dictators’ palms to succeed. “I didn’t build Addax on getting acreages from governments under the table,” he said. “We have never paid money to anyone to get acreage in Africa, never.”'"
"'11-06-16,'1','Johnson & Johnson announced on Wednesday that it would stop manufacturing drug-coated heart stents by the end of the year, abandoning an intensely competitive $4 billion market after a series of setbacks for the company and rising concerns about the use of stents in some patients.The company is expecting to take a $500 million to $600 million restructuring charge this quarter and to trim 900 to 1,000 jobs this year.The announcement by the company and its subsidiary Cordis, long expected by some analysts because of a dwindling market share, opens up more sales possibilities for three competitors.The use of heart stents is being challenged as unnecessary for some patients. Stents are tiny devices inserted through blood vessels to keep arteries open in the heart. But research in recent years has suggested that stents are overused by doctors and that drugs may be a cheaper, safer and more effective way for many patients to avoid heart attacks or strokes.The emerging concerns, the recession and pricing pressures have caused a fall-off in stent sales. The worldwide market for coronary stents dropped to $4.2 billion last year, from $5.3 billion in 2006, according to the investment house Leerink Swann.'"
"'11-06-16,'1','SHANGHAI — The Australian government said Wednesday that it was considering approval of a prisoner transfer treaty that could eventually allow Stern Hu, a former executive at the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, to leave China and serve out the rest of his 10-year prison term in Australia.The announcement, made by the Treaties Committee in the Australian Parliament, would also allow Chinese prisoners serving time in Australia to complete their terms here in China.The arrest of Mr. Hu, a Chinese-born Australian citizen, strained diplomatic relations between Australia and China in 2009 and 2010 because of disputes about whether he and three other Rio Tinto employees had been fairly prosecuted over allegations that they had stolen secrets from Chinese state-owned companies. The prosecution of Mr. Hu and the others also raised anxieties among other foreign companies that do business in China.Last March, Mr. Hu and the three Chinese employees were found guilty in Shanghai of accepting millions of dollars in bribes and stealing commercial secrets while working for Rio Tinto.The four men, who each confessed to taking bribes, were sentenced to between 7 to 14 years in prison.After the men were arrested in July 2009, the Australian government pressed for an open and fair trial and Rio Tinto said it had no evidence they had engaged in wrongdoing. Later, Rio Tinto said it was disappointed that the men had engaged in bribery.'"
"'11-06-16,'1','That much was evident at the show’s opening-night party in late April held, of course, at B. Smith’s, her jazzy Southern-themed restaurant in the theater district. As Ms. Smith swirled about in a curve-hugging Herve Leger cocktail dress, cast mates and partygoers marveled at her staying power, her enduring beauty and her uncanny ability for self-reinvention over the years. Asked why Ms. Smith was chosen for the play, Nora Ephron pointed to her and half-jokingly declared, “Um, look at her.”They’ve been saying that for years. Ms. Smith grew up in rural Pennsylvania, where her multitasking got an early start. “I inherited a paper route, I sold magazines, had lemonade stands, I was a candy striper and into fund-raising,” she said. “I’ve always enjoyed being busy.”She was also a trailblazer for African-Americans. “I was the first to bring a black D. J. to our school,” she recalled, laughing, about her high school years. “That’s still one of the first things people bring up when they see me at the reunions.”It was a similar tenacity that led her to become one of the first African-American women on the cover of Mademoiselle, in July 1976. After reading an ad in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about a modeling school, Ms. Smith begged her parents, a housekeeper and steelworker, to allow her to attend.Upon graduating, she moved to New York with dreams of being a big-time model and relentlessly pursued editors for work, at a time when many were hesitant to hire a black woman. “I used to make calls to magazines all the time,” she said, sighing. “I wasn’t discovered. I made them discover me.”Landing the Mademoiselle cover brought her steady work in fashion capitals, and for several years this was enough. But Ms. Smith couldn’t quell her entrepreneurial spirit. She’d always enjoyed cooking and hosting dinner parties, so in 1986 she opened the B. Smith restaurant. Two more in Sag Harbor, N.Y., and Washington soon followed.In 1994, she added cookbooks to her burgeoning business with “B. Smith’s Entertaining and Cooking for Friends.” The glossy tabletop work shared bits of her life, recipes for Southern favorites like pecan pie and tips for the perfect beach picnic. Her second book, “B. Smith Cooks Southern-Style,” released in 2009, offers a healthier spin on calorie-laden classics. “Obesity is killing us in the black community,” she said. “We have to make better choices about what we’re eating.”Although her return to the stage ended a few weeks ago, this renaissance woman has more than a few projects to keep her on the run. Tour her office, a cozy apartment one floor below her home, and you’ll find copies of her lifestyle magazine (which hit shelves in 1999, a year before Oprah’s), pieces from her home collection for Bed, Bath & Beyond (which started in 2001 and includes duvets and dinner plates) and samples from her furniture line (which she describes as “Afrasian” for its combination of African and Asian influences).LAST year, she branched out into food, with a line of olive oil, now selling in more than 2,000 stores. And later this year, she plans to expand with a jewelry collection. The line will be affordable, “but look expensive,” she said. “I’ve used sterling silver, white topaz, turquoise. These will be feel-good pieces that you can keep forever.”She also wants to restart her television show, “B. Smith With Style,” which began in 1997 and was broadcast on NBC stations. Through her show, she hopes to spread the gospel of holistic living. “I’m not a perfectionist and I don’t want to force anything on anybody,” she said. “But if I can preach to a few people and they get it, that’s how movements start.”And, she said, she’d like to appear on stage again in the near future. “I’m sure one of these days I will be inviting you to ‘An Evening with B. Smith,’ because I also want to get back to my singing,” she said. “Betty White is my hero. There’s absolutely no reason to slow down if you can keep on doing your thing.”'"
"'11-06-16,'1','The market has surrendered almost all of its gains for this year, falling 7 percent since its peak at the end of April. It may be nearing what is known as a market correction, a sort of miniature bear market characterized by a 10 percent decline in a short period of time.Greece needs to pass a new round of austerity measures by the end of the month in return for new loans from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.In Athens, thousands joined a nationwide strike as Parliament prepared to debate a second round of sharp cuts in government spending. The measures are unpopular with Greeks, who have already suffered deep salary and pension cuts.Although many analysts expect that a default by Greece on its debts will eventually be averted, the political uncertainty in Greece is providing an unsettling backdrop for investors. In addition, they are fretting because the United States this summer faces its own fractious negotiations over raising the federal debt ceiling.The European Central Bank said on Wednesday in a report on financial risk that it would be a big mistake for Greece to be allowed to miss its debt payments, either by delaying payments to a later date, or by paying back less than the full amount. Germany, the biggest economy in the 17-member euro zone, is proposing that private sector bondholders accept some form of a loss on their Greek bonds.This could prove damaging to Greek banks, requiring them to mark down the value of their holdings of government debt at a time when they are struggling with bad loans in their home market. And it could have similar dire repercussions for other European banks that hold Greek debt.“The concern is that a default by Greece would not only hurt European banks but could also spread to U.S. banks,” said Bernard Baumohl, an economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, N.J. “Should there be a default, it can only have a delaying effect on the recovery, hurting American exports and the banks’ ability to lend.”Pointing to a slowing United States economy, a Federal Reserve regional report for New York State showed a decline in both manufacturing activity and optimism for June. Also Wednesday, a government report showed consumer prices crept up again, though they were held in check by a decline in energy prices.The recent economic data has prompted economists to steadily downgrade their forecasts for economic growth in the second quarter of this year. Macroeconomic Advisors, a prominent forecasting firm, on Wednesday lowered its annualized second-quarter gross domestic product forecast to 1.9 percent, compared with the 3.5 percent growth it was expecting when the quarter began.“There is enough negative data that came out of the U.S. and the situation in Europe to warrant a conservative tone in the markets,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. “The data underscores a soft patch, and the Greek issue has deteriorated.”The fear that a default by Greece could lead to broader European problems were fanned by Moody’s Investors Service, which on Wednesday put the credit ratings of three of France’s largest banks on review for a possible downgrade because of their exposure to Greek debt.Moody’s cited concerns about the exposure of the three banks, BNP Paribas, Société Générale and Crédit Agricole to the Greek economy, either through holdings of government bonds or loans to the private sector there, directly or through subsidiaries operating in Greece.According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, French banks could potentially lose more from a collapse of Greek banks and a sovereign default than other countries, including Germany, the United States and Britain.Moody’s stressed that there were “potential mitigants” to the concerns about Greece, including the French banks’ strong overall financial profiles, substantial scale and earnings diversification.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell sharply on Wednesday. It lost 22.45 points, or 1.74 percent, to close at 1,265.42. The Nasdaq composite index average fell 47.26 points, or 1.76 percent, to 2,631.46.The euro, oil prices and Treasury yields also fell on Wednesday.The stock market sell-off is a sign to some analysts that investors are entering a phase when they will flee riskier assets like stocks, commodities and richer-yielding bonds.According to the Investment Company Institute, United States equity funds experienced outflows for at least six successive weeks. Investors redeemed about $15 billion from American stock funds since the beginning of May, even as they shifted billions into less risky bond funds.On Wednesday, the yield on the Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell to 2.98 percent from 3.10 percent, suggesting to analysts a continuing strong flow of investment funds from risky assets into safer investments like TreasuriesMarc Harris, an economist at RBC Capital Markets, said interest rates in short-term money markets — where banks and companies borrow funds to keep their businesses going — were “spiking in a troubling way” mainly in Europe.All of the sectors of the market were down by 1.24 percent or more, with financials and materials recording the heaviest declines at more than 2.3 percent.Crude oil took a tumble, falling $4.56, to $94.81 a barrel for July delivery, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.'"

"'11-06-17,'1','Along with discussing articles — recent topics included “Beating Potty Training Setbacks” and “Staying Safe From Toxins” — attendees receive product samples, which they also discuss.Maxine Wolf, the publisher of Kiwi, which is owned by the May Media Group, said the magazine does not accept advertising from pharmaceutical companies or from foods that contain artificial colors or flavors. Products must meet those same standards to participate in the sampling program, she added.Brands that meet the criteria, Ms. Wolf said, are eager to pay to be tried by consumers who may be predisposed to what they offer. “Kiwi moms are entirely engaged and committed to this lifestyle,” she added, “and recommending these types of products to their friends.”So far, participants in the sampling program have primarily been smaller companies selling brands like Sprout organic baby food or Laloo’s goat milk ice cream. But Kiwi recently struck a deal with its biggest participant: Kraft Foods.In August, Teddy Grahams, the Nabisco cookie brand sold by Kraft, will bring out its newest variety, Teddy Grahams Soft Paws: large, soft, individually wrapped cookies in claw shapes.The Kiwi meet-ups are a natural choice for Teddy Grahams, said Dan Anglemyer, a senior brand manager at Kraft, because the entire line is made with whole grain, no artificial flavors or colors, sugar instead of corn syrup and considerably less sugar content over all than other Kraft cookies like Oreo.“We’re so focused on moms, and this is a mom-designated program,” Mr. Anglemyer said. “And it’s a psychographic that’s concerned about the ingredients in food,” he added, using the term that emphasizes attributes of self-image and values over demographics like age or income.The new Soft Paws product will be provided to a third of the Moms Meet groups, a total of about 100,000 people. The leaders will complete questionnaires to elicit collective impressions of the product and feedback from individual members.When executives of Marcal, the brand of recycled paper products, recently sent Small Steps toilet paper to about 4,000 mothers in about 200 groups, they learned that many were impressed with something the brand had not previously trumpeted: it is made in the United States.Because of that insight, the brand will “be tweaking the packaging going forward” to highlight its domestic origin, said Ilyne Germaise, senior brand manager at Marcal.As magazines fret about marketers eschewing print ads for online media and social-network marketing, Moms Meet represents an alternative approach to the revenue puzzle.While she declined to provide figures, Ms. Wolf said that Kiwi was on pace to double its revenue this year compared with last, attributing the growth to the success of the sampling program.That revenue is “rapidly approaching” the amount earned through advertising and subscriptions, she added.At Redbook, part of the Hearst Magazines division of the Hearst Corporation, the advertisers’ participation in the House Party gathering comes with buying what it describes as a “total package partnership” with Redbook.Redbook is the first magazine to hire House Party to put on parties; other clients include ABC Family, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Ford Motor, S. C. Johnson, Kraft, McDonald’s and Microsoft.“We’ve worked with House Party before on behalf of advertisers,” said Mary Morgan, vice president and publisher of Redbook. “We thought, what if we went to House Party and became the client?”“The most effective way to sample any product is to actually have a consumer experience it,” Ms. Morgan said. “This is like Redbook parachuting into a party and saying, ‘Here we are.’ ”Michael Perry, chief executive at House Party, estimated that more than 33,000 people in the company’s database of 800,000 hosts applied to host a Redbook party — “about two times the normal average of 15,000 to 20,000 for big clients,” he said.There is a matter unique to a party for a publication, Mr. Perry said, laughing: The party packs that the company is shipping to hosts, containing the materials they need for the Redbook events, weigh 35 pounds each, compared with an average of 10 pounds for party givers that are not magazines.Redbook is promoting the National Happy Hour parties on several pages of its July issue. The magazine plans to revive the parties virtually on Tuesday, inviting readers to follow @redbookmag on Twitter.com and asking those who post comments to use the hashtag #RED BOOKhh.'"

"'11-06-17,'1','In the landmark Miranda case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution’s guarantee against self-incrimination required that police warn criminal suspects about their right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present when they are taken into custody for questioning.Now the court has ruled in J. D. B. v. North Carolina that police need to consider a suspect’s age when deciding whether they must give him Miranda warnings.Under earlier rulings, the court said that whether a suspect was “in custody” for Miranda purposes depended on the circumstances of the interrogation and whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave.In its new decision, the court concludes that age matters because a teenager is likely to think he is not free to leave an interrogation even if a reasonable adult would think otherwise.The case involved a 13-year-old seventh-grade student in North Carolina who was taken out of a classroom by a uniformed police officer and questioned for at least 30 minutes in a closed-door conference room about the theft of a digital camera. The police did not tell the student that he was free to go and did not give him Miranda warnings. The student eventually confessed to the theft — after an officer told him that “this thing is going to court” and that he might be “sent to juvenile detention before court.”'"
"'11-06-17,'1','So what happened to the Canucks, who became the first team in a Stanley Cup finals to lose a playoff series by suffering a shutout on home ice in Game 7?Injuries played a role, as they always do. The skating wounded included defenseman Christian Ehrhoff, who revealed he was playing with a bad shoulder that will probably require surgery. He finished with an appalling minus-13 in the postseason. Defenseman Alexander Edler had two broken fingers.Ryan Kesler, not wishing to make excuses, did not reveal the nature of his injury to reporters or even to teammates, but teammate Jeff Tambellini said, “I think every stride hurt him.”It was probably a groin injury that slowed Kesler, who had been so effective in the first three rounds, when he scored 18 points and was a plus-6. In the finals, though, Kesler accounted for only 1 assist and went minus-6.Among the healthy, Roberto Luongo was inconsistent in goal and petulant before the microphones, and certainly suffered in comparison with Boston’s celestial Tim Thomas, the Conn Smythe winner and the best goalie hockey has seen since the heyday of Dominik Hasek.But Luongo saved the Canucks in their three home victories (1-0, 3-2, 1-0) and was not totally to blame on the three goals Vancouver surrendered before it pulled him for an extra attacker.Ultimately, the performance of a team is governed by its leaders, and here the failure of Henrik and Daniel Sedin stands in the starkest light.Henrik, the captain and the N.H.L.’s leading scorer and most valuable player in 2009-10, had 1 goal, 0 assists and a minus-7 mark in finals.Daniel, the N.H.L.’s leading scorer in 2010-11 and a leading candidate for the most valuable player award to be handed out in Las Vegas next week, scored 3 goals and 1 assist in the finals, but also went minus-7.In Game 7, the twin brothers were on the ice for all four goals.It was the meekness of Daniel’s performance that really stood out. Punched four times in the jaw during a Game 6 scrum by Boston’s 5-foot-9 Brad Marchand, Sedin just stood there and took it, hoping for a penalty call that never came. That is admirable behavior in soccer, where such fouls are called, but not in hockey, where the code of conduct requires a player to at least push back.Worse, perhaps, was Daniel’s reaction after he said the Canucks would win the series in the aftermath of Game 6. “We’re going to win Game 7,” he said, sounding like a fire-breathing Mark Messier.But on the morning of Game 7, he backtracked to an almost comical extent.“You know, that was probably me being excited and the words came wrong out of my mouth,” he said. “What I said was if we put our best game on the ice, I like our chances.”Hardly the sound of a leader, and it symbolized why the Canucks fell short in Game 7 as they now have a reputation for doing. That failure will frustrate loyal fans, even if it does not provide an excuse to smash car windows and burn police vehicles.'"
"'11-06-17,'1','Willem De Kooning made many unforgettable statements about his own work, and one of them is splayed across the opening wall of this riveting show: “The figure is nothing unless you twist it around like a strange miracle.”Those words do what all great art-writing should do: help us to see, that is, to genuinely grasp and enjoy the complexity of vision involved in both making and looking at art. Specifically, they provide the perfect setup for the twists and strange miracles at hand, resplendent in a selection of 32 paintings, drawings and sculptures ranging from the late 1960s through the ’70s.De Kooning saw the figure as a rubbery, infinitely malleable subject perfectly suited to the malleable substance of paint and also to his conception of the painting process as one of unending, never-resolved flux and instability. That he usually set his figures in landscapes, full of green and light, only added to the tumult. A painting for De Kooning was a kind of perpetual-motion machine of shifting forms and gestures — his own and his subjects’— amid suggestions of torsos, heads and limbs (and feet!) and glissandos of paint. His skittish figures almost invariably twist and often seem to shout, whether they are doing the Charleston or a high kick, sitting cross-legged or tending gardens in the East Hampton sun.As the art historian Richard Shiff reminds us in a catalog essay that is itself wonderfully slippery and light-shedding, Cézanne was the artist De Kooning most admired. In a sense, De Kooning expanded Cézanne’s “petit sensation” from small and relatively dry to big, frowsy and very 20th century.This exhibition confirms that in many ways De Kooning was at heart a figurative painter, one in pursuit of an elusive, semiabstract reality that taunted him from the space between his canvas and the model. The caveat implicit in this view is that he was part of a European tradition and therefore conservative — especially compared with Jackson Pollock. But the works here show him forcing that tradition into a new alignment with process and with abstraction and, in this, well ahead of his time.'"
"'11-06-17,'1','Smithfield Foods posted record profits for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday as the company, the world’s largest hog producer, was able to raise prices.The company also announced a $150 million stock buyback, and its shares jumped more than 6 percent.Smithfield had struggled during the recession as consumers cut back on spending in restaurants and on more expensive ham in favor of cheaper foods. With demand returning, however, Smithfield said it had been able to pass on the higher costs it had been paying for corn and soybeans to feed its hogs.“The fundamentals are very strong for the industry,” C. Larry Pope, Smithfield’s chief executive, told analysts during a conference call. “No one wants to push through price increases, but it’s a reality of life.”Smithfield reported net income of $98.4 million, or 59 cents a share, for the three months ended May 1. That compared with a net loss of $4.6 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding a charge tied to early debt retirement, adjusted earnings were 85 cents a share, beating the average forecast of 82 cents, according to analysts polled by FactSet.While hog and pork prices have rebounded, industry analysts were unconvinced that consumers had overcome their economic jitters, and warned that a slowing economy would leave Smithfield with high feed prices but a diminished ability to cover those costs.'"
"'11-06-17,'1','OTTAWA — Air Canada and the Canadian Auto Workers union said on Thursday that they had reached a tentative agreement to end a strike by 3,800 customer service agents.While the union said that its members would all be back at work by Friday, the settlement put off resolution of the most contentious issue in the negotiations. Binding arbitration will now determine the fate of Air Canada’s plan to give new employees a different pension plan without defined retirement benefits. Current Air Canada workers have a defined-benefit plan that is underfinanced by 2.1 billion Canadian dollars.“We could not settle that issue in collective bargaining,” Ken Lewenza, the union’s president, told a news conference after apologizing to future Air Canada employees.Mr. Lewenza said that the airline had agreed to significantly reduce and delay changes it sought to the pension plan covering current employees.The union asked its members, who went on strike early Tuesday morning, to return to work rather than wait for the results of a ratification vote, a process that will take several days.“It is business as usual at Air Canada,” Duncan Dee, the airline’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.'"
"'11-06-17,'1','Boeing on Thursday raised its long-range forecast for commercial aircraft demand, citing expectations that annual increases in passenger and cargo traffic, particularly in Asia, would continue to outpace average global economic growth over the next two decades.The plane maker predicted that airlines would buy 33,500 new jets through 2030. That represented an increase of 8.5 percent from its previous forecast of 30,900 planes, made last July as airlines were just beginning to emerge from a downturn set off by the 2008-9 financial crisis.Boeing, based in Chicago, said that the new orders would be worth $4 trillion, up 11 percent from the $3.6 trillion forecast a year ago.“Not only is there a strong demand for air travel and new airplanes today,” said Randy Tinseth, vice president for marketing at Boeing’s commercial airplanes division, “but the fundamental drivers of air travel — including economic growth, world trade and liberalization — all point to a healthy long-term demand.”The 20-year forecast from Boeing was announced in advance of the Paris Air Show, which opens Monday at Le Bourget Airport.Airbus in December predicted sales of 26,000 commercial planes through the end of 2029, with a market value of $3.2 trillion.'"
"'11-06-17,'1','Fewer people applied for first-time unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department reported, indicating some improvement in jobs. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits in the week that ended June 11 dropped 16,000, which was more than expected, to 414,000. The less-volatile four-week moving average held at 424,750, the lowest level since April 23.Still, applications have been above 400,000 for 10 weeks, suggesting that any recovery in the job market remains anemic.In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that housing starts rose 3.5 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 560,000 units. April’s starts were revised up to a 541,000 unit pace.Despite the gain, the pace of home-building is well below the level required for a robust housing market, and the surfeit of foreclosed homes is expected to weigh on the sector for some time.Housing permits, a measure of future construction, rose 8.7 percent in May to their highest level since December. But apartments and condominiums were a big part of that increase. Permits for buildings with five or more units surged to their highest point since October 2008.The number of single-family homes started in May rose 3.7 percent, but the pace still lags behind last year. Single-family homes make up 80 percent of residential construction.Outside of jobs and houses, manufacturing showed continued weakness.On Thursday, for the second consecutive day, a gauge of regional manufacturing activity in the United States showed a steep decline. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index of manufacturing conditions fell to –7.7 in June, down from 3.9 in May and the lowest reading since July 2009.On Wednesday, the Fed’s regional survey for New York showed a decline in both manufacturing activity and optimism for June.Factory output, which had been something of a bright spot since the ended, has slowed this spring.While has been in the forefront of investors’ minds for some time, it was an even greater focus this week, as Prime Minister of Greece said he would reshuffle his cabinet to get his government to approve additional austerity measures demanded by its foreign creditors.The looming fiscal crisis in Europe overshadowed the fresh data, said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners.“The headlines out of Greece are the most important thing this week,” Mr. Landesman said. “We are going to have a very volatile year. All the liquidity pumped into the market has helped the stock market, but not the global economy.”He added: “I still think this market believes they are going to bail out Greece.”led the Dow, rising $1.13, or 2.4 percent, to $48.41. rose 2.1 percent, to $34.97. gained 1.8 percent, to $34.50.In the broader market, materials, information technology and consumer discretionary shares declined less than 1 percent.

"'11-06-18,'0','It is often said that academic politics are so vicious because the stakes are so low, but in the matter of Mr. Protess and the wrongly convicted men he helped to free, the stakes could not have been higher.“He is in the hall of fame of investigative journalists in the 20th century,” said Mark Feldstein, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. “Using cheap student labor, he has targeted a very specific issue, and that work has reopened cases, changed laws and saved lives.”Dennis Culloton, a lawyer who served as press secretary for Governor Ryan, said that Medill’s work led in part to the decision to essentially shut down Illinois’s death row. “I think it would have been an academic discussion if not for David’s work,” he said.Behind that public success, however, there were gnawing tensions within Medill. Mr. Protess’s tendency to clash with authority did not end with law enforcement. He came into conflict with at least two deans of the Medill school, including the current one, John Lavine, who started in 2006 after a long career in newspapers.Mr. Lavine is a polarizing figure at Medill: he is widely credited with stabilizing an institution that was suffering financially but he also led a successful effort to rename the school the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, a change he said reflected the school’s broader agenda but one that was widely ridiculed by alumni and journalists.Mr. Protess said the project initially received support from the dean, but now says that was a charade, “an attempt to seem as if he were fighting for the First Amendment when in fact he was undermining the Innocence Project at every turn.” Mr. Lavine counters that he had no choice but to remove Mr. Protess: “What I saw warranted the decision that I made.”Mr. Protess (whose son Ben is a reporter for The New York Times) started the Innocence Project at Medill in 1999 after spending much of his career looking into questionable convictions for Chicago Lawyer magazine. Working with the Center on Wrongful Convictions, a sibling project at the Northwestern Law School, Mr. Protess methodically vetted cases, laid out lines of inquiry for his student journalists and guided them through their reporting assignments.As the list of exonerations grew, the global reputation of Medill — and Mr. Protess — soared and students were drawn to the project to be trained in the real-life crucible of capital cases.“His class was life-changing,” said Evan S. Benn, a former student of Mr. Protess who is now a reporter at The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.It was an oddity of the Innocence Project that students rarely wrote their own articles (until 2008, when the project put them online). Instead, the students, sometimes working with private investigators, would produce one-page reports about their findings, then be partnered with well-known journalists to bring new information to light. The lack of direct journalistic output concerned at least one former dean.“It was always kind of fuzzy whether he was engaged in journalism or a kind of guerrilla social justice law operation where the ends justified the means,” said Michael Janeway, a dean at Medill from 1989 to 1996 who is now a professor of journalism at Columbia. “David was not totally irresponsible. He was zealot in pursuit of a cause, a cause you could not question.”Maurice Possley, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and a collaborator with Mr. Protess, said that Mr. Protess was not well served by a culture of permission that came to surround him.“In the structure of a newspaper, you have an editor who is not vested in the reporting who can push back. I don’t know if he had that kind of editor,” he said, adding “David is a character, but in my dealing with him, he’s always been incredibly professional.”In 2003, the Innocence Project became involved in the case of Anthony McKinney, a man sentenced to life on a murder conviction. Nine teams of student journalists concluded that Mr. McKinney, who was convicted in 1981 of killing a security guard, was actually watching the Spinks-Ali championship fight at the time of the killing.Two eyewitnesses who had identified Mr. McKinney recanted when students working with Mr. Protess questioned them, and a story by Mr. Possley, using some of the students’ work, was published in The Chicago Sun-Times in 2008.The doubts raised by the Innocence Project led the Cook County state’s attorney to re-examine the case, but investigators found instances in which “we were not getting the same answers the students claimed to have gotten,” said Sally Daly, a spokeswoman for the state’s attorney’s office. In 2009, the state’s attorney Anita Alvarez filed a sweeping subpoena for Innocence Project materials, including students’ notes, summaries, e-mails and even grades, on the theory that they would report tendentiously in favor of innocence in the hope of getting a better grade.Mr. Protess immediately objected, saying that, as journalists, he and his students were protected under Illinois’s shield law. He went further, saying that the prosecutor was more interested in going after students to discredit their reporting than getting to the bottom of what happened in the McKinney case.Ms. Daly said that the state’s attorney spent two years investigating, interviewing dozens of people in six states, before asking the court to force Northwestern to produce the information.“The professor framed it as a vendetta,” she said. “It was untrue.”At first, the project had the school’s support. “At the time, I said if you are going to put a professor in jail because he is not turning over student grades and materials, all of which I believed were covered by the shield law, you are going to have to put me in jail first,” said Mr. Lavine.The attorney’s office did uncover several situations in which students pushed professional boundaries. In November 2006, one of Mr. Protess’s students identified herself as a census worker while trying to find a witness. In 2009, another student posed as a worker for the power company. In both cases, Mr. Protess says he didn’t know about the tactics in advance but has no professional issue with them.Last year, Northwestern started an internal investigation into the group. In September 2009, Karen Daniel, Mr. McKinney’s lead counsel, made an explosive admission to university investigators: she received “a significant amount of materials” from Mr. Protess’s students. That would negate the journalist’s privilege that Mr. Protess had claimed in the hope of keeping the students’ work out of Ms. Alvarez’s hands.Mr. Protess said then that it had been several years since the events and that he could not remember what he had and had not turned over. But in a search of Innocence Project computers, the university turned up an e-mail from Mr. Protess to his assistant in 2006 that indicated the students’ reporting memos had been shared with the defense.“My position about memos, as you know, is that we share everything with the legal team, and don’t keep copies,” he wrote, referring to Mr. McKinney’s lawyers.But the copy of the e-mail he provided to university lawyers was altered to read, “My position about memos, as you know, is that we don’t keep copies.”Mr. Protess said that he altered the e-mail to reflect the actual practice of the Innocence Project as he remembered it.“Everybody assigns sinister motives to what I did, but my intent was not to mislead; it was precisely the opposite,” he said. “My part was due to memory failure about the extent to which I had shared student memos with the defense, and then I stubbornly stuck to that position when I felt ganged up on by everybody else.”With the discovery of the e-mail, what had been a publicly united front broke down behind the scenes. At a hastily called faculty meeting at Medill on April 6, Mr. Lavine presented his colleagues with a PowerPoint presentation of statements and actions by Mr. Protess that the dean considered misleading, and asked for opinions. But by the time the faculty members got back to their desks, a press release had already been issued announcing Mr. Protess would not be teaching spring semester and making it clear he would not be welcomed back after that.“The situation turned on a dime,” said Douglas Foster, an associate professor. “You have the most lionized member of the faculty suddenly becoming somebody who is summarily removed from teaching with no notice and subjected to a kind of banishment. It’s a textbook case of how not to manage conflict.”Mr. Protess has since signed a negotiated agreement to leave the university. The work of the Innocence Project continues under the leadership of Alec Klein, a former investigative reporter for The Washington Post. At the beginning of June, the Innocence Project published a story students produced raising serious questions about the murder conviction of Donald Watkins, who was sentenced to 56 years in prison in 2007. Meanwhile, Mr. McKinney’s appeal is at a standstill.Another of Mr. Protess’s former students, Jennifer Merritt, said that despite the difficulties, the Innocence Project should continue.“The last thing I want is for the investigative journalism and the teaching to go away,” said Ms. Merritt, now an editor at The Associated Press. “There may be some things that people question, but the end results are amazing.”'"

They are courageous, loyal, smart and would give their lives for their families. They are not, however, diseaseproof or bulletproof.To spend $230,000 on a living thing that could be felled by illness or a bullet gives new meaning to the phrase “wretched excess.”If these people need a status security system, they could spend a fraction of that on a well-trained protection dog and have money left over to donate to one of the many worthy rescue groups trying to save abandoned and stray animals from the dire fates that await them on the streets or in kill shelters.'"
"'11-06-18,'0','As a result, banks are seeing a rise in what are known as technical defaults, when homeowners fall behind on their taxes or homeowner’s insurance, both of which are required to avoid foreclosure. According to Reverse Market Insight, about 4 to 5 percent of active reverse mortgages, or 25,000 to 30,000 borrowers, are in default on at least one of those items.Bank of America, meanwhile, said that declining home values made fewer people eligible for reverse mortgages. So it decided to redeploy at least half of those working on the mortgages to its loan modification division, which has been criticized for failing to help enough homeowners on the brink of foreclosure.For Wells Fargo, however, the inability to assess borrowers’ financial health was the biggest factor for exiting the business. Anyone over the age of 62 with enough home equity can take out a reverse mortgage, regardless of their other income. The amount of money received is determined by the borrower’s age, the amount of equity in the home and prevailing interest rates.“We are not allowed, as an originator, to decline anyone,” added Mr. Codel of Wells Fargo. We “worked closely with HUD to find an alternative solution and we were unable to find one with them, which led to this outcome.”Reverse mortgage borrowers are required to pay premiums for mortgage insurance, which protects the lender if the homes are ultimately sold for less than the mortgage value, since the government is required to pay the difference to the lender. The premium rates were increased last October to account for declining home values (though one sizable upfront mortgage premium was eliminated to make the loans more attractive to certain borrowers).But lenders are responsible for making tax and insurance payments on behalf of delinquent borrowers until they submit an insurance claim to HUD, at which point the agency would be responsible since it provided the insurance against default.In January, HUD sent a letter to lenders and reverse mortgage counselors that provided guidance on how to report delinquent loans to the agency, and what steps the lenders could take to get borrowers back on track, like establishing a realistic repayment plan that could be completed in two years or less, or getting a HUD-approved mortgage counselor involved to help come up with a solution. If one cannot be reached, the lenders must begin foreclosure proceedings.Both Wells Fargo and Bank of America have said they have not foreclosed on any borrowers to date.The National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, the industry group, said it has been working with HUD to come up with procedures that would allow lenders to assess a prospective borrower’s income and expenses, or at least require homeowners to set aside money to pay for taxes and insurance. A spokeswoman for HUD said the guidance is still being drafted.As it stands now, borrowers are required to see a HUD-approved lender before they can apply for a reverse mortgage. As part of that process, consumers are educated on the nuts and bolts of how the loans work and what their responsibilities are, including that they need to be able to continue to pay taxes, insurance and keep the property in good repair.“We don’t tell consumers what decision to make, but we do try to give them the tools to make a decision,” said Sue Hunt, director of reverse mortgage counseling at CredAbility, a nonprofit consumer credit counseling agency. She added that their sessions last about an hour and 15 minutes, on average. The counselors also look at the consumer’s budget to see if it is sustainable with the mortgage, as well as what circumstances might arise that could throw the borrower off track.“Outside factors are affecting people who thought five or six years ago that they were in pretty good shape,” she added. “The world has changed a bit around them.”In days past, the borrower would get the reverse mortgage, and equity would continue to build, experts said, which would provide borrowers with more options — like refinancing — should they fall on hard times. Declining home values have changed that calculus for both bankers and consumers. Borrowers have not been able to pull out as much money. At the same time, the government has also tightened its withdrawal limits.There were a total of more than 50,000 reverse mortgages, totaling $12.66 billion, made industrywide since last October, according to HUD.Both Wells Fargo and Bank of America will continue to service their existing reverse mortgages. And the reverse mortgage association has said it will work with its members to ensure that senior citizens who need the loans can get them, though some experts said that less competition could increase certain fees.“There is a certain amount of the business done by Wells and Bank of America that happens because of their bank branches, brand names and large sales forces,” said John K. Lunde, president of Reverse Market Insight. “We would expect something more than half of their volume to be absorbed by the rest of the industry, with something less than half not happening.”Wells Fargo, which said that reverse mortgages represented 2.2 percent of its retail mortgage business, employs about 1,000 reverse mortgage workers. They are being given a chance to find other positions at the bank. Bank of America said that about half of its 600 workers have been reassigned within the bank. MetLife, the third-largest provider of reverse mortgages, declined to comment on its business.'"

Although the revolt was largely started by people who simply wanted a job, the immediate result has been slower economic growth and higher unemployment.In response, at the end of this month the United States government will be the host for a forum called Egypt: Forward, the first major event between the United States and Egypt since the protests. The forum will connect American and Egyptian businesses and promote increased trade between the countries.As President Obama said of Egypt in a speech last month, “It’s important to focus on trade, not just aid, and investment, not just assistance.” It is critical at this important juncture that we support the growth of the Egyptian economy, by building direct, sustainable trade and business partnerships between the United States and Egypt.

"'11-06-18,'0','He said playing at Congressional Country Club with the world’s best golfers — including his hero, Phil Mickelson — was cooler than receiving his driver’s license, which he did two weeks ago. (But he has yet to receive the permanent documentation, so he still uses his Santa Margarita Catholic High School photo card as ID.) And it was even more special than qualifying for the United States Amateur in 2009, at 14, when he was just 5 feet 2 inches, 120 pounds and in eighth grade. He is now 5-11 after growing six inches in the last six months.Here, Hossler had the opportunity to play on the same course as Mickelson and enjoyed other perks of being a top golfer. He took advantage of the free massages, getting one every day, and every night he sat in the Jacuzzi at his hotel, soaking up both heat and the atmosphere. He relished getting the keys to a new Lexus, the sponsor that gives each player a car to use this week.He also got tips from pros like Ángel Cabrera, Anthony Kim and Camilo Villegas, who treated him just like any other colleague, Hossler said. Kim gave him advice on how to play very firm greens, he said.But Hossler’s mother, Amy Balsz, could still sense his nerves.“His first day on the course, I saw him looking over his shoulder a few times to look and see, ‘Oh my gosh, who’s that golfer?’ ” she said. “A few times I saw him notice how many people were following him and cheering for him, but for the most part he’s been pretty calm about all of this.”Hossler has always been mature for his age, said his stepfather, Matt Balsz, a real estate appraiser.When Beau was 5, Matt Balsz asked him what he wanted to eat for his birthday and he answered, “Crab legs.”“I was like, what, crab legs?” Balsz said. “What 5-year-old wants crab legs? But Beau didn’t want a hamburger, didn’t want fries. He was talking like an adult already.”Hossler started playing golf when he was about 7 or 8, using Snoopy clubs. He gave up baseball when he was 10 and turned down an offer to play on an all-star team to focus on golf, his mother said. In a jiffy, he went from wanting to be an owner of a BMW lot when he grew up to wanting to play on the PGA Tour.On a wall of his bedroom is an old black-and-white photo of Ben Hogan to remind him of his goal.But to get here, Hossler had to juggle a tight schedule, taking two finals — pre-calculus and Advanced Placement chemistry — a day after he qualified for the Open. Before saying how well he did on those exams, he checked to see if his parents were nearby. In a low voice, he said, “Not too good.”Still, his mother says that Hossler has a 4.3 grade point average and that keeping his grades and his golf at high levels eats up most of his free time. He has been so busy that he has not had a chance to get his braces tightened, so he may be wearing them well into his 20s, she said.But lately, there has been evidence that Hossler is interested in a typical subject for a teenage boy: a few girls have suddenly been seen hanging around the house, his mother said. At the Open, Hossler showed more signs that he is a typical teen. He shooed away his father, Beau Hossler Sr., when he suggested that Hossler introduce himself to Mickelson in the dining room at Congressional.“He was like, ‘Dad, no, get out of here,’ ” Beau Sr. said. “But I guess I’m just lucky that he still talks to me a little. That’s all you can hope for with a teenage boy.”Once play began, however, Hossler transformed into someone with as much calm and confidence as someone who has played on the Tour for years. It took only one shot for him to rid himself of the butterflies, he said.But for his caddie, his godfather, Bill Schellenberg, the gravity of the moment was too much. He said he felt faint as Hossler walked the green of that first hole and had to fall to his knee to compose himself.For Hossler, though, the experience of playing at the Open simply foreshadowed what life would be like on the Tour in the years to come. But his father wants to remind him that those days are very likely still far off.“On Monday, life will go back to normal,” Beau Hossler Sr. said. “He still will have to walk the dogs and take the trash out. No more free massages or driving his own new Lexus. He’ll be just a regular kid again.”'"

"'11-06-18,'0','It got harder after he left, as the closer Carlos Marmol put the tying runs on base in the ninth, walking Russell Martin and allowing a two-out single to Brett Gardner before striking out pinch-hitter Chris Dickerson on three pitches to end the game.The Yankees had won 18 of 21 day games this season, a not insignificant — or easily explainable — statistic heading into two straight afternoon affairs at Wrigley, where at the time of their last visit Steve Bartman was an anonymous financial analyst. Over all, the on-field excitement paled in comparison to 2003, when the Cubs were good and Roger Clemens was chasing his 300th career victory. That visit was the Yankees’ first to Wrigley Field since the 1938 World Series. Derek Jeter’s calf injury, which interrupted his pursuit of his 3,000th career hit, also took away some of the anticipation for this series.But if Jeter had been healthy, could he have solved Davis? The first seven pitches Mark Teixeira saw were out of the strike zone.“Not because he was pitching around me, but because his ball just moves everywhere,” Teixeira said. “If he doesn’t know where it’s going sometimes, then hitters aren’t going to know where it’s going.”In that respect, Davis’s style evokes a knuckleballer, and the Yankees have struggled in their matchups against fellow knuckleballers R. A. Dickey of the Mets and the Boston Red Sox’ Tim Wakefield.“He throws the ball all over the place, throws a very slow breaking ball, good changeup, good fastball, good cutter,” Alex Rodriguez said. “It’s one of those guys where you really have to center the ball, and today we didn’t do that.”That scouting report more or less applies to Freddy Garcia, whose return to Chicago, where he played parts of five seasons with the White Sox, attracted far less fanfare than the homecomings of Manager Joe Girardi, a former Cub and Cubs fan; the pitching coach Larry Rothschild, who held the same position with the Cubs for nine seasons; and Curtis Granderson, who grew up in the southern suburbs. Garcia pitched seven innings, and it was a surprise that he lasted that long. Had Garcia allowed another hit or two in the third inning, when the Cubs scored their third run, Girardi said Jeff Marquez would have come in.But Garcia said he made an adjustment after the second inning, after sensing the Cubs had timed his slider and splitter. He started throwing more sinkers, and after Aramis Ramirez’s run-scoring single in the third, Garcia rebounded to retire 11 straight hitters, staying in long enough for two at-bats against Davis.“I couldn’t wait to hit, man,” Garcia said. “But I got assigned to bunt twice.”He was successful twice, but the Yankees failed to capitalize. They did not score until after Davis left to a standing ovation, exiting when Swisher ripped a one-out double in the eighth. The left-hander Sean Marshall struck out Granderson but allowed a single to Teixeira, drawing the Yankees to 3-1 as their fans, who sat mostly subdued for the first seven innings, rumbled to life. But when Marmol struck out Rodriguez swinging to end the inning, a roar engulfed Wrigley.“It’s definitely a great stadium, great atmosphere, great crowd — it was a perfect day,” Rodriguez said. “For the Cubs.”With Jorge Posada unlikely to start during this six-game tour of National League ballparks, Joe Girardi said he hoped to use him as a pinch-hitter in at least five of them as a way to try to keep his hot streak going. Posada, who struck out in the ninth inning, has 16 hits in his last 36 at-bats.'"

"'11-06-18,'0','He made clear that the group’s willingness to discuss cuts comes with conditions: Reductions in benefits should be “minimal,” they should not affect current recipients and instead should be directed “far off in the future,” and they should be offset by increases in -generated revenue.Nonetheless, the group’s openness to the possibility of unspecified cuts was seen as a significant development by people on all sides of the Social Security question because of AARP’s influence on federal policies affecting older Americans, including , prescription drugs and many more.Third Way, a moderate Democratic group in Washington that has favored possible reductions in benefits, called AARP’s position “a watershed moment” in the debate over Social Security.“Now that they have opened the door to reform, it is time for lawmakers to walk through it,” said Jonathan Cowan, president of Third Way.But other advocacy groups that are pushing to preserve Social Security benefits accused AARP of effectively abandoning its core constituency.Max Richtman, executive vice president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group in Washington, said the timing of AARP’s statements was particularly bad because it came in the midst of deliberations between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans about the and overall deficit reduction.AARP insisted that the Social Security trust funds should not be raided to reduce the deficit and that the two issues were separate. But Mr. Richtman said the group’s openness to considering future cuts would no doubt be used by deficit hawks to push for immediate cuts in Social Security benefits as part of the debate over deficit reduction.“I think it’s tragic that AARP would, wittingly or unwittingly, play into the hands of people who have never really liked Social Security and want to decimate it,” Mr. Richtman said. “AARP is the 800-pound gorilla, but they do not speak for seniors.”Republican leaders, who have led calls for revamping Social Security, had no immediate comments on AARP’s willingness to consider benefit reductions.An aide to the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity under committee protocol, said AARP’s position was a welcome acknowledgment that Social Security would be unable to pay future benefits at the current rate and that it must be restructured.“The longer we wait,” the aide said, “the more difficult it will be to protect current beneficiaries and those who rely on Social Security the most.”The most recent projections from the , issued last month, indicate that at the current rate, the program’s trust funds will be exhausted by 2036, and that $6.5 trillion in additional money will be needed over a 75-year period to pay all scheduled benefits.Mr. Rother said AARP expected to hear criticism from some of its members over its position on possible cuts.“We have such a broad membership, Mr. Rother said. “I’m sure there will be some who will not be happy, but others will be eager to see the program put on a stronger financial footing for the long term.”While AARP has not issued specific recommendations or figures on how benefit reductions might be carried out, the group’s recent discussions with its members signal support for using increased revenue to fill two-thirds of the projected gap, and benefits reductions for one-third, Mr. Rother said.As word of AARP’s position set off debate in Washington on Friday, the group’s chief executive, Barry Rand, issued a formal statement saying that the group’s position had not changed in any substantive way and refuting what he described as “misleading” media reports.“Let me be clear — AARP is as committed as we’ve ever been to fighting to protect Social Security for today’s seniors and strengthening it for future generations,” Mr. Rand said.While he did not directly address the question of possible cuts in benefits in his statement, Mr. Rand said his group would be working to evaluate any proposed changes in Social Security “to determine how each might — individually or in different combinations — impact the lives of current and future retirees.”'"
"'11-06-18,'0','Michael Sonnenfeldt, the founder of Tiger 21, used the term “carefrontation” to describe what happens in a portfolio defense. The assessments are meant to be direct, unsettling and possibly painful to hear, Mr. Sonnenfeldt told me. But the goal is to get members to think differently about what they are doing with their investments and about everything in their lives that is affected by their wealth, from their family to charities.“It’s not meant for the faint-hearted,” Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. “This is a process that some people could clearly find offensive or discomforting.”What I experienced was rough, but it was also thought-provoking. The value to me — and to anyone given a similar opportunity — was that the members challenged everything about my assumptions on saving and spending. Here’s some of what I took away.OUR MISTAKES In the week leading up to this, I worked with Joel Treisman, an executive coach and the chairman of one of Tiger’s 17 groups, to gather up all of our financial reports.I was confident that the group would think my wife and I were in good financial shape. We save a good percentage of our income. We don’t have any debt beyond mortgages and a car payment. We probably spend a bit too much on food and pet care, but we don’t run up credit card bills to do it.The members were warm and welcoming as we filled our plates with poached salmon, grilled asparagus and buffalo mozzarella from the buffet. But as soon as we were seated, it was all business. And I was immediately on the defensive. There were two big surprises but also blunt advice and some thoughtful questions about our portfolio.First, the surprises. The group agreed that we did not have enough life or disability insurance. We both have insurance that would cover about three or four years of earnings if one of us died. This seemed sufficient to get past a few years of sorting things out. The group disagreed. Going from two incomes to one would mean a radical rethinking of our life.We needed more sizable policies to give us the freedom to sort through things. Though we both carry disability insurance, the policies are old and do not reflect our current income. They would also cover only 50 to 60 percent of our old base salaries. The members thought we should buy individual policies to add to this.The second surprise was about our savings. We have been saving about 15 percent of our post-tax income. Alan Mantell, a lawyer who made his money in real estate, development and investment, said the issue was not how much we saved but how we thought about spending.“You need to ask, ‘What can I afford to spend versus what do I need to spend?’ ” he said. We could be saving more money for retirement — or in case something bad happens — if we cut back on things we did not really need, he said.All the members agreed that we should sell our vacation condominium. “You need to become more liquid,” said Thomas Gallagher, the former vice chairman of CIBC World Markets. “If something bad happens, it’s easy to get rid of a dog walker; it’s hard to get rid of a house in Naples.”Florida real estate is in a sad state, so I asked what they would do with an offer that was less than our mortgage?“Take it,” Mr. Gallagher said. “Write the check and be done with it.”As for our portfolio of stocks and bonds, the questions were more basic. Leslie C. Quick III, whose money came from Quick & Reilly, the discount brokerage firm, looked at our investments — 50 percent in equities, 34 percent in fixed income, 12 percent in commodities and real estate and 4 percent in cash — and wanted to know how our investment manager had done in the bear market. He also thought we should ask our adviser how he balances the risks in our jobs against those in our portfolio.OUR SOLUTIONS Because I had parachuted into Tiger 21 for one meeting, I was taken aback by the group’s brutal honesty. I walked out after three hours in a daze. Over the next couple of days, though, I concluded that the members had made some great points.Some solutions were simple. We can increase our term life insurance for comparatively little money — $1 million of term life costs about $700 a year. Individual disability policies cost more. Barry Lundquist, president of the Council for Disability Awareness, said the yearly premium would usually be 1 to 3 percent of a person’s salary, but the payout would still be limited to a percentage of that person’s income.As for our portfolio, I put the questions to our adviser, K. C. King of Emerson Investment Management. I liked that he did not sidestep the bear market question: Emerson’s portfolios did better than the benchmarks in 2008, but they lost value like everything other than cash, gold and Treasuries.Where I took comfort, though, was in how he thought about our portfolio. “We’re very mindful that what we’re managing for you and most of our clients is their core portfolio,” Mr. King said. “If someone said from the Tiger group that this is fairly conservative and you’re not taking big swings, we’d say you’re right. This is the portfolio that we’re trying to keep for your daughter’s education and into your retirement.”The issue that Mr. Mantell raised about spending is the thorniest one. My wife and I are under no illusions that having a condo in Florida makes financial sense. Trimming spending in other places is easier: Walking the dogs ourselves, for instance, would save $100 a week or $5,200 a year.In the end, though, there are such radical differences between the wealth of the Tiger members and most Americans that some of their advice could not apply.Mr. Sonnenfeldt estimated that 90 percent of Tiger members had paid off the mortgages on all of their homes.They also tend to view money as something to preserve rather than accumulate. Mr. Sonnenfeldt said members spent about 3 percent of their wealth annually, which allowed the principal to continue to grow. But at the $10 million entry level, this would mean $300,000 a year.Perhaps most important, none of the members became rich by eating out less. They became rich by working in industries that paid extremely well or by building businesses that they later sold.Still, what was best about the session was that no one pulled any punches. Their honesty forced us to think hard about the assumptions we were making. Yes, it was difficult. But really, who wouldn’t want advice from those who have made it?'"
"'11-06-18,'0','The euro continued to be buffeted by European debt developments, reacting sharply on Friday to the announcement by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany about the Greek bailout.“That is when the euro popped,” said Brian Dolan, the chief currency strategist for Forex.com. The European currency rose to $1.4306 in late New York trading from $1.4207 late in the day on Thursday.Mr. Dolan said that the debt issue was likely to continue to weigh on the European currency, however. “You get a short-term rebound in the euro but the long-term issues are still there, and that is going to prevent the euro from a sustained recovery,” he said.In European markets, the CAC-40 in Paris rose 31.43 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,823.74. The DAX in Germany was up 53.85 points, or 0.8 percent, at 7,164.05, and the FTSE in London gained 16.13 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,714.94.Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist of Key Private Bank, said concerns about European debt and a slowdown in the United States economy had probably pushed United States stock prices down too far, too quickly. “We priced in a lot of negatives over a short time period,” he said. With investors having reduced their exposure to equities, he said, now the market “has the opportunity to rally a bit.”In the bond market, Treasury issues slipped Friday after rallying on Thursday in response to European debt worries.

"'11-06-18,'0','But critics said that the reshuffle was a cosmetic, not structural, change. Yanis Varoufakis, a political economist at the University of Athens, told Skai television that “not even God almighty” as finance minister could change the dire situation.Greeks increasingly feel they are unfairly suffering for mistakes made by their leaders and banks and have staged labor strikes and three weeks of daily protests to express their outrage. This week, Mr. Papandreou has contended with two defections from within his own Socialist Party and growing dissent. After the reshuffle, a confidence vote in the new government was expected on Tuesday night.Mr. Venizelos, a respected professor of constitutional law at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in northern Greece, now faces the task of pushing through the hugely unpopular austerity program. A rival of Mr. Papandreou, he has held other ministerial portfolios over the years including culture and development, and challenged Mr. Papandreou for the leadership of the Socialist Party, known as Pasok, in 2007. Though he lost the leadership race, Mr. Papandreou has continued to rely heavily on him.The new cabinet was met with criticism from other political parties. The main conservative opposition, New Democracy, said the removal of Mr. Papaconstantinou as finance minister amounted to “an admission of the failure of the government’s economic policy.” A spokesman for New Democracy, Yiannis Michelakis, accused the government of “rustling up a new administration to enforce the same erroneous policies.” Syriza, a coalition of leftist parties, said nothing could prevent the collapse of Mr. Papandreou’s beleaguered administration, and the Communists described the new cabinet as “dangerous.”Mr. Venizelos said the government would continue to work for consensus with the parties that have opposed its austerity program. “We are open to ideas and dialogue but will not diverge from our fiscal targets,” he said. “The country must be saved and will be saved but we must work together, all Greeks together,’ he said.Speaking at the same press conference, Mr. Papaconstantinou said he was “extremely happy” to be handing over the task of reviving the economy to a colleague with “experience and dedication.” While he acknowledged making mistakes during his term as finance minister, Mr. Papaconstantinou said the government’s actions had helped to avert a worse fate.“We had reached the brink of disaster, and we managed to keep the country on its feet, and put into motion a series of important economic reforms,” he said. As evidence, he cited a crackdown on tax evasion, which has seen limited success, as well as the launch of a drive to privatize state assets. Greece, he noted, managed to reduce its budget deficit last year by 5 percent of gross domestic product, an unprecedented achievement for a euro-zone country.Elias Mossialos, a professor of health policy at the London School of Economics who was appointed as the new government spokesman, replacing George Petalotis, told Net television, a state channel, that the priority now was “to restore the stability of the Greek economy.” He also said that “negotiations were under way” with Greece’s creditors regarding the terms of the bailout, but did not state explicitly that the country would seek changes to the existing agreement.The Finance Ministry was initially offered to Lucas Papademos, a Columbia-educated economist who served as vice president of the European Central Bank from 2002 to 2010, but he turned it down.Mr. Venizelos will also become a second deputy prime minister. Mr. Papandreou already has another Socialist veteran, Theodoros Pangalos, 73, as his first deputy.Mr. Papaconstantinou, 50, the chief architect of the Greek government’s austerity drive, was named environment minister, a clear demotion.Other key moves include the ousting of Dimitris Droutsas, 43, as foreign minister. He was replaced by Stavros Lambrinidis, a Yale-educated lawyer. Mr. Droutsas is broadly regarded by observers as having fallen short of the demands of a difficult portfolio.Another victim of the reshuffle was Labor Minister Louka Katseli, 59, one of the most controversial figures in Mr. Papandreou’s cabinet. The Princeton-educated economist had repeatedly clashed with Greece’s foreign creditors on several proposed economic reforms including amending labor contracts that protect the rights of workers in the private sector. She was replaced by her deputy, Yiannis Koutroumanis.'"

"'11-06-19,'0','For Mr. Hill, 48, and Mr. Gebhardt, 46, even to be in position of rewriting the books is fortunate. The McDonald Observatory — where the dark-energy observations, made with the third-largest telescope in the world, are set to begin next spring after nearly 10 years of development — is about 425 miles west of Austin, in Fort Davis. In April, the Rock House Fire, which started 35 miles south of there, in Marfa, scorched the Davis Mountains surrounding the state-of-the-art observatory, putting it perilously close to going up in flames.Mother Nature has not been the only threat. Lack of financing for an abstract experiment with little or no immediate pay-off has stymied several similar projects that sprang from the discovery of dark energy in 1998. Now, only a handful of those remain, and none have the proprietary will of Hetdex — a testament to the ego of the state of Texas.Nearly a third of the money raised for Hetdex, which includes a one-of-its-kind $16 million spectrograph created by Mr. Hill called Virus (Visible Integral-Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph), came from private in-state sources. The largest donor, Harold Simmons, a Dallas investor and U.T. alumnus whom Forbes magazine ranked as the 55th-richest person in the United States, gave two gifts totaling $6.5 million. (Mr. Simmons’s family foundation is a major donor to The Texas Tribune.)“I could see that figuring out the nature of dark energy would be of historic importance, not just in astronomy but for all science, and for all humankind,” Mr. Simmons said in an e-mail. “As a proud Texan, I wanted a Texas-based, Texas-led project to be first.”Meanwhile, broader debate has recently emerged over the role of academic research in state universities, with some conservatives calling for a greater emphasis on teaching to improve efficiency. But many in the higher education community have argued that the benefits of research extend beyond universities’ bottom lines.“This is helping us train the next generation of engineers and leaders in these fields of technology,” Mr. Gebhardt said of Hetdex, which derives about a quarter of its financing from U.T. and a $6 million special biennial line item in the state budget. “And that’s important because we don’t have a lot of that in the country.”The impact on education goes even deeper, Mr. Hill said, explaining: “Kids, when they’re 5 or 6 or 7, these are the ones who get interested in science through fields like paleontology and astronomy. These are exciting areas.”Where the education system falls short, Mr. Hill added, “is failing to take that excitement and actually train them so they remain excited through college.”The McDonald Observatory’s history also provides a valuable lesson in collaboration.On a recent tour, Thomas Barnes, the observatory’s superintendent, said U.T. did not even have an astronomy department in 1926, when William Johnson McDonald, a banker from Paris, Tex., bequeathed his $1.1 million fortune to start an observatory. U.T. enlisted the University of Chicago to design and build the operation under the direction of Otto Struve, a Russian-born, fourth-generation astronomer who operated the McDonald Observatory for 30 years, ushering it into the U.T.-led era.“Better a foreigner than a damn Yankee,” one of the U.T. regents at the time said of Mr. Struve’s appointment, according to Mr. Barnes.And now the U.T. astronomy department has a chance to enhance its history.“There will only be one time when we figure out what is in the universe, and then it gets placed in the textbooks,” Mr. Gebhardt said. “We are basically living through that time now.”'"
"'11-06-19,'0','An unassuming building on Bush Street in San Francisco shelters Audium, billed as a theater of sculptured sound. Stan Shaff began the sound experiment more than 50 years ago. In a room that looks like a set piece from the original “Star Trek,” audience members in total darkness are immersed in what Mr. Shaff calls “sound choreography”: a cornucopia of sounds, from running water to galloping horses to electronic music.Mr. Shaff is a classically trained trumpeter who derives much of his inspiration from playing antiphonal “call and response” music. He conducted some of his earliest experiments with space and sound with the help of his friend Seymour Locks, the pioneer of rock ’n’ roll light shows.Audium, at 1616 Bush, seats 49 in a circular arrangement; 176 speakers are placed throughout the room (nine are under the floor). The 45-minute show happens every Friday and Saturday; tickets are $20 (cash only).Mr. Shaff has created nine sound experiences in Audium’s 51 years. He considers each new composition to be an extension of the ones before it.The building that houses Audium used to be a bakery with a large, novelty doughnut hanging above the entrance. Mr. Shaff tried to save the doughnut when Audium moved in, but it fell and broke.Audium began as a series of performances by Mr. Shaff and Doug McEachern, the project’s equipment designer. In 1965, they installed the sound theater in a building in the Richmond district, and then in 1972 moved it — with the help of a National Endowment for the Arts grant — into its current home.If the Name FitsAudium is an invented word that Mr. Shaff says they chose because it sounded like “auditorium” but seemed “newer.”'"
"'11-06-19,'0','For Patrick Gleason, starring in a film about a professional wrestler who finds unlikely redemption at the end of his career was not just a new experience but a metaphor for his own life story.Just a few years ago, Mr. Gleason, 43, sat in a prison cell, serving a 15-year sentence for the attempted murder of a police officer at a Maywood nightclub in 1989. Then a childhood friend in the movie business contacted the tall, tattooed Mr. Gleason after he had been released to serve the last three years of his sentence under house arrest.The friend asked Mr. Gleason if he would be interested in a starring role in a movie being produced by Humble Pie Films, a Chicago production company that makes films on modest budgets.Mr. Gleason had a few obstacles to overcome, like the lack of professional acting experience and the house-arrest time remaining. But a sympathetic parole officer helped him complete his house arrest four months early, and the gamble paid off.In April 2011, the film in which he starred, “Fancypants,” won the Best Feature award at the Sunscreen Film Festival in St. Petersburg, Fla., an international festival that receives close to 400 film submissions. Humble Pie is currently in talks with several distributors and is hoping for a Chicago premiere.'"
"'11-06-19,'0','Re “When Food Kills,” by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, June 12): Far from blocking initiatives to make food safer, pork producers work to ensure that their products are safe. Ways they do that include raising pigs in clean, secure, climate-controlled barns and by using antibiotics responsibly to keep animals healthy. Mr. Kristof seems to have a problem with modern production facilities and animal health programs.Mr. Kristof also suggests that antibiotic use in livestock production is leading to antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are killing people. In fact, numerous peer-reviewed risk assessments show virtually no risk to humans from antibiotic use in animals.The risk to public health from overuse or misuse of antibiotics comes overwhelmingly from human medicine, not livestock production. And curtailing antibiotic use in food animals, as Mr. Kristof advocates, could endanger human health by jeopardizing the health of animals.'"
"'11-06-19,'0','Children born outside the country to an unmarried American parent are considered American citizens at birth if the parent lived in the United States before the child was born. For a mother, the required period of residence is one year. For a father, it is 10 years, five of them after he turns 14. Fathers must also prove parenthood and pledge to support the child.In a decision based on an outmoded stereotype that fathers are less committed parents, the Supreme Court let this obvious discrimination stand last week when it affirmed a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Flores-Villar v. the United States.Ruben Flores-Villar was born in Mexico to a Mexican mother and an American father who were not married. His mother remained in Mexico, and Ruben was raised by his father in San Diego. His father could not pass on his citizenship because he was 16 at Ruben’s birth so could not have lived for five years in the United States after he turned 14.The Ninth Circuit denied Ruben’s bid for citizenship, saying that it is constitutional to make it harder for an unmarried father to pass along citizenship because a father’s relationship to the child “is not so easily established” and a mother’s is “verifiable from the birth itself.”Congress has already jettisoned such outmoded principles when it comes to married couples. From 1790 to 1934, married American fathers — as “heads” of their family — could pass along citizenship to their foreign-born children, not mothers. A law ended that discrimination.For the last 30 years, the Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down laws treating men and women differently. The court’s decision in this case was by a 4-to-4 vote, with Justice Elena Kagan recused. The one-sentence ruling does not say how the justices divided, but it is likely that if Justice Kagan had taken part, the court would have outlawed this form of discrimination. That would have been the right choice. The days when fathers were assumed to be minor players in parenting are long over.'"

The law requires anyone who performs the job of an agent in Tennessee to register with the Department of State, which already regulates the agents who represent professional athletes.'"
"'11-06-19,'0','He died in 1989, two years before the dissolution of the Soviet Union and before many of today’s college-age Russians were born.A survey conducted last year by the Levada Center, a respected polling agency in Moscow, found that 44 percent of Russians ages 18 to 24 knew nothing about Sakharov. Of those who did, only 9 percent knew that he was a champion of human rights and a dissident.Sakharov and his ideas have fallen so far from the public consciousness that a group of Russian college students has begun a campaign to introduce him to their peers. They believe Sakharov can serve as a moral compass in Russia, like a Martin Luther King Jr. or Nelson Mandela.“Sakharov is an example of Russian democracy,” said Anna Solodovnikova, 19, a journalism major at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and one of the coordinators of the campaign, called the Sakharov Movement. “Though more than 22 years have passed, what he promoted is relevant today.”In many ways, their task should be easier now than it would have been in Sakharov’s day, when meetings had to be held secretly and publications had to be distributed by hand.They are using social networks like Facebook and Twitter to disseminate Sakharov’s ideas and writings. The movement was founded in March, and it already has a small online following. (As of last week, 439 people “liked” the movement’s Facebook page, and hundreds more had joined through other social networks.)They have hung posters in subway cars and universities with the slogan, “I’m not Sakharov, but ...” to suggest that Russians can play a role in society, even in small ways.And they have published interviews with well-known writers, artists and activists about how Sakharov has inspired them.Yet, small as it is, the Sakharov Movement has encountered opposition.Internet users have accused it of being a front for Western interests. Its posters have been defaced and torn down.But the movement’s biggest challenge may be overcoming apathy and cynicism.“People do not believe that a person can care about his nation without having some ulterior motives,” said Darya Peshchikova, 18, another coordinator of the movement.Today’s college students grew up in a very different Russia from the one Sakharov opposed. Though they had many more freedoms, by the mid-1990s the allure of democratic reforms had faded; their major concerns were disorder and economic hardship.Vladimir V. Putin, the former president and the current prime minister, came to power in 1999, promising security and stability, while putting a brake on democratic reforms. Under his leadership, the Kremlin largely co-opted youth activism in Russia, mobilizing thousands of young people in defense of the government.Last month, some 50,000 members of a Kremlin-backed youth group called Nashi gathered for a rally against corruption in downtown Moscow. Analysts say government officials are a major source of corruption, but Nashi tends to focus its protests on government opponents.Members of the Sakharov Movement used the occasion to make a point, circulating among the crowd and asking people on camera what they knew about Sakharov.“He manufactured sugar,” one young woman said at the rally, which, coincidentally, took place on a street named after Sakharov. (The root of Sakharov’s name is “sugar” in Russian.)The videos were later posted on the movement’s Web site, angering leaders of Nashi, who criticized the group’s tactics and defended their support of Mr. Putin, a man they say is Russia’s true guiding light.“Ultimately, knowing or not knowing who Sakharov is does not define a person as good or bad,” Kristina Potupchik, the group’s spokeswoman, wrote in a statement.For now, the Sakharov Movement is hoping to turn Sakharov’s old office in Moscow into a museum, and it is raising money in the effort to generate grass-roots interest in him. It is focusing on obtaining small donations from Russians, rather than larger ones from corporate or foreign sponsors.“We don’t need a cult of Sakharov,” said Grigory Shvedov, a journalist who is part of the movement. “Average Russians need to take this model of Sakharov’s life and use it as a basis for their own actions.”Mr. Shvedov said Russians did not need to give up their lives to become dissidents. Simple actions like refusing to pay a bribe or speaking up about an unjust policy could go a long way.Many young people, however, follow different ideals.Asked about his heroes, Suren Khachtryan, 18, another student at the Russian Law Academy, responded without hesitation: “Roman Abramovich and Mikhail Prokhorov,” two of Russia’s billionaire businessmen.“They are successful, shrewd and intelligent,” he said.'"
"'11-06-19,'0','The injuries to first responders have so far been minor. But in some cases where police officers have opened car doors or broken car windows without protective equipment, the gas “is knocking them right to the ground,” Chief Oreshan said. To avoid exposure, rescuers cannot reach the victim until the hazard is cleared, a process that can take hours.And that, said Michael Cerone, the police chief in Irvington, N.Y., is “heart wrenching.”“You want to help,” he said. “You want to get in there.”On March 28, Chief Cerone went to investigate a report of a person slumped inside a Jeep Liberty parked on a deserted dirt road. A sign on the window warned against breaking the glass and urged rescuers to call a hazardous materials team, he said. The bomb squad was summoned, and a robot was sent to breach the car’s rear window. Houses in the neighborhood were evacuated.At that moment, a few miles away, Dr. Stephen Kelly, a family practice physician, was at the police station in Irvington waiting to file a missing person report on his 24-year-old son, John. As he stood there, a dispatcher on the police radio described the car and the body found inside and Dr. Kelly knew immediately what had happened.He and his wife, Janet, a nurse, had spent hours that afternoon in an increasingly frantic search for their son, who had suffered since childhood from a severe form of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression and had been hospitalized in December after a suicide attempt. Dr. Kelly had quit his practice to stay home and try to help John overcome his depression.Despite John’s illness, he had graduated from college with a degree in psychology and was working at a nearby psychiatric hospital.“He didn’t let people know,” his mother said. “He was always counseling others.”Other suicides have followed a similar pattern. On May 23, a 23-year-old woman died in her car in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, after mixing up the recipe and placing signs on the window saying “Danger! Chemicals Inside! Call 911.”She had made a suicide pact with a man who changed his mind at the last minute and left the car, the police said. In a suicide in Baldwin, Mich., on Jan. 8, emergency workers were taken to the hospital after a firefighter moved a canister in the car of a suicide victim, causing the gas to be re-released. And in Massachusetts, an elderly woman was sickened when the toxic fumes leaked through her ceiling from an upstairs apartment.“Suicide is generally intended for one victim,” said Richard Perrin, under sheriff of the Lake County Sheriff’s Department, who was at the scene of the suicide in Michigan. “Whereas this form of suicide has the potential to affect many, whether it be intended or unintended, and that’s what makes it so dangerous.”Under Sheriff Perrin is one of about 50 police and fire officials who are part of a nationwide working group organized by Chief Oreshan to educate first responders about the suicides.In Japan, Web sites advertised the chemical suicide method as a way to “die easily and beautifully,” according to one 2008 news report. After the number of people affected by detergent suicides reached alarming proportions — in the central city of Konan, a 14-year-old girl’s suicide sickened 90 of her neighbors in 2008; in Otaru, 350 people were evacuated after a 24-year-old man’s suicide — government officials tried to persuade Internet sites to remove the recipes.But the proliferation of the sites has proved difficult to control, and instructions remain readily available, in some cases provided by visitors to suicide forums in answer to pleas from desperate people.“In my last post I told my story,” one forum participant with the user name “Death” wrote under the headline “researching reliable ways to go.” “I am now here to ask if anyone can put a link to the Japanese detergent suicide recipe.”Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless gas that smells strongly of rotten eggs and is produced naturally by the decomposition of organic matter. Deaths from it most commonly occur from accidental exposures in mineshafts or sewers. The gas dissipates quickly, but if inhaled at high concentrations it can cause convulsions, coma and a rapid death.“You definitely don’t take any chances, because literally one breath will kill you,” said Dr. Kurt Kleinschmidt, chief of medical toxicology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, who has been following the suicides.Dr. Kleinschmidt said the lethality of the method left no room for ambivalence or second thoughts.John Kelly, the young man who died in Irvington, seemed determined not to be deterred. In the months before his suicide, he had told his parents that he felt increasingly trapped by his obsessions. His world was shrinking, he said.In a journal entry written a few days before he died, he wrote about his struggles with his disorder: “Need to up the ante, apply the skills. Putting in the work. Gotta put in the effort. There’s no shortcut.”He noted that he should “look into yoga” and reminded himself that if he felt suicidal he should “take a Klonipin, go to the gym, call a suicide hot line.”The morning of March 28, Dr. Kelly said, he and his wife talked to John about plans for him to go to McLean Hospital in Boston for further treatment.“Does that give you hope?” his father asked him. He said it did.'"

The terrific shrimp and grits, which thrilled the Southerner at our table, included scampi-style rock shrimp, mascarpone, lemon, grits, morel mushrooms and marinated heirloom tomatoes. Another regional hit, this one from Maine, was the classic lobster roll: a toasted, open-face brioche bun piled high with big chunks of lobster in Old Bay mayonnaise, accompanied by cole slaw and house-made potato chips.A special not to be missed is the crisp roast duck with wonderful accompaniments: braised homemade bacon, whipped potatoes, spicy ginger pickles and Founders Cherry Ale demi-glace. Another special, soft-shell crabs, got a mixed reception, though. We liked the crisp house-cut French fries, the slaw and one of the crabs, which sat atop guacamole. But the chipotle mayonnaise under the second crab made it too spicy to be enjoyable.An inventive hit from the menu was the chili-root beer glazed pork chops. The two tender, tasty chops were paired with a harvest-style potato salad, which included corn, greens, wild rice, snippets of sun-dried apricots and a warm bacon vinaigrette. The strip steak on the menu, on the other hand, was ordinary.Desserts are a combination of sweets from noteworthy outside sources and house-made treats. Among the former were a big creamy hunk of Junior’s cheesecake topped with berry sauce and fresh strawberries, and a flaky, warm apple crumb pie from a local bakery, accompanied by slices of white cheddar cheese and molasses whipped cream. Even better was the house-made vanilla-orange bread pudding resting in a pool of caramel sauce with vanilla gelato on the side.Left Coast Kitchen offers exciting food in casual, familiar surroundings.

"'11-06-19,'0','“Don Ernesto,” as he was known to the Spanish, spent enough time in Madrid — he was there for chunks of the late 1920s, late 1930s, and parts of the 1950s, with his last visit in 1960 — that he left a distinct, mostly booze-stained trail. With the exception of the revamped Matadero, the modern version of Hemingway’s Madrid is an old-school itinerary of bars, bullfighting arenas and restaurants. So in advance of the 50th anniversary of his death, I set out to experience all that drew Hemingway back again and again to the city.After starting my tour at the Matadero, I met up with my wife, Jessie Sholl, in front of our hotel, the Tryp Gran Vía, one of the spots where Hemingway stayed (the second-floor breakfast room, named for the writer, displays photos of him in various acts of masculinity like firing a gun or pulling in a huge fish from a boat).From there we headed down the Gran Vía, a wide boulevard Hemingway described as Madrid’s answer to Broadway and Fifth Avenue combined, passing by Museo Chicote, a cocktail bar he frequented in the 1930s, when it was popular with international journalists. We then zigzagged through the streets around Puerta del Sol, many recently made pedestrians-only, crossing narrow Calle Victoria, where Hemingway often purchased scalped bullfighting tickets. We walked through leafy Plaza Santa Ana, home to Cerveceria Alemana, a 1904 beer hall that was such a favorite of Hemingway’s that he had his own table (just to the right of the entrance, the only marble-topped table overlooking a window).A couple of twists and turns later, we reached Calle de Echegaray, its cobblestones shining from a morning rain, and entered La Venencia, an old bar where men in flat caps and tweed jackets sipped sherry from tall, narrow glasses and barkeeps wrote their tabs in chalk on the bar.We sat down at a table toward the back of the room with Stephen Drake-Jones, who has lived in Madrid for 35 years. “Welcome to the civil war,” said Mr. Drake-Jones, a 61-year-old former University of Madrid history professor, referring to the three-year period, 1936 to 1939, that pitted left-leaning Republicans against the Fascists. Mr. Drake-Jones runs a tour company called the Wellington Society of Madrid. A native of Leeds, England, Mr. Drake-Jones gives a popular Hemingway-themed tour and has an encyclopedic knowledge of the writer’s time in Madrid.As he pushed glasses of crisp manzanilla sherry toward us, Mr. Drake-Jones explained that La Venencia was — and, in some ways, still is — a haunt for Republican sympathizers. “During the civil war,” he said, “this bar was frequented by Republican soldiers. Hemingway would come here a lot to get news from the front” — in the late 1930s, he was reporting on the war for the North American Newspaper Alliance — which would later inform “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” his novel about the war.“This place hasn’t changed in 70 years,” he added. “It’s like walking right into Hemingway.”He pointed to an old sign on the wall and translated: “In the interest of hygiene, don’t spit on the floor.” This was, he said, only the first rule of La Venencia. The second rule — no taking of photos — prevented Republican visitors from being incriminated by possible Fascist spies during the war. The third rule: absolutely no tipping. “The Republican loyalists considered themselves all workers — they were all the same — so there was no point in tipping,” Mr. Drake-Jones said.Just then his eyes squinted and narrowed in on Jessie, who was taking a sip of sherry. “Stop!” he cried. There was a fourth rule he hadn’t gotten to yet. “If this were during the civil war, you’d be arrested right now,” he said, his eyes surveying the room to see if anyone was watching. Jessie put her glass down. “You just gave yourself away as someone who wouldn’t have belonged here. But if you would have held your glass like this” — he picked up his glass by the stem — “the regulars wouldn’t take alarm. Otherwise, they would have thought you were a foreign spy.”Schooled in correct sipping technique and fortified by the sherry, I bid adios to Mr. Drake-Jones (and Jessie, who went to nap back at the hotel) and headed to Las Ventas arena, one of the most prestigious bullfighting rings in the world, where I joined a guided group tour. The tours, given daily from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., in both English and Spanish, take guests into the seats (Hemingway liked sitting in Section 9, Mr. Drake-Jones had told me earlier) and onto the sand in the middle of the stadium, where brave matadors stare down 500-pound horned beasts in front of 24,000 fans. When the tour finished, I asked the guide, Sean Marcos, 24, if he was a bullfighting aficionado.“No, not really,” he said. “The people of my generation don’t like bullfighting. It’s mostly for older people.”When I asked if he thought that didn’t bode well for the future of bullfighting in Spain, he shrugged and said: “Who knows? Maybe when we’re older we’ll become interested.”Don Ernesto would most likely have been crushed that successive generations were losing interest in his beloved bullfighting. But he’d be happy to know that interest in his other Madrid love is far from waning: He was also a regular patron of the Prado, home to one of the world’s great art collections.The analogy he drew to viewing art at the museum was pure Hemingway: “The tourist should be introduced to an attractive woman quite unclothed with no draperies, no concealments and no conversation and only the plainest of beds.”The Prado was one of the main reasons he sometimes chose to stay at the Palace Hotel (now the Westin Palace Hotel), across the street from the museum. Hemingway would often begin his evenings with a martini or two at the stuffy bar inside the hotel, which also appears toward the end of his 1926 novel, “The Sun Also Rises.”Like Jake and Brett, the novel’s protagonists, my wife and I cozied up to the bar and ordered our own round of martinis (each at 17.20 euros, about $24 at $1.43 to the euro, it wasn’t easy pretending we were in the 1920s). When asked for a dining suggestion, the bartender pointed up toward Plaza Santa Ana and said the streets were crammed with restaurants. I had a different spot in mind, though: El Sobrino de Botín, Jake and Brett’s next stop in the final scenes of the novel.Botín, open since 1725 on a tiny street behind Plaza Mayor, claims to be the oldest restaurant in the world. Jake and Brett turned up here — like Hemingway himself often did — to dine on the house specialty, roasted suckling pig, and drink several bottles of Rioja Alta. Botín isn’t above playing up the association: the front window displays an image of the writer and a quote from “The Sun Also Rises” that mentions the restaurant. (Until recently, the owners of a nearby restaurant, presumably trying to differentiate themselves from Botín, hung a large sign above its door reading: “HEMINGWAY NEVER ATE HERE.”)Jessie and I asked for a table upstairs, the place where Hemingway put Jake and Brett and where he preferred sitting as well. And like our fictional counterparts, we dined on juicy roast suckling pig, though we stopped at just one bottle of Rioja. Afterward, I introduced myself to Antonio and Carlos Gonzáles, the third generation of their family (along with José) to run Botín. The brothers hadn’t been born when Hemingway was a regular guest at their restaurant, but they’ve heard plenty of stories.“Don Ernesto once wanted to make paella,” Carlos said. “And so our grandfather allowed him to go into the kitchen to make it.”Was it any good?“Apparently not,” he said, laughing. “It was the last time they let him cook anything.”Mr. Gonzáles’s grandfather, however, did give Hemingway the privilege of making his own martinis. “He would get here early in the day and write upstairs until his friends showed up for lunch,” Antonio said.We bade the brothers Gonzáles farewell and, like Jake and Brett in the last scene of “The Sun Also Rises” — and most certainly the man whose trail I’d been following the last four days — we hailed a cab and drove into the warm Madrid night.IF YOU GOTryp Gran Via (Gran Via 25; 34-91-522-1121; www.solmelia.com; doubles from 100 euros) offers small but comfortable rooms right on the wide, bustling Gran Via.The Westin Palace (Plaza de las Cortes 7; 34-91-360-8000, www.westinpalacemadrid.com; doubles from 275 euros) offers opulent rooms across the street from the Prado Museum.The Wellington Society of Madrid (34-609-14-3203; www.wellsoc.org) offers historical tours, including a tour of the Hemingway-related sights.Plaza de Toros Monumental de las Ventas (Calle Alcalá 237; 34-91-356-2200; www.las-ventas.com; daily tours 7 euros), Madrid’s main bullfighting ring offers daily tours between 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.'"
"'11-06-19,'0','A tiger lies on the parquet floor of a deserted room, telling lies to a newly awakened stone statue: Long ago, the tiger says, he had a family, but he was shot and stuffed with straw, and glass baubles were sewn where his eyes had been. Later, however, he says he was made in a factory out of artificial fibers. Which story is true?The statue, a girl named Faith who is holding a book, can’t say. She doesn’t know who she is or where she’s from, whether she’s always been made of stone or whether she’s under a spell. All she knows is that she is awake, and she listens to the carpet’s tales.The tiger carpet’s stories contradict each other, but, the tiger says, “I prefer to think that they are all true at once.” Reading “The Lying Carpet,” is a dreamy experience — the language is lovely; the free verse has an offbeat rhythm; the illustrations are breathtaking — a strange blend of childlike cartoon, Moorish and Indian art, spot illustration and illuminated manuscript. But I fear kids will find “The Lying Carpet” maddening. For most middle-grade readers, truth is still just one thing.Still, as Faith makes a leap into reality and into a belief in the transformative power of storytelling, older readers may think of Kierkegaard’s “Fear and Trembling” and “The Present Age” — the poetry, the paradoxes, the musings on leaps of faith, the need for passion and the awareness of self. I can see high school and college philosophy students finding endless discussion fodder in “The Lying Carpet”; it would be a great graduation gift for black-clad poetesses. It could be the new “Oh, the Places You’ll Go,” with less anapestic tetrameter and more death.Poetry and death also fill “The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland,” which similarly seems an ill fit for its publisher’s target audience. At first blush, it’s a kids’ book: September, a lonely 12-year-old girl in Omaha, meets the Green Wind, who whisks her off to Fairyland. She undertakes a quest to recover a witch’s spoon stolen by an evil marquess and picks up a band of oddball friends along the way: a wyvern (like a dragon, but not), a marid (a sea jinni from Arabic folklore), a lantern that communicates by burning letters into its own panels.Resonances of Alice and Dorothy and “The Phantom Tollbooth,” right? If only this book weren’t so exhausting. Catherynne M. Valente unrolls string after string of “ands” — “doubloons and necklaces and crowns, pieces of eight and plates and bricks and long, glittering scepters”; “chanterelles and portobellos and oysters and wild crimson forest mushrooms”; “cobalt and ochre and silver and rose”; “gunk and crusty things and dirt and fear and knowing how bad things can get and what pain feels like.” Adjectives and adverbs tumble down the page relentlessly and merrily in a glimmering, glistening cascade of too-muchness. Some people may love it; my people call it ungapatchka.'"
"'11-06-19,'0','Clarence Ditlow, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, based in Washington, says that rear-impact crash tests of 1995, 1996 and 1999 Grand Cherokees showed, in each case, significant leaks of gasoline, posing a danger not only to the Jeeps’ passengers but those of the striking vehicle.In two of the tests, commissioned by the safety group, a Ford Taurus hit the Jeep’s rear at about 50 m.p.h. In the third, the Taurus struck at about 40 m.p.h. By comparison, the center said, the fuel system of a 1995 Ford Explorer struck by a Taurus at 70 m.p.h. remained intact.“The 1995 Ford Explorer showed vastly better fuel system integrity than its contemporary peer 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee,” the center said last month in a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The tests were conducted by Karco Engineering of Adelanto, Calif., which also does testing for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and for the Federal Outdoor Impact Laboratory, based in McLean, Va.The federal safety agency began a preliminary investigation of the 1993-2004 Grand Cherokees last August, granting a request made by the center almost a year earlier. In its request, the Center for Auto Safety said it found that “172 fatal fire crashes” resulting in 254 deaths had occurred in Grand Cherokees during 1992-2008.In at least one case the driver of the vehicle that struck a Jeep died in a fire. Jose Sierra died of burns in 1999 a day after his Toyota MR2 struck the rear of a Grand Cherokee on Long Island. Two sisters riding in the Grand Cherokee were seriously burned.Another victim of a Grand Cherokee fire was Cassidy Jarmon, a 4-year-old who was riding in her family’s 1993 Grand Cherokee in February 2006 in Cleburne, Tex. Her mother was stopped on a two-lane highway to make a left turn when the Jeep was hit from behind by a 2001 Chevrolet Lumina, according to the police report.Cassidy was in a child seat in the second row. She survived the impact of the crash, but a fire ensued.“We actually had witnesses,” said Detective Kelly Summey, who arrived at the crash while the rescue effort was under way and later conducted the investigation. “Almost every one of them said it was instantaneous.”She said the rescue was delayed because Cassidy and a younger sister were strapped in their car seats. “So, you are trying to get them unstrapped and cutting the car seats and you have fire all around you,” she said.The girls were pulled from the vehicle, but Cassidy, who suffered burns and smoke inhalation, died two days later, Ms. Summey said.The speed limit at the accident site is 60 m.p.h.; based on the skid marks, the Lumina’s estimated speed at the time of impact was 52 m.p.h.Ms. Summey said her investigation concluded that the gas tank had been punctured by the Jeep’s trailer hitch.Shortly after the accident, the Jarmon family sued Chrysler, asserting that the placement of the gas tank was dangerous. The family could not be reached for comment.In an e-mail, Mr. Palese, the Chrysler spokesman, wrote that the Lumina hit the Grand Cherokee at a speed that was “substantially higher than federal requirements, which the Grand Cherokee met. And a thorough analysis of rear impact crash data indicates that the Grand Cherokee is no more likely to experience fire as a result of a rear impact than peer vehicles.”In granting the Center for Auto Safety’s 2009 petition to investigate, N.H.T.S.A. said a “preliminary review” of S.U.V.’s from other automakers did not indicate the Grand Cherokees “to be over-represented for post-crash fires.”However, the center disagrees and contends that the Grand Cherokees have two serious problems.The first is a gas tank located behind the rear axle and somewhat below the bumper, in an area that safety engineers call a crush zone.Carl Nash, a former N.H.T.S.A. official who worked as a pro bono consultant for the center, said that having the gas tank in that position makes it very vulnerable. “If anything goes under that bumper it could easily puncture the tank,” he said.Some major competitors at the time — including the Ford Explorer and Toyota 4Runner — had their gas tanks in front of the rear axle, spokesmen for the companies said. The Nissan Pathfinder’s tank was behind the rear axle.The center says the second problem is a fuel filler pipe positioned so that it can rip away in a rear impact, allowing gasoline to escape from the tank.It was unusual that a vehicle designed at that time “seems to have no kind of detailed attention to this kind of foreseeable strain,” said Mark Arndt, an independent safety consultant and the president of Transportation Safety Technologies in Mesa, Ariz.In documents filed with N.H.T.S.A., Chrysler said that the Grand Cherokees were designed with “sound engineering judgment and due care” and were “neither defective, nor do they pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety in rear-impact collisions.”Chrysler has also provided the safety agency with hundreds of pages of material that it says support its claim that a recall is not warranted. That material includes tests showing that Grand Cherokees exceeded the federal standard for not leaking fuel in a rear impact.Even when an automaker meets a minimum safety standard, it can still be required to recall a vehicle, said Allan Kam, who retired from N.H.T.S.A. as its senior enforcement lawyer and is now the director of Highway Traffic Safety Associates in Bethesda, Md. Automakers have a legal responsibility to make vehicles safe, he said.The federal safety standard in effect when the Grand Cherokee was introduced said a vehicle could leak only a tiny amount of gasoline after a 30 m.p.h. rear impact by a large barrier. But critics say the speed was too low and the test distributed the force over the entire rear of a vehicle — not a good representation of real-world collisions.“It was just too easy to pass,” Mr. Arndt said.The safety agency had a similar concern and took action. By September 2006 vehicles had to pass a 50 m.p.h. rear impact from a barrier that did not spread the impact forces evenly.In justifying the new standard, the agency noted that “fuel system integrity in a crash is critical” because while vehicle fires are relatively rare “they tend to be severe in terms of the number of casualties caused.”Mr. Arndt said that although 50 m.p.h. rear-impact crashes are not common they tend to be “very survivable impacts” so it is important that the survivors not suffer secondary injuries or death from a preventable fire.One factor that seemed to make a difference in the crash tests was an optional off-road package that included a skid plate, a thick metal shield positioned to protect the gas tank from rock damage in off-road excursions. In tests commissioned by the center, the Grand Cherokees had that package and the gas tank was not punctured.But Mr. Ditlow said there was still a serious problem because the fuel filler hoses ripped loose either from the gas tank or from the fender, where the gas cap is located.In the test where the hose pulled free from the gas tank, photos show that pressure on the tank caused a spray of a gasoline substitute, used for the tests, to be forced out.“That allowed the plume of Stoddard Fluid (a gasoline surrogate) to disperse from the tank into the air and form an ideal mixture for combustion,” Mr. Ditlow reported to N.H.T.S.A.In the other case, the filler hose pulled out of the fender, but there was no leakage while the Jeep remained upright. However, when the Jeep was turned on its side to simulate a rollover after an impact, the gas tank emptied, Mr. Nash, the former N.H.T.S.A. official, said.“All the fuel just poured out without any restriction,” he said.The third test involved a 1996 Grand Cherokee without the optional skid plate protecting the gas tank. That impact was at 40 m.p.h. and the gas tank was punctured in two places, allowing fuel to leak, Mr. Ditlow said. However, the filler hose remained intact.Mr. Arndt said the problem with the Grand Cherokees could be mitigated if the gas tanks were protected by skid plates and the vehicles were equipped with a valve or other device to prevent gasoline from leaking should the filler pipe be ripped free.If Mr. Ditlow’s plea to have the Jeeps recalled under federal regulations is successful, Chrysler would not have to pay for repairs on all the vehicles.Once a vehicle is 10 years old an automaker may not be required to pay, although it does have to notify the owner, said Mr. Kam, the former N.H.T.S.A. official. And despite Chrysler’s 2009 bankruptcy and change of ownership, owners of the earlier Grand Cherokees are still able to file product liability suits.Karen Aldana, an agency spokeswoman, said that it was aware of the results of the center’s tests. She declined to comment other than to note that the agency’s investigation continues.'"

"'11-06-20,'1','Arriving as he has, fulfilling years of anticipation about his potential, McIlroy has brought with him a freshening wind of promise.Tom Callahan, a Golf Digest columnist and the author of “His Father’s Son,” a book about Woods’s father, Earl, has been to many Opens. He said Sunday at Congressional that this was the first one in years that had thrilled him. McIlroy is the reason.“He’s the one who’s been on the horizon, the guy everybody has been hoping would come along,” Callahan said. “I’m ready for a sports hero who doesn’t treat the world like his spittoon.”With the excitement comes curiosity about McIlroy, who was raised in the blue-collar town of Holywood near . His mother, Rosie, is a former factory worker who does not hesitate to let her son know when she thinks he may be getting a little too full of himself. His father, Gerry, grew up near Holywood Golf Club and tended bar there, teaching his son the basics of the game beginning at age 4 — when Rory first smashed a long drive of 40 yards. By 7, he was a member of the club, and by 15,  he had qualified for his first professional event.McIlroy calls his parents back home every day he is on the road. He accepts compliments with grace and humbly deflects comparisons with Woods.When of said McIlroy would be the first one to break ’s record of 18 major championships — a record Woods, with 14, has coveted — McIlroy put his head down sheepishly.“Paddy, Paddy, Paddy, I’m trying to win my first,” he said.He proved with his eight-stroke victory that his golf game is complete. His long, accurate drives found mostly fairways. With a pinpoint iron game, he hit 86 percent of the greens, the most since the United States Golf Association began keeping records. He shored up what used to be a suspect short game.“The thing about these major championships is the history and the prestige,” McIlroy said. “Just being able to add your name to a list like Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, and — that is the most satisfying thing about it.”To some, McIlroy has shades of Hogan and Byron Nelson already. After McIlroy closed out the tournament, which he had led since Thursday’s first round, the golf author Dan Jenkins posted on , “Rory has the repeating swing of Hogan and Nelson, and the likability of Arnold.”McIlroy’s breakthrough has been a year in the making. He gained his first PGA Tour victory last year, shooting a final-round 62 to win at Quail Hollow. He tied for third at last year’s British Open and at the P.G.A. Championship, and he was the leader entering the final round of the Masters in April before a disastrous round of 80 left him back in the pack.His recent success and near-misses seem to have increased his following.“The support I got out there today was absolutely incredible, for a foreigner to come over and play in front of these U.S. crowds,” McIlroy said. “I think every cloud has a silver lining, and I think what happened at Augusta was a great thing for me in terms of support.”McIlroy realizes that comparisons with Woods will only increase. But he avoids them when he can, knowing that Woods won 24 tournaments before he turned 25. McIlroy has won three at age 22.“Nothing this kid does ever surprises me,” said Graeme McDowell, also of Northern Ireland and last year’s United States Open champion.“He’s the best player I’ve ever seen. He’s great for golf. He’s a breath of fresh air for the game, and perhaps we’re ready for golf’s next superstar, and maybe Rory is it.”Golf is ripe for a new young superstar. Woods’s main rival, , just turned 41. And since Mickelson won the 2010 Masters, the next four major championships have been won by golfers little known in the United States — McDowell, of , Martin Kaymer of and Charl Schwartzel of South Africa.Since a protracted winless streak dropped Woods from the top world ranking, three Europeans — Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Kaymer — have ascended to No. 1.The upside to Woods’s absence is that it has opened up the competition and provided opportunities for other golfers to make their reputations. The downside is that it has hurt television ratings and attendance at tournaments.Enter McIlroy, a golfer loved by the camera. Nicklaus, who also won his first major championship when he was 22, a few months older than McIlroy, says McIlroy is special.“I love his moxie, the sort of way he walks, sort of cocksure about himself,” Nicklaus said. “I kind of like that in a guy. You’ve got to have confidence in what you’re doing. I think this kid’s going to have a great career. He’s got all the components; he’s got lots of people rooting for him.”'"

"'11-06-20,'1','Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, blocked a vote on President Obama’s nominee to lead the Fish and Wildlife Service until the government granted 15 permits for deepwater drilling. Those conditions were satisfied last month. A separate demand by Senator Mike Lee of Utah that the Interior Department release certain documents was met last week. Now the nomination is being blocked by Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, who wants a review of the protected status of wolves.“The one leverage tool that the minority party in the Senate has right now is confirmations,” said Joseph Engelhard of Capital Alpha Partners, a research firm that analyzes Washington for corporate clients.“This isn’t about any particular appointee — Ben Franklin could come back to life and they would oppose him,” said Mr. Engelhard, a former Republican aide on the House Financial Services Committee. “There’s just very strong concerns on their side that the process, that traditional way that the Senate likes to come to bipartisan compromise, isn’t working.”Democratic lawmakers, regulators and even some industry groups say they are increasingly concerned that the vacancies are impeding efforts to improve regulation and spur growth.“It’s important for agencies to have leadership that has been appointed and confirmed by elected officials,” said Joseph A. Smith Jr., whose nomination to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency was blocked by Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. “It confers legal authority and it confers moral authority. People are more likely to listen to you.”“It doesn’t matter that it’s not me,” Mr. Smith said. “What’s important is that they confirm someone.”Almost a year has passed since Mr. Shelby and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, a Democrat who led the banking committee until he retired last year, sent a letter to the White House urging Mr. Obama to appoint a leader “as soon as possible” for the housing agency, which supervises the mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.“We also urge you to make timely appointments to fill the positions at other federal financial regulators.” the letter said. “A full contingent of federal financial regulators is crucial to maintaining adequate federal prudential regulation and consumer protections.”Mr. Obama’s nomination in November of Mr. Smith, the commissioner of banking in North Carolina, was cheered by banking and consumer groups. His confirmation began with warm praise from both North Carolina senators, one a Democrat and one a Republican.Five days later, Mr. Shelby issued a statement describing Mr. Smith as ill suited for the job, saying he lacked experience and had not demonstrated independence from the administration.“We need a watchdog, not a lapdog,” Mr. Shelby said.Professor Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was one of three people nominated to the Fed by Mr. Obama in April 2010. The others, Sarah Bloom Raskin and Janet L. Yellen, were confirmed in September, but Mr. Shelby demanded a new hearing on Professor Diamond, citing a range of concerns about his background and ideas.Two weeks later, Professor Diamond was awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on labor markets, a central focus of Fed research and policy. He said he had asked the prize committee for the value of gold in the medal to include it in his taxable income, particularly because he knew his tax return could be scrutinized.Mr. Shelby opened the second hearing in March with a ringing condemnation of Professor Diamond’s nomination, arguing that he lacked relevant experience and that he favored efforts by the Fed to stimulate the economy that were opposed by Mr. Shelby and other Republicans.“Many of us believe that this is not the economic philosophy the Fed should be embracing at this point in our economic history,” Mr. Shelby said. “I encourage the president to withdraw this nomination.”Professor Diamond, who withdrew from consideration this month, was philosophical in an interview last week, noting that the first piece of advice he received after accepting the nomination was not to sign a lease in Washington until the Senate gave its approval.He said that he understood senators would vote against nominees whose views differed from their own, but added that he believed they should not prevent votes unless the nominee fell outside the mainstream.“A conservative president gets conservative jurists, but not too conservative,” he said. “And it seems to me there should be a similar framing for the Fed. If instead the issue is putting too much pressure on how monetary policy is done, then we run the risk of having lower-quality monetary policy.”Democrats are most infuriated by Republican opposition to any nominee to lead the new consumer bureau — and indeed, to the existence of the position itself. “A wall of opposition to any nominee is different than what has happened in the past,” said Representative Brad Miller, Democrat of North Carolina.Republicans counter that they see no practical difference in issuing a blanket objection, rather than waiting for the president to name someone, because the issues are the same in either case.“The only thing that’s unusual is that we’re doing it publicly,” said an aide to Mr. Shelby, speaking on condition of anonymity. He noted that senators often blocked nominations without any public acknowledgment or explanation.“At least we’re having a fair and open policy discussion,” he said.'"
"'11-06-20,'1','Airbnb, which helps people rent rooms in their homes, is raising venture capital that would value it at a billion dollars. Scoopon, a kind of Groupon for Australians, raised $80 million; Juice in the City, a Groupon for mothers, raised $6 million; and Scvngr, which started a Groupon for gamers, raised $15 million. These could, of course, turn out to be successful businesses. The worry, investors say, is the prices.They say they have paid two to three times more for their stakes in such start-ups over the past year. According to the National Venture Capital Association, venture capitalists invested $5.9 billion in the first three months of the year, up 14 percent from the period a year earlier, but they invested in 51 fewer companies, indicating they were funneling more money into fewer start-ups.“The big success stories — Facebook, Zynga and Twitter — are leading to investing in ideas on a napkin, because no one wants to miss out on the next big thing,” said Eric Lefkofsky, a founder of Groupon who also runs Lightbank, a Chicago-based venture fund with a $100 million coffer.A decade ago, in the first surge of Internet investing, it was not unusual for tech start-ups to raise tens of millions of dollars before they had revenue, a product or users. But venture capitalists became more cautious after the bubble burst and the 2008 recession paralyzed Silicon Valley.Meanwhile, it now costs less than ever to build a Web site or mobile app. So this time around the general philosophy has been to start small.“By starting out lean, you have the chance to know if you’re on to something,” said Mark Suster, a managing director at GRP Partners. “If you start fat and the product concept doesn’t work, inherently the company will lose a lot of money.”Two of Color’s photo-sharing competitors, Instagram and PicPlz, exemplify the lean start-up ethos. They started with $500,000 and $350,000, respectively, and teams of just a few people. As they have introduced successful products and attracted users, they have slowly raised more money and hired engineers.Color, meanwhile, spent $350,000 to buy the Web address color.com, and an additional $75,000 to buy colour.com. It rents a cavernous office in downtown Palo Alto, where 38 employees work in a space with room for 160, amid beanbag chairs, tents for napping and a hand-built half-pipe skateboard ramp.Bill Nguyen, Color’s always-smiling founder, has hired a team of expensive engineers, like D. J. Patil, a former chief scientist at LinkedIn.“If I knew a better way of doing it, I would, but that’s what my cost structure is,” Mr. Nguyen said in an interview last week.Michael Krupka, a managing director at Bain Capital Ventures and one of Color’s investors, said Color needed to raise a lot of money because it planned to do much more than photo-sharing.“When we get to the end product that we envision, people will realize how technically sophisticated it is, so we couldn’t do it with four people,” he said. “That’s expensive to do, so therefore I think the valuation’s a fair one.”A serial entrepreneur, Mr. Nguyen, 40, said he had always raised more money than he needed so that if his products faltered, he had enough to keep going longer than his competitors. But it also means he has to sell the company to a bigger company or to shareholders for a lot more money than if he had raised less.He said the gamble was worth it, and it had paid off for him twice. He started a service for receiving faxes, e-mail and voicemail called Onebox.com, which Phone.com bought for $850 million, and Lala, a digital music service that Apple bought for $80 million last year. He also started a mobile messaging company called Seven, which has not yet sold.Mr. Nguyen bounds around the Color office in bare feet and talks with implicit exclamation points at the end of each phrase, fueled by what he calls an addiction to Coke Zero. Despite his sprightliness, he says he has been chastened in the last three months.“Your ego gets bruised a little bit,” he said. “There’s no doubt I wish we would have launched and millions of people would have used it, but that didn’t happen. The reality is we’re going to plug away at it and take a much more traditional route to go from A to B.”But he makes no apologies for the amount of money he raised.“We live in a very favorable environment for start-ups right now, so if the number we raised was significantly larger than it would be at any other time, I’m not going to apologize for that,” he said.At its start, Color said it would usher in a new era of location-based social networking, letting people share cellphone snapshots with other Color users nearby. But though it had some success at big events like music festivals, those who tried it elsewhere found that there was rarely anything to see.Mr. Nguyen said the company had taken the criticism to heart and charted a new course. He fired Color’s president, Peter Pham, and its engineers are building a new version of the app to be released later this summer.Mr. Nguyen outlined an ambitious plan to compete with Apple, Google and Facebook by tying together group messaging, recommendations and local search, all while making money through advertising. He plans to build applications that will use data from Facebook to create temporary social networks, say at a conference or sporting event, to help users meet people who grew up in the same town or like the same band.“It’s literally going to turn your Facebook network from 500 people to 750 million people,” Mr. Nguyen said.Photos might not even be a part of Color in the future, he said, though an engineer hired away from the computer-in-a-pen company Livescribe is working on ways for people to doodle on photos. Analysts are curious about whether Color can pull off a do-over — and whether it and other high-priced start-ups can beat the long odds that all fledgling companies face.“In every bust, there are ones that stand out and become Google, but that’s the exception rather than the rule,” Mr. Suster of GRP Partners said. “For every success there will be 250 really dumb valuations.”'"
"'11-06-20,'1','In “When Food Kills” (column, June 12), Nicholas D. Kristof highlighted the human health threat posed by the overuse of antibiotics on healthy livestock.For decades, scientists and doctors have warned that the practice of routinely adding low-dose antibiotics to animal feed creates vast quantities of drug-resistant bacteria. Now, with deadly antibiotic-resistant infections on the rise, we cannot let the practice continue any longer.That’s why the Natural Resources Defense Council and a coalition of consumer groups have filed a lawsuit to force the Food and Drug Administration to take action. It’s time for the F.D.A. to heed the advice of the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association and hundreds of other scientific bodies and ban the use of lifesaving human antibiotics on healthy livestock— as dozens of other countries have already done.These drugs have a purpose: to cure the sick and save lives. We need to do everything we can to keep them working.'"
"'11-06-20,'1','Re “On College Forms, a Question of Race, or Races, Can Perplex” (“Race Remixed” series, front page, June 14):It is very, very sad that so many universities make admission decisions based on an applicant’s skin color and what country his or her ancestors came from. Our nation’s latest census tells us that we are increasingly a multiracial, multiethnic society — and, as the article notes, more and more individuals are themselves likely to be multiracial and multiethnic. In such a society, it is untenable for our institutions to be sorting people and treating some better and others worse, depending on which silly little box is checked.As for the complaint that some students are “gaming” this system: The real problem is that the system itself is disgustingly discriminatory.Fifty years ago, Congress and federal regulators redefined how the nation would deal with blatant and latent racism. Two generations have passed. Today, more minority families have succeeded in careers once closed to them because of inequities in higher education. We are a better nation, but also a different nation, and therefore we need an improved approach to the remaining inequities.The solution is simple. Tailor affirmative action by making a family’s means the most important criterion. For example, why should the minority children of someone with the financial means of a Michael Jordan be given the same affirmative action weight as the average minority high school senior?Many people fear that tinkering with the laws surrounding affirmative action would render the still needed corrections ineffective. I believe that we as a nation have moved beyond such silliness.But if I am wrong and if legislators destroy a mandate that has improved this nation, we can turn to the courts yet again.'"
"'11-06-20,'1','But if troops begin to flow out faster, history may view his decision as the crucial turning point — for good or ill — in the longest war in American history.No matter what he decides, Mr. Obama will almost certainly argue he is hardly walking away from Afghanistan: even after the 30,000 troops who made up the “West Point surge” (named for where he gave the 2009 speech) are withdrawn, 68,000 Americans will remain. That is more than twice as many as were on the ground the day that President George W. Bush left office.Mr. Obama’s political advisers say that number will be repeated, over and over leading up to next year’s election, to make the case that the president has committed far greater resources to the war than the man who had ordered the initial invasion.But by returning to the initial objective of that invasion, getting Osama bin Laden and hobbling Al Qaeda, the terror group he built, Mr. Obama is taking several risks. He is betting that an American force that may remain in Afghanistan for years or decades, upward of 25,000 troops if the Afghan government agrees, will prevent the country from again becoming a terrorist enclave. And he is essentially downgrading the grander vision for transforming Afghanistan, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, among others, have described as the ultimate firewall against Islamic extremism.“The weak point in America’s strategy has always been this endless debate about whether we were just there to protect ourselves or had a grander vision for Afghanistan,” Mr. Obama’s special envoy to the country, Richard C. Holbrooke, said about two weeks before he died last year.By the end of this month it seems likely that debate will be just about over, with Mr. Obama taking it back to its starting point, which was crippling Al Qaeda.Mr. Obama never embraced Mr. Bush’s oft-expressed dream of creating a strong, central Afghan state in which democratic ideas and religious tolerance pervades the land. Unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama rarely talked about how, thanks to the American intervention, girls now go to school in Afghanistan. But he did agree to a vast increase in aid for Afghanistan, tied to a “diplomatic surge” that was never executed with the vigor of the military surge.The White House debate has also been colored by the reality that the Afghan government has not been able to clear the hurdle Mr. Obama set for it as part of his decision in 2009 to increase troop levels. At that time the White House declared that American troops should never “clear, build and hold” territory in Afghanistan that it could not soon “transfer” to Afghan control.For the last year, the Pentagon has been presenting numbers to show that transfer is taking place. But plot those on a map, and it becomes clear that with a few notable exceptions, the transfer has happened largely in areas not hotly contested with the Taliban. In their more candid moments, Mr. Obama’s aides acknowledge there is little evidence that the Afghan government will be ready to control the fought-over territory in the south by the end of 2014, the date set for the withdrawal of all NATO forces.“It’s been painfully slow,” one of Mr. Obama’s aides said recently, noting that the United States pays more to train the Afghan army and police than Afghanistan spends on its entire government budget. “But we’re learning to live with ‘good enough.’ ”As he prepares to make a decision this time, Mr. Obama is facing a set of political pressures that were more muted when he ordered the surge in 2009. In his West Point speech, he talked of containing the costs of the war; since then, spending has mushroomed to $2 billion a week, a price that seems even more crushing now, in an age of painful austerity, than it did then.Public rants by the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, describing the Americans as “trespassers and occupiers” in the country for their own purposes, have come at a particularly delicate time — just as Mr. Obama must make the case that the commitment of tens of thousands of troops should continue for years. That may explain why the American ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl W. Eikenberry, shot back at Mr. Karzai so directly on Sunday.“When we hear ourselves being called occupiers and worse, and our generous aid programs dismissed as totally ineffective and the source of all corruption, our pride is offended and we begin to lose our inspiration to carry on,” he said.The tension with Mr. Karzai is not new. But the latest eruptions are feeding into an atmosphere in which Mr. Obama appears to be looking for rationales to explain why a conflict he called a “war of necessity” two summers ago may no longer be as necessary.'"
"'11-06-20,'1','PARIS — Boeing will decide this year whether to revamp its popular 737 jet with more fuel-efficient engines or to develop a new single-aisle jet, an executive of the company said on Sunday.Pressure on Boeing to define its future strategy for the fast-selling 737 has been building since late last year, when its European rival, Airbus, announced that it would bring to market by mid-2016 an updated version of its A320 single-aisle jet, with new engines and a more aerodynamic wing. Boeing plans delivery of its new engine design or new jet around 2020.Airbus has since lined up more than 200 firm orders for the A320neo — the letters stand for new engine option — with potential orders from customers to buy as many as 200 more.Industry executives expect Airbus will have orders for well over 500 of the planes by the end of the Paris Air Show, which begins Monday.“That’s going to be no surprise to us,” James F. Albaugh, the chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said at a briefing with reporters on the eve of the show.'"
"'11-06-20,'1','When he reached the final hole, where he had a par, his four-day totals of 268 and 16 under par — both records — not only made him the winner of the United States Open by eight strokes, it made him do something he had mostly suppressed all day — he turned to the grandstand, pumped a fist and smiled.His victory summoned a host of historical reference points. McIlroy is the youngest champion in the event since Bobby Jones in 1923. He is younger than Jack Nicklaus was when Nicklaus won the first of his record 18 major titles and he is just 10 months older than Tiger Woods was when Woods won his first major in 1997.In total, McIlroy set multiple United States Open records, including lowest score for a 36-hole and 54-hole leader. It took him only 26 holes to reach double digits under par, the earliest ever. He hit 62 of 72 greens in regulation, which was the best percentage (86) since the tournament began keeping that statistic. It was only the seventh time the winner was atop the leader board at the end of every round.There were also successes that will be less noticed by record keepers but not soon forgotten by those who watched the event. He made eagle from the fairway, savaged the second-longest golf course in United States Open history with booming drives that could have run longer if the fairways had not been soaked with persistent rain, and took advantage of softened greens with menacingly accurate iron play. In 72 holes, he had three bogeys and one double bogey.“Over all, the week has been incredible,” McIlroy said, adding that he knew he was chasing history and Woods’s 11-year-old aggregate record score of 12 under. “I knew how good Tiger was in 2000 and I was trying to go out there and emulate him in some way. Right now, I couldn’t ask for anything more.”In the end, it was a victory won in McIlroy’s reaction to disappointment. It was a lesson in how achievement often begins with the acceptance of past mistakes and the realization that hardship can be sculptured into triumph.It was also a victory for those who believe in karma. McIlroy’s gracious and mature response to failure at the Masters earned him new fans, something evident as he walked his rounds at Congressional. Based on the surge of fans seeking autographs or just trying to be near him, he was easily the most popular golfer in the field. Now he is poised to make good on expectations that he could be golf’s next superstar, taking up a spot vacated by the faltering Woods.McIlroy is the second consecutive United States Open champion from Northern Ireland, following Graeme McDowell. He is also the fifth straight winner of a major championship from outside the United States, a stretch that started after Phil Mickelson’s victory at the 2010 Masters. Golfers in their 20s have also now won four successive majors, and McIlroy is the 11th player to win the last 11 major titles.The Australian Jason Day finished second at eight-under-par 276, and four golfers — Lee Westwood, Y. E. Yang, Robert Garrigus and Kevin Chappell — finished tied for third at six under.McIlroy’s mastery and march to redemption began with an immediate display of his peerless skill. He pounded his first tee shot down the fairway, knocked his approach close and made birdie.How’s that for a start when you come into the final round with an eight-shot lead?He made two routine pars, then birdied the fourth hole with another spectacular wedge to 4 feet. There were no nervous swings or timid putts, and McIlroy was playing at a peculiar, but probably intentional, pace. He was taking almost no time to hit his shots, swinging his club sometimes less than 10 seconds after his playing partner Yang had struck a shot. That was perhaps by design to keep any edginess from setting in over the ball.But between shots, he was walking very slowly. McIlroy trailed Yang onto every green by several seconds, and it was unlikely he did that to milk the applause. After his Masters debacle, McIlroy said one of his errors was letting his tempo become needlessly quick.By the time he reached the dramatic downhill 10th tee, which is framed against the terraces of the adjacent Congressional clubhouse, there was little doubt of the outcome, and the procession of fans following him on a muggy day increased by several thousand. When his tee shot backed up to within 6 inches, the fans rose from their seats on the terraces, and many began bowing.He made two bogeys, two birdies and five pars on the final nine, almost meaningless missteps and successes in a path to a championship and a final-round score of 69.Coming off the 18th green, he hugged his father, Gerry, and McDowell. Fans in a nearby grandstand were doing what they had done all day, standing to applaud McIlroy, and while he had politely acknowledged them before, he had always done so in a businesslike, muted way. No longer.As McIlroy said in a greenside interview: “There will be a lot of pints of Guinness going down back home. I know a few of my friends will be out partying and I can’t wait to join them.”In the interim, next to the 18th hole, McIlroy turned to a few thousand of his newest, closest friends, offered his best, unrestrained smile and raised his arms in salute.'"
"'11-06-20,'1','“Salam Fayyad is a criminal who should be put on trial,” Mahmoud Zahar, a top Hamas official, said in an interview at his home. “He has tortured our people in prison. He is not acceptable to anyone in Hamas.”The announcement of the meeting’s cancellation was made by Azzam al-Ahmed, chief Fatah negotiator in the reconciliation talks, who said another meeting would be scheduled soon.But other officials said the problem was unlikely to be resolved quickly. Some said that Washington had warned Mr. Abbas that going ahead with the unity government would risk American aid, which currently amounts to about $500 million a year.The United States, like Israel, considers Hamas to be a terrorist organization, and Congressional rules on aid to the Palestinian Authority are tightly drawn to exclude any money going to Hamas-affiliated bodies.Although the unity government would be composed of unaffiliated technocrats — Mr. Fayyad is not a member of Fatah — it would most likely be confirmed by the Palestinian Legislative Council, which has been dominated by Hamas since that group won elections in 2006.Israel has also said that any unity deal would sink the possibility of returning to negotiations. Hamas and Fatah disagree on the negotiations with Israel as well, with Hamas opposing them.The surprise deal between Fatah and Hamas, brokered by Egypt, was signed in early May after four years in which the two groups barely spoke. It called for the formation of a national unity government and elections a year later.The desire for unity is widely shared by the populations in both Hamas-ruled Gaza and Fatah’s West Bank, but the efforts to agree on a government and make it function face enormous challenges not easily overcome. Still, leaders in both places say unity is vital.“This reconciliation is a must,” said Muhammad Shtayeh, a member of the Fatah Central Committee, speaking by telephone from Ramallah in the West Bank. “We cannot afford to lose this. It is our duty, our responsibility to make it happen.“For me, the issue is not individuals but the political program. We have to sit down and agree on a political agenda, but that is not there yet either.”'"
"'11-06-20,'1','“NATO regrets the loss of innocent civilian lives,” Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, the commander of the Libyan mission, said in the statement, blaming a possible “weapons system failure.”NATO said it had conducted 11,500 sorties “with tremendous care to minimize civilian casualties.” The Qaddafi government has often claimed that the strikes have killed hundreds of civilians. But until Sunday’s bombing, the Qaddafi government’s attempts to show journalists proof of civilian casualties have been contradicted by witnesses or lacking in evidence or specific details.In a statement in response to the attack, the Libyan foreign minister, Abdulati al-Obeidi, called “for all Muslims to initiate a global jihad against the oppressive criminal West.” The secular Libyan government offered no explanation for its uncharacteristic use of Islamist language.Neighbors who witnessed Sunday’s attack said it took place at about 1:15 a.m., at the same time that foreign journalists lodged at the Rixos Hotel in the capital heard a large blast rattle windows. A few moments later, an agitated Qaddafi spokesman began urgently summoning the reporters for a bus ride to the bombing site, saying that the bodies of civilians were still in the rubble.When the journalists arrived, a body was sitting in an open ambulance. Another was carried out as emergency workers and neighborhood men pulled away the wreckage of a large cinderblock home. A short while later, reporters were taken to the Tripoli hospital and shown the bodies of a third adult and a baby, laid alongside the first two. A small child arrived on a stretcher, dead either on arrival or soon after. All the bodies appeared caked in dust from the rubble.A Qaddafi spokesman said the destroyed home had housed 15 members of an extended family named al-Ghrari.The home sat in a working-class neighborhood in the Souq al-Juma area, which is known as a hotbed of opposition to the Qaddafi government. As the journalists visited in early Sunday, and during another call later, a few neighbors tried without evidence to argue that the Qaddafi government had set off the blast or planted the bodies. But others who said that they opposed Colonel Qaddafi confirmed an airstrike.There were no indications of any military facility in the area. Children’s shoes, diapers, a woman’s dress and kitchen tools lay amid the wreckage early Sunday. The blast knocked the top off the structure, leaving a concrete staircase reaching into the air. Several carports on the block collapsed, crushing the vehicles within. A neighbor a block away invited reporters into his home to show shattered glass from windows and doors, and said his wife had been taken to the hospital with wounds from the shards.“Why did they bomb a civilian house?” asked Abdul Rouf, 26, another neighbor, who said he had run to his roof when he heard jets overhead and watched a missile hit the house.Khalid Kaim, a deputy foreign minister, arrived at the scene not long after the blast and told journalists it gave the lie to NATO’s stated mission of protecting civilians from Colonel Qaddafi’s wrath for challenging his rule. “We have seen who is attacking civilians,” he said. “They are targeting houses and flats. Tomorrow they will target schools and hospitals.”Perhaps wary of recent attacks by small groups of rebels against Qaddafi forces here, one of the government minders taking the journalists to the bombed house and the hospital in the middle of the night brought along his assault rifle.'"
"'11-06-20,'1','Mr. ’s Socialist Party has been working to shore up its tenuous political position in the face of widespread anger in Greece over strict austerity measures that have produced job losses and cuts to wages and pensions. Late last week Mr. Papandreou shuffled his cabinet and appointed a Socialist stalwart, Evangelos Venizelos, as the new finance minister.The ministers did fall into line with an agreement made on Friday between the German chancellor, , and the French president, , over the extent to which private investors would be involved in a second bailout package, which Greece needs on top of its existing rescue package in order to meet its debt obligations through next year.The ministers did agree that a second bailout would involve the private sector “in the form of informal and voluntary rollovers of existing Greek debt” — a solution deemed acceptable by the . Before backing down on Friday, Mrs. Merkel had initially pressed for debt swaps instead.Asked about the mood of the talks, the Belgian finance minister, Didier Reynders, said “the atmosphere was good.”“The problem was that we have to make progress on the role of the private sector, and we have made progress,” he said.The discussion proved more complex than expected because the was insisting that the effectively underwrite the Greek government if its financing plan did not add up over the next year, said one European official not authorized to speak publicly. Many governments resisted that effort because of the uncertainty in knowing how much of a financing gap there could be next year. It is also unclear what proportion of it could be covered by the private sector.Devising a new bailout that would include voluntary private sector involvement, so it would not be classified as a default, will be complex, said one official not authorized to speak publicly, because the amount that the private sector agrees to contribute will largely determine how big a gap reluctant European governments will have to fill. Another big source will be Greece’s privatization program, intended to raise as much as 50 billion euros.After a week of intense turmoil that ended with an overhaul of the ruling Socialist Party’s cabinet on Friday, Mr. Papandreou signaled on Sunday that he was prepared to make radical changes to the indebted Greek state system, and proposed an overhaul of the Constitution.Declaring that the bloated government sector was largely to blame for the state of the Greek economy, Mr. Papandreou called for a referendum in the fall on a proposal to “change the political system” and revise the Constitution, which protects some 800,000 government workers.Mr. Papandreou confirmed that talks were progressing between Greece and its foreign creditors for a second bailout package “approximately equal” to last year’s emergency package of 110 billion euros.The stakes still remain high, with politicians aware of the risk of contagion.“Nobody’s lending to the Greeks at the moment and that’s why we need to find a solution,” said Maria Fekter, ’s finance minister. “A default would be an ever bigger damage.”All this comes a little more than a year after the international community offered the government in Athens its first package of 110 billion euros in loans to prevent it from having to borrow at crippling rates on the financial markets.But Greece has since then failed to meet its economic goals because of a worse-than-expected recession, which has depressed revenues, as well as its own failure to install reforms.Greece’s creditors have demanded that Mr. Papandreou secure a broad political consensus on a number of austerity measures — chiefly increases, cuts in public spending and privatization of state assets — that are to be voted on in Parliament by the end of this month.'"

Levinson, inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services. The products included cantaloupes from Honduras contaminated with salmonella, frozen mussel meat from New Zealand infected with listeria and frozen fish from Korea that contained the bacterium that causes botulism.In one case, more than three months passed from the time the F.D.A. became aware of the contamination to the time a recall was initiated. In another case, the lag was nearly a month. In 13 of the 17 cases, the companies that supplied the tainted goods failed to provide accurate or complete information to their customers so that the products could be withdrawn completely, the audit found.In a response to the audit, David Dorsey, the F.D.A.’s acting deputy commissioner for policy, planning and budget, said that the landmark food safety law signed in January by President Obama would fix some of these problems. For instance, the law for the first time gave the F.D.A. the authority to order companies to withdraw foods suspected of being contaminated. Until this year, the F.D.A. could only ask manufacturers to withdraw suspect foods.The F.D.A. is studying other ways to improve food recalls, and one possible solution would be to hire contractors to do the work, Mr. Dorsey wrote.From July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008, the F.D.A. oversaw 40 recalls of imported foods that were so contaminated that the agency deemed them to be an imminent threat. Auditors examined 17 of these recalls, which included seven for salmonella, five for listeria, four for Clostridium botulinum and one for high lead levels.'"
"'11-06-21,'1','“The market is changing,” said Pal Zarandy, a partner at Rewheel, a Helsinki firm that advises operators on their mobile data strategies. “The whole smartphone data transformation is a window that will last one or two more years. Then that market will be saturated. The question is: Can Nokia and Microsoft come up with relevant phones fast enough?”Mr. Elop, a 47-year-old Canadian who ran Microsoft’s Office products division before joining Nokia, said the alliance between the companies would deliver. The release of the N9 — which Mr. Elop said he pushed for relentlessly after he arrived — was a harbinger, he said, of a more competitive Nokia.“It is an opportunity for us to test and to learn with the N9, but also to put a very clear statement in the market: Nokia continues to innovate, does beautiful work,” Mr. Elop said in an interview last week at Nokia’s glass-and-steel headquarters in Espoo, a suburb west of Helsinki. “Innovation is alive and well at Nokia.”During a 40-minute interview, Mr. Elop said Nokia was on the cusp of a productive new phase that would re-establish the company’s credibility and increase its global smartphone share, which the market research firm Gartner put at 27.4 percent in March, behind Android, with 36 percent, and ahead of Apple’s 16.8 percent. During the interview, he used the words “innovate” or “innovation” 24 times.Aesthetically, the N9 is a quantum leap for Nokia in smartphone design, incorporating a sculptured four-inch glass screen and a polycarbonate plastic body made of solid color — cyan blue, magenta and black — so that scratches are barely visible. But beyond the features, it is the timing and strategy of its introduction that signal a deeper change at Nokia.The N9 runs a variant of Nokia’s MeeGo operating system, a product of Nokia’s short-lived venture with Intel, the chip maker. The device was already in the pipeline when he arrived last fall, but Mr. Elop said he saw its potential and accelerated its release, working closely with his design chief, Mr. Ahtisaari, who now reports directly to him. Mr. Ahtisaari said design had a new priority at Nokia, a company traditionally run by radio engineers.In a wood-paneled conference room flanking a row of idle Finnish saunas, Mr. Elop spoke pointedly about his efforts to retool the world’s largest maker of mobile phones to meet the challenges poised by Apple, Google and a host of Asian rivals led by Samsung, LG, ZTE and Huawei.The saunas, one assistant said, were now used only twice a year. The company’s glass lobby, which a decade ago buzzed with visiting clients, suppliers and media people when Nokia was riding high, had only a handful of visitors on a weekday afternoon.Nokia has gone through a bracing transition since Mr. Elop arrived last fall. The company is cutting 4,000 jobs, including 1,500 in Finland, and transferring 3,000 others to a consultant, Accenture. The moves were a consequence of Mr. Elop’s decision to phase out Nokia’s internal operating system, Symbian, in favor of Microsoft’s Windows software for phones.Investors reacted skeptically to news of the Microsoft alliance, sending Nokia’s shares down 20 percent a day after the announcement. Then came the profit warning on May 31. Since Mr. Elop’s arrival, Nokia’s share price has fallen 40 percent. Shares closed at $5.83 in New York on Monday; they traded as high as $11.75 in February.Mr. Elop acknowledged that the job cuts and transition to Microsoft, considered necessary to restore competitiveness, have been challenging. But he rejected criticism from some analysts who had questioned whether he could have better finessed the timing of the move to Microsoft’s software to limit any damage to Symbian.“We are shifting a whole company,” Mr. Elop said. “There are tens of thousands of people here. What they do every day is being changed right now. And that’s not something you can do under the cloak of darkness or privacy.”He said the phase-out of Symbian would be gradual. In fact, Nokia plans to introduce 10 new Symbian handsets over the next year, he said. Mobile operators, which are the main buyers of most handsets, continue to buy Symbian devices because they do not want to become dependent on its rivals, he said, without mentioning Apple or Google by name.“There’s tremendous support from the operators for what we need to do,” Mr. Elop said. “They are not dropping Symbian en masse. That is absolutely not the case. It is the case that by going through a transition, it is hard. Our competitors want to attack us. That’s business. That’s O.K.”In the midst of the battle, Mr. Elop spoke rapidly but appeared upbeat, even buoyant. He said the reason for his optimism was that the collaboration with Microsoft on smartphones was going better than he had expected. Just before the interview, Mr. Elop said, he spent two hours reviewing plans for the introduction of Nokia’s first Microsoft phones.“This is still some number of weeks and months before that happens,” he said, adding that Nokia might unveil one or more of the first Microsoft handsets in time for the holiday season.The first Microsoft handsets are being conceived at Nokia’s research facility in San Diego. Mr. Elop recently returned from a visit there with several working prototypes. The models have excited people within Nokia and Microsoft, he said. The two companies have combined some staff from Redmond, Wash., where Microsoft is based, and Espoo, to expedite their collaboration.By using Microsoft’s operating system, Nokia has trimmed its time-to-market for new handsets by two-thirds, Mr. Elop said.In view of the pending Microsoft introduction, Mr. Elop described the N9 as “one step in the journey to demonstrate that we are executing.”Carolina Milanesi, an analyst for Gartner in London, said the N9 was a “night and day” improvement over its predecessor, the N900. “They have created something that consumers will want,” Ms. Milanesi said.Mr. Elop suggested that many N9 innovations might be incorporated into the new Microsoft line.Nokia’s work force is committed, he said, to taking on the competition. He invoked the Finnish word “sisu,” which he said translates into a combination of perseverance, energy and drive.'"

In the fracking process, drillers pump chemical-laced water into the ground at high pressure to crack the rock. Environmental groups worry that the chemicals could taint water supplies.

"'11-06-21,'1','On Jan. 22, 1980, shortly after I arrived in Moscow as a reporter, but before I met him, Andrei Sakharov was arrested and flown to internal exile in Gorky, a city closed to foreigners (now called Nizhny Novgorod). The operation was a stunning show of the Soviet state’s paranoia about a mild man who did nothing more than publicly criticize its human-rights violations. All the traffic around Sakharov’s apartment on Chkalova Street was halted and phones in the neighborhood turned off as if armed dissidents were out there ready to defend him.Some time later, Sakharov’s wife, Elena Bonner, returned from Gorky to Moscow and reported on the small and intimately watched apartment to which they had been sent. The authorities had evidently decided at that initial stage of Sakharov’s exile that they would seem less malicious if some information was allowed out. Thus began my acquaintance with the formidable Elena Bonner, who died Saturday at the age of 88.With time I came to know when Bonner was in Moscow because the small tan Zhiguli sedan that sometimes followed me would be replaced by a larger gray Volga. The K.G.B. blocked her apartment, but only until 2 a.m.She was an imposing presence with her thick glasses and a loud, clear voice that carried the authority of a sergeant major — which she was to dissidents and refuseniks, helping them get their message out through her many contacts among foreign correspondents and diplomats.She could be peremptory with reporters, demanding that they publish her communiqués verbatim or not at all. But at times she was also ready to sit back with a cigarette and a dreamy smile and talk about being a front-line medic in World War II; her postwar life as a pediatrician and believing Communist Party member, her two children, and finally her conversion to open dissent after the Prague Spring of 1968.'"
"'11-06-21,'1','If Congressional Republicans are really intent on getting to the bottom of an ill-conceived sting operation along the border by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, they should call President Felipe Calderón of Mexico as an expert witness.Mr. Calderón has the data showing that the tens of thousands of weapons seized from the Mexican drug cartels in the last four years mostly came from the United States. Three out of five of those guns were battlefield weapons that were outlawed here until the assault weapons ban was allowed to lapse in 2004. To help him stop the bloody mayhem, he is pleading with Washington to re-enact the ban and impose other needed controls.That is the last thing Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican, wants to hear. He and Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, issued a report last week castigating the A.T.F. for an operation in which federal agents, hoping to track guns to Mexican cartels, monitored but did not stop gun sales to people suspected of obtaining weapons for those criminal groups. Two of the American-sold guns showed up at the scene of a fatal shooting of an American border patrol agent in Arizona last year.The Justice Department has ordered an investigation, and it must be candid in assessing what happened.Congress needs to be candid about how loophole-ridden laws have created a huge market for assault weapons, which end up in Mexico. At a hearing, Mr. Issa insisted, “We’re not here to talk about proposed gun legislation.” Federal officials in February sought authority to require gun dealers to report bulk sales of assault rifles only to have it blocked by a provision in the Republican budget. A responsible Congress would re-enact the assault weapons ban, outlaw uncontrolled gun-show sales and reform regulations that allow corrupt dealers to stay in business.'"
"'11-06-21,'1','The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said Monday that virtually every aspect of the rent laws, which limit rent increases on more than a million apartments in New York City and its suburbs, remained on the table as lawmakers sought a deal acceptable to both Mr. Cuomo and Senate Republicans, who are closely allied with the real estate industry.“It’s all of the issues,” Mr. Silver said, a few hours after meeting with Mr. Cuomo and Dean G. Skelos, the Senate majority leader, in the governor’s office.Assembly Democrats are seeking to raise the income and rent thresholds at which landlords can begin charging tenants market rate, while at the same time indexing those thresholds to inflation. Those changes are intended to help stem the steady loss of rent-regulated units, tens of thousands of which have reverted to market rate as inflation and annual increases pushed rents past the existing thresholds.Democrats have sought to bundle the tenant-friendly changes they have proposed with the renewal of tax breaks sought by real estate developers and landlords.But after the meeting on Monday, Mr. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, signaled that he considered the Assembly proposals onerous and unacceptable.“We’re not looking to protect the wealthy,” he said. “We’re looking to ensure that rent stabilization helps affordability.”Mr. Skelos said that one specific proposal of Assembly Democrats — to raise the income threshold at which tenants can lose the protection of rent regulations, to $300,000 from $175,000 — was “unconscionable.”Though Mr. Cuomo has said publicly that he wants to expand rent regulations and not merely extend the existing laws, his specific bargaining position is unknown. Tenant advocates, who fear that Mr. Cuomo will settle for a deal that raises the current thresholds but does not index them to inflation, pressed him on Monday for a stronger package of tenant protections.“What has been floated, it would be such a piddling improvement it’s laughable,” said Michael McKee, treasurer of the Tenants Political Action Committee. “We’re not going to accept a piddling reform and say that it’s a victory.”Meanwhile, protesters on both sides of the same-sex marriage issue strode through the corridors of the Capitol, forming a crowd as raucous as any that has gathered there in months. Members of the clergy and gay-rights activists held placards, while state troopers, some armed with bright yellow Tasers, watched over them.Dr. Jan Taylor, 50, a family physician from the Albany suburbs, stood outside Mr. Skelos’s office clutching rosary beads. “I’m here for my children,” she said. “If gay marriage passes and marriage is redefined, I think that will unleash a social experiment on our children, which they have not consented to. And that’s unfair to them.”Linda Barat, 53, a homemaker from New Rochelle, also said she was there for her children — a daughter, 18, who is straight, and son, 20, who is gay.“They’re equal,” she said. “There’s no difference between them. And I want them both to have the opportunity of marriage, and everything it entails.”A few yards away, the former Giants wide receiver David Tyree lingered with the leaders of several groups that oppose same-sex marriage, which delivered petitions to Mr. Skelos that they said had the signatures of 63,000 New Yorkers who agreed with them.Mr. Tyree, who earned fame for an acrobatic, late-game catch in Super Bowl XLII in 2008, told reporters that he thought his mythical reception may have been part of a larger plan.“Perhaps God orchestrated that play to give me a platform for what I’m doing here today,"" he said.'"
"'11-06-21,'1','WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday gave a complicated answer to the simple question of whether poor people facing jail time for failing to pay child support are entitled to court-appointed lawyers.In a 5-to-4 decision that divided along ideological lines, the court said there is no automatic right to counsel for people charged with civil contempt, at least when the parent seeking to collect child support does not have a lawyer. In those circumstances, Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority, states must use “substantial procedural safeguards.”In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said the answer to the simple question the court had agreed to decide is that there is no constitutional right to counsel for people facing jail for civil contempt. He also objected to the court’s decision to fashion safeguards based on suggestions from the federal government, which was not a party to the case.In a series of decisions starting with Gideon v. Wainwright in 1963, the Supreme Court has held that poor people facing the loss of liberty for crimes must be provided with lawyers. But those decisions were rooted in the Sixth Amendment, which concerns only criminal proceedings.Civil contempt is meant to coerce rather than punish, and judges often say that people held in such circumstances hold the keys to their own jail cells.'"

The ads use the same voice and motion control developed for the company’s Kinect game console, which it introduced in time for the 2010 holiday season.The new ads are intended to help advertisers keep the attention of Xbox users in a way that traditional television advertising does not.“When you have highly interactive people and a passive medium, they are interacting with their phone or their laptop while watching TV,” said Mark Kroese, the general manager of the advertising business group at Microsoft. The new ads, Mr. Kroese said, “create a natural way for the user to engage with the TV.”At least one advertising agency seems to agree.“The new ad units really epitomized the level of engagement that everyone is working towards,” said John M.

"'11-06-21,'1','The Harts are just starting to tear their levees down.The great flood of 2011 is still slowly receding from the Mississippi Delta, sitting stubbornly in some areas, leaving behind in others thousands of damaged homes and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ruined crops. For farmers, who were expecting a banner year, it is closer to a nightmare.“The two things that make or break us are the whims of a financial market and weather,” said John Michael Pillow, 41, who farms the land that borders the Harts, and who lost three-quarters of his corn crop this year, his first as sole owner of the family farm. “You can’t get any riskier.”Much of farming is a matter of risk management. Mr. Pillow and many other farmers would go under completely in a year like this were it not for the sophisticated tools that have been devised to reduce risk.But some of these tools — insurance policies, government programs, high-tech farm equipment, genetically modified crops from the biotech giant Monsanto — are part of what led the elder Mr. Hart, 62, to quit farming a dozen years ago.“My dad taught me you put the seed in the ground then put your faith in the Lord,” he said. “Where am I putting my faith now? I’m putting my faith in Uncle Sam, in the insurance companies, in Monsanto.”Todd Hart, 32 and about to be married, is now considering whether to take up that calling himself. The 200 acres of soybeans he now farms, and which are still mostly underwater, are not nearly enough to be profitable in the modern business of farming. His accountant put it starkly. “Get big,” he said, “or get out.”Among the worst-flooded areas in Mississippi was a large area of farmland just west of Yazoo City. Here the levee system was simply unfinished, and backwater from the Yazoo River spilled out unobstructed, forming a vast brown lake in a matter of days.The Harts’ island sat in the middle of this lake. Inside the six-foot-high levees stood the family farmhouse where father and son were raised, the office from which the elder Mr. Hart ran the farm, the plot where his childhood pony is buried, the workshop that Todd wants to turn into a recording studio, the garden tended by his stepmother, the grass lawn that Todd kept mowed during the flood.The decision to put it all behind levees was made on the fly.On April 24, on an Easter Sunday afternoon trip to Lowe’s hardware store, the elder Mr. Hart got a call. It was a friend of his who happened to be a hunting buddy with a man from the Army Corps of Engineers, and he had news: a flood was coming.Over the next week Mr. Hart worked his sources, and with each call it seemed the predictions worsened. At first, his worry was the house in the nearby hamlet of Satartia, a house that his grandfather built in 1918 and where his son was planning to move with his new wife after their wedding on July 30.But by the end of the week it was all at risk: the house in Satartia, the family farmhouse and the cottage a few dozen yards away where Todd Hart lives now. It was impossible to know the better, and cheaper, option: to let the floods come and clean up afterward or do something radical like building levees. The elder Mr. Hart opted for the latter.Building your own levees is expensive, but so is letting the waters come in and cleaning up afterward.  Mr. Hart figured that only one of these options meant relying on insurance policies, adjusters and paperwork. For a man who describes himself as having “an authority problem,” this was not a hard decision.“It wasn’t no smarts in it,” Mr. Hart said.Mr. Hart picked up farming at the age of 22, clearing some land on his father’s 2,500 acres to plant cotton alongside the existing cow pastures. He was good at it and even expanded, briefly, leasing an additional 2,500 acres.But starting in the mid-1990s, things went sour. World cotton prices began a long steady decline. A 1995 bollworm outbreak brought ruin.Mr. Hart was stung by the run of bad luck, but he was also turned off by the newer ways farmers were coping with the old vagaries.The federal government’s generous cotton subsidies not only buoyed many farms in a bad market but also, in Mr. Hart’s opinion, seemed to blatantly defy the law of supply and demand. Family farms became legal partnerships to take advantage of the subsidy regulations, and expanded by buying up or leasing the farms of those who, like Mr. Hart, left.These legal tactics, along with the insurance policies, the new varieties of crops and the satellite-guided tractors, were designed to smooth the sharp edges of a profoundly variable occupation.But for Mr. Hart they only seemed to make things worse. The margins for mere economic survival were tightening as the necessary spectrum of expertise was growing. Little of this expertise appeared to have much to do with the farming Mr. Hart had learned as a young man.“When I started putting my numbers together,” he said, “I was checking with my insurance man and my lawyer and my accountant and the farm services man before I ever figured out what it was going to cost me to plant a seed. You’re doing something that’s not farming. It’s a business.”In 1999, he quit. He sold most of the equipment and let his employees go. He leased his land to a couple of farmers, who still farm it today. Both have law degrees.But he held on to his farmhouse.That is where Todd Hart, in between trips to Starkville, Miss., for wedding photos, kept his vigil this spring. In the mornings, he paced off the levees, looking for seepage or armadillo holes. At night, as the waters lapped against the levees and the dogs chased raccoons around the lawn, he watched TV or played guitar in the quiet house, emptied of all furniture but a bed.Sitting in the boat in the driveway, he talked of plans to start a music festival on the farm or turn the old barn into a concert site. With marriage looming, a gamble in the music business may not cut it.“I told myself I would never farm,” he said. But he faltered in college, switching majors and then schools before losing interest altogether. And at some point one had to do something.It is not as straightforward a decision as it was when his father got into it. Mr. Pillow, the neighbor, said he felt ready to take over the family farm only after two decades of managing it for the other family members in the partnership. All of the advancements have made farming more complex, but the level of risk is still daunting.“If it were my son,” he said, “I’d really discourage him.”It is a major decision that Todd Hart does not have much time to think about these days. He is spending his days tearing out the drywall in the house in Satartia, which took on water and will not be ready by the wedding; moving back into his cottage;  and anxiously watching the water on his soybeans — hoping, in the counterintuitive math of insurance payouts, that it does not drain too quickly.The plan to build levees, like the Harts did, was not without risk: Some of Irma Hart’s acquaintances have discovered they had hit septic lines while digging up earth, and that sewage water, not floodwater, had filled up the house.Mr. Hart, for his part, is just starting to find out how much his levees cost, having received a bill for $25,000 a few days ago.  In his case, it was probably a financially shrewd move, he said, given the limits of his insurance policy.On Monday, he was even leaning toward leaving some of the levees standing, just in case.“At least,” he said, “that’s the plan as of today.”'"
"'11-06-21,'1','To be sure, this present international golf dominance is good for global expansion of the game. What more could a golf-related business with global aspirations ask for? The South African-born Charl Schwartzel as the Masters champion; McIlroy, an appealing, fresh-faced talent with the United States Open trophy; a South African, Louis Oosthuizen, with the British Open title; and Martin Kaymer of Germany as the P.G.A. Championship winner.With golf’s return to the Olympics in 2016, any company with the worldwide expansion of the game written into its five-year plans is ecstatic. The PGA European Tour is pleased. After McIlroy’s victory, Chubby Chandler, whose International Sports Management organization represents three of the four major winners, was “proper chuffed,” as the British would put it.The picture is a bit murkier in the short term for United States interests. The Saturday and Sunday Nielsen ratings for the Open were down about 26 percent. The drop is explainable in that last year’s broadcast was shown in prime time from scenic Pebble Beach and Mickelson and Tiger Woods were in the mix, finishing tied for fourth.The current cycle for golf in the United States is similar to one in 1986, when the top four spots in the Sony Rankings, the precursor to the World Golf Ranking, were held by Greg Norman of Australia, Bernhard Langer of Germany, Seve Ballesteros of Spain and Tommy Nakajima of Japan. Andy Bean at No. 5 was the highest-ranked United States player. Steve Stricker is currently the highest-ranked American, at No. 5.Mark McCormack, the founder of IMG, took American professionals to task in 1987, saying they had become “complacent.”He added, “They do not care enough to become champions.”The culprits were college golf and the PGA Tour, McCormack said. By eliminating match play and de-emphasizing individual performance in their tournaments, he said, colleges trained nonwinners, and the PGA Tour compounded the problem with its top-125 exemption policy and purse-distribution structure.He recommended the radical cure of heavily weighting purse distribution so the winner would collect 50 percent, the runner-up 20 percent and the third-place finisher 10 percent — with 5 percent to fourth place and the remaining 15 percent to players in spots 5 through 12.Although none of his suggestions were adopted, American golf did go through a resurgence in 1987, with Americans winning three of the four majors. A year later, they won two more, including the first of Curtis Strange’s consecutive United States Open titles, and three again in 1989.This trend will probably also cycle through, although there was some concern earlier this year when Bill Haas, one of the PGA Tour’s better young players, who won twice in 2010, said what he really wanted was “to be able to have 13 top 10s, because even without winning, that’s a better year than my year last year, in my opinion, when I won twice.”If that particular motivation were to become widespread, there might be cause for alarm about the state of American golf, where $5 million is on offer each week and finishing ninth is worth $150,000.Jack Nicklaus, who knows what separates good from great, was asked Sunday night what he would tell McIlroy about how to avoid the pitfalls of early success.“In this day and age, it’s very difficult,” he said. “I hope he understands he is a golfer first. He will be and already is a celebrity, but he is a golfer first. Right now, he is a very good golfer, but if he wants to be a great golfer, he needs to learn how to deal with it and learn how to handle all the things on the side.“He needs to make certain golf is the first thing, as well as his motivation and desire to be great,” Nicklaus continued. “Tiger had records on the wall as his motivation. My motivation was that I wanted to be the best I could be in the sport, and once I got close to Bob Jones’s record, that became a motivation.”Collecting 13 top 10 finishes would mean a minimum of $1.9 million in earnings. But, as a motivator, it does not lead to a green jacket, a United States Open trophy, a claret jug or a Wanamaker Trophy.'"
"'11-06-21,'1','A lawyer for McCourt, Steve Susman, issued a statement saying that Selig’s action was “not only a disappointment, but worse, is potentially destructive to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Major League Baseball.” Susman vowed to “explore vigorously our options and remedies” in light of Selig’s decision.A flashpoint in the deal is a $385 million upfront from Fox that would reduce the annual rights fee to the team. Only $211.5 million of the $385 million would finance team operations.Of the rest, $80 million would repay debt, which Major League Baseball says is too high; $23.5 million would repay most of a $30 million personal loan from Fox that McCourt used to meet payroll last month; $10 million would pay the McCourts’ legal fees; and $10 million would be spent as they desire.McCourt could use another $50 million of the Fox money to bankroll a $100 million payment to his wife if the team were declared his property by Judge Scott Gordon of Superior Court, who is overseeing the divorce.Gordon had scheduled a one-day trial Aug. 4 to determine if McCourt retains ownership of the team or if it is ruled community property and sold. But that and the rest of the divorce agreement were voided by Selig’s rejection of the Fox deal. Selig approves all 30 teams’ TV deals and loans.McCourt could resuscitate the Fox deal by sharply reducing or eliminating the $385 million payment, but he needs that influx of money now to stabilize his team’s finances.The Dodgers’ current TV deal with Prime Ticket, a regional sports network owned by Fox, expires in 2013. The new one would replace the last three seasons of that contract and extend it through 2027. As part of the transaction, a company owned by McCourt would have received a 35 percent stake in Prime.Under the deal, Fox would have lent Prime $385 million, which then would have been distributed to the McCourt subsidiary. That critical payment, which Selig might have approved for a team with less debt or an owner he trusted more, looks to be a central issue in a lawsuit by the Dodgers.Susman said that the Dodgers had complied with all of M.L.B.’s requirements to approve the Fox deal. But Selig was not swayed.'"
"'11-06-21,'1','A special type of pacemaker fails to help almost half of the heart patients who get it, and now researchers believe they know why.The implantable device, called a biventricular pacemaker, is designed to correct the irregularity in contractions of the heart’s ventricles that sometimes occurs in people with heart failure. The pacemaker is generally used in patients for whom medication has been ineffective. More than 50,000 are implanted each year.Medical guidelines suggest that the pacemakers be used in patients with a delay of 0.12 seconds or more in QRS duration, a particular heart rhythm abnormality that appears on an electrocardiogram.Researchers writing online last week in The Archives of Internal Medicine reviewed five randomized controlled trials of the device, involving 5,813 patients. They found that the treatment was effective only for those with a QRS delay of 0.15 seconds or more, leaving 40 percent of the patients treated with no benefit at all.The pacemakers are expensive — getting one can cost $70,000 or more — and the lead author, Dr. Ilke Sipahi, an assistant professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve, said that implantation has significant risks. “If you’re not going to benefit,” he said, “taking the risk is not worth it.” NICHOLAS BAKALAR'"

It is working on more, including one that would set limits on power plants that burn fossil fuels like coal or natural gas.It followed, Justice Ginsburg wrote, that the agency rather than the courts should take the leading role in considering limits on power plant emissions, although the agency’s action or inaction would remain subject to judicial review.Originally, eight states — California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin — filed the suit, but New Jersey and Wisconsin later dropped out.The states and their allies asked the courts to protect them from what they called a public nuisance: the many unwanted consequences of global climate change caused by heat-trapping pollutants. The defendants, they said, were collectively responsible for 25 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from domestic power plants, and 10 percent of emissions from all human activity in the United States.Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed the suit, saying the “balancing of economic, environmental, foreign policy and national security interests involved” was a task “consigned to the political branches, not the judiciary.” But her ruling was reversed more than three years later on appeal, when a two-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, allowed the case to proceed.The panel originally included Judge Sonia Sotomayor, although its decision was not issued until after she was elevated to the Supreme Court. Justice Sotomayor recused herself from the case when it reached the Supreme Court; that led to a 4-to-4 deadlock on the threshold issue of whether federal courts had the authority to hear the case at all.The court did not disclose the justices’ votes on that point. Summarizing the decision from the bench on Monday, Justice Ginsburg explained the court’s “standard practice” in such circumstances: “We affirm the court of appeals’ exercise of jurisdiction, but we issue no opinion on the point and our disposition of the question carries no weight as precedent.”Nonetheless, a passage in another part of the decision indicated concerns similar to those expressed by Judge Preska.“The expert agency is surely better equipped to do the job than individual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case injunctions,” Justice Ginsburg wrote. “Federal judges lack the scientific, economic and technological resources an agency can utilize in coping with issues of this order.”The justices also took no position on the science of climate change.“The court, we caution, endorses no particular view of the complicated issues related to carbon dioxide emissions and climate change,” Justice Ginsburg wrote in her decision in the case, American Electric Power v. Connecticut, No. 10-174.Nor did the court address whether a nuisance suit over carbon dioxide emissions would be proper but for the Clean Air Act’s grant of authority to the federal environmental agency. All the court decided, Justice Ginsburg wrote, was that “any such claim would be displaced by the federal legislation authorizing E.P.A. to regulate carbon dioxide emissions.”The Clean Air Act, she wrote, “provides a means to seek limits on emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic power plants — the same relief the plaintiffs seek by invoking federal common law,” adding: “We see no room for a parallel track.”'"

"'11-06-22,'0','“Wilfred,” beginning Thursday night on FX, is a semi-dark comedy in which Frodo Baggins frequently shares a bong with a large Australian man wearing a dog suit. Some shows aspire to cult status; this one goes straight there, practically bypassing the need to be broadcast at all.Elijah Wood, who went to New Zealand to play Frodo the hobbit in the “Lord of the Rings” movies, maintains his Down Under bona fides with “Wilfred.” It’s the American remake of an Australian succès d’estime that grew from a joke between friends to a short film to a 16-episode television series; the series won several Australian Film Institute awards, including best comedy.Mr. Wood plays Ryan, a clean-cut young depressive who tries with a notable lack of success to commit suicide as the pilot opens. Jason Gann, who created the original series with Adam Zwar, reprises his role as Wilfred, the dog belonging to Ryan’s nubile neighbor, Jenna (Fiona Gubelmann).Ryan, and only Ryan, sees Wilfred as a man in a moth-eaten, floppy-eared dog suit. Viewers seeking an explanation for this, or looking for some symbolic framework — Wilfred as an expression of Ryan’s loneliness and insecurity, canine id beckoning to human superego, the loutish working-class dog versus the buttoned-up salaryman — will be disappointed, at least through the first three episodes. Sometimes a man in a dog suit is just a man in a dog suit.The show’s casual surreality can be traced to its roots, when Mr. Zwar told Mr. Gann a story about going home with a date and encountering her jealous dog. That anecdote, expanded to sitcom length, became the first episode of the original show. The idea was simple: a dog fights a man over a woman, and gradually they become mates. It was a buddy comedy crossed with a talking-animal comedy, filmed on a shoestring (much of the action involved man and dog sitting on a couch and getting high) and featuring the foul language and full frontal nudity allowed on Australian broadcast television.The new version has been put in the hands of the writer and producer David Zuckerman (“Family Guy,” “American Dad”) and toned down for American basic cable, though the humor still pushes the envelope. (Some of the nastiest jokes, as it happens, target Asians: the narrowness of their birth canals, the foulness of their cooking.)'"

"'11-06-22,'0','Two senators on Tuesday expanded an investigation of the medical device maker Medtronic, demanding that the company turn over records involving millions of dollars in payments to researchers and internal correspondence with doctors who had published its research on a controversial bone-growth product.Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, wrote to Omar Ishrak, Medtronic’s recently named chairman and chief executive, seeking extensive documents related to its bone-growth product, Infuse.“Reports that doctors conducting medical trials while on Medtronic’s payroll may have hidden serious side effects for patients are deeply troubling,” Senator Baucus said in a statement. “We need to do everything we can to ensure companies aren’t concealing serious medical complications from patients just to increase profits,” he added.Medtronic, in a statement late Tuesday, said it would respond to the senators’ request. The company did not comment specifically on the accusations of unreported complications and financial bias in research, but said it routinely reported all adverse events to the Food and Drug Administration “irrespective of any financial relationship between the company and the clinical investigator or study author.”Marybeth Thorsgaard, a spokeswoman for Medtronic, said three specific complications listed in the letter — abnormal bone growth, swelling in the neck and throat, and a form of sterility — were all listed as side-effect warnings on the Infuse product label.'"
"'11-06-22,'0','Bookstore owners say they are doing so because too many people regularly come to events having already bought a book online or planning to do so later. Consumers now see the bookstore merely as another library — a place to browse, do informal research and pick up staff recommendations.“They type titles into their iPhones and go home,” said Nancy Salmon, the floor manager at Kepler’s. “We know what they’re doing, and it has tested my patience.”The novelist , who is currently on a three-week book tour for her new book, “ ,” appeared at a ticketed event at Kepler’s last week. While she said she was sympathetic to bookstores, she is concerned that people who do not have enough money to buy a hardcover book — especially students or the elderly — might be left out.“I wouldn’t want the people who have no idea who I am and have nothing else to do on a Wednesday night shut out,” she said. “Those are your readers.”While e-book sales have exploded in the last year, sales of print books have suffered, hitting brick-and-mortar stores especially hard. But the independent bookstores that have survived the growth of Amazon and the big bookstore chains have tried to retool over the years to become tougher, more agile and more creative in finding new sources of revenue beyond print books.Anne Holman, the general manager of The King’s English Bookshop, an independent store in , said an industrywide discussion began a few years ago about whether to charge for events.“We don’t like to have events where people can’t come for free,” Ms. Holman said. “But we also can’t host big free events that cost us a lot money and everyone is buying books everywhere else.”The bookshop now requires book purchases or sells tickets for around half of its 150 annual events, up from 10 percent five years ago.Heather Gain, the marketing manager of the in , Mass., said that in recent years the store had begun doing more events that required the customer to buy a book, constantly reminding them that “if they aren’t purchasing the books from the establishments that are running these events, the bookstores are going to go away.”“We’re a business,” Ms. Gain said. “We’re not just an Amazon showroom.”Roxanne Coady, the owner of R. J. Julia in Madison, Conn., was one of the first prominent booksellers to begin charging for events about five years ago, a move that she considered “desperate” at the time. A ticket to get in, she said, generally can be paid toward the price of a book.“We were so nervous about it,” she said. “What we’re saying to our best customers is, if you’re shopping with us, nothing’s changed. But for those folks who consider us cheap entertainment, then this is a good way to talk to them about the fact that the way to show your appreciation to the author and the bookstore is to buy their book.”About 10 percent of her revenue now comes from events, which are held about 200 times a year.Publishers can benefit from bookstore events, which are frequently covered in local media as news events, giving book sales a boost.But privately, some publishers said they were skeptical. “We pay for the author to travel and come to the bookstore, and then the store makes money from it?” one said.Readers seem split on the practice. Helen Glikman, 54, a professor of social work from Cambridge, Mass., who regularly attends readings at local bookstores, said she would happily pay a nominal fee, say $10, to hear , who she has seen twice, or .“You get a real sense of community at an independent bookstore,” she said. “You get an intellectual community that gathers around books, and that can only happen at a bookstore.”Joshua Roberts, who works for Drexel University, attended a reading of Eleanor Henderson’s debut novel “10,000 Saints,” at the Strand bookstore in Manhattan on Thursday night. He has known Ms. Henderson for years and was thrilled that her book was out, but he was disinclined to pay to attend a reading at a bookstore.“Who would the money go to? Not to the author?” he asked. “That’s terrible.”After the reading Ms. Henderson said her initial reaction was that charging would be unwise.“I’m not sure that charging readers would be a) useful or b) friendly. While I understand the need for bookstores to make money, I don’t think they should discourage readers.”Some bookstore owners say that while they understand the impulse to charge, they are not comfortable doing it themselves., the largest bookstore chain in the country, has never charged admission to its events, a spokeswoman said.“We are retailers, we are selling a product, for sure, but, at the same time, we’re a cultural center,” said Neal Sofman, co-owner of Bookshop West Portal in , but he would not rule out charging in the future. “You can never say never anymore.”Others make an occasional exception to their no-charging policy. BookCourt, a bookstore in that holds about 300 author events each year, charged $10 a person for an event celebrating the magazine N+1 in December, at the urging of Keith Gessen, an author and an editor of N+1. More than 200 people showed up.“I think it makes it more fun,” said Mr. Gessen, adding that he believed all events should charge admission. “I don’t think you should be able to walk into a Barnes & Noble and get to look at .”'"
"'11-06-22,'0','An analysis of funding needs for state pensions, undertaken by two economists, Robert Novy-Marx and Joshua D. Rauh, showed rising costs as commitments come due. The analysis, cited in an article and a chart in The New York Times, has been disputed by many pension funds. Here are excerpts from a response by Keith Brainard, research director at Nasra, the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, after being shown the chart.It was early in 2010 that Joshua Rauh first published his results that most state pension funds are approaching insolvency in the next 15-20 years. ... You can see Nasra’s response to it here: http://www.nasra.org/resources/RauhNovyMarxMuniStateCritique.pdf.The graphic you sent contains this statement: “In general, pension funds should hold 80 percent of the funds needed for future obligations. Many states, however, have failed to put enough aside.”That statement is a simplistic and misleading characterization of public pension funding. A plan that is 70 percent funded could be in fine shape, and a plan that is funded at 100 percent could be in lousy shape. It depends on many factors, including the plan’s demographic composition, the fiscal health of the plan sponsor, etc.Also, a plan’s funding condition is not solely or even chiefly a function of whether or not they have “put enough aside.” Investment earnings account for a majority of public pension revenues over time, and all pension funds start out life funded well below 100 percent. They build up their funding level over time.'"
"'11-06-22,'0','CHICAGO — Summer arrived, another day passed, and the jury in the case of Rod R. Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois, went right on deliberating behind closed doors. As Tuesday came and went — it was Day 7 of deliberations over charges that Mr. Blagojevich tried to sell a United States Senate seat to the highest bidder — eyebrows were inevitably rising around Chicago.Might this be another deadlocked jury?Less than a year ago, a different jury deliberated for 14 days in the federal courthouse here before emerging to announce that it could not agree on most of the criminal charges against Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat who was arrested, impeached and removed from office over accusations that he tried to trade his official decisions as governor for personal gain — most notably, an appointment to fill the Senate seat that President Obama once held.So as Chicagoans began guessing at what might now be happening inside this jury room, divided camps were forming.On one side were those who argued that this jury was merely methodically mulling transcripts of telephone calls the government secretly recorded of Mr. Blagojevich and pondering intricate legal definitions of the 20 criminal counts against him before arriving, in due time, at a verdict. On the other were those who were beginning to guess that — if a few more days pass — this jury has surely grown as divided as the last one.There have been almost no actual clues about what this jury is thinking (two written questions to the judge last week showed mostly that jurors were carefully studying the evidence), but the dearth of information has in no way diminished the speculation.'"
"'11-06-22,'0','The Brooklyn Museum has canceled plans to mount a controversial exhibition of graffiti art, citing financial constraints. The show, “Art in the Streets,” is currently at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it has drawn large crowds but has also attracted criticism for prompting an increase in graffiti in the surrounding neighborhood.Among the critics was Heather Mac Donald, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who published an article in City Journal this spring, titled “Radical Graffiti Chic,” in which she accused the Los Angeles museum of glorifying vandalism.Her article alerted The Daily News that the show was headed to Brooklyn in 2012, and in late April, it ran a sharply critical editorial, writing that art “mavens will be sticking their thumbs in the eyes of every bodega owner and restaurant manager who struggles to keep his or her property graffiti-free.”On May 5, shortly after the editorial ran, Peter F. Vallone Jr., a member of the City Council, wrote to the director of the Brooklyn Museum, Arnold L. Lehman, urging him not to do the exhibition. “Let me be very clear, taxpayer money should NOT be used to encourage the destruction of our taxpayers’ property,” Mr. Vallone wrote, noting that the museum receives about $9 million annually from the city.But in announcing the show’s cancellation on Tuesday, the museum cited cutbacks, not political pressure. “This is an exhibition about which we were tremendously enthusiastic,” Mr. Lehman said in a statement. “The cancellation became necessary due to the current financial climate.”One of the featured artists, a street artist based in Los Angeles named Saber, said that he was disappointed the show would not go to Brooklyn, but that Mr. Lehman and the Brooklyn Museum’s curator, Sharon Matt Atkins, had been receptive. “Maybe there are some things going on behind the scenes that we don’t know about,” Saber said, but “the people who work there — the director, Sharon — they’re all really enthusiastic, great people.”'"
"'11-06-22,'0','Demonstrators describing themselves as “angry jobless citizens” said they would picket the Capitol on Wednesday to urge members of Congress to use any savings from Mr. Obama’s troop reductions to create more jobs. The group sponsoring the demonstration, the Prayer Without Ceasing Party, said in a statement on Tuesday that it was “urging the masses to call their congressmen and the president to ensure that jobs receive a top priority when the troops start returning to America.”Spending on the war in Afghanistan has skyrocketed since Mr. Obama took office, to $118.6 billion in 2011. It was $14.7 billion in 2003, when President turned his attention and American resources to the war in Iraq.The increase is easy to explain. When Mr. Obama took office, he vowed to aggressively pursue what he termed America’s “war of necessity” (Afghanistan) and to withdraw from America’s “war of choice” (Iraq). He has done so; the lines on Iraq and Afghanistan war spending crossed in 2010, when the spent $93.8 billion in Afghanistan versus $71.3 billion in Iraq, according to the Congressional Research Service.But the White House is keenly aware that the president is heading into a re-election campaign; with the country’s jobless rate remaining high, topping 9 percent, his poll numbers on his handling of the domestic economy have plummeted.“Do we really need to be spending $120 billion in a country with a G.D.P. that’s one-sixth that size?” asked Brian Katulis, a national security expert at the Center for American Progress, a policy group with close ties to the Obama administration. “Most Americans would be shocked to know that we’re spending that kind of money for jobs programs for former , and would wonder where are our jobs programs for and Cleveland?”In 2010, Congress — at the Obama administration’s request — set aside $100 million to support programs in Afghanistan aimed at moving former insurgents off the battlefields and into the country’s mainstream economy. Those efforts — similar to what the Bush administration did in Iraq — have yet to bear much fruit; the 1,700 fighters who have enrolled in the reintegration program represent only a fraction of the estimated 20,000 to 40,000 Taliban insurgents, reported Monday.Most American aid bypasses the Afghan government and goes to international companies, a practice that, according to a June 8 report by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, can undercut the Afghan government and lead to redundant and unsustainable donor projects. But Obama administration officials complain that the Afghan government of President has, thus far, been unwilling to tackle corruption in any meaningful way, making it hard to argue that it should get more money directly.In Washington, the argument over whether the United States should be building bridges in Kandahar or Cleveland is bound to grow even louder as the 2012 election campaign heats up.After Senator Manchin made his speech on Tuesday calling for an end to nation-building in Afghanistan, Senator , Republican of , took to the floor to rebuke him, calling Mr. Manchin’s remarks characteristic of the “isolationist-withdrawal-lack-of-knowledge-of-history attitude that seems to be on the rise.”But in Mr. McCain’s own , which has historically been more supportive of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars than Democrats, there is clearly some queasiness about war spending during a period of economic distress.Four years ago, Representative of was the only Republican presidential candidate raising concerns about the costs of the Afghanistan or Iraq wars. But last week, Mr. Paul was joined explicitly by another contender, , the former governor of and the Obama administration’s former ambassador to , who said that the cost of a continued military presence was a leading factor in his belief that a major troop drawdown should begin in Afghanistan.“Very expensive boots on the ground may be something that is not critical for our national security needs,” Mr. Huntsman said.Even when Mr. Obama does withdraw the bulk of troops from Afghanistan, Americans will still be footing the bill for years, argued William R. Keylor, an international relations professor at .“The total cost of the war, the longest in American history and one that was paid for by borrowing rather than by increased taxation, should not be measured solely by the costs of financing the troops and the extensive aid programs administered by the State Department,” Mr. Keylor said. “It should also include long-term costs of the war, primarily veterans’ benefits for the returning soldiers, who will require medical and services for many years to come. Long after the last troops depart from the country, that hidden part of the bill will come due.”'"
"'11-06-22,'0','“Infosys is a large and rapidly growing company,” the statement said. “We have made changes over time to certain of our policies relating to the business visa program and we may continue to make improvements in those policies and controls.”The Infosys inquiry coincides with a broader attack in Congress on longer-term visas, known as H-1B, that Infosys and other Indian companies rely on to bring Indian technology workers to the United States. With unemployment for Americans stubbornly high, lawmakers have become increasingly reluctant to defend H-1B visas, which give temporary residence to highly skilled foreigners. In recent years, the top companies receiving those visas were not American names, but Infosys and another big Indian outsourcing company, Wipro.Last week, Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the senior Democrat on the immigration subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill that would increase the wages employers would have to pay H-1B workers, in an effort to ensure they do not undercut Americans. The measure is specifically aimed at Indian outsourcing companies. Last year, Congress added an extra $2,000 to the fee for H-1B visas, in another move aimed at the Indian companies.Yet the criminal investigation is perhaps the most worrisome development for Infosys, which enjoys a reputation as one of India’s best-run and most respected companies. The events began with Mr. Palmer, 43, a project manager from Alabama who was hired by the company in 2008. In a sworn affidavit he submitted to the federal court, Mr. Palmer said his differences with Infosys management began after he was summoned to a meeting in Bangalore in March 2010. Top executives, he said, discussed ways to “creatively” get around H-1B visa limitations “to fulfill the high demand for its customers at lower cost.”In general, B-1 visas are granted to business visitors coming to the United States for short stays to attend meetings, conferences or training sessions, or to install specialized equipment. Visitors may not be employed for contract work like H-1B workers, nor can they be paid salaries in this country. There is no annual limit on business visitor visas, whereas H-1B visas are restricted to 85,000 a year.Mr. Palmer said his supervisors asked him to write letters inviting workers to come from India for sales and training meetings, letters he believed were false. “I refused to write the letters,” he said.After word got out of his refusal, Mr. Palmer said, he was chastised by his managers and began to receive threats by e-mail and telephone. In October, Infosys has confirmed, Mr. Palmer filed a whistle-blower report about B-1 visa holders from India assigned to projects he or others managed. His report said the B-1 visa holders were doing the same tasks as workers on H-1B visas, including writing and testing software code. Mr. Palmer said he personally knew of at least 60 Indian workers doing contract work on B-1 visas.Mr. Palmer still works at Infosys. He feels isolated and besieged within the company, according to Kenneth Mendelsohn, his lawyer in Montgomery, who has instructed him not to speak publicly about his experience.“I’m protecting him as best I can so Infosys doesn’t fire him,” Mr. Mendelsohn said. But Mr. Mendelsohn provided documents and e-mails that he said Mr. Palmer has shared with investigators from the State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department.In one e-mail, another Infosys manager confirmed to Mr. Palmer that three Indians on B-1 visas were “working on client sites” on a contract with Baker Hughes, an oil services company in Houston.In an e-mail exchange with Jeffrey Friedel, a top lawyer for Infosys, Mr. Palmer described the work assigned to one B-1 visa holder on a project for Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search company in Chicago. “His project task consists of reviewing designs and then to physically create and write test scripts,” Mr. Palmer wrote. “This process is repeated over many weeks.”Referring to the same employee, another manager wrote that he was “working on a B-1 visa” and cautioned his colleagues not to include the man’s name in any contracts. “We can’t put name on B-1 people for contract,” the manager wrote.In an e-mail in December, Mr. Friedel assured Mr. Palmer that the issues he had raised “have made it clear to management that certain changes need to be made to our systems.” Mr. Friedel enumerated seven steps the company would take to prevent misuse of visitor visas.But only this month, another Infosys manager became alarmed after discovering by chance that B-1 workers were among the team members on a project under the manager’s supervision. “There was no significant difference between the B-1 and the H-1B employees in the type of work they did,” the manager, who was granted anonymity out of fears of retaliation by the company, said in an interview.At least one of Infosys’ major clients, Wal-Mart, has been contacted by investigators about its contracts with Infosys. Greg Rossiter, a Wal-Mart spokesman, declined to comment. There has been no suggestion of wrongdoing by any Infosys client mentioned in the visa investigations.A State Department official in India said Infosys and other Indian companies had made use in recent years of an exception in the complex visa guidelines that allows them to send workers to the United States on B-1 visas for up to six months for certain short-term projects that might otherwise have required an H-1B visa. Since last year, the State Department has clamped down on the use of that exception and is considering whether to eliminate it, the official and several outsourcing executives in India said.Mr. Palmer, who is known as Jay, filed his lawsuit claiming that Infosys had failed to protect him from threats from within the company he received after submitting his whistle-blower report, and had unfairly withheld more than $100,000 in bonuses he was owed. Described by his lawyer, Mr. Mendelsohn, as “on an emotional roller coaster,” Mr. Palmer has reported receiving a new death threat against himself and his family as recently as April.While denying Mr. Palmer’s claims, Infosys has noted that Indian employees with business visitor visas are a small part — less than 2 percent — of its teams in the United States. The company reports a total of 15,500 employees in this country, including 10,100 on H-1B visas. North American clients account for 65 percent of the company’s revenue.At least one top Indian executive overseeing United States immigration procedures has resigned from the company, Infosys said.But Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee who closely monitors United States visa programs, said he remained skeptical of Infosys’s intentions.“It appears the B-1 visa program has become a subterfuge for companies wanting to avoid the cap and wage requirements of the H-1B visa,” Mr. Grassley said.'"
"'11-06-22,'0','House members of both parties and various political stripes seemed undaunted. Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, a Democrat of Ohio, will offer an amendment to a Pentagon spending bill to deny money for operations in Libya, as will Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, a Republican freshman.“I’m more worried that we’re sending the signal to the world that we’ve abandoned our Constitution and our principles,” Mr. Amash said. “I think public opinion has shifted, opinion within the Republican Party has shifted, and their view is clearly in the minority right now.”On Tuesday, Representative Joe Heck, a freshman Republican from Nevada and an Army reservist, introduced a bill that would cut off funds for the Libya mission within 30 days. The House is expected to vote on the McCain-Kerry bill this week, and is also likely to vote on a measure to end all involvement in Libya.The antipathy toward the operations in Libya stems in part from President Obama’s refusal to seek authorization from Congress for the activities, as required by the 1973 War Powers Resolution.But the rationale against operations in Libya extends to costs — expected to top $1 billion by the end of the fiscal year — and a belief among many lawmakers that American involvement in international conflicts should be limited to those where American interests are clearly defined. “We have to get away from occupation, nation-building-style warfare,” Representative Allen West, a Florida Republican and a Tea Party star, told ABC News.This sentiment appears to extend to some Republican candidates for president, like Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, the chairwoman of the House Tea Party caucus, who has called the Libya campaign “President Obama’s war.”The intransigence among House Republicans — scores of whom voted for a measure earlier this month, also offered by Mr. Kucinich, ordering a United States withdrawal from Libya — is enraging many conservatives in the Senate and beyond.“Tea Party critics of America’s current military operations should look at how well served Congressional Republicans were in the 1990s by opposing intervention in the Balkans,” said Daniel Senor, a former Bush administration official and one of 37 conservatives to sign a letter to Congress on Monday urging members not to cut financing for the Libya operation.There is a long history of both Democrats and Republicans adopting neo-isolationist views when their party is out of the White House. Democrats criticized President Ronald Reagan’s support for the Nicaraguan contras and El Salvador’s government, and fewer than a third of Democrats in Congress voted to authorize the Persian Gulf war in 1991 under President George Bush.In the 1990s, Tom DeLay, then the House majority leader, called the Kosovo operation “Clinton’s war,” and most Senate Republicans voted against a bombing campaign in that war. Conservatives also charged that President Bill Clinton’s 1998 strikes in Iraq were meant to distract attention from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. “Sadly, this is pretty standard,” Mr. Senor said, “however irresponsible it may be.”But the disagreements over Libya have made for some odd bedfellows, including antiwar lawmakers like Mr. Kucinich and right-of-center representatives, as well as strong Democratic supporters of the president alongside Republican hawks.While not all lawmakers linked to the Tea Party are cut from the same cloth — indeed, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, one of the early Tea Party darlings, has much in common with Mr. McCain — the strong libertarian streak underlies some of the alliances.  “This is a determined group of people who are not going along with business as usual,” Mr. Kucinich said. “They are principled and see the Constitution as being among the first principles.”There also appears to be a generational divide. The freshman class “has come of age during two wars that were not going so well,” said Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who also signed the letter to the House. “They did not live through the cold war, and they do not have the sort of Republican internationalist tendencies that were developed in the Reagan years that was kept going through two Bush presidencies.”Mr. Amash, 31, noted that the Afghan war had gone on “almost a third of my life,” and agreed that newer members “have a greater sense that we need to worry more about our own affairs at home and stop trying to police the entire world.”'"

"'11-06-22,'0','Global stocks rallied and the euro rose on Tuesday on growing optimism that Greece would be able to hold off a debt default ahead of a vote of confidence in the Greek government.The vote, held after markets had closed in the United States, was a crucial hurdle that Greece had to clear to avert a debt default. As expected, Parliament reaffirmed its confidence in the administration of Prime Minister George Papandreou in the early morning vote in Athens on Wednesday.World stocks had tumbled almost 8 percent from three-year highs in early May as the threat of a disorderly restructuring of Greek debt shook global markets and banking shares in Europe and elsewhere.Euro zone finance ministers said the Greek government had until July 3 to approve reforms to get the next installment of 110 billion euros ($157 billion) in aid from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.“There is increased optimism that one, the prime minister will survive the confidence motion tonight and two, that will pave the way for austerity measures to be passed,” said Nick Stamenkovic, a strategist at RIA Capital Markets in London.'"
"'11-06-22,'0','The police in Britain have arrested a 19-year-old man in connection with digital attacks on businesses and government agencies “by a single hacking group,” the Metropolitan Police said Tuesday in a statement.The police did not identify the man or the hacking organization. Suspicion immediately fell on two groups: Anonymous, a shadowy international network of computer hackers, and Lulz Security, a group that has claimed responsibility in recent weeks for attacks on the Web sites of the Central Intelligence Agency and the United States Senate as well as on Sony and, on Monday, the Web site of a British agency that combats organized crime.The arrest resulted from a joint investigation by a British cybercrime unit, the local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into attacks on “a number of international business and intelligence agencies,” the police said, without naming specific targets.British police officials said the man was being questioned in a London police station and was suspected of violating several British computer and fraud laws. After his arrest, they said, officers searched a home in Wickford, about 35 miles north of London, and turned up material that was under examination. They said the search was conducted late Monday night; the time of the arrest was not made clear.Attacks this spring on the Web sites of several companies, including Sony and Bethesda Softworks, a video game developer, exploited holes in Internet security systems that are meant to protect hundreds of thousands of private user accounts. In a letter posted last week, Lulz Security said that it planned to mount further attacks on government and corporate Web sites, and that its attacks were meant to improve privacy protections on the Web by exposing lax security.But the letter also outlined some expanded ambitions. “Top priority is to steal and leak any classified government information,” the group wrote, adding that it was now teaming up with Anonymous. “Prime targets are banks and other high-ranking establishments.”'"

"'11-06-23,'0','To put that in perspective, spending cuts and tax increases of a similar scale in the would amount to $1.75 trillion, considerably more sweeping than even the most far-reaching proposals for reducing the American deficit. And Greece has promised to generate another $72 billion by selling off prime state assets, which many Greeks consider a fire sale of national patrimony.While the commitment to austerity will allow Greece access to a fresh infusion of international aid, a growing chorus of economists say that the government’s new program will at best delay default and a restructuring of its debt, which is already more than 150 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. Steeper budget cuts and tax increases, they say, are the enemy of economic growth, which Greece desperately needs to make its debt burden lighter.“You cannot keep on milking the cow without feeding it,” said Konstantinos Mihalos, the president of the Hellenic Chamber of Commerce in Athens.In fact many economists fear Greece has already entered a “debt trap,” where paying the interest on its mound of debt requires more and more . “The Greeks have been told to accept more of the medicine that has already failed to treat the disease,” said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in .The Greeks have already reduced their deficit by five percentage points of the gross domestic product, “unprecedented cuts in a modern economy,” Mr. Tilford said. “But the cuts have had a much stronger negative impact on the economy than the troika imagined, and fiscal austerity has pushed the economy deep into recession. Debt can only be paid out of income, and that means growth.”Greece does not have access to many tools to fight recession, like devaluing its currency or cutting interest rates, at least as long as it remains a member of zone. Its monetary policy is controlled by the European Central Bank.Some independent economists accept that Greece has no choice but to try a fresh round of cuts. Edwin M. Truman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in said Greece had to go through more pain because it had run a budget deficit even before making payments on its debt, meaning it needed loans to pay off its loans.Only after Greece reorganizes its budget, tax collection and labor market and is running a surplus — not including interest payments on the debt — can economists begin to calculate how much in debt payments Greece is actually able to afford, and then figure out how big a debt restructuring it needs.“As long as they’re running a primary deficit, they need to keep tightening the belt,” Mr. Truman said. “Rescheduling now doesn’t relieve Greece of the burden of fixing the economy to create a surplus.”It is not getting any easier. In the year since its first bailout, Greece has cut $17 billion through across-the-board wage cuts, layoffs and attrition in its bloated state sector, which employs 800,000 people, a quarter of the Greek work force. But given its recession, the economy shrank and tax revenues fell, meaning that Greece did not meet the original target of a government deficit of 9.1 percent of G.D.P. as agreed with its foreign lenders, prompting them to demand more cuts.European demands have placed Mr. Papandreou in an increasingly untenable position. He must sell the increasingly restive Greek people on more austerity with no clear signs of recovery. And he has to persuade his Socialist Party on reforms that undo almost everything the party has stood for in the past.At least one Socialist member of , Alexandros Athanasiadis, has already announced that he will not vote for the new austerity measures, citing his opposition to selling part of the state’s stake in the electricity utility whose power plants dominate his district in northeastern Greece.On Wednesday, members of the public power company union, Genop, occupied the Transport Ministry and orchestrated some power failures to protest the sale, which seeks to reduce the state’s stake to 34 percent from 51 percent in the profitable company.To many Greeks, selling that and many other state-owned companies and assets, even those that currently lose money, is tantamount to a loss of sovereignty — especially if wealthy investors from and the other big European powers pushing austerity of Greece end up purchasing the assets for a hefty discount.“We’ve always been advocates of privatization because the national state cannot play the role of the entrepreneur and has in fact proven to be a complete disaster every time they attempt to do so,” said Mr. Mihalos of the Athens Chamber of Commerce.“But at these extremely low levels, especially for those companies quoted on the stock exchange, we have to be very wary,” he added. “If we go by today’s values, as a result of the recession and the crisis the country finds itself in, it will be really selling the crown jewels at a pittance of their cost.”Mr. Papandreou’s government has not managed to make a convincing case for the sell-off to many Greeks, where the idea of a fire sale has taken hold, setting off a wave of national indignation. “Imagine if you asked me for my apartment, and I gave you the whole building,” said Dorothea Ekonomopoulou, a public school teacher in Athens, as she stood among demonstrators in Syntagma Square this week.'"
"'11-06-23,'0','Derivatives traders and analysts are debating just how much money is involved in these contracts and what sort of threat they pose to markets in Europe and the United States. On the one hand, just over $5 billion is tied up in contracts that will pay out if defaults, according to Markit, a financial data firm based in . That is less than 1 percent the size of Greece’s economy, but that is a conservative calculation that counts protections banks have in place offsetting their positions, and is called the net exposure.The less conservative figure, the gross exposure, is $78.7 billion for Greece, according to Markit. And there are many other types of contracts, like about $44 billion in other guarantees tied to Greece, according to the Bank of International Settlements. The gross exposure of the five most financially pressed countries — , , , Greece and — is about $616 billion. And the broader figure on all derivatives from those countries is unknown.The pervasiveness of these opaque contracts has complicated negotiations for European officials, and it underscores calls for more transparency in the derivatives market.The uncertainty, financial analysts say, has led European officials to push for a “voluntary” Greek bond financing solution that may sidestep a default, rather than the forced deals of other eras. “There’s not any clarity here because people don’t know,” said Christopher Whalen, editor of The Institutional Risk Analyst. “This is why the Europeans came up with this ridiculous deal, because they don’t know what’s out there. They are afraid of a default. The industry is still refusing to provide the disclosure needed to understand this. They’re holding us hostage. The Street doesn’t want you to see what they’ve written.”Regulators are aware of this problem. Financial reform packages on both sides of the Atlantic mandated many changes to the derivatives market, and regulators around the globe are drafting new rules for these contracts that are meant to add transparency as well as security. But they are far from finished and could take years to put into effect.Darrell Duffie, a professor who has studied derivatives at the Graduate School of Business at , said that he was concerned that regulators may not have adequately studied what contagion might occur among swaps holders, in the case of a Greek default.Regulators, he said, “have access to everything they need to have. Whether they’ve collected all the information and analyzed it is different question. I worry because many of those leaders have said there’s no way we’re going to let Greece default. Does that mean they haven’t had conversations about what happens if Greece defaults? Is their commitment so severe that they haven’t had real discussions about it in the backrooms?”Regulators aren’t saying much. When asked what data the Federal Reserve had collected on American financial companies and their swaps tied to European debt, Barbara Hagenbaugh, a spokeswoman, referred to a speech made by Mr. Bernanke in May in which he did not mention derivatives tied to Greece. At the Wednesday press conference, Mr. Bernanke said that commonly cited data on derivatives do not take into account the offsetting positions banks have on their Greek exposures. And with those positions, he said, even if there is a Greek default, “the effects are very small.”At the , Eszter Miltenyi, a spokeswoman, said: “This is much too sensitive I think for us to have a conversation on this.”On Wall Street, traders are debating whether the industry’s process for unwinding credit-default swaps would run smoothly if Greece defaulted. The process is tightly controlled by a small group of bankers who meet in an industry group called the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.The process is fairly well developed, but it has been little tested on the debt of countries. For the most part, Wall Street has cashed in on credit-default swaps tied to corporations’ debt.For most purposes, determining whether a default occurred in a country’s debt falls to ratings agencies like and . But for the derivatives market, a committee of I.S.D.A. makes the call.If the committee decides there was a default, it passes the baton to Markit, which is partly owned by the banks. Markit holds an auction to determine how much value has been lost on the debt, and that determines how much money is paid out to the parties that purchased the insurance.Marc Barrachin, who runs the auctions, said there was no reason to worry about the process.“The process is very smooth, very well understood by market participants,” said Mr. Barrachin, the director of credit products at Markit. “I mean if you go back to 2008 right in the fall, in five days we had auctions for , and , and two weeks after that you had . I go back to that period of stress and the orderly settlements of large amounts of credit derivatives, for names that were widely followed, were testament of the efficiency of the auction system.”In the case of A.I.G., there was not an unwind process run by I.S.D.A. because A.I.G.’s contracts were tied to mortgage bonds. Those sorts of derivatives pay out money over time, whereas derivatives tied to a country’s debt pay out on one occasion: if a default occurs. That makes sovereign derivatives more similar to derivatives on corporate bonds and different in some ways from the situation at A.I.G.But the smoothness of the process would be irrelevant if the risk were concentrated in just a few weak institutions.The uncertainty around how a sovereign default would course through the derivatives market had greatly increased the price premiums banks were charging to put on new derivatives trades related to European countries. As of last week, the price to insure against default on $10 million of Greek debt was $1.9 million per year, up from $775,000 a year ago, according to Markit.“There is lack of transparency and visibility in these products, and that increases the risk,” said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, a boutique banking firm in New York.'"

"'11-06-23,'0','E. M. Broner, a writer who explored the double marginalization of being Jewish and female, producing a body of fiction and nonfiction that placed her in the vanguard of Jewish feminist letters, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 83.The cause was multiple organ failure as a result of an infection, her daughter Nahama said.Ms. Broner (her surname rhymes with “owner”) was among the first writers to consider feminism and Judaism as parts of a seamless if difficult-to-integrate whole. While her work was often likened to that of postwar feminist novelists like Doris Lessing, Marge Piercy and Marilyn French, it was distinguished by its specifically Jewish focus.In that respect, Ms. Broner was sometimes compared to Grace Paley, whose fiction also centered on modern Jewish women. But where Ms. Paley’s work was steeped in secular progressivism, Ms. Broner’s was intensely concerned with Jewish spirituality, and with carving out a place for women in a faith tradition that had long seemed not to want them.One of Ms. Broner’s most influential books was “The Women’s Haggadah,” written with Naomi Nimrod. Originally published in Ms. magazine in 1977 — at the time no book publisher would touch it, Ms. Broner explained in interviews — it was one of the first Haggadot to recast the Passover seder from a feminist vantage point. It was issued in book form by HarperSanFrancisco in 1994.“The Women’s Haggadah” has inspired feminist seders throughout the world. Ms. Broner’s own women’s seder, held in New York since 1976 (often in her Manhattan apartment), was regularly attended by luminaries including Ms. Paley, Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug and Letty Cottin Pogrebin.'"
"'11-06-23,'0','As the nation has grown weary over the cost and toll of war, fault lines have emerged among Republicans, with the longstanding isolationist strain regaining its footing after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the adventurism of the George W. Bush era.The aggressive posture adopted by the president, particularly in pulling out troops faster than Pentagon advisers recommended, could open a discussion in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail. Republicans now hold an array of positions, from the budget-minded focus of the Tea Party movement to the stay-the-course view of the party’s 2008 nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, to other internationalist Republicans who fear the party has lost its way.Mr. McCain has emerged as the leading critic of Mr. Obama’s decision on Afghanistan, but his views are muted by the many Republican presidential candidates who have expressed a desire to end the war as soon as possible.Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former Utah governor who recently stepped down as the ambassador to China, is trying to build his Republican presidential campaign around his foreign policy experience, which included positions in both Bush administrations. Four years ago, he was Mr. McCain’s co-chairman, but now is seeking to distinguish himself on Afghanistan by raising questions about whether the country can afford it.“It is time we move to a focused counterterror effort, which requires significantly fewer boots on the ground than the president discussed tonight,” Mr. Huntsman said.Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota, has emerged as one of the party’s few candidates who are cautioning against an abrupt withdrawal in Afghanistan. “I’m concerned about what appears to be a drift toward minimalism and isolationism inside the Republican Party,” Mr. Pawlenty said Wednesday in an interview. “But it’s really important to make sure that we finish the job correctly in Afghanistan.”Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who has conducted focus groups to gauge public opinion of the war, said the multiple messages among Republicans would benefit Mr. Obama.For Mr. Obama, his prime-time announcement was the latest in a series of defining moments in his presidency. Four years ago, in the early stage of his political rise, he positioned himself as a strong opponent of the Iraq war. After he took office, he began delivering on his pledge to end the war. But he chose to build up efforts in Afghanistan, infuriating many Democrats by sending 30,000 more troops.On Wednesday night, the president found himself in a position where he could announce what has always been a priority of Democrats — and of Mr. Obama himself when he first took office: “America,” he said, “it is time to focus on nation-building here at home.” It is something that is surely going to help him with Democratic base voters who had been concerned that he had strayed too far from his promises since passing a new health care law.Now the position is harder for Republicans to attack, since they, too, are describing the fighting in Afghanistan as an expense the country can no longer afford.This week, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found for the first time that a majority of Americans — 56 percent — favored removing troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible, an increase of eight percentage points from a poll taken in May after Bin Laden’s death. Two-thirds of Democrats and nearly six in 10 independents support withdrawal, while 53 percent of Republicans favor maintaining troop strength — 12 percentage points lower than a year ago.While predicting what will influence a presidential election is dicey more than a year in advance, the slow recovery and persistently high unemployment suggest that the 2012 election will be focused on the economy, not war. But the complicating dynamic for Mr. Obama is that the nearly decade-old war in Afghanistan has become an economic issue for many Americans.“There are huge economic concerns about where the money is going, a realization that we’re basically defending the world and can’t show better results for it,” said former Senator Tom Daschle, who was the Democratic Senate leader after the 2001 terrorist attacks, when Democrats deferred to President Bush for fear of being labeled weak against terrorism. At the time, it was unthinkable in Congress or among the general public to question the war’s added cost.“The whole burden for this has been on a very, very small percentage of people, so no one has really felt the effects of this war,” Mr. Daschle said.Barring another major terrorist attack, Democrats say, Mr. Obama has to show at least a significant reduction in troops overseas by Election Day.“Today’s announcement is a start, but not enough. Retaining most of our 100,000 troops in Afghanistan is simply delaying the inevitable,” said Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon. “Given the recent death of Osama bin Laden, our budgetary constraints and the questionable effectiveness of our nation-building efforts in Afghanistan, now is the time to begin a significant withdrawal of U.S. troops.”'"
"'11-06-23,'0','PHOENIX — A jury found James A. Ray, a self-help guru, guilty of negligent homicide on Wednesday in the deaths of three of his followers during a botched sweat lodge ceremony near Sedona in October 2009.The decision, delivered after a nearly four-month trial in Yavapai County Superior Court in Camp Verde, Ariz., means Mr. Ray was found to have caused the deaths of Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, N.Y.; James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee; and Liz Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minn., but did not necessarily recognize the risk he put them in. He could face anywhere from probation to more than 30 years in prison on the three guilty counts as court proceedings continue next week.The prosecutor, Sheila Polk, had pursued a more serious charge of manslaughter, arguing that Mr. Ray should have known that the way he ran the two-hour ceremony, in which hot stones were piled in the center of the sweltering lodge, risked death and that he disregarded that risk.The case drew international attention, largely because of the bizarre circumstances and because the deaths took place at a pristine campground within sight of the red rocks of Sedona, a well-known New Age gathering place.A motivational speaker and author, Mr. Ray seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when he was found not guilty on the first manslaughter charge. But he looked stunned a moment later when the guilty verdicts came in. Watching the verdict were relatives of Mr. Ray as well as family members and friends of the victims, many of them holding hands as the decision was read.After the verdicts, Ms. Polk asked Judge Warren R.

"'11-06-23,'0','Now Mr. Venizelos, 54, a constitutional lawyer with minimal economic policy-making experience, must persuade Parliament next week to pass the government’s most recent economic plan — centered largely on a 50 billion euro, or $72 billion, privatization effort. That is the requirement imposed by Europe and the International Monetary Fund to make an immediate cash payment and to allow Greece to qualify for a second batch of rescue money needed to stave off default.More crucially, he must succeed in doing what no other politician in Greece has done before him: persuade Greeks to pay their taxes and get public sector unions to accept the shrinking of the state.“He is a political animal and he will cut the privatization Gordian knot because he knows the law and the political tricks of how to get the job done,” said Theodore Pelagidis, an Athens-based economist and one of Mr. Venizelos’s top advisers.Mr. Pelagidis cites Mr. Venizelos’s experience in negotiating a deal with the powerful electricity unions and his role as minister in charge of putting on the 2004 Olympics as examples of Mr. Venizelos’s ability to get things done.That said, there is a difference between operating in Athens and Brussels, especially now.Arriving for his first meeting with fellow European finance ministers in Luxembourg on Sunday night, Mr. Venizelos misjudged the mood, according to several European diplomats briefed on the discussions but not authorized to speak publicly.According to one person, he seriously underestimated the frustration among his European colleagues at Greece’s failure to honor some of its previous pledges.The new minister began by trying to explain the limitations Greece faced, a stance interpreted by some ministers as an attempt to reopen the austerity package already negotiated.That prompted several firm responses after which Mr. Venizelos recalibrated his message, according to another diplomat. He was, however, largely sidelined when the ministers’ communiqué was drafted.In Greece, by contrast, he is thoroughly plugged in. He was most recently defense minister and has had other Cabinet posts including culture, justice and transport — a political résumé that far exceeds that of his predecessor, George Papaconstantinou, whose rapid fall in stature within his party forced the prime minister to call on Mr. Venizelos last week.It was in many ways a last resort. Having been turned down by Lucas Papademos, the former vice president of the European Central Bank, and several other prominent economic experts, Mr. Papandreou made his offer in a 3 a.m. phone call last Friday.This reluctance was steeped in politics. In 2007, Mr. Venizelos unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Papandreou for the party leadership and since then he had not been among the prime minister’s close circle of advisers.But Greek analysts say the divide may be deeper than that. Mr. Venizelos’s stature in the party dates back to the early 1990s, when he won renown as the lawyer who successfully fought corruption charges against Andreas Papandreou, George’s father, who is still remembered as a hugely popular, if controversial, prime minister during the 1980s and part of the 1990s. The elder Papandreou then persuaded his lawyer to enter politics, and he became one of his closest advisers, rivaling even George in his political influence.Nevertheless, unlike George Papandreou, he is not seen as a tribal Pasok politician, ever eager to pander to the party’s powerful union base whenever times get tough.“He is in the party, but he is not of the party,” Mr. Pelagidis said. “He is a bit of an outsider.”Unlike most Greek politicians, he went to a state school. Friends and associates say that he leads a spartan, workaholic existence — eschewing, for example, the holiday home on a nearby Greek island that is de rigueur for much of the Athens elite.And while he has the thrusting ambition of the politician pushing for the top, his less ideological bent allows him the opportunity to hear an opposing view.“He is a clever politician, but he also knows how to listen,” said Yannis Stournaras, an economist in Athens who has worked with Mr. Venizelos in the past.Mr. Papandreou’s political standing has been weakened considerably after his botched offer last week to step down from his job in favor of a unity government. Mr. Venizelos, as both deputy prime minister and chief economic adviser, will be the prime minister’s domestic point man and also possibly the future leader of Greece — if Mr. Papandreou, as many suspect, is forced to call a new election within the next few months and steps aside as head of Pasok.People who have spoken to Mr. Venizelos say he plans to distinguish himself from Mr. Papaconstantinou by focusing less on increasing taxes to raise revenue and more on revitalizing the beaten-down construction and tourism sectors that are so crucial to the Greek economy.But such efforts, crucial as they may be over the longer run, will do little to halt the rapid deterioration of the budget deficit. Through May, it was higher than it was last year, confounding the promise made by Greece that its budget deficit this year will improve over last year’s 10 percent of G.D.P. And without at least 50 billion in aid from Europe, Greece is expected to run out of money by April 2012.That’s why the privatization effort is so important, analysts say. Mr. Venizelos has told associates that a first priority is for the finance ministry is to hire more lawyers to navigate the thicket of rules and regulations governing asset sales in Greece.For all the hopes invested in Mr. Venizelos, most economists say it is simply too late to stave off bankruptcy by following the prescription laid down by the European Union, the I.M.F. and the European Central Bank. In Athens, though, many people argue that if he can’t do it, nobody can.“Venizelos will sell the troika policies better than anybody else,” said Vassilis Karatzas, a fund manager based in Athens. “I think this is the most positive development of the last two years.”'"
"'11-06-23,'0','Some professional editors are already insisting that Apple has made exactly the same mistake with Final Cut X; they pointed out various flaws with the program after an earlier version of this column was posted online on Wednesday. They say the new program is missing high-end features like the ability to edit multiple camera angles, to export to tape, to burn anything more than rudimentary DVDs and to work with EDL, XML and OMF files (used to exchange projects with other programs). You can use a second computer monitor, but you need new TV-output drivers to attach an external video monitor. You can’t change the settings of your exported QuickTime movies without the $50 Compressor program.Apple admits that version X is a “foundational piece.” It says that it will restore some of these features over time, and that other companies are rapidly filling in the other holes.For nonprofessionals, meanwhile, Final Cut is already tempting — especially because the price is $300, not $1,000. It’s the first Apple program that’s available only by download from the online Mac App Store, not on DVD. All of the programs formerly called Final Cut Studio have been rolled into Final Cut except Motion and Compressor, which are sold separately. Final Cut Express and DVD Studio Pro are gone.)The new Final Cut has been radically redesigned. In fact, it looks and works a lot like iMovie, all dark gray, with “skimming” available; you run your cursor over a clip without pressing the mouse button to play it.Once you’re past the shock of the new layout, the first thing you’ll notice is that Apple has left most of the old Final Cut’s greatest annoyances on the cutting-room floor.First — and this is huge — there’s no more waiting to “render.” You no longer sit there, dead in the water, while the software computes the changes, locking up the program in the meantime, every time you add an effect or insert a piece of video that’s in a different format. Final Cut X renders in the background, so you can keep right on editing. You cannot, however, organize your files or delete clips during rendering.Second, in the old Final Cut, it was all too easy to drag the audio and video of a clip out of sync accidentally; little “-1” or “+10” indicators, showing how many frames off you were, were a chronic . But in the new Final Cut, “sync is holy,” as Apple puts it. Primary audio and video are always synced, and you can even lock other clips together so that they all move as one.In fact, an ingenious feature called Compound Clips lets you collapse a stack of audio and video clips into a single, merged filmstrip on the timeline. You can adjust it, move it and apply effects as if it were a single unit, and then un-merge it anytime you like. Compound Clips make it simple to manage with a complicated composition without going quietly insane.In the old Final Cut, if you dragged Clip A so that it overlapped part of Clip B, even briefly, you wound up chopping away the covered-up piece of Clip B. But now, the timeline sprouts enough new parallel “tracks” to keep both of the overlapping clips. Nothing gets chopped unless you do it yourself.There are new features, too. The Auditions feature lets you compare alternative shots in the timeline, trying them out without having to place them individually. This is great if you’re sitting with a client or director, asking for input. Color Match does an impressive job making the overall color cast of one clip (a broad-daylight shot, for example) match the lighting of another (say, a sunset scene).You can adjust the playback speed of a clip — slow-mo, fast-mo, whatever — just by pressing a key and then dragging the clip’s right edge, so that it occupies a longer or shorter chunk of the timeline. It’s visual, immediate and render-free.The new Timeline Index presents a tidy, clickable chronological list of everything in your movie: clip names, markers, clip keywords and so on.Like iMovie, Final Cut can analyze newly imported video and figure out which shots have people in them — one person, two people, group shots — and put them into virtual folders automatically. You can also apply keywords to any portion of any clip —“Closeup,” “ ,” whatever; the program puts keyworded clips into appropriately named virtual folders, too. Final Cut can also stabilize shaky footage during the import process, and even eliminate hums or hisses in your audio.The bottom line: The rewritten Final Cut is much, much easier to use than the old one, and its immediacy keeps your creative flow going.But not everyone will fall in love. Switching to the new Final Cut from the old one is like coming home from college to discover that your parents remodeled your bedroom. Longtime Final Cut jockeys, in particular, may grind their teeth for a few days — and not just because they have to pay $300 for the “upgrade,” same as newcomers.Here’s one example. The new “magnetic timeline” works like iMovie’s; your clips always snap to the left, leaving no gaps. You can no longer freely park clips temporarily off to the right, using the timeline as a workspace.Also, the fact that Final Cut is much less intimidating may be a bitter pill to swallow for professionals who have sweated blood to master the old version. Online, some early adopters are already cursing how “consumer-y” the new program looks.Video editing screams out for horsepower. Final Cut is now a 64-bit program, meaning it can exploit Macs with more than 4 gigabytes of memory for even better speed. And you’ll need it; on even medium-powered Macs, scrolling and dragging operations can get laggy.I also ran into a bunch of typical first-release bugs. Don’t entrust your next entry to this program until Apple produces the inevitable bug-fix patch.The biggest disappointment is that Final Cut X can’t open old Final Cut projects. They’re now orphaned, stuck forever in the old program. Apple says the of the new program is too different from the old one. Well, O.K., but what a drag to have to maintain your video projects in two separate collections: B.X. (before X) and A.X.Of course, that’s the way Apple rolls. Here’s one more Apple-imposed migration to a new, very different platform.Yes, some bugs need fixing, and the “coming soon” features need to come soon. But despite the footnotes, and if you can get past the shock of the new, Final Cut X is already intuitive, powerful and very sweet.'"
"'11-06-23,'0','Derivatives traders and analysts are debating just how much money is involved in these contracts and what sort of threat they pose to markets in Europe and the United States. On the one hand, just over $5 billion is tied up in contracts that will pay out if defaults, according to Markit, a financial data firm based in . That is less than 1 percent the size of Greece’s economy, but that is a conservative calculation that counts protections banks have in place offsetting their positions, and is called the net exposure.The less conservative figure, the gross exposure, is $78.7 billion for Greece, according to Markit. And there are many other types of contracts, like about $44 billion in other guarantees tied to Greece, according to the Bank of International Settlements. The gross exposure of the five most financially pressed countries — , , , Greece and — is about $616 billion. And the broader figure on all derivatives from those countries is unknown.The pervasiveness of these opaque contracts has complicated negotiations for European officials, and it underscores calls for more transparency in the derivatives market.The uncertainty, financial analysts say, has led European officials to push for a “voluntary” Greek bond financing solution that may sidestep a default, rather than the forced deals of other eras. “There’s not any clarity here because people don’t know,” said Christopher Whalen, editor of The Institutional Risk Analyst. “This is why the Europeans came up with this ridiculous deal, because they don’t know what’s out there. They are afraid of a default. The industry is still refusing to provide the disclosure needed to understand this. They’re holding us hostage. The Street doesn’t want you to see what they’ve written.”Regulators are aware of this problem. Financial reform packages on both sides of the Atlantic mandated many changes to the derivatives market, and regulators around the globe are drafting new rules for these contracts that are meant to add transparency as well as security. But they are far from finished and could take years to put into effect.Darrell Duffie, a professor who has studied derivatives at the Graduate School of Business at , said that he was concerned that regulators may not have adequately studied what contagion might occur among swaps holders, in the case of a Greek default.Regulators, he said, “have access to everything they need to have. Whether they’ve collected all the information and analyzed it is different question. I worry because many of those leaders have said there’s no way we’re going to let Greece default. Does that mean they haven’t had conversations about what happens if Greece defaults? Is their commitment so severe that they haven’t had real discussions about it in the backrooms?”Regulators aren’t saying much. When asked what data the Federal Reserve had collected on American financial companies and their swaps tied to European debt, Barbara Hagenbaugh, a spokeswoman, referred to a speech made by Mr. Bernanke in May in which he did not mention derivatives tied to Greece. At the Wednesday press conference, Mr. Bernanke said that commonly cited data on derivatives do not take into account the offsetting positions banks have on their Greek exposures. And with those positions, he said, even if there is a Greek default, “the effects are very small.”At the , Eszter Miltenyi, a spokeswoman, said: “This is much too sensitive I think for us to have a conversation on this.”On Wall Street, traders are debating whether the industry’s process for unwinding credit-default swaps would run smoothly if Greece defaulted. The process is tightly controlled by a small group of bankers who meet in an industry group called the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.The process is fairly well developed, but it has been little tested on the debt of countries. For the most part, Wall Street has cashed in on credit-default swaps tied to corporations’ debt.For most purposes, determining whether a default occurred in a country’s debt falls to ratings agencies like and . But for the derivatives market, a committee of I.S.D.A. makes the call.If the committee decides there was a default, it passes the baton to Markit, which is partly owned by the banks. Markit holds an auction to determine how much value has been lost on the debt, and that determines how much money is paid out to the parties that purchased the insurance.Marc Barrachin, who runs the auctions, said there was no reason to worry about the process.“The process is very smooth, very well understood by market participants,” said Mr. Barrachin, the director of credit products at Markit. “I mean if you go back to 2008 right in the fall, in five days we had auctions for , and , and two weeks after that you had . I go back to that period of stress and the orderly settlements of large amounts of credit derivatives, for names that were widely followed, were testament of the efficiency of the auction system.”In the case of A.I.G., there was not an unwind process run by I.S.D.A. because A.I.G.’s contracts were tied to mortgage bonds. Those sorts of derivatives pay out money over time, whereas derivatives tied to a country’s debt pay out on one occasion: if a default occurs. That makes sovereign derivatives more similar to derivatives on corporate bonds and different in some ways from the situation at A.I.G.But the smoothness of the process would be irrelevant if the risk were concentrated in just a few weak institutions.The uncertainty around how a sovereign default would course through the derivatives market had greatly increased the price premiums banks were charging to put on new derivatives trades related to European countries. As of last week, the price to insure against default on $10 million of Greek debt was $1.9 million per year, up from $775,000 a year ago, according to Markit.“There is lack of transparency and visibility in these products, and that increases the risk,” said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, a boutique banking firm in New York.'"
"'11-06-23,'0','Chinese officials announced in May that the authorities were investigating Mr. Ai on suspicion of tax evasion, after police officers took him from the main Beijing airport on April 3 as he prepared to board a flight to . Supporters of Mr. Ai said the inquiry was a pretext to silence one of the most vocal critics of the Chinese Communist Party.Mr. Ai is presumed to be well connected because he is the son of Ai Qing, one of the most beloved poets of modern China. His detention was nearly certain to have been approved by top Chinese leaders. It is unclear what kinds of discussions took place within elite political circles that ultimately led to his release.But China came under unusually heavy pressure from all corners of the globe, not only from standard diplomatic channels but also from prominent people like Mayor of New York, who harangued China in May at a opening of an outdoor sculpture exhibition by Mr. Ai, and , a leading sculptor in who this month canceled a show planned for the National Museum of China in Beijing. Prime Minister of China was scheduled to visit Britain and starting on Saturday, and he almost certainly would have encountered protests and condemnation, whether on the streets or in private meetings.“Without the wave of international support for Ai and the popular expressions of dismay and disgust about the circumstances of his disappearance and detention, it’s highly unlikely the Chinese government would have released him,” Phelim Kine, an researcher for , said in an e-mail. “The public announcement of his release signals that the Chinese government has had to respond to this pressure and that the cost-benefit ratio of continuing to detain him was no longer tenable.”Mr. Kine noted that less visible Chinese remain missing and “at high risk” of torture. Among them are Wen Tao, a former journalist and aide to Mr. Ai, and other associates of Mr. Ai, including Hu Mingfen, Liu Zhenggang and Zhang Jinsong.Gao Ge, Mr. Ai’s sister, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Ai’s wife, Lu Qing, got a call on Wednesday and was told to go to a police station in Beijing. “She didn’t know what would happen, and then the police said that Weiwei was free to go with her back home,” Ms. Gao said. Mr. Ai got home before midnight, and his mother went to meet him.“All I care about is that he’s home now,” Ms. Gao said.Word of Mr. Ai’s release first emerged in a report posted online Wednesday night by Xinhua, the state news agency. It said in English that the Beijing police had released Mr. Ai on bail “because of his good attitude in confessing his crimes as well as a chronic disease he suffers from.”Xinhua also quoted the police as saying that Mr. Ai had repeatedly said he was willing to pay the taxes he had evaded. The news agency reported the authorities as saying that Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd., a company controlled by Mr. Ai, evaded “a huge amount of taxes and intentionally destroyed accounting documents.”“Bail” is the shorthand commonly used as an English translation of the Chinese term “qubao houshen,” which means obtaining a guarantee pending trial. It generally means that prosecutors have decided to drop charges against a suspect on certain conditions, including good behavior, and to monitor him over a period of time during which charges could be reintroduced.“This is a technique that the public security authorities sometimes use as a face-saving device to end controversial cases that are unwise or unnecessary for them to prosecute,” Jerome A. Cohen, a scholar of the Chinese legal system, said in an e-mail. “Often in such cases, a compromise has been reached in negotiation with the suspect, as apparently it has been here.”Mr. Cohen said Mr. Ai’s release “is very good news and perhaps the very best outcome that could have been expected in the circumstances of this difficult case.”Liu Xiaoyuan, Mr. Ai’s lawyer, said in a post that as long as the taxes were paid, Mr. Ai would probably remain free.Mr. Ai’s family members have insisted that he is innocent of the accusations against him. Ms. Gao said in May that Mr. Ai was neither the legal representative nor the chief executive of the company accused of evading taxes and should be freed. During his detention, the family also said that Mr. Ai had been suffering from and , which required medication.After Mr. Ai was detained on April 3, the authorities did not immediately detail any charges against him, and his incarceration was widely considered an attempt to silence a prominent critic while buying the authorities time to decide on the legal grounds for prosecuting him.He was held in an undisclosed location. On May 15, police officers took Mr. Ai’s wife, Ms. Lu, to see him. Ms. Gao said afterward that Ms. Lu had reported that Mr. Ai seemed healthy and was being given access to medication. On May 20, a Xinhua report said the police had concluded that Mr. Ai had evaded taxes and destroyed financial documents.The police can legally continue to pursue the case for up to one year after “qubao houshen” releases. During that time, the suspect is allowed freedom of movement, but the police generally hold onto his travel documents.Few dissidents who have been detained in recent years have been shown leniency. International pressure so far has not helped Liu Xiaobo, a writer who was sentenced in 2009 to 11 years in prison on subversion charges. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last October, which he was not allowed to collect.'"

She largely pulls it off, though detours intermittently threaten the balance.It starts as a play within a play, with Boo (Anna Greenfield) debating with her father, Larry (Jay Potter), about its authorship — she wrote it, but his stories populate it — and then plunges into the biblical hell that was Gulfport in 2005. The inhabitants include a family — Rena (Annie Henk), Jay (Juan Francisco Villa) and Michael (David Rosenblatt) — at home (and on a roof) as floodwaters rise; two emergency medical workers (T J Witham and Jordan Mahome) stranded in their vehicle; and an 87-year-old (Geany Masai) who lost a daughter years ago and is waiting for her son.Interspersed are flashbacks of fraught Killebrew family dynamics, which, given the life-and-death circumstances of the others, seem minor in comparison and a bit indulgent, if heartfelt. Larry, who left his wife (Tracey Gilbert, barely seen) for another woman, appears to be his daughter’s favorite parent. Given Mr. Potter’s dignity and rumpled Dixie charm, it’s easy to see why. As Boo, Ms. Greenfield is an appealing blend of coltish energy and limpid emotion.Directed by Lee Sunday Evans, this 59E59 Theaters production avoids lulls. Nick Houfek’s effective lighting at times involves complete darkness.

"'11-06-24,'0','PHOENIX — The police in New Mexico made another arrest on Thursday in their investigation of an online prostitution ring said to be run by a New Jersey college professor, taking into custody another academic who is a past president of the University of New Mexico.F. Chris Garcia, 71, a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico who served as its president from 2002 to 2003, was charged with promoting prostitution, conspiracy and tampering with evidence.The police in Albuquerque served search warrants at his home and campus office and said his arrest was linked with the Southwest Companions Web site they say was operated by David Flory, 68, a physics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey who was arrested on Sunday. The police said at an afternoon news conference that Mr. Garcia’s role was as a member of the Web site’s “Hunt Club,” which recruited new prostitutes, The Albuquerque Journal reported.Mr. Flory, who lived in Manhattan, had a vacation home in New Mexico and was arrested while visiting the state. Charging him with 40 felony counts, the police said he set up the online sex site, which connected about 200 prostitutes with as many as 1,400 customers.At the University of New Mexico, there was shock at the news that the professor emeritus had been linked to the scandal. “Media reports which state the search warrants were served in connection with the multistate online prostitution ring are deeply disturbing,” Susan McKinsey, university spokeswoman, said in a statement. “It is important for all of us, our entire university family, that we get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible.”'"
"'11-06-24,'0','LONDON — As suspects go, Ryan Cleary did not look dangerous: a pale 19-year-old who looked five years younger, wearing a white skateboarding T-shirt and track pants, standing nervously in a courtroom here on Thursday.But charges by the British police link Mr. Cleary to a hacking group called Lulz Security, or LulzSec, which has been on an Internet crime spree in recent weeks, attacking Web sites and computer networks including those of the United States Senate, the Central Intelligence Agency and Sony.The British tabloids have been quick to cast Mr. Cleary as the young criminal mastermind behind LulzSec, calling him “Hack the Lad” in front-page headlines. His mother, Rita, has said her son is highly intelligent but has a history of mental illness, including agoraphobia. His lawyer, Ben Cooper, described Mr. Cleary as “a vulnerable young man.”Though it is not clear how much notoriety he deserves, Mr. Cleary’s arrest has made him a focus of the public fascination with a wave of computer hacking cases, carried out by amorphous online collectives.The police say Mr. Cleary is guilty of illegally using a computer to perform denial of service attacks — bombarding Web sites with so many automated messages that they shut down. They say his targets were organizations including the British Serious Organized Crime Agency.In the hierarchy of computer hacking, the accusations against Mr. Cleary and the actions of LulzSec fall broadly into the category known as hacktivism. Hackers of this type are not motivated by money, but are mainly interested in protesting against or antagonizing their targets, or in showing off technical skills.Hacktivists, according to computer security experts, are a different breed from mainstream cybercriminals, who seek financial gain. Such criminals, for example, manipulated Citigroup’s Web site to steal the personal information of credit card holders.The third category, experts say, are warriors, either working in the “cybercommands” of governments like those of the United States and other countries, or for mercenary or terrorist groups. They defend computer networks, power grids and state secrets of their own country, while devising tactics to attack enemies.Hacktivists tend to portray their activities as digital sit-ins, a form of protest. But security experts say their attacks often cause real damage to computer networks and financial losses. LulzSec has been more aggressive than most, and more brazen in its choice of targets.“This is organized criminal activity that is typically distributed across many different countries,” said Mark Rasch, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department, who is director of security for CSC, a computer services company. “It’s a serious crime.”On Thursday evening LulzSec released what it said were hundreds of internal documents from the Arizona Department of Public Safety, including material related to border patrol and counterterrorism operations. It said it was taking aim at the agency because of Arizona’s anti-immigrant policies. A Department of Public Safety spokesman, Capt. Steve Harrison, said the documents appeared to be authentic but were sensitive, not confidential.Hacking has been a pursuit of mischievous young men — and they are nearly all men — since shortly after computers were invented. But the Internet made it an increasingly international pursuit. The intruders quickly became power users of online bulletin boards and Internet chat software, using those tools to communicate and organize activities.“Hackers were among the first to figure out the benefits of social networking,” said Alan Brill, a senior managing director of Kroll, a security consulting firm.The far-flung hacker networks present a formidable challenge for law enforcement. But in recent years, they and prosecutors have more and more formed their own international networks of communication, sharing information across borders. Mr. Cleary’s arrest, for example, involved cooperation between Scotland Yard and the F.B.I.LulzSec, on a Twitter feed that it uses to communicate with more than 250,000 followers, has said that Mr. Cleary is “at best mildly associated with us.” The group did not respond to a Twitter message seeking comment for this article.LulzSec, experts say, is a splinter group from Anonymous, another online hacking collective. Anonymous is best known for its attacks last year in support of WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange. The group went after the Web sites of companies like MasterCard and PayPal, which had refused to process donations to WikiLeaks after it disclosed confidential diplomatic cables.Earlier this year, said Barrett Brown, a former Anonymous activist, “some of the most prominent leaders and hackers broke off and are now LulzSec.”The two hacker groups certainly strike different poses. LulzSec’s statements and its actions display a spirit of exuberant anarchic glee. Lulz, in essence, means mean-spirited laughter, and LulzSec’s Web site describes the group as “a small team of lulzy individuals who feel the drabness of the cybercommunity is a burden on what matters: fun.”The group is strongly antagonistic to the media. When a TV journalist for Russia Today asked for an interview, she was told it would be granted only if she and her producer wore shoes on their heads and wrestled in mud while singing. They declined.There seems to be far less glee in the Anonymous culture. In a YouTube video describing the group, a voice intones: “There is no control, no leadership, only influence. The influence of thought.” Later, the video adds that Anonymous’s actions have “brought justice to our world.”LulzSec’s exploits have riled others in the hacker world who object to its activities, particularly exposure of personal information of innocent Internet users. Those people are now working to stop LulzSec by investigating its members’ identities and providing information to the F.B.I.The core LulzSec group, according to Mr. Brown, the former Anonymous activist, numbers between five and 10. Mr. Brown said the members he had dealt with — known by online nicknames like Topiary and Sabu — are mostly men in their early 20s.Mr. Brown said he had dealt with Mr. Cleary, and that he believed — contrary to LulzSec’s statement — that he was involved with the group. But a person involved with Anonymous, who declined to be named for fear of prosecution, said Mr. Cleary was peripheral.On Thursday the court agreed to delay Mr. Cleary’s application for bail while police investigated.Hacker networks and their activities are murky by design, said Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer of the British company BT Group. LulzSec, Mr. Schneier said, “is a badge, a name you call each other if you’re one of the cool hacker kids now.”'"

Blue-collar workers were to have been paid Thursday, while white-collar employees were to be paid next Monday.Saab’s unions said they would formally demand their wages Monday, if they had not been paid by then, after which the company would have seven days to respond.“After that there are two alternatives,” Mr. Saikkala told Reuters. “Either we see that the situation can be solved, or we demand that Saab is put into bankruptcy.”Under its chief executive, Victor R. Muller, Swedish Automobile, a tiny maker of sports cars, bought Saab from General Motors in 2010. But it has struggled with the daunting task of trying to restore timely production at the company and return it to profitability.Output at the Saab factory in Trollhattan, Sweden, has been suspended for most of the time since early April because of a shortage of cash. The company, repeating a statement of two weeks ago, said it was continuing to negotiate with parts suppliers who have refused to extend I.O.U.’s.The announcement Thursday dashed hopes that recently announced deals with Chinese partners would turn Saab around. Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile has agreed to pay €136 million, or $195 million, for a 29.9 percent stake in Swedish Automobile, the companies said June 13. That deal followed the announcement in May that Pang Da Automobile Trade would pay €109 million for 24 percent of Swedish Automobile.The companies have portrayed the deals as game changers offering access to the Chinese auto market, the world’s largest. But industry analysts have expressed skepticism that those cash injections, assuming they are approved by the Chinese authorities, are of a sufficient scale to fix Saab.The Saab brand might yet be saved, Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners in London, wrote in a research note. But, he wrote, “I frankly doubt that even if a deal with the Chinese or Russians could be brokered, that in such a crowded volume marketplace as this and one that right across Europe probably contains something like 40 percent production overcapacity, that there can be any future left producing Saab cars in Sweden.”Saab is still awaiting word on whether a Russian financier, Vladimir A. Antonov, will be cleared by the Swedish government and the European Investment Bank to invest in the group. His participation, if approved, would bring in substantial new funds.Ms. Olofsson said that so far General Motors, which still owns Saab preferred shares that it is eager to sell, and the E.I.B., which has extended funding to the carmaker, have blocked Mr. Antonov’s entry to the company. “If G.M. and the E.I.B. say yes, we in the Swedish government are prepared to say so as well,” she added.'"
"'11-06-24,'0','The government, which reportedly gained a confession from him about his “crimes,” has not publicly acknowledged any restrictions on Mr. Ai’s ability to express himself. Responding to questions from reporters on Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said the conditions of his release applied only to his freedom of movement — he needs permission to leave Beijing — and any potential inference with the continuing investigation. “China is a country under the rule of law,” Mr. Hong said. Yet the contours of the Chinese legal system, as rights lawyers here know well, tend to be fuzzy. Petitioners are often thrown into extralegal holding cells known as black jails; dissidents are frequently cooped up in their homes for months on end; and domestic security agents have a variety of means to keep troublemakers in line.Gao Zhisheng , a self-taught legal rights defender, has been missing since April of last year, disappearing soon after he defied the authorities by telling a reporter about the torture he endured during an earlier detention. Liu Xia, the wife of the jailed Nobel peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, has been held incommunicado since October. And this month, a United States rights group released a letter by the wife of a lawyer, Chen Guangcheng, who is blind, that described the beatings the couple suffered during months of forced confinement in their rural village.For those who have grown accustomed to speaking their mind, the restrictions can be hard to swallow. Zhao Lianhai, a Beijing activist who sought greater compensation for the victims of a tainted milk scandal, gained early release from a two-and-a-half-year prison term after he reportedly pledged to stop his public protests. “I support and thank the government, and I feel deeply sorry for the remarks I made against the government in the past,” Mr. Zhao wrote in an online message to supporters after his parole last December.But three months later, prompted by the detention of Mr. Ai, he broke his silence with a torrent of Twitter comments that have become increasingly impassioned and frequent. “I’m ashamed of myself for not speaking up until now,” he wrote in one of his first dispatches. “I cannot stay silent anymore. I’m ready to go back to prison. I would rather die than give in.”Wu Lihong, a Jiangsu Province environmentalist who served three years in prison after exposing local officials whose machinations allowed a lake to become fouled with industrial pollution, was told he would be jailed again if he publicly revealed the details of his mistreatment in custody, which he says included whippings and cigarette burns.Speaking by telephone on Thursday, Mr. Wu described the web of other restrictions that he said were imposed by the police since his release last year: No Internet access and no interviews with the media — and under no circumstances was he to photograph the lake. Although he remains free, Mr. Wu, a machine salesman by trade, says he has paid a steep price for his intransigence. Each time he finds a job, he said, the police arrange for his prompt dismissal. In recent months, he has survived by growing vegetables on the small plot of land next to his house, he said.It is too soon to tell what kind of restrictions Mr. Ai may face on his ability to work, socialize or communicate with the outside world. Any impulse to speak out may be tempered by the knowledge that three of his associates remain in detention as part of a financial inquiry that his family says is groundless.Some human rights advocates, even as they celebrated his release on Thursday, said they feared the government might have successfully muzzled one of the nation’s most renowned voices of conscience.“A political power can easily silence an individual,” said Pu Zhiqiang, a rights lawyer in Beijing. “But in doing so, it also shows its fear and lack of confidence. And it also shows to the world the failings of China’s legal system.”'"
"'11-06-24,'0','NAIROBI, Kenya — The president of Somalia’s transitional government on Thursday appointed a Harvard-educated prime minister who said he would try to revive Somalia’s war-wrecked economy and establish better security in a country that has been virtually lawless for 20 years.The president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, seemed to be continuing with his preference for Western-educated technocrats by naming Abdiweli Mohamed Ali as prime minister. Mr. Ali’s résumé reads like the itinerary on a tour of prominent American universities: it says he holds a master’s degree in public administration from Harvard, a master’s degree in economics from Vanderbilt and a Ph.D. in economics from George Mason University. In recent years, he has been teaching economics at Niagara University in upstate New York.He is Somali-American, and his profile is similar to that of Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, the previous prime minister, who also is an American citizen. He was abruptly pushed out of Somalia’s transitional government this month as part of a United Nations-backed deal to resolve an internal political dispute. Mr. Ali was a deputy prime minister and had been the acting prime minister since Mr. Mohamed resigned.At a news conference on Thursday in Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital, Sheik Sharif praised Mr. Ali, whose academic focus has been international trade, public finance and public choice.“He is a good man,” the president said. “I hope he will improve the situation of Somalia.”Few would argue that Somalia needs it. The Transitional Federal Government has been paralyzed by infighting and accusations of corruption over the past several months, and it controls only a small patch of the capital. Much of the rest of the country, which is nearly the size of Texas, is ruled by clan militias and Islamist insurgents. Somalia’s seas are plagued by pirates, whose ransoms keep going up, to about $10 million per hijacked ship.African Union peacekeepers have recently uprooted insurgents from several neighborhoods in Mogadishu, but without a functioning government most analysts predict the insurgents will be back.“Somalia is in a difficult situation; there is an economic crisis and insecurity,” Reuters quoted Mr. Ali as saying. “I hope I will succeed in overcoming all these problems. I urge the entire government and Somalis to help me achieve this.”'"
"'11-06-24,'0','The president of the World Bank, Robert B. Zoellick, called the steps “modest,” saying, “It’s just a start, but it’s progress.” Mr. Zoellick was pleased, he said in an interview, that the Group of 20 had finally focused on agriculture and the continuing crisis he sees in food supply, especially for poorer countries with weaker links to the world’s financial and commodity markets.Food stocks of wheat and corn are too low, he suggested, given the increasing demand for livestock feed in China, India and the developing world, where people are eating more meat. Keeping up with that demand will not allow a growth in emergency food stocks unless more action is taken, he said. And if there is an unforeseen event or disastrous weather, these stocks might quickly disappear, and prices would soar.“We’re in a danger zone for a number of years,” he said. “If you get a bad weather event, you get hammered.”The 24-page declaration was the result of months of negotiations. China and India, in particular, had been reluctant to release data on their food stocks, which are considered strategic information. Final agreement was obtained only at a dinner Wednesday night that was attended by, among others, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Pascal Lamy, the chief of the World Trade Organization.In general, Mr. Zoellick said, the Group of 20 allowed countries like China and India to take more collective responsibility for world crises and challenges. “This is where the G-20 can work, as long as they don’t feel ordered around by the bigger countries,” he said, citing the agreement by Beijing and New Delhi on food stocks. “They know it’s in their interest to do it.”This first-of-a-kind meeting was called by France, the current holder of the Group of 20 and Group of 8 presidencies, after world food prices hit record levels this year, raising concerns about a replay of the riots in some countries in 2007 and 2008.The current spike — driven by drought in Western Europe, a Russian export ban last summer and bad weather in Canada and Australia — contributed to the social and political unrest in the Arab world this year.In recent weeks there has been a slight letup in food prices, but the main wheat futures contract traded in Chicago remains up about 50 percent from its level a year ago. And few analysts expect a major retrenchment in prices in the months ahead.There was no agreement on the possible role of speculators in financial and food markets.There was also no accord on whether or how to cut or end subsidies on biofuels. In the declaration, the ministers merely said they would “continue to address the challenges and opportunities posed by biofuels.”“The problem is not biofuels in themselves,” said the Food and Agriculture Organization’s director general, Jacques Diouf. “The problem is the policies adopted by certain governments to encourage the development of biofuels.”Olivier De Schutter, a professor whom the United Nations has asked to report on food issues, said: “The final declaration is particularly disappointing on biofuels. There is a consensus among international agencies that this has been a major factor in the price increases of basic food commodities over the past four years.”In the United States, about 37 percent of the corn crop in 2010 went to ethanol, and the figure will be no lower this year, Mr. De Schutter said. The American agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, noted that the issue was alive in Congress and said it was “likely that we will see changes in the way in which the industry is supported.”'"

"'11-06-25,'0','Already, the rebels say, they are in contact with apolitical or disaffected officials in the Tripoli police force, the Interior Ministry and other government departments to make plans to secure the city in the days after a potential ouster of Colonel Qaddafi. “In every ministry of the government we have people who will be going to their offices in the days after Qaddafi falls, so the government will not collapse,” Mr. Fekini said.Many of the intellectuals and professionals involved in leading the revolt, he said, were worried about the possibility of mobs seeking revenge on anyone implicated in the Qaddafi government — a prospect that he acknowledged may be helping to hold the Libyan leader’s loyalists together. “We don’t want revenge, but it is the problem of popular justice,” he said.It is unclear what resources Colonel Qaddafi still commands. He is believed to have started the conflict with billions of dollars in foreign currency stashed away. But the rebels say they are counting on his inability to replenish his coffers because of international sanctions and asset freezes, and in interviews last week Tripoli residents said the strains on his resources were already beginning to show.Gas lines stretch for miles and drivers wait as long as two weeks to fill their tanks. (Bicycles, previously rare in hot Tripoli summers, are now everywhere). Food prices have soared, with the prices of staples like a can of sardines increasing as much as tenfold, some residents said. To preserve cash, residents said, his government has recently restricted the amount any individual can withdraw from the bank — including cashing a paycheck — to the equivalent of about $800 a month.At the moment, several Tripoli residents said, the shortages, like the fear of revenge, may also be strengthening Colonel Qaddafi’s hold on the city, in this case by giving him scarce commodities to dole out to loyalists. One Tripoli religious leader said last week that conversations with his congregation have convinced him that virtually every car with enough gas to drive on the streets belongs to a Qaddafi informant or member of the secret police.But it is an article of faith among the opposition that only money binds most of Qaddafi’s loyalists, and the Tripoli underground leader said his organization expected the colonel’s extensive network of informants to fray as his supplies ran out.The leader, a successful Tripoli businessman who would not give his name for safety reasons, said he had been living on the run, moving from house to house in the city since the early days of the uprising.After a relative abroad appeared on an Arabic-language news network criticizing Colonel Qaddafi, he said, two pickup trucks carrying eight Qaddafi soldiers arrived at his house looking for him while he was inside. A family guard told the police that he had moved away years ago and, bluffing, invited them to look inside. They fell for it and drove away, the underground leader said, and he has not returned since.An underground steering committee was formed at a large meeting in Tripoli in mid-March, about 20 days after the uprising began, he said, but has met in smaller cells ever since. It is divided into a civilian branch of lawyers, doctors and intellectuals planning for a transition, and a military branch attempting to wage a guerrilla fight against the Qaddafi security forces. Underground organizers say they rely on fake identification and change cellphones constantly to avoid identification.Although the rebels in the city remain starved for weapons, he and other underground organizers in the mountains said, their allies in other parts of the country are smuggling in more and more. Asked about a Qaddafi soldier’s recent statement to a reporter that he feared for his life because of rebel guerrilla attacks, the underground leader said, “Every night there is a death.”He declined to say whether the rebels had their eyes on any other major targets, like the Rixos Hotel, or to comment on reports that rebels had killed a guard outside the hotel. But he predicted that as Colonel Qaddafi ran out of money Tripoli would rise up, as it did during the first uprising in February. “A few thousand men with guns can’t control two million people,” he said.'"
"'11-06-25,'0','What will happen in Denmark remains less clear. The Danish Parliament has yet to ratify its border deal, and the union has issued a stern warning, saying Denmark’s plans are probably incompatible with its “obligations under European and international law.”But experts say the situation in Denmark, where support for the far right has risen steadily over the past decade, is part of a worrying trend for the European Union. Small nationalist parties in many European countries, determinedly anti-immigrant and anti-European Union, are leveraging important changes in policies.“It is something that we are seeing across the European Union,” said Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy in Brussels.Mr. Erixon and other experts say these populist parties have succeeded in producing a serious assault on the European Union’s principal institutions: the euro zone and free trade across open borders.In Italy, for instance, legislation was passed recently to designate certain Italian companies as strategic and prevent their foreign takeover.In Finland, the populist True Finn Party won 19 percent of the vote in April when it campaigned on the promise to oppose any further contributions to bailing out euro zone countries.In the Netherlands, the far-right Freedom Party is credited with pulling that country away from its historically pro-Europe stance. In recent months, as euro zone officials have fought to steady markets in the face of a possible default by Greece, a Dutch government that relies on the openly anti-European Union party has fiercely opposed expanded powers for the union’s bailout fund.“For decades, the E.U. had been moving ever closer to an overarching cooperation,” Mr. Erixon said. “But what we are seeing now is a reversal in the overall trend. Some of the E.U.’s crown jewels are under attack.”In Denmark, political analysts say the Danish People’s Party has not only drawn more and more voters since it was founded in 1998, getting 13 percent of the vote in 2007, but it has also pulled more mainstream parties to the right as they try to win those voters back, a phenomenon that experts say has occurred in many other countries.Prof. Marlene Wind, a political scientist at the University of Copenhagen, said that with new elections likely in the next few months, only one small party, the Social Liberal Party, initially spoke out against the border deal. “Hardly anyone said anything because they think it might get them voters back from the D.P.P.,” Professor Wind said.Much of the support for the far right in Denmark comes from the working class, which chafed the most at ultraliberal immigration policies that allowed thousands of immigrants — from Iran, Iraq and the Balkans — to enter the country in the 1970s, ’80 and ’90s.Denmark had few policies in place to deal with the immigrants’ needs, experts say. Blue-collar Danes resented that many newcomers in their neighborhoods never learned Danish and remained unemployed, clustered in the suburbs of Copenhagen.While mainstream parties avoided the subject as politically incorrect, the Danish People’s Party, led by Pia Kjaersgaard, a home care attendant for the elderly before she entered politics, took it on. Ms. Kjaersgaard is widely credited with forcing an overhaul of the country’s immigration policies, now among the most restrictive in Europe.Many of her supporters are like Rene Schultz, a 42-year-old furniture mover from Ishoj who is wistful for simpler times and blames immigrants for a rise in crime, though official statistics do not support this claim.“We need to close the borders,” Mr. Schultz said. “And if they throw us out of the European Union, that’s fine with me. There was a robbery here just last week. The old people are afraid to go out.”Martin Henriksen, the party’s spokesman for social issues, said that for a country to survive, its people must share values and customs. He predicted that Sweden would fall apart because so many immigrants were living there. And he called the European Union’s objections to the border deal absurd. “If we throw someone out of the country because he is a criminal, he can turn around and walk back in,” Mr. Henriksen said. “That is ridiculous.”Just how much more Europe’s nationalist parties can grow is an open question. The Danish People’s Party alienated many of its supporters when it signed on to the budget deal, which called for an overhaul of the pension system in order to save costs.For the moment, the Danish government continues to say that it will move forward with its agreement to have a 24-hour presence at its borders. Currently, drivers from Germany and Sweden can pass into Denmark without taking their feet off the accelerator, except for the occasional toll.But all that may change. Under the plan, Denmark would add about 100 customs officials, install or restore guardhouses, set up video cameras and construct special lanes where cars can be detained. Boom gates and stop signs have already been purchased.These moves, officials insist, are not in violation of the European Union’s open border policy, the so-called Schengen agreement. For a while, Denmark’s tax minister, Peter Christensen, insisted that six other countries in the bloc had already done what the government was proposing. But by the end of last week, that claim had been disproved.The mistake was just the latest embarrassment for the Liberal-Conservative government, which has faced protests from Swedish and German officials — and a spate of biting comedy show material. For some Danes, the low point was watching a recent skit on a Jon Stewart-style show in Germany.It featured a newsman at the German border with Denmark, a newly installed boom gate blocking the road. In the background, a luckless German who had strayed into Danish territory was being gunned down.“There we were being made fun of by the Germans,” said Professor Wind, who is appalled at the government’s willingness to bargain with the Danish People’s Party. “In Denmark, we don’t think of the Germans as even having a sense of humor, but this is completely on the spot and very funny. It’s so embarrassing.”'"
"'11-06-25,'0','The floodwaters climbed to levels never before recorded in this city on Friday, pouring over protective barriers and into the low-lying neighborhoods that more than a quarter of this city calls home.The spreading Souris River, known here as the Mouse after its French name, filled houses, closed bridges, washed out railroad tracks and, as more and more water arrived, left residents wondering how high it would rise. There was growing concern that the city would be effectively split in two by the water.The flood was long predicted, forcing an evacuation several weeks ago and again this week as warnings of devastation escalated. As a result, many residents had time to save belongings from homes that now stand in rushing water reaching close to some roofs.And for the workers at the 90-year-old zoo, which straddles the river and also was flooded in 1969, when the animals were taken to a livestock yard, that extra notice allowed for the safe evacuation of every animal, right down to the river otters.The evacuation, most of which occurred during the first flood scare and the rest of which occurred in the past week, was chaotic.“From the pictures I’ve seen of Noah’s Ark, the animals came on board pretty easily, two by two, marching right along,” said David Merritt, the zoo director. “That’s not exactly what happened.”It took a frantic search to find someone in Wisconsin with a trailer able to accommodate a giraffe. And it took quite a bit longer to convince the giraffes that the trailer was accommodating.On the other side of the zoo, a team of workers took the better part of the day to corral the bison. A team of police officers was on hand when the three bears were anesthetized. The tiny Sika deer bounced out of captivity. And many more animals fought as they were loaded into cages.“It was the saddest day I ever experienced,” said Jondrea Crawford, a seasonal zookeeper. “Because you could see the terror in their eyes.”The head of the Dakota Zoo in Bismarck (it was also partly evacuated because of flooding on the Missouri River) drove up to lend his new expertise.“If you’re picking up furniture and throwing it up on a truck — anybody can do that,” said Terry Lincoln, the director of the zoo, which has been protected by newly constructed levees and is now housing several of Minot’s displaced animals. “In a zoo setting you can’t take someone off the street and, say, ‘Go get the 500-pound lion.’ It just doesn’t work that way.”The smaller reptiles are being housed in a locker room at the hockey rink. Local farmers agreed to take some of the llamas, alpacas, bison and elk. And many of the more challenging animals — the bears, jaguars and lions — were sent directly to other zoos in the region.But a majority were taken to the former furniture warehouse, nicknamed the “north zoo,” which is now a government building used for storage, including sandbags for the flood.“They really designed an awfully nice little zoo in hours,” said Ron Merritt, executive director of the parks department.Most of the zoo animals have spent more than a month in the building, now heavy with the smell of hay and excrement. Each day, though, some of the remaining animals are being moved to those other zoos; six flamingos and a pelican were packed, squawking, into crates on Friday for transport.The high waters are expected to remain well into July. And though the parks director expects the zoo to reopen next year, it could be longer before all the animals can return.In the meantime, as the city sank deeper into the Souris River, the kookaburras continued their cacophonous chatter, the camels munched on hay bales, a lone alligator soaked silently in a large tub, the ground hornbills greeted visitors with curiosity, and the lamb named Noah continued his rounds.'"

With one out, Campana popped up a bunt that Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas appeared to catch at his shoetops. But the umpire Jeff Kellogg ruled that it hit the grass, and Campana then went to third on a single. He scored when Kosuke Fukudome hit a bouncer that went off the glove of second baseman Chris Getz for an error.AROUND THE MAJORS Red Sox pitcher Josh Beckett’s next start has been pushed back to help him recover from an illness that left him bedridden this week.

"'11-06-25,'0','So far the strategy seems successful, with Mr. Romney leading in early polls.Mrs. Bachmann’s and Mr. Santorum’s jabs on the abortion issue raise the question of whether it can still be a decisive point for Republican primary voters, who are more conservative in some early-voting states.Mrs. Bachmann sought to push that advantage. “There are indeed major problems in our country, that goes without saying,” she told the convention audience, speaking by a Skype connection over the Internet. “The importance of these issues does not for a moment mean the life issues should take a back seat.”A spokesman for Mr. Romney declined to comment, seeking to portray the dispute as a minor one that had already played out in the news media.But some political analysts said evangelical Christians already skeptical of Mr. Romney’s Mormon faith could be driven further away by the abortion issue.Ted G. Jelen, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who has written about abortion politics, said: “It’s something to hang your hat on: ‘How do I oppose a Mormon without seeming to be a bigot?’ Well, he’s not solid on abortion.”Mr. Romney’s distancing himself from abortion-rights groups, however, could also play in his favor in early-voting New Hampshire, where the Republican primary is open to independents. Many have a libertarian streak and want government out of people’s personal lives, said Dean Spiliotis, a political scientist at Southern New Hampshire University. “I think it’s a clear attempt to play well in New Hampshire,” he said.It is unclear how strongly abortion might affect voters’ decisions in 2012. Less than 1 percent told a New York Times/CBS News poll this year and last that abortion was the top problem facing the country.But the issue retains its power to stir passions on both sides. Anti-abortion activists and their elected supporters have chipped away at abortion’s availability in many states. Republicans in the House almost succeeded in blocking a budget compromise in April over federal financing for Planned Parenthood.That issue is sure to resurface in the general election next year.Mr. Romney, in laying out his anti-abortion credentials in an essay for National Review Online on June 18, wrote that he agreed with ending government grants to Planned Parenthood (which is barred already from using the money to pay for abortions).He clarified why he would not sign the “Pro-Life Leadership Presidential Pledge” from the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that raises money for anti-abortion candidates. Five other primary candidates have signed: Mrs. Bachmann, Mr. Santorum, Tim Pawlenty, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul.Mr. Romney objected to the pledge’s requirement of a litmus test on the issue for key presidential appointees overseeing health agencies and the Department of Justice. He also said that its call to end support for all institutions that perform abortions could have unintended consequences.“It is one thing to end federal funding for an organization like Planned Parenthood,” he wrote. “It is entirely another to end all federal funding for thousands of hospitals across America.”The president of the Susan B. Anthony List, Marjorie Dannenfelser, responded that Mr. Romney misinterpreted the pledge.Another candidate who did not sign, Herman Cain, a former pizza-chain executive, said he thought it infringed on the separation of government powers.Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor who entered the primary race on Tuesday, said that day that he disagreed with signing pledges on principle.Mr. Santorum spoke passionately here of his commitment to the anti-abortion cause, telling several hundred activists, “You are the warriors out there on an unpopular front.”In a brief interview after leaving the stage, Mr. Santorum criticized Mr. Romney for being unwilling to pledge that he would give authority over health and law enforcement agencies to foes of abortion.“When you do not follow through and put people in key positions that reflect the position you hold, I think it’s legitimate to question whether you really hold those positions deeply,” he said.'"

"'11-06-25,'0','But as Congress debates ways of saving money in the Medicare program, some critics have pointed to these medicines — known collectively as erythropoietin-stimulating agents — as examples of how poorly the federal government controls expenses in the program. The United States is among only a few industrialized countries that do not routinely assess whether new drugs or devices are worth providing to patients whose care is paid for by the government. Those decisions are largely left up to doctors, many of whom have financial incentives to use the drugs or devices. Indeed, doctors in the United States used far more Epogen, Aranesp and Procrit than doctors in Europe and elsewhere who did not profit from their use.“Sixty billion dollars have gone out the window on these drugs, and what do we have to show for it?” asked Dennis Cotter, president of Medical Technology and Practice Patterns, a nonprofit health policy research institute in Bethesda, Md. Citing government estimates that as much as $800 billion in health care expenses may be wasted annually, Mr. Cotter said, “It’s time we had a sound way of assessing the value of these technologies.”Amgen, a large biotechnology company, was built on the sales of Epogen and Aranesp. Johnson & Johnson sells Procrit, which is manufactured by Amgen. Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, executive vice president for research at Amgen, said the company supported the new F.D.A. warnings, which will be placed on the labels that educate doctors.“The revised label also provides physicians with more individualized treatment guidance by distinguishing between patients undergoing dialysis as compared with those who are not on dialysis,” Dr. Perlmutter said.Epogen, Aranesp and Procrit work by spurring the body’s production of red blood cells, which ferry oxygen to the body’s tissues. Professional athletes, particularly cyclists, have used the drugs (often improperly) to improve performance. They were developed to help dialysis patients cut down on blood transfusions, but Amgen and Johnson & Johnson soon persuaded doctors that the drugs helped both kidney and cancer patients feel better even when not suffering severe anemia. The consulting payments that the companies made to top doctors, including those who wrote guidelines for the drugs’ uses, may have played an important role in doctors’ enthusiasm.The drugs are expensive, and that means they have been particularly profitable for oncologists and nephrologists. But sales have been falling since 2007, when studies renewed concerns that the drugs might cause heart attacks and strokes and spur the growth of cancer.Friday’s warning about the drug’s risks is the most severe yet and will likely reduce uses of the drugs in kidney patients by as much as a third, Dr. Wish said.“I think it’s fairly draconian and is an overreaction,” said Dr. Wish, who has consulted for makers of the drugs. “They’re scaring everyone away.”Dr. Daniel Coyne, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, asked why any patient would willingly risk a fatal stroke or heart attack just to reduce the number of blood transfusions they might require while on dialysis. He said he would probably cut the dose of the medicine he provided to dialysis patients by a third or more and eliminate it from the care of many patients not yet on dialysis. He and other nephrologists predicted that the F.D.A. warning would change the way Medicare paid for the drug.“This is a shockingly bold statement by the F.D.A., but is firmly evidence-based,” Dr. Coyne said.'"
"'11-06-25,'0','He drove a battered , was unfailingly polite, was sometimes accompanied by a basset hound named Dog, and was constantly referring to the wisdom of his wife (who was never seen on screen) and a variety of relatives and acquaintances who were identified in Homeric-epithet-like shorthand — an uncle who played the bagpipes with the , say, or a nephew majoring in dermatology at — and who were called to mind by the circumstances of the crime at hand.It was a low-rent affect that was especially irksome to the high-society murderers he outwitted in episode after episode. In the detective-story niche where Columbo lived, whodunit was hardly the point; the murder was committed and the murderer revealed in the show’s opening minutes. How it was done was paramount. Typically, Columbo would string his suspects along, flattering them, apologizing profusely for continuing to trouble them with questions, appearing to have bought their alibis and, just before making an exit, nailing them with a final, damning query that he unfailingly introduced with the innocent-sounding phrase, “Just one more thing ....” It was the signal to viewers that the jig was up.It was also the title of Mr. Falk’s anecdotal memoir, published in 2006, in which he summarized the appeal of the show.“What are you hanging around for?” he wrote, referring to the viewer. “Just one thing. You want to know how he gets caught.”Mr. Falk had a glass eye, resulting from an operation to remove a cancerous when he was 3. The prosthesis gave all his characters a peculiar, almost quizzical . And he had a mild speech impediment that gave his L’s a breathy quality, a sound that emanated from the back of his throat and that seemed especially emphatic whenever, in character, he introduced himself as Lieutenant Columbo.Such a deep well of eccentricity made Columbo amusing as well as incisive, not to mention a progenitor of later characters like ’s Monk, and it made him a representative Everyman too. Off and on from 1968 to 2003, Mr. Falk played the character numerous times, often in the format of a 90-minute or 2-hour television movie. Each time Columbo, the ordinary man as hero, brought low a greedy and murderous privileged denizen of Beverly Hills, or Brentwood, it was an implicit victory for the many over the few.“This is, perhaps, the most thoroughgoing satisfaction ‘Columbo’ offers us,” Jeff Greenfield wrote in in 1973: “the assurance that those who dwell in marble and satin, those whose clothes, food, cars and mates are the very best, do not deserve it.”Peter Michael Falk was born in on Sept. 16, 1927, and lived for a time in the , near , but grew up mostly in Ossining, N.Y, where his father owned a clothing store and where, in spite of his missing eye, he was a high school athlete. In one story he liked to tell, after being called out at third base during a baseball game, he removed his eye and handed it to the umpire.“You’ll do better with this,” he said.After high school Mr. Falk went briefly to Hamilton College, in upstate New York, before dropping out and joining the Merchant Marine as a cook. He later returned to , where he earned a degree in political science from the New School for Social Research before attending , where he received a master’s degree in public administration.He took a job in as an efficiency expert for the budget bureau. It was in Connecticut that he began acting, joining an amateur troupe called the Masquers in Hartford and taking classes from Eva Le Gallienne at the White Barn Theater in Westport. He was 29 when he decided to move to New York again, this time to be an actor.He made his professional debut in an Off Broadway production of ’s “ ” in 1956. In 1957 he was cast as the bartender in the famous Circle in the Square revival of “ ,” directed by José Quintero and starring Jason Robards; he made his first splash on screen, as Abe Reles, a violent mob thug, in the 1960 film “ .” That performance earned him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and a moment of high embarrassment at the awards ceremony. When the winner was announced — it was for “ ” — Mr. Falk heard the first name and stood, only to have to sit back down again a moment later.“When I hit the seat, I turned to the press agent and said, ‘You’re fired!’ ” Mr. Falk wrote in his memoir. “I didn’t want him charging me for another day.”The next year, newly married to a classmate, Alyce Mayo — they would have two daughters and divorce in 1976 — Mr. Falk again earned a supporting-actor Oscar nomination for playing a mobster, though this time with a more light-hearted stripe, in the final film to be directed by Frank Capra, “ ,” starring Bette Davis and .From then on Mr. Falk, who was swarthy, squat (he was 5-foot-6) and handsome, had to fend off offers to play gangsters. He did take such a part in “ ,” alongside Frank Sinatra, , and , but fearful of typecasting, he also took roles in comic films like “ ” and “ .”He returned to the stage as well, as Stalin, the title role, in Paddy Chayefsky’s “Passion of Josef D,” which earned him solid reviews in spite of the show’s brief run (less than two weeks). Mr. Falk played Stalin “with brilliant, unsmiling ferocity,” Howard Taubman wrote in his largely positive review in The Times.His life was forever changed in 1967 when, reportedly after both Bing Crosby and Lee J. Cobb turned down the role, he was cast as Columbo in the television film “Prescription: Murder.” The story, about a psychiatrist who kills his wife with the help of one of his patients, was written by Richard Levinson and William Link; they had adapted it from their stage play, which opened in and in 1964, and which itself was an adaptation. Mr. Levinson and Mr. Link first wrote the story in 1960 for a series called “The Chevy Mystery Show.” It was in that show — the episode was titled “Enough Rope” — that Columbo made his debut as a character, played by Bert Freed.But it was Mr. Falk who made him a legend. During the filming it was he who rejected the fashionable attire the costume shop had laid out for him; it was he who chose the raincoat — one of his own — and who matched the rest of the detective’s clothes to its shabbiness. It was he who picked out the Peugeot from the studio motor pool, a convertible with a flat tire and needing a paint job that, he reflected years afterward, “even matched the raincoat.”And as the character grew, the line between the actor and the role grew hazier. They shared a general disregard for nattiness, an informal mode of speech, an obsession with detail, an irrepressible absent-mindedness. Even Columbo’s favorite song, “ ,” which seemed to run through his mind (and the series) like a broken record, was one that Mr. Falk had loved from childhood and that ended up in the show because he was standing around humming it one day, in character, when Columbo was waiting for someone to come to the phone.Three years passed between the first “Columbo” movie and the second, “ ,” which became the pilot that turned the show into a regular network offering. It was part of a revolving wheel of Sunday night mysteries with recurring characters that appeared under the rubric “ Mystery Movie.” The first set included “McCloud,” with Dennis Weaver, and “McMillan and Wife,” with and Susan Saint James.In between, Mr. Falk made “ ,” the first of his collaborations with his friend Cassavetes. The others were “ ,” in 1974, a brutally realistic portrayal of a marriage undermined by mental illness, directed by Cassavetes, for which Mr. Falk’s co-star and Cassavetes’s wife, , was nominated for an Academy Award; and “ ” in 1976, a dark buddy film directed by in which the two men played the title roles.In 1971 he once again returned to Broadway, in Neil Simon’s angry comedy “ The Prisoner of Second Avenue .”In later years Mr. Falk starred in several notable films — among them “Murder by Death” (1976), “ ” (1979), “ ” (1987), “Tune In Tomorrow” (1990) and “ ” (1987), in which he played himself, contemplating his acting career — and in 1998 he opened Off Broadway in the title role of Arthur Miller’s play “Mr. Peters’ Connections,” a portrait of an older man trying to make sense out his life as it comes to an end. By that time, however, Mr. Falk and Columbo had become more or less interchangeable as cultural references. Mr. Peters, wrote in his review of the play in The Times, “is as genuinely perplexed as Columbo, his aggressively rumpled television detective, only pretends to be.”Mr. Falk, who began sketching as a way to while away time on movie sets, had had many gallery shows of his charcoal drawings and watercolors. He is survived by his second wife, the former Shera Danese, and his two daughters, Jackie and Catherine.For all the mysteries Columbo solved, one remains. Many viewers claim that in one or more episodes Columbo’s police identification is visible with the first name “ ” visibly scrawled on it. However, the character was initially created without a first name; an exhaustive book about the television show, “The Columbo Phile,” does not give a first name, and Mr. Falk, for his part, was no help in this regard. Whenever he was asked Columbo’s first name, his response was the same.'"
"'11-06-25,'0','All this comes a little more than a year after the government in Athens won a package of loans worth 110 billion euros.“Greece is supported,” President Nicolas Sarkozy of France said at a news conference. “Europeans trust the Greek authorities and Parliament in their endeavors to implement the bold measures that have been decided.”After discussions with the Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, European leaders expressed confidence that Greece’s Parliament would approve the austerity package, which has already prompted large protests in Athens.Changes to the plan, negotiated with European and I.M.F. officials Thursday, are certain to make it even less popular among Greek citizens.The new austerity program will now include a one-time levy on personal income ranging from 1 to 5 percent, depending on income.Meanwhile, the tax-free threshold on income will be lowered to 8,000 euros a year from 12,000 euros, with the lowest rate set at 10 percent — but with exemptions for people up to 30 years old, pensioners older than 65 and the disabled. There will also be an annual levy of 300 euros on the self-employed.On Thursday, at a meeting of center-right parties in Brussels, the Greek opposition leader, Antonis Samaras, refused to bow to pressure to change course and support the new plan during next week’s vote. During the discussion, Mr. Samaras was warned that Europe was engaged in a war for its economic stability, according to one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Reflecting the disappointment of European leaders at Mr. Samaras’s stance, Mrs. Merkel said that “it would be better to have the widest support.”She also insisted that any new program for Greece should be monitored closely. “One needs to do a reality check on whether the assumptions are proved right,” she said.Nonetheless, in a statement issued late Thursday, European Union leaders accepted the need for a “new program jointly supported by its euro area partners and the I.M.F.”That could amount to as much as 120 billion euros, though no figures have been identified yet because euro zone countries are negotiating with private investors to determine their level of voluntary contributions.After the meeting, Mr. Papandreou conceded that his country was on a “difficult path” but one that was “much better than the alternative path of defaulting.”“I believe that this is something which is understood by the majority in the Greek Parliament,” Mr. Papandreou said, adding that he was sure that the 12 billion euros in emergency aid would be released next month.At the summit meeting, an obstacle to the new rescue was removed when the leaders agreed that nations that do not use the euro would not be obliged to contribute through a fund that they finance along with countries that use the single currency.Britain objected to taking part, arguing that it had not participated in last year’s Greek package and had no plans to join the single currency.“For Britain, we weren’t involved in this bailout and we should not be involved, as a noneuro country, in anything that might happen subsequently,” David Cameron, Britain’s prime minister, said at a news conference. Some practical difficulties remain, including an insistence from Finland that any new loans to Greece should be guaranteed by collateral.'"
"'11-06-25,'0','“We are positive that the Greater China region is going to be one of the most interesting markets for the future of the luxury industry,” Patrizio Bertelli, Prada’s chief executive, said Friday at a ceremony to celebrate the company’s stock market debut. “This is a very important moment for our company.”Prada’s decision to list in Hong Kong, rather than in Milan, where it has been based for nearly 100 years, signals its desire to tap into a deep-pocketed group of Asian investors — both funds and wealthy individuals — who feel more comfortable putting their money into stocks listed here.But it also reflects a desire to be front and center in a region rapidly gaining significance for the industry as a whole. For some luxury and consumer goods companies, the Asian market now contributes a third or even half of global sales and earnings, a sharp increase from a decade or two ago.Many brands have responded with a rapid expansion of their store networks, turning what were once economic and fashion backwaters in China and Southeast Asia into high-end shopping havens.LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the biggest luxury group in the world, is a prime example. Last year, it generated about 6.9 billion euros ($9.7 billion) in revenue in Asia, where it operates more than 800 stores. That compares with 4.6 billion euros in revenue, and 570 stores, in the United States.Ermenegildo Zegna, the Italian men’s wear company, which opened its first shop in Beijing in 1991, is also increasing its presence. It now has more than 70 stores in Greater China — mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan — making it Zegna’s biggest international market.Prada has lagged some other companies in terms of expansion in mainland China. But about half of its 319 outlets around the world are in the Asia-Pacific region, more than a dozen of them in Hong Kong.Prada, whose handbags and Miu Miu dresses can cost more than $1,000, plans to open dozens more stores, using some of the proceeds from the $2.1 billion it raised in its initial stock offering.Market nervousness about the debt crisis in Greece and the prospect for global economic growth diminished Prada’s debut on Friday, the same way it did for the luggage maker Samsonite earlier this month.Prada shares edged up 0.3 percent, closing at 39.6 Hong Kong dollars ($5.08) on the first day of trading. The modest rise contrasts with the large jumps in share prices of Internet companies like LinkedIn that recently have listed in New York.Analysts say the current market uncertainty is unlikely to deter other Western luxury and consumer goods companies from following in the footsteps of Prada, Samsonite and the French cosmetics maker L’Occitane, all of which sought listings in Hong Kong.It will be a handful in the beginning, rather than a stampede, said Pradeep Rao, head of Asia-Pacific consumer and health care investment banking at Citigroup. “But long term, there is definitely an appetite from investors here for such companies,” he said.The biggest driver of luxury buying is the increasing affluence of emerging Asian economies, which has catapulted millions of people into the ranks of the wealthy. Traditional luxury markets like the United States, Japan and Europe remain important. But these regions are mature and, for the most part, still recovering only haltingly from the global financial crisis.For example, a study by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini, published Thursday, estimated that the number of millionaires (in United States dollars) in North America and Europe remained more or less unchanged in recent years, while the number in the Asia-Pacific region had increased tremendously.With growth rates like these — and despite recent worries that China’s economic prospects are not as rosy as they once seemed — Asia’s population of millionaires is likely to top that in North America “very soon,” said Wilson So, a managing director of Merrill Lynch wealth management.The expansion in the 170-billion-euro-a-year luxury goods market has closely mirrored this trend. In 2008, Europe accounted for 38 percent of the global luxury market, according to Bain & Company. That figure dipped slightly to about 37 percent last year.During the same period, Asia, including Japan, rose to 28 percent in 2010 from 25 percent in 2008.The consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that China alone could account for a fifth of the global luxury market by 2015.“China is where the main battleground for the global luxury industry is,” said Yuval Atsmon, a partner at McKinsey who follows the luxury market. “The center of gravity is shifting.”Prada, for one, seems to be on the uptake, judging by shoppers like Kevin Chen. Visiting Hong Kong last week, Mr. Chen bought a Prada handbag as a wedding gift for a friend.“I’ve done this many, many times now,” he said.“My friends in Shenzhen said they would like a Prada bag or maybe some shoes as a wedding gift, so I picked a bag for them.”'"

"'11-06-25,'0','But they are also afraid. It is a fear born of soft authoritarianism, which has replaced blunt repressions throughout much of the former Soviet Union. Selective prosecutions, of which Mr. Milli’s is one example, are frightening precisely because they are unpredictable. This allows the state to halt worrisome trends, said Vafa Guluzade, who was an adviser to President , whose son, Ilham, has succeeded him.“It’s absurd to you, but very sensible to us,” Mr. Guluzade said. “When two bloggers are punished in this way, there will not be a third.”Azerbaijan is a sought-after ally; it pumps about a million barrels of oil a day and has provided critical support for the war in . Cartier and Chopard have set up shop beside the Gothic palaces of 19th-century oil barons in the capital.

Mr. Milli studied law in ; his friend Adnan Hajizada attended the , a private college in . Neither was particularly prominent, but they epitomized a class of restless young people experimenting with flash mobs, social media and parody. Mr. Milli made speeches overseas.Which is where the donkey came in.DURING the summer of 2009, Mr. Hajizada asked Mr. Milli, who was in New York, to accept delivery of a voluminous Chinese-made donkey suit and carry it back. In Baku, Mr. Hajizada shot a five-minute film in which he, in donkey gear, gave a news conference about the lush life available to donkeys in Azerbaijan. He meant to satirize a report that accused the government of spending $60,000 to import donkeys, he said. But people took it as something riskier.“I started worrying one week into the video, because everyone started saying, ‘Oh, are you targeting the president?’ ” Mr. Hajizada said. “Then I said, ‘To hell with it, I’m standing by my words.’ ”A week later Mr. Milli and Mr. Hajizada were at a restaurant when strangers accosted them. When they rushed to a police station to report the incident, the authorities charged them with hooliganism, both men said. Despite international protests, Mr. Milli was sentenced to two and a half years, and Mr. Hajizada to two. They were freed in November, after 17 months.Ali M. Hasanov, a top official in the presidential administration, said President Aliyev had allowed the two to be released early because their parents asked for mercy.“They said they were young and could unintentionally commit some crimes,” Mr. Hasanov said, “that they were creative people and have to serve the motherland. This is why maybe you will give them a chance to return to the right way of life. And the president granted this request out of humane considerations.”Mr. Milli remembers those first hours of freedom as delicious.He dialed his wife, Leyla Karimli, from his lawyer’s car, and when she asked where he was, he said, “I’m calling from freedom!” Reporters were waiting for interviews, but many acquaintances kept their distance, he said. He figured they were giving him time to rest.A month later, he called the embassies one by one to tell them he was back on the market as a translator. But the calls he expected did not come, he said.One employee of an international organization, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she is not authorized to speak to the news media, said that her managers had proposed using Mr. Milli to translate at a seminar but that state officials had refused, calling him “a politically incorrect person.” A man from another international body, who also refused to give his name, said his manager had warned him that the organization needed to continue working with the government.“The manager said: ‘It’s not a situation where we need to risk having Emin Milli. It’ll send the wrong message,’ ” he said.Christel Fricke, an academic from who taught a course in Baku, hesitated even to mention the bloggers’ case in class, which a friend had asked her to do, because she feared authorities would shut down the teaching program. She felt such remorse afterward that she wrote an essay about it.“At this most harmless moment,” she wrote, “I nonetheless refused to take any risk.”As for Ms. Karimli, 34, who is completing a doctorate in social work at , she found herself married to a symbol. In an interview in Baku last month, a few days after their divorce became final, she recalled seeing Mr. Milli for the first time, about five years ago. She had read his writing, and expected him to be homely. He was not. When he walked in, she said, “I thought I saw a light around him.”The years since have weighed heavily on her. After Mr. Milli organized a 15-person picket to protest the elimination of presidential term limits, her father called her in New York to say he had lost his job as a physician. The only reason he was given was his relationship to Mr. Milli.Desperate to find her father another job, Ms. Karimli dialed the phone again and again before she realized that no one would take the risk of helping her.“Part of his life is taken from him,” she said of her father. “Just like that.”LIKE her former husband, to whom she remains close, Ms. Karimli is trying to imagine a new future for herself. She is fairly sure it is as a scientist, not the selfless wife of a dissident. She is also not sure she will stay in Azerbaijan, as Mr. Milli plans to.“I feel you should not have to choose between two fundamental human things,” she said. “You’re supposed to have a life and you’re supposed to have dignity. You’re not supposed to choose between those things.”Mr. Milli said goodbye to Ms. Karimli last week, when he flew to England to participate in a monthlong training program on democratic activism and social justice. He said he could understand her decision, though he also has no interest in meeting other women.“I told her, ‘See if you can be happy with someone else,’ ” he said. “ ‘If you see that you cannot be happy with someone else, I will be here.’ ”'"

Ms. Zeng, who is also a political activist and blogger, was herself subjected to harassment during her husband’s confinement, and said in an interview this month that the authorities were trying to force her and her 3-year-old daughter from their apartment in Shenzhen.Early Sunday, Ms Zeng wrote on Twitter that Mr. Hu had arrived home at 2:40 a.m. Beijing time.“A sleepless night,” she wrote. “peace. happiness. he needs to rest for a while. thank you to everyone please forgive us if we have caused you any inconvenience.”Efforts to reach Ms. Zeng by mobile telephone produced a message that her telephone had been turned off. but the Reuters news service reached Mr. Hu’s mother Feng Juan, who was quoted as saying that Mr. Hu was in “so-so” health but in good spirits.'"
"'11-06-26,'0','Company data for more than 10,000 wells in three major shale gas formations raise further questions about the industry’s prospects. There is undoubtedly a vast amount of gas in the formations. The question remains how affordably it can be extracted.The data show that while there are some very active wells, they are often surrounded by vast zones of less-productive wells that in some cases cost more to drill and operate than the gas they produce is worth. Also, the amount of gas produced by many of the successful wells is falling much faster than initially predicted by energy companies, making it more difficult for them to turn a profit over the long run.If the industry does not live up to expectations, the impact will be felt widely. Federal and state lawmakers are considering drastically increasing subsidies for the natural gas business in the hope that it will provide low-cost energy for decades to come.But if natural gas ultimately proves more expensive to extract from the ground than has been predicted, landowners, investors and lenders could see their investments falter, while consumers will pay a price in higher electricity and home heating bills.There are implications for the environment, too. The technology used to get gas flowing out of the ground — called hydraulic fracturing, or hydrofracking — can require over a million gallons of water per well, and some of that water must be disposed of because it becomes contaminated by the process. If shale gas wells fade faster than expected, energy companies will have to drill more wells or hydrofrack them more often, resulting in more toxic waste.The e-mails were obtained through open-records requests or provided to by industry consultants and analysts who say they believe that the public perception of shale gas does not match reality; names and identifying information were redacted to protect these people, who were not authorized to communicate publicly. In the e-mails, some people within the industry voice grave concerns.“And now these corporate giants are having an moment,” a retired geologist from a major oil and gas company wrote in a February e-mail about other companies invested in shale gas. “They want to bend light to hide the truth.”Others within the industry remain optimistic. They argue that shale gas economics will improve as the price of gas rises, technology evolves and demand for gas grows with help from increased federal subsidies being considered by Congress. “Shale gas supply is only going to increase,” Steven C. Dixon, executive vice president of , said at an energy industry conference in April in response to skepticism about well performance.“I think we have a big problem.”Deborah Rogers, a member of the advisory committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, recalled saying that in a May 2010 conversation with a senior economist at the Reserve, Mine K. Yucel. “We need to take a close look at this right away,” she added.A former stockbroker with , Ms. Rogers said she started studying well data from shale companies in October 2009 after attending a speech by the chief executive of Chesapeake, Aubrey K. McClendon. The math was not adding up, Ms. Rogers said. Her research showed that wells were petering out faster than expected.“These wells are depleting so quickly that the operators are in an expensive game of ‘catch-up,’ ” Ms. Rogers wrote in an e-mail on Nov. , 2009, to a petroleum geologist in , who wrote back that he agreed.“This could have profound consequences for our local economy,” she explained in the e-mail.residents were already reeling from the sudden reversal of fortune for the natural gas industry.In early 2008, energy companies were scrambling in Fort Worth to get residents to lease their land for drilling as they searched for so-called monster wells. Billboards along the highways stoked the boom-time excitement: “If you don’t have a gas lease, get one!” Oil and gas companies were in a fierce bidding war for drilling rights, offering people bonuses as high as $27,500 per acre for signing leases.The actor signed on as a pitchman for Chesapeake, one of the largest shale gas companies. “The extremely long-term benefits include new jobs and capital investment and royalties and revenues that pay for public roads, schools and parks,” he said in one television advertisement about drilling in the Barnett shale in and around Fort Worth.To investors, shale companies had a more sophisticated pitch. With better technology, they had refined a “manufacturing model,” they said, that would allow them to drop a well virtually anywhere in certain parts of a shale formation and expect long-lasting returns.For Wall Street, this was the holy grail: a low-risk and high-profit proposition. But by late 2008, the recession took hold and the price of natural gas plunged by nearly two-thirds, throwing the drilling companies’ business model into a tailspin.In , the advertisements featuring Mr. Jones disappeared. Energy companies rescinded high-priced lease offers to thousands of residents, which prompted class-action lawsuits. Royalty checks dwindled. receipts fell.The impact of the downturn was immediate for many.“Ruinous, that’s how I’d describe it,” said the Rev. Kyev Tatum, president of the Fort Worth chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.Mr. Tatum explained that dozens of black churches in Fort Worth signed leases on the promise of big money. Instead, some churches were told that their land may no longer be tax exempt even though they had yet to make any royalties on the wells, he said.That boom-and-bust volatility had raised eyebrows among people like Ms. Rogers, as well as energy analysts and geologists, who started looking closely at the data on wells’ performance.In May 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas called a meeting to discuss the matter after prodding from Ms. Rogers. One speaker was Kenneth B. Medlock III, an energy expert at , who described a promising future for the shale gas industry in the United States. When he was done, Ms. Rogers peppered him with questions.Might growing environmental concerns raise the cost of doing business? If wells were dying off faster than predicted, how many new wells would need to be drilled to meet projections?Mr. Medlock conceded that production in the Barnett shale formation — or “play,” in industry jargon — was indeed flat and would probably soon decline.“Activity will shift toward other plays because the returns there are higher,” he predicted. Ms. Rogers turned to the other commissioners to see if they shared her skepticism, but she said she saw only blank stares.Some doubts about the industry are being raised by people who work inside energy companies, too.“Our engineers here project these wells out to 20-30 years of production and in my mind that has yet to be proven as viable,” wrote a geologist at Chesapeake in a March 17 e-mail to a federal energy analyst. “In fact I’m quite skeptical of it myself when you see the % decline in the first year of production.”“In these shale gas plays no well is really economic right now,” the geologist said in a previous e-mail to the same official on March 16. “They are all losing a little money or only making a little bit of money.”Around the same time the geologist sent the e-mail, Mr. McClendon, Chesapeake’s chief executive, told investors, “It’s time to get bullish on natural gas.”In September 2009, a geologist from , one of the largest producers of natural gas in the Barnett shale, warned in an e-mail to a colleague that shale gas might end up as “the world’s largest uneconomic field.” About six months later, the company’s chief executive, , described natural gas as “nature’s gift,” adding that “rather than being expensive, shale gas is often the low-cost source.” Asked about the e-mail, John C. Roper, a spokesman for ConocoPhillips, said he absolutely believed that shale gas is economically viable.A big attraction for investors is the increasing size of the gas reserves that some companies are reporting. Reserves — in effect, the amount of gas that a company says it can feasibly access from its wells — are important because they are a central measure of an oil and gas company’s value.Forecasting these reserves is a tricky science. Early predictions are sometimes lowered because of drops in gas prices, as happened in 2008. Intentionally overbooking reserves, however, is illegal because it misleads investors. Industry e-mails, mostly from 2009 and later, include language from oil and gas executives questioning whether other energy companies are doing just that.The e-mails do not explicitly accuse any companies of breaking the law. But the number of e-mails, the seniority of the people writing them, the variety of positions they hold and the language they use — including comparisons to Ponzi schemes and attempts to “con” Wall Street — suggest that questions about the shale gas industry exist in many corners.“Do you think that there may be something suspicious going with the public companies in regard to booking shale reserves?” a senior official from Ivy Energy, an investment firm specializing in the energy sector, wrote in a 2009 e-mail.A former Enron executive wrote in 2009 while working at an energy company: “I wonder when they will start telling people these wells are just not what they thought they were going to be?” He added that the behavior of shale gas companies reminded him of what he saw when he worked at Enron.Production data, provided by companies to state regulators and reviewed by The Times, show that many wells are not performing as the industry expected. In three major shale formations — the Barnett in Texas, the Haynesville in East Texas and and the Fayetteville, across — less than 20 percent of the area heralded by companies as productive is emerging as likely to be profitable under current market conditions, according to the data and industry analysts.Richard K. Stoneburner, president and chief operating officer of , said that looking at entire shale formations was misleading because some companies drilled only in the best areas or had lower costs. “Outside those areas, you can drill a lot of wells that will never live up to expectations,” he added.Although energy companies routinely project that shale gas wells will produce gas at a reasonable rate for anywhere from 20 to 65 years, these companies have been making such predictions based on limited data and a certain amount of guesswork, since shale drilling is a relatively new practice.Most gas companies claim that production will drop sharply after the first few years but then level off, allowing most wells to produce gas for decades.Gas production data reviewed by The Times suggest that many wells in shale gas fields do not level off the way many companies predict but instead decline steadily.“This kind of data is making it harder and harder to deny that the shale gas revolution is being oversold,” said Art Berman, a Houston-based geologist who worked for two decades at Amoco and has been one of the most vocal skeptics of shale gas economics.The Barnett shale, which has the longest production history, provides the most reliable case study for predicting future shale gas potential. The data suggest that if the wells’ production continues to decline in the current manner, many will become financially unviable within 10 to 15 years.A review of more than 9,000 wells, using data from 2003 to 2009, shows that — based on widely used industry assumptions about the market price of gas and the cost of drilling and operating a well — less than 10 percent of the wells had recouped their estimated costs by the time they were seven years old.Terry Engelder, a professor of geosciences at , said the debate over long-term well performance was far from resolved. The Haynesville shale has not lived up to early expectations, he said, but industry projections have become more accurate and some wells in the Marcellus shale, which stretches from to New York, are outperforming expectations.Many people within the industry remain confident.“I wouldn’t worry about these shale companies,” said , the oil and gas industry executive, adding that he believes that if prices rise, shale gas companies will make good money.Mr. Pickens said that technological improvements — including hydrofracking wells more than once — are already making production more cost-effective, which is why some major companies like have recently bought into shale gas.Shale companies are also adjusting their strategies to make money by focusing on shale wells that produce lucrative liquids, like and butane, in addition to natural gas.Asked about the e-mails from the Chesapeake geologist casting doubt on company projections, a Chesapeake spokesman, Jim Gipson, said the company was fully confident that a majority of wells would be productive for 30 years or more.David Pendery, a spokesman for IHS, added that though shale gas prospects had previously been debated by many analysts, in more recent years costs had fallen and technology had improved.Still, in private exchanges, many industry insiders are skeptical, even cynical, about the industry’s pronouncements. “All about making money,” an official from , an oil and gas services company, wrote in a July 2010 e-mail to a former federal regulator about drilling a well in , where some United States shale companies are hunting for better market opportunities.“Looks like crap,” the Schlumberger official wrote about the well’s performance, according to the regulator, “but operator will flip it based on ‘potential’ and make some money on it.”'"

"'11-06-26,'0','KIEV, Ukraine (Reuters) — Former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko clashed angrily with the judge at a pretrial hearing on Saturday, denouncing the court action as political maneuvering aimed at wiping out the opposition in Ukraine.Ms. Tymoshenko, Ukraine’s leading opposition leader, curtly refused to stand to address the court, and asserted that the hearing was part of a wider political plot. “The aim of this trial is the liquidation of a working opposition in Ukraine,” she said.Ms. Tymoshenko, 50, is accused of working against the country’s interests by signing a deal to buy Russian natural gas while in office in 2009 at prices that prosecutors say were inflated. She has called the charges absurd and accused her longtime rival, President Viktor F. Yanukovich, of trying to prosecute his opponents into oblivion.Ms. Tymoshenko, who could face 10 years in prison if convicted, is the most prominent, but by no means the only, opposition figure to face prosecution since he came to power. Rights groups and Western officials have expressed alarm over what they say is an intensifying crackdown on the president’s opponents.'"
"'11-06-26,'0','In a phone interview from Washington, Mr. Doggett said he thinks the new Congressional map is unconstitutional, and expressed confidence that the courts will redraw it. In the meantime, he is gearing up for a run in the new 35th Congressional District — the only way “for a Democrat to win from my hometown.”“My campaign is going to be more about the Republican power structure and their determination to have Democrats fight Democrats” than about Mr. Castro, Mr. Doggett said.While Mr. Castro agrees that the redistricting map presents serious legal problems, he thinks the new district, with its largely Hispanic, largely Democratic base, will survive a court challenge. He sees it as a “blessing in disguise for two cities that really complement each other, that are intertwined.”The Legislature’s Republican majority has tackled Congressional redistricting — the post-census restructuring of Texas’ United States House seats — in the special session, drawing a map that largely keeps Republicans safe, while adding four new districts to account for the state’s booming population.The map redraws Mr. Doggett’s current district, the 25th, in a way that almost assures he could not be re-elected. And it alters the 23rd district, which Mr. Castro considered running in before redistricting, in a way favorable to Representative Francisco Canseco of San Antonio, the Republican incumbent. But the map includes a new 35th district spanning from South Austin to eastern Bexar County — territory that voted 60 percent for Barack Obama in 2008 — laying the foundation for a dog-eat-dog Democratic primary.Mr. Castro is expected to have the upper hand with the new district’s base. He and his brother were born to activist parents in San Antonio, raised in the city and educated in its public schools. They have been active in politics since returning from Stanford University and Harvard Law: Mr. Castro, a lawyer, was first elected to the Texas House in 2002; his twin and law partner served on the San Antonio City Council and was elected mayor in 2009.In the House, Mr. Castro has advocated for higher-education affordability and opposed large budget cuts to public schools and health care; this session he helped restore millions of dollars in financing to them. But he has been stymied by a Republican majority that has left little room for up-and-coming Democrats.“To say it’s taken no toll would be insincere,” Mr. Castro said.Mr. Doggett has faced similar challenges, such as Republicans’ repeated efforts to unseat him. A former Texas Supreme Court justice and state senator, he was elected to Texas’ 10th Congressional District in 1995, held his seat until 2003, when Tom DeLay, then House majority leader, came to Austin to help Republican lawmakers redistrict him out of it. Undeterred, Mr. Doggett jumped to the 25th district, which he has held ever since.And while he may not be as familiar to San Antonians, Mr. Doggett said Central Texas voters knew his reputation for working for education, the elderly and veterans, for standing up to Wall Street banks and international tax dodgers, and for fearlessly taking on Republicans.“Republicans have done all that they possibly could to eliminate me as one of their most effective adversaries,” he said.Mr. Castro said he had a candid conversation with Mr. Doggett about running in the 35th district several weeks ago, before the final maps were drawn. He said Mr. Doggett did not directly ask him not to run, but reminded Mr. Castro that he had a hefty war chest. (At last count, Mr. Doggett had $2.8 million cash on hand; Mr. Castro said that he cannot legally start raising money until 30 days after the regular legislative session that ended May 30, but that he will be “very competitive.”)But Mr. Doggett said Mr. Castro was not clear about his intentions. He said that he reached out to Mr. Castro first to discuss the Congressional field, and that at that time, Mr. Castro appeared to be considering a run against Mr. Canseco in the 23rd district “to help pick up a seat rather than to cause an internal battle.”Mr. Castro said he had no desire to start an internal fight — he just wants to be “a fresh voice for a new district.” And he took a not-so-veiled jab at Mr. Doggett’s lone-ranger reputation, saying, “I’ve mixed it up with Republicans, and I haven’t been shy about it, but I’ve also found a way to be effective by working with others and not alienating anyone.”Both candidates play down the effect their geographic differences will have on the race. Mr. Castro said Austin had been a second home for him since he was elected to the Legislature in 2002. Mr. Doggett said he has previously represented roughly half of the new district, which Mr. Castro’s current state House district barely overlaps.Mr. Cook, the political consultant, said that if the Congressional map is upheld, the new district’s makeup — highly Hispanic, centered on San Antonio — bode well for Mr. Castro, “to the tune of about 100,000 voters.” But the reality, he said, is that Mr. Doggett performs best when up against a wall. When he was redistricted in 2003, Mr. Cook said, Mr. Doggett scrambled, leaving no stone unturned as he raised money and built allegiances up and down his new district.“I don’t necessarily think Doggett’s going to win, because he starts at a huge disadvantage,” Mr. Cook said. “But if it were anybody other than Doggett, I would go to Vegas and put my money on Castro.”'"
"'11-06-26,'0','Deutsche Bank National Trust Company filed a foreclosure suit against the owner in 2009. Neither bank officials nor Ms. Hill, who has since moved to Philadelphia, would comment.“She couldn’t get any relief,” said Ms. Hill’s mother, Pat Hill, executive director of the African American Police League and a supporter of the Anti-Eviction Campaign. “The banks were too big to fail and got bailed out. What about the people?”The Anti-Eviction Campaign chose the two-flat because it was one of at least 1,700 foreclosure actions temporarily halted in Cook County after Fisher & Shapiro, the law firm handling the cases on behalf of the banks, self-reported to Circuit Court officials three months ago that documents in some of the cases had been altered. Many foreclosure proceedings could be delayed for months.Last Monday, Ms. Hill filed suit in Federal Court against Fisher & Shapiro, alleging that the firm violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The suit seeks class-action status and damages.Pat Hill said that her daughter is not fighting to get the building back. “She doesn’t want it any more after all of this,” Pat Hill said. “As far as we’re concerned, this home belongs to Martha and her kids and the community.”The law firm’s managing partner, Lee Perres, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.The only noise coming out of the 101-year-old building for much of the last two years was the sound of thieves ripping out copper pipes, radiators, ceiling fans, bathroom fixtures and kitchen appliances. Neighbors feared that another crack house was slowly being born.Before moving into the two-flat, before sleeping in their car, before wandering from relative to friend like refugees, the family rented an apartment in a weary West Side building. It, too, was in foreclosure.When the building changed hands last year, the new owners raised the rent. Working on the line at a hot dog factory, Ms. Biggs, who grew up in the Cabrini-Green public housing development, said she could not afford it, along with gas and electricity. “We became homeless,” she said.Mr. Fleming, the housing advocate, who also once lived in Cabrini-Green, knew Ms. Biggs and asked her to move into the South Prairie Avenue two-flat to make a statement and to provide shelter for her children. They both knew it would be risky. The authorities might come banging on the door and demand she and her family leave. But worse than that, she said, her children’s hearts could be broken again.“They love it here,” she said the other day, showing off the freshly painted rooms and the used dining room set given to her by a neighbor. “This is a blessing. My kids don’t have to worry about where they’re going to sleep or wash up. What happens next is in God’s hands.”The group hopes that if the bank assumes ownership, it will allow the family to live there at a reasonable rent.Before moving in, Ms. Biggs had to promise Mr. Fleming she would help repair the building. For six weeks, she worked alongside a skilled handyman, Tommy Tillman, learning how to put up drywall and install tile and plumbing fixtures.She took time out to attend the eighth-grade graduation of her 15-year-old daughter, Jajunna. “She did it even though we were homeless,” Ms. Biggs said of her daughter. “I’m so proud of her.”Ms. Biggs hung Jajunna’s red cap and crown on a nail in the wall of the sparsely furnished living room.“For right now,” she said, “that’s all the decoration I need.”'"
"'11-06-26,'0','Adding another layer of complexity to the already murky effort, the English-speaking Afghan, Tayeb Agha, who was an aide to Mullah Omar during the Taliban’s rise to power, was arrested by Pakistani authorities last year and then released, leading American officials to assume that he is negotiating on behalf of the Taliban with the blessings of the Pakistani authorities.“We’re at that stage where it’s very confusing,” one senior administration official said, adding that the meetings could not even be called “talks” at this stage, let alone “peace talks.”The wariness in part reflects the fact that the administration has been badly embarrassed by previous diplomatic efforts. An Afghan was given substantial sums of cash last year and was flown on a NATO aircraft in the belief that he was a Taliban envoy, but he turned out to be an impostor.Even so, the renewed diplomatic push signals a significant shift in Mr. Obama’s strategy since he came to office in 2009 and increased American forces in Afghanistan to nearly 100,000 troops, from 34,000, in an effort to crush a resurgent Taliban insurgency.While the military has secured parts of the country and bolstered the Afghan government’s security forces, the administration now recognizes that a final American withdrawal depends on a political settlement with the Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic movement equated closely with the murderous ideology of Al Qaeda. The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were orchestrated by Al Qaeda under the Taliban’s protection.The administration has imposed significant conditions for any reconciliation with the Taliban. The movement’s leaders must disarm, sever ties with Al Qaeda’s remaining leadership, recognize the government in Afghanistan and accept the country’s Constitution, including basic rights for women, who were severely repressed when the Taliban governed the country in the 1990s.It is uncertain whether the Taliban or even parts of its leadership are willing to accept such conditions, and many experts are deeply skeptical.“There really can’t be a deal on the core red lines, because that’s what red lines are,” Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said of the conditions, using the diplomatic term for nonnegotiable demands.The diplomatic effort is being led by Marc Grossman, who replaced Richard C. Holbrooke as special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan after Mr. Holbrooke died in December.Mr. Grossman has not been directly involved in the initial contacts with the Taliban envoy. That work has been handled by Frank Ruggiero, a Grossman deputy, and Jeff W. Hayes, an official of the Defense Intelligence Agency who is working on the National Security Council, one official said.Mr. Grossman has participated in two meetings with senior officials from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The first, coincidentally, took place in Pakistan the day after the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan.That raid badly soured relations between the United States and Pakistan, threatening to turn the initial diplomatic forays with the Taliban into collateral damage. Pakistan was once the Taliban’s patron, and it maintained links to the organization’s leaders even after the government in Afghanistan was toppled in 2001.Mr. Grossman; Deputy Foreign Minister Jawed Ludin of Afghanistan; and Pakistan’s foreign secretary, Salman Bashir, have since met again in Kabul and are scheduled to do so again next week.Another step to entice the Taliban into the political process occurred last week when the United States won approval at the United Nations Security Council for a resolution that separated the Taliban from Al Qaeda on the terrorist blacklist that was the basis for international sanctions after 9/11.The resolution creates a process for removing Taliban leaders from the list, including some who have already broken with the movement and joined President Hamid Karzai’s government. American officials hope the prospect of being freed from sanctions will encourage others to abandon the insurgency.“With Bin Laden dead and Al Qaeda’s remaining leadership under enormous pressure, the choice facing the Taliban is clear: Be part of Afghanistan’s future or face unrelenting assault,” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday in testimony to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. “They cannot escape this choice.”Some have questioned the wisdom of the administration’s new strategy.“I don’t think it’s productive to talk to the Taliban to begin with because they have every incentive to have us leave,” said Vali Nasr, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University who was an assistant to Mr. Holbrooke as special envoy to the region until earlier this year.Another question, he and others noted, is Mr. Karzai’s commitment to the process.Last week, he acknowledged the talks but said the United States, not his government, was leading them. He went on to angrily criticize the international military operation that brought him to power.'"
"'11-06-26,'0','Two of the misleading impressions left by Jonathan Mahler’s review of my book “The Rights of the People” (June 12) deserve clarification. My research was framed less by my first thought on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 — “There go our civil liberties” — than by my more nuanced second thought, as explained in sentences that followed immediately: “It was a rash prediction, I knew, and I quickly re-formed it into a question about how firmly we would hold our liberties in such a time of testing, whether the Bill of Rights would sustain us. I figured there would be deterioration, but how much?”Also, when Mahler derides my comparison between autocratic personalities on the Soviet left and the American right, he misses the larger point, which is not the similarities but the differences between dictatorship and democracy. A democracy like ours may at times have abusive officials, but they are restrained by a constitutional system, if we choose to maintain it. Our liberties cannot depend on officials themselves, for as James Madison observed at the Constitutional Convention, “All men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree.”Jonathan Mahler’s review of “The Rights of the People” makes the same mistake as the book’s author. The most disturbing aspect of post-9/11 security measures is not the erosion of enumerated constitutional rights; it is the loss of common human dignity. We of course don’t have a constitutional right to carry weapons on airplanes, but a decent society should not subject its citizens to the invasions of personal turf now routine for air travelers. We need to accept some risks to preserve our dignity. The best case for a rethinking of our priorities is not Shipler’s book or Mahler’s review. It is the images of body scans that accompanied the review. At first, I thought that they were photos of terrorism suspects spirited out of Guantánamo, and that the purpose was to illustrate the Abu Ghraib-style humiliations they endured. In fact, the images, from the Transportation Security Administration, are of ordinary Americans whose only suspected crime was trying to board an airplane in Salt Lake City.WILLIAM A.

"'11-06-26,'0','With a subject this fought-over it’s not surprising that the documentary itself has been controversial. A legal affairs blog that covers product liability law, Abnormal Use, criticized the film for having come from the hands of a trial lawyer, stating, “We’re thinking that this might not be the most objective documentary on the subject.”Of course that wasn’t really the filmmaker’s goal. Ms. Saladoff is, as a lawyer and now a director, an advocate. One of several strands in the film, Ms. Liebeck’s story shows how tort reformers deftly spun her case and others to nudge public opinion and argue for the need to shut down what industry advocates called “jackpot justice.” The film also lays out facts of the case that are rarely heard.Many believe she was driving the car and juggling a cup of coffee — classic recklessness. In fact Ms. Liebeck’s nephew was at the wheel and was not going through the drive-through window. He had pulled into a space in the McDonald’s parking lot so that she could add cream and sugar to her coffee. She has been portrayed as a greedy plaintiff out for a bonanza, but she did not sue right away and initially asked McDonald’s only for the several thousand dollars to cover her medical expenses. The company refused.And while jurors found that Mrs. Liebeck was 20 percent responsible for the accident, they were outraged by what they saw as the company’s arrogance and decided to punish McDonald’s by levying punitive damages amounting to two days’ worth of coffee sales. And those making jokes tend to skip the part of the story in which the judge reduced the award and the case was settled out of court.“Susan has done a wonderful job of putting the real story out there,” said Judy Allen, Ms. Liebeck’s daughter. “We feel relief.”The film’s most powerful argument, however, might be the horrifying photographic evidence of Ms. Liebeck’s third-degree burns, presented indirectly at first through shocked reaction shots during man-on-the-street interviews. Then the audience gets to see.“You hear this unanimous gasp through the whole theater,” said Ms. Allen, who teaches autistic children in Virginia.Besides Ms. Liebeck’s case, the film looks at a number of other issues about civil lawsuits, including binding clauses in contracts for matters from cellphones to employment that sign away the right to go to court. That segment focuses on Jamie Leigh Jones, who said she was raped while working in Iraq for KBR, but whose civil lawsuit was initially blocked in court based on a clause in her employment contract.The film also uses the story of Lisa and Mike Gourley, a Nebraska couple, to illustrate the effects of caps on damages. The Gourleys’ son Colin was born in 1993 with cerebral palsy attributed to medical malpractice. A jury awarded them $5.6 million to pay his lifelong medical needs.But the State Legislature had capped overall damages for medical malpractice at $1.75 million. After legal bills and other expenses, the award did not amount to much, Mr. Gourley says in the film, and so “what happens then is, he goes on Medicaid, and the taxpayers have to pay.”Ms. Saladoff has structured an argument that America has narrowed access to the courts in many ways.“It’s not like corporate interests took our rights from us,” she said. “We’re giving over our constitutional rights to the court system” by voting for tort reform measures and politicians and judges who favor them.“We’ve been convinced through this massive public-relations campaign,” she added. “We’re doing it unwittingly.”Before taking the director’s chair Ms. Saladoff had a successful legal career and is a past president of the group Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, which is now called simply Public Justice. “You probably know the reason why” the name was shortened, she said. There was much to learn about filmmaking. “I didn’t know what an establishment shot is,” she said. “I didn’t know what B-roll was when I started.”So she surrounded herself with experienced filmmakers — like Cindy Lee, an editor whose credits include the Oscar-nominated Iraq-war documentary “No End in Sight”; Martina Radwan as director of photography (the Oscar-nominated “Ferry Tales”); and Carly Hugo, a producer whose films have appeared at Sundance. Still, Ms. Saladoff found her courtroom experience useful.“I know how to tell stories,” she said. “Doing it on the screen, telling it in a documentary, is not so different from trying a case in front of a jury.”She found that questioning a witness on the stand was akin to interviewing people on camera, and that organizing documents to tell a story was a common skill in courtroom and newsroom alike.One group of reviewers has given the film a thumbs down: those who work to limit what they call frivolous lawsuits. Bryan Quigley, a spokesman for the United States Chamber Institute of Legal Reform, compared the film to the Flat Earth Society.“In the midst of all the evidence they cling to the belief that America doesn’t have too many lawsuits, but that we don’t sue enough,” he said. “They deny that America’s lawsuit industry is out of control, when the rest of the world knows that it is.”A longtime leader of the tort reform movement, Victor E. Schwartz, appears in the film and pronounced himself unhappy with the result. “I’ve seen lots of plaintiffs’ lawyers’ propaganda — nothing like this,” he said. “It’s very well produced, but it may lead people to believe something that’s not true.”He counters the film’s arguments nimbly, pointing out that overall economic caps like those that affected the Gourleys are relatively rare, compared with restrictions on punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering. As for the coffee case, he said, other juries have not awarded damages in similar cases, and while Ms. Liebeck’s defenders cite hundreds of hot-coffee complaints to McDonalds, he noted that billions of cups were sold over the same span.He also complained that his comments in the film were selectively edited to make him look more supportive of the film’s argument. Ms. Saladoff used part of a quotation, for example, in which Mr. Schwartz acknowledged that money flooding into judicial elections may not be a good thing; but he said she should have also used his argument that the business lobby increased contributions in response to earlier contributions from plaintiffs’ lawyers. “Both points I make are valid,” he said, but “the money really began with the plaintiffs’ lawyers, big time.”Asked to respond, Ms. Saladoff said, “The quote was complete and in context.”But Louie Psihoyos, the director of the Academy Award-winning 2009 documentary “The Cove,” about dolphin hunting, said presenting both sides equally isn’t necessarily the goal.“After you’ve gathered as many sides of the story as you can, having a strong point of view is essential for a good documentary,” he said, even helping to bring about social change. “A good documentary can become a weapon of mass construction.”'"
"'11-06-26,'0','In the preface to “Cambodia’s Curse: The Modern History of a Troubled Land,” Joel Brink­ley recalls his first encounter with Cambodia. Brinkley was reporting for The Louisville Courier-Journal from a refugee camp near the Thai border in 1979, in the aftermath of Pol Pot’s reign. “As they tell of years of horror and misery,” Brinkley wrote, “their faces are expressionless and dull . . . as if they’re talking about a dull day of work. Their tales end with a nodding acknowledgment of the death of their nation and culture.” Brinkley, who later worked for The New York Times, finds little has changed in the 32 years since then. As the title suggests, his book is an unabashed plea to refocus international aid and diplomacy on a suffering people. It is also an attempt to hold some of those responsible for that suffering accountable — but not all.Cambodia lost a quarter of its population under the Khmer Rouge. For many, survival meant 14-hour days of backbreaking work, often on little more than a cupful of rice or a smattering of gruel. You could be killed on the least suspicion you sympathized with the Vietnamese. The effects of this period have proven hard to shake.Cambodia is one of the world’s poorest countries. “Among Southeast Asian nations,” Brinkley writes, “only Burma is poorer, on a per capita basis.” At least 30 percent of Cambodians live on less than a dollar a day. About 40 percent of children suffer from stunting (failure to develop because of poor nutrition). In 2010 only 30 percent of Cambodian middle-school-age students were enrolled in school. Asia’s self-described “longest ruling prime minister,” Hun Sen, is a murderous kleptocrat, Brinkley shows. Corruption is rife. The sick may die waiting for treatment if they cannot pay doctors’ bribes in hospitals.Statistics of suffering aside, “Cambodia’s Curse,” when it is at its most thorough, acknowledges the role of rich countries in this disaster. Every year for more than a decade, Brinkley recounts, donor organizations and states made toothless pleas that Hun Sen pass an anticorruption law. But once money was pledged, the law would stall another year. As a result of this annual pas de deux, donors had given Hun Sen $18 billion by 2010, essentially with no strings, before the law was enacted. And when it finally did pass last year, it had been gutted into meaninglessness.“Some Cambodians and others remained astounded by the donors’ behavior,” Brinkley writes. Why didn’t they withhold aid? Echoing the economist Dambisa Moyo, Brinkley suggests that the corruption is symbiotic. “If they cut off aid to the government, as the human rights groups were demanding, many donors would lose their jobs.”Cambodians also suffer from widespread post-traumatic stress disorder. A study by the Cambodian psychiatrist Muny Sothara found PTSD “in 47 percent of the population”; another study, of Cambodian refugees in Massachusetts, found that 60 percent of PTSD victims there suffered from sleep paralysis, a half-conscious state of catatonia. Even Hun Sen shows signs of the malady. One official, describing his own PTSD, relives his experience of starvation: “I would like to inform you that I am very, very hungry.” Social scientists are finding that PTSD is being passed from one generation to the next. Has this become Cambodia’s curse?Or is impunity the curse? In the aftermath of Pol Pot’s death in 1998, the United Nations partnered with Cambodia’s judges to try the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge. Brinkley explains the logic of the costly proceedings. “If nothing else, Ieng Sary fed the state’s omnipresent culture of impunity,” he writes of one Khmer Rouge leader. “If he, with the blood of two million people on his hands, faced no penalty, no censure, no retribution, how hard was it to accept the killing of a journalist here, a trade-union official there?” On June 27, three Khmer Rouge leaders will face trial. Last July, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, was sentenced to 19 years.'"
"'11-06-26,'0','There is just one engine for all the minivans, a new 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 that replaces the three engines offered last year. The new engine, which powers many of the latest Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep products, has more horsepower and torque than its predecessors: 283 horsepower and 260 pound-feet. Yet its fuel economy is equal to, or better than, those previous engines.Chrysler says the minivan’s 283 horsepower is the most in the class, but the Town & Country, at at 4,652 pounds, is also the heaviest front-drive minivan.A 6-speed automatic transmission, which also can be shifted manually, levels the playing field with the Town & Country’s redesigned competitors and even offers more gears than most versions of the Honda Odyssey.The Chrysler’s fuel economy rating, 17 miles per gallon in the city and 25 m.p.g. on the highway, falls short of the Odyssey’s rating of 19/28 with the 6-speed transmission.The Town & Country has an ECO mode for improved fuel economy that forces the transmission to shift at lower engine speeds.I tested a top-of-the-line Limited with a sticker price of $40,090. Not surprisingly, it was very well equipped, including a navigation system, a $595 power-folding third row and Sirius Backseat TV, which carries only three channels of children’s programming.For those of us living in colder climates, heated front seats are hard to beat. But the Town & Country test van topped that with a heated steering wheel and heated second-row seats, which could result in arguments among siblings about who will be relegated to the frozen reaches of the third row.The interior appointments of Chrysler’s previous vans didn’t measure up to the competition, but that has finally changed. The test model’s cabin was every bit as handsome and practical as those of the Odyssey or Toyota Sienna.I can’t say the same about the exterior styling. While other van makers have tried to make their designs a little sleeker, the new Chrysler and Dodge are homages to the slab in its flattest form. After a period in which designers tried to disguise the inherent boxiness of minivans with rounded surfaces, Chrysler seems to have reverted back to Square 1.Chrysler has a competitive advantage with its Stow ’n Go second-row seats, which fold flat into the floor for maximum cargo space. No other van has the feature, not even the Routan that Chrysler builds for Volkswagen.For 2011, the Chrysler’s Stow ’n Go seats have been improved in several ways. They now fold in one motion, with just one pull, without having to remove or adjust the head restraints. Perhaps more important, the seats are more comfortable, with a thicker and wider cushion and seatbacks two inches taller.After spending six hours in them, my rather trim mother-in-law said she fitted well within their contours but wondered how they would fit someone, well, broader. If that is a concern, individual captain chairs are available for an additional $320. But they do not fold into the floor and must be manually removed.Ben Winter, the chief engineer for the minivans, said the story behind the Stow ’n Go seats was an example of the difference between the pre- and postbankruptcy Chrysler.Before bankruptcy, the company was planning to carry over the same Stow ’n Go seats to the 2011 models, even though executives knew the seats were costing sales because customers found them uncomfortable.Enlightened by the bankruptcy, the company decided to make changes that would address consumer complaints, improve sales and meet new federal rules for head restraints in the second and third rows. The redo, which also involved re-engineering the reclining, folding and pivoting mechanisms, was done in 12 or 13 months, Mr. Winter said.One feature formerly available, the somewhat bizarre second-row Swivel ’n Go seats, are no longer offered. Very few customers, it seems, wanted to swivel.When Chrysler added Stow ’n Go seats for 2005, it also gave up its available all-wheel-drive system. The design left no room for the under-floor components of an all-wheel-drive system.If hills and snow are a concern and snow tires aren’t enough, the minivan buyer will have to choose the Sienna, the only van offering an all-wheel-drive option.Chrysler’s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said recently that the next-generation minivans must have an all-wheel-drive option.All the new vans have the full complement of safety features, so it’s hard to stand out from the crowd. The Town & Country’s seven air bags include a driver’s knee bolster.One nifty standard feature is Rear Cross Path detection. If you are backing up, it senses vehicles approaching the rear end of the van from either the right or the left, and issues audible and visual alerts. It could be a great safety aid in busy parking lots where visibility is limited.When it comes to crash safety, the federal government has not tested the new Chrysler or Dodge minivans with its latest more stringent testing procedures.The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tested the 2008 models and said those results would still apply despite the suspension changes. The minivans received “good” ratings in those front and side crash tests. The institute has not tested the vans’ roof strength.The suspension changes included tweaks to nearly every significant component, to fix a ride that was smooth but “too compliant,” Mr. Winter said. Customers said they wanted a slightly firmer, more European ride, but not firm to the point of harshness.The revised structure is solid, and it provides reassuring, confidence-inspiring handling. But I found the ride noticeably jarring on rough Northeast roads.The new low-rolling-resistance tires, engineered for better fuel economy, have stronger sidewalls for improved cornering and better traction for shorter stopping distance. But the tires are rather noisy.Resale value is important to many van owners, and Edmunds.com estimated that the 2011 Town & Country would retain 38 percent of its resale value after five years. The comparable Odyssey was projected to retain 48 percent and the Sienna 45 percent.Also, Honda and Toyota did much better than Chrysler and Dodge in the latest J. D. Power& Associates Vehicle Dependability Study, which looked at problems with three-year-old vehicles.But quality may be improving. In the 2011 J. D. Power Initial Quality Study released last week, which measures issues that arise during the first 90 days of ownership, the Chrysler brand rose to 16th place from 23rd a year earlier. The research firm attributed most of the improvement to the Town & Country, which was the highest-ranked minivan.The Town & Country Limited is selling for somewhat less than its comparably equipped rivals. Based on transaction prices from Edmunds.com, customers are paying, on average, $283 less for the Chrysler than for the Odyssey and nearly $2,500 less than for the Sienna.Certainly Chrysler has made some huge improvements to the Town & Country, particularly to its interior and powertrain. It may not be a clear winner over competing vans, but it has become competitive once again.'"
"'11-06-26,'0','Loved it — laughed out loud several times while reading. Wished Sullivan would have given his thoughts on the following: childless middle-aged adults visiting the park who routinely shove little kids out of the way to get to a ride; massive people eating roasted turkey legs like wild jackals in the animal kingdom; Lark-scooter-riding people (because of age or obesity) running down aforementioned little children; and best of all, young honeymooners who proudly wear special bridal Mickey and Minnie ears in the Magic Kingdom (bride’s ears are white with a modest little veil).John Jeremiah Sullivan’s article on his trip to Disney World seems less about his vacation and more about his reluctance to embrace his adult responsibilities. He devotes more thought to his weed-smoking buddy than to his own daughter’s experience. I can only wonder what memories Mimi will have of her Disney vacaton. It’s time to grow up, Mr. Sullivan!Maybe I’m just getting old (33 with two kids), but man, there is something about a story involving two parents scheming to do drugs at Disney World that provokes the “what the hell?” response in me. I dug the brief Disney World “did you know?” back story, as well as the high jinks involving the family, but at the end I thought this was more druggie blog (high on Americana?) than Times Magazine. Well written though — kudos to Sullivan.Best darn article I have ever read. Well, Top 10 anyway. My face hurts from smiling. Have been to Disney World with my two sons and can relate to so much of the author’s experience, with the exception of being high.I, too, used to be too good for Disney. After I had my first kid, I was forced to go with my husband’s family to Orlando. I realized about 10 minutes into it that the only way to survive was a complete suspension of my ironic hipster self. I had the time of my life.'"
"'11-06-26,'0','Agents have long known that looks can sell a house — hence the proliferation of stagers, who strip away clutter and personal items, leaving buyers room to imagine their belongings inside.Offering a house fully furnished is, in effect, the opposite of staging, said Ms. Engel, in that buyers must project themselves into surroundings filled with someone else’s carefully selected and artfully arranged belongings. “And if it makes you look good,” she added, “you’ll buy into it.”She is currently sharing a listing on a historic colonial in downtown New Canaan that failed to find a buyer when it was offered for more than $4 million in 2008. The place intimidated some buyers who couldn’t easily envision decorating an antique home themselves, Ms. Engel said.So she has made it less daunting by offering the professionally decorated five-bedroom house, listed for $3.295 million, with its traditional American décor in place. This time around, the old-timer comes complete with wingback chairs, the wall of leather-bound volumes (most in German or French), the floor-length floral curtains, even the kitchen cookbooks. Everything is included but the sports car in the garage.If the décor is not to everyone’s taste, Ms. Engel said, at the same time, “nothing’s ugly.”Houses sold completely furnished account for a sliver of the high-end market in Greenwich, according to Barbara Wells, a Realtor at Prudential Connecticut Realty.But if lock, stock and barrel purchases are unusual, offers on individual items — the brass carpet rods on the stairs or the dining room chandelier — are not.Ms. Wells was recently involved in the sale of a 10,000-square-foot house in Greenwich in which the buyers negotiated to keep not just the light fixtures and the draperies, but also the seating in the theater room.“It just makes life so much easier,” she said. “They have to have great jobs to afford these houses, and they’re very busy.”That was Ms. Fisher’s thinking when she decided to invest several hundred thousand dollars in remodeling her Westport property. Built in the 1970s, the house used to be “dreary and depressing,” she said. Now, the whitewashed interiors have been redone in a subtle nautical theme.Situated on nearly three acres on Sasco Creek, with a view beyond of Long Island Sound, the house is listed for $4.395 million.“We’re gearing it toward a specific buyer: a senior couple, probably boaters,” said Anthony Ardino, who is listing the property for William Raveis Real Estate. “We thought that by appointing the house, somebody would want to come in and just drop their bags.”But neither Mr. Ardino nor Ms. Engel actually expects a sale with all contents included. Their mission is to use the décor to sell the surroundings.A house that recently sold on Oenoke Ridge in New Canaan for $6.5 million was completely refurbished for sale and offered with all of its furnishings. The couple who bought it did not want them, however, because they had more modern pieces that fit the house well, Ms. Engel said.A difficulty in marketing a house that comes fully decorated and furnished is finding the right terminology for her sophisticated Fairfield County clientele, she added. She doesn’t want words that suggest the bland hotel décor of furnished vacation properties in Florida.Local multiple listing services don’t have a category for ready-to-move-in, just-bring-yourselves houses, and she is trying to come up with the language.“If I put a banner on my ad that said fully furnished,” she said, “buyers would recoil. It would be like saying, ‘Fast food.’ ”'"
"'11-06-26,'0','“All the stuff you get for starting your marriage, I wasn’t able to use,” Mrs. Marotta said. “I was bummed about that.” They wanted a second bedroom for storage, guests and maybe a baby in the future, as well as a second bathroom to eliminate the workday-morning squeeze.In a stronger market, they might have sold their co-op. But values of similar units in the building had dipped and were hovering around $360,000. So they decided to rent their place out and hunt for a two-bedroom two-bath rental in a calmer locale.In Westchester and on Long Island, they found few apartment complexes or private houses that allowed dogs. And they were alarmed by the cost of a monthly train ticket, plus a MetroCard for each of them: several hundred dollars a month. Both work downtown, Mrs. Marotta as a public relations executive and Mr. Marotta in the internal audit department of a bank.They planned to buy a car, too. They often visit their families in Queens and on Long Island, and needed an easy way to transport Kaya.Mrs. Marotta’s best childhood friend and her husband owned a condominium in Jersey City, so the Marottas knew the area was filled with new high-rise rental buildings. A 30-day unlimited PATH ticket was just $54. So they decided their best bet was Jersey City.As soon as they began searching, their budget rose well beyond $3,000 a month, from $2,500. “I think we were maybe out of touch with prices of luxury rentals,” Mrs. Marotta said.The buildings they saw all seemed nice, with waterfront locations, vistas of the Manhattan skyline and similar amenities. To the Marottas’ surprise and dismay, all included an extra charge for Kaya.They loved the views from the big windows at Aquablu, the newest of the Newport complex’s rental buildings. The monthly rent for two-bedroom two-bath apartments was in the low to high $3,000s. The pet fee was $300 per pet per year. The complex included a dog run, so the fee seemed reasonable, Mr. Marotta said.Parking was $190 a month. Use of the Newport pool was $77 per person per month. (Mr. Marotta thought a pool might be worth it.)Next up was the Pier, where two-bedrooms rent in the $3,000s. The pet fee was $500 per pet, plus a pet rent of $75 a month. There was a $500 one-time fee for amenities, a monthly charge of $200 for parking, and a flat monthly fee ($95 for a one-bedroom and $122 for a two-bedroom) covering water, sewer, trash and heat. Mr. Marotta objected. If the fee was obligatory, he said, it should be added to the rent instead of tacked on separately.At every building they saw, he asked immediately about extra fees. He found building Web sites annoying. Typically, they gave prominence to the lowest rental prices and touted their pet-friendliness, with only a glancing mention, if any, of additional charges.“I am always happy to see all charges and fees laid out — what consumer wouldn’t want that?” Mr. Marotta said.The not-so-fine print wasn’t endearing Jersey City’s new rental buildings to them. Meanwhile, they were monitoring Craigslist, intrigued by an ad for a two-bedroom two-bath apartment in the A Condominiums, where their friends lived. The brick and glass building was several years old and had a gym but no pool.“You usually don’t see rentals for that building,” Mrs. Marotta said.But this was a sublet. The rent was $3,100 furnished, plus $200 for parking. Over two months, the rent dropped. The parking fee vanished. The place was offered unfurnished.And, it turned out, the apartment was next door to their friends’.The owner, needing to relocate for work, was reluctant to sell in a soft market, just as the Marottas were. “It was a really good coincidence,” Mr. Marotta said, “so we pretty much fixated on that apartment. There was no nickel and diming.”The Marottas signed a two-year lease for $2,900 a month — which covered them, their dog and their new car — and moved in two months ago.Everyone is enjoying the space, where they play fetch both inside and on the balcony. Kaya walks, uninterrupted, on empty sidewalks. They hope to trade babysitting for dogwalking — their friends had a baby earlier this month. They joke that the only bad thing about Jersey City is leaving it, due to the horrific traffic in the Holland Tunnel.Meanwhile, through a StreetEasy ad, the Marottas quickly found a couple to rent their alcove studio for $2,300 a month. Their pet-friendly co-op has relatively lax rules when it comes to allowing renters, except for one thing: It charges them $300 a month for a pet.“It seems so hypocritical to me,” Mr. Marotta said. He would prefer a prohibition on pets to an exorbitant charge. “If you want to raise revenue, then at least put a number that is doable. It is so high nobody is going to pay it.”The rationale, he was told, was to deter pet ownership among renters, who might not care for pets or property with the same vigilance as owners. “I don’t get their logic,” he said. “My dog peed in the elevator when she was a puppy. I wasn’t a bad owner. That is just what dogs do.”'"

"'11-06-27,'1','One official says the shale industry may be “set up for failure.” “It is quite likely that many of these companies will go bankrupt,” a senior adviser to the Energy Information Administration administrator predicts. Several officials echo concerns raised during previous bubbles, in housing and in technology , for example, that ended in a bust.Energy Information Administration employees also explain in e-mails and documents, copies of which were obtained by , that industry estimates might overstate the amount of gas that companies can affordably get out of the ground.They discuss the uncertainties about how long the wells will be productive as well as the high prices some companies paid during the land rush to lease mineral rights. They also raise concerns about the unpredictability of shale gas drilling.One senior Energy Information Administration official describes an “irrational exuberance” around shale gas. An internal Energy Information Administration document says companies have exaggerated “the appearance of shale gas well profitability,” are highlighting the performance of only their best wells and may be using overly optimistic models for projecting the wells’ productivity over the next several decades.While there are environmental and economic benefits to natural gas compared with other fossil fuels, its widespread popularity as an energy source is relatively new. As a result, it has not received the same level of scrutiny, according to some environmentalists and energy economists.The Energy Information Administration e-mails indicate that some of these difficult questions are being raised.“Am I just totally crazy, or does it seem like everyone and their mothers are endorsing shale gas without getting a really good understanding of the economics at the business level?” an energy analyst at the Energy Information Administration wrote in an April 27 e-mail to a colleague.Another e-mail expresses similar doubts. “I agree with your concerns regarding the euphoria for shale gas and oil,”wrote a senior officialin the forecasting division of the Energy Information Administration in an April 13 e-mail to a colleague at the administration.“We might be in a ‘gold rush’ wherein a few folks have developed ‘monster’ wells,” he wrote, “so everyone assumes that all the wells will be ‘monsters.’ ”The Energy Information Administration’s annual reports are widely followed by investors, companies and policy makers because they are considered scientifically rigorous and independent from industry. They also inform legislators’ initiatives. Congress, for example, has been considering major subsidies to promote vehicles fueled by natural gas and cutting for the industry.In any organization as big as the Energy Information Administration, with its 370 or so employees, there inevitably will be differences of opinion, particularly in private e-mails shared among colleagues. A spokesman for the agency said that it stands by its reports, and that it has been clear about the uncertainties of shale gas production.“One guiding principle that we employ is, ‘look at the data,’ ” said Michael Schaal, director of the Office of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Analysis within the Energy Information Administration. “It is clear the data shows that shale gas has become a significant source of domestic natural gas supply.”But the doubts and concerns expressed in the e-mails and correspondence obtained by The Times are noteworthy because they are shared by many employees, some of them in senior roles. The documents and e-mails, which were provided to The Times by industry consultants, federal energy officials and Congressional researchers, show skepticism about shale gas economics, sometimes even from senior agency officials.The e-mails were provided by several people to The Times under the condition that the names of those sending and receiving them would not be used.Some of the e-mails suggest frustrations among the staff members in their attempt to push for a more accurate discussion of shale gas. One federal analyst, describing an Energy Information Administration publication on shale gas, complained that the administration shared the industry’s optimism. “It seems that science is pointing in one direction and industry PR is pointing in another,” wrote the analyst about shale gas drilling in an e-mail. “We still have to present the middle, even if the middle neglects to point out the strengths of scientific evidence over PR.”The Energy Information Administration, with its mission of providing “independent and impartial energy information to promote sound policymaking” and “efficient markets,” was created in response to the energy crisis of the 1970s because lawmakers believed that sound data could help the country avoid similar crises in the future.As a protection from industry or political pressure, the Energy Information Administration’s reports, by law, are supposed to be independent and do not require approval by any other arm of government.Its administrator, Richard G. Newell, who announced this month his plans to resign to take a job at , has hailed the prospects for shale gas, calling it a “game changer” in the United States energy mix. “The energy outlook for natural gas has changed dramatically over the past several years,” Mr. Newell told the Natural Gas Roundtable, a nonprofit group tied to the American Gas Association. “The most significant story is the transformative role played by shale gas.”A number of factors have also helped create more interest in shale gas. The nuclear disaster in in March has focused attention on the promise of natural gas as a safer energy source.And last year, as energy market analysts warned about tougher federal regulations on oil and , particularly after the and the Massey coal mining accident, they also pointed to natural gas as a more attractive .But a look at the Energy Information Administration’s methods raises questions about its independence from energy companies, since the industry lends a helping hand to the government to compile those bullish reports.The Energy Information Administration, for example, relies on research from outside consultants with ties to the industry. And some of those consultants pull the data they supply to the government from energy company news releases, according to Energy Information Administration e-mails. Projections about future supplies of natural gas are based not just on science but also some guesswork and modeling.Two of the primary contractors, Intek and Advanced Resources International, provided shale gas estimates and data for the Energy Information Administration’s major annual forecasting reports on domestic and foreign oil and gas resources. Both of them have major clients in the oil and gas industry, according to corporate tax records from the contractors. The president of Advanced Resources, Vello A. Kuuskraa, is also a stockholder and board member of , an energy company heavily involved in drilling for gas in the Fayetteville shale formation in .The contractors said they did not see any conflict of interest. “Firstly, the report is an extremely transparent assessment,” said Tyler Van Leeuwen, an analyst at Advanced Resources, adding that many experts agreed with its conclusions and that by identifying promising areas, the report heightened competition for Southwestern.Intek verified that it produced data for Energy Information Administration reports but declined to comment on questions about whether, given its ties to industry, it had a conflict of interest.Some government watchdog groups, however, faulted the Energy Information Administration for not maintaining more independence from industry.“E.I.A.’s heavy reliance on industry for their analysis fundamentally undermines the agency’s mission to provide independent expertise,” said Danielle Brian, the executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a group that investigates federal agencies and Congress.“The Chemical Safety Board and the both show that government agencies can conduct complex, niche analysis without being captured or heavily relying upon industry expertise,” Ms. Brian added, referring to two independent federal agencies that conduct investigations of accidents.These sorts of concerns have also led to complaints within the administration itself.In an April 27 e-mail, a senior petroleum geologist who works for the Energy Information Administration wrote that upper management relied too heavily on outside contractors and used “incomplete/selective and all too often unreal data,” much of which comes from industry news releases“E.I.A., irrespective of what or how many ‘specialty’ contractors are hired, is NOT TECHNICALLY COMPETENT to estimate the undiscovered resources of anything made by Mother Nature, period,” he wrote.Energy officials have also quietly criticized in internal e-mails the department’s shale gas primer, a source of information for the public, saying it may be “on the rosy side.”The primer is written by the Ground Water Protection Council, a research group that, according to tax records, is partly financed by industry.The Ground Water Protection Council declined to respond to questions.Tiffany Edwards, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said that the shale gas primer was never intended as a comprehensive review and that further study was continuing.Asked about the views expressed in the internal e-mails, Mr. Schaal says his administration has been very explicit in acknowledging the uncertainties surrounding shale gas development.He said news reports and company presentations were included among a range of information sources used in Energy Information Administration studies. Though the administration depends on contractors with specialized expertise, he added, it conforms with all relevant federal rules.And while production from shale gas has not slowed down and may not any time soon, he said, a lively debate continues within the administration about shale gas prospects.'"

"'11-06-27,'1','American officials on Sunday characterized the attacks carried out by LulzSec as “nuisances” rather than real security threats. One government official said that LulzSec had never penetrated government servers or stolen any classified information.“What we are really worried about is people getting access to our systems, or putting malware on it,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.The official said that even though it was possible that LulzSec had disbanded, hackers tended to operate in a world of shifting alliances and it would be easy for a new group copying LulzSec’s techniques to appear in the future.“All it takes is one guy in his basement to do this, not an organized group,” the official said.On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security plans to introduce a system to help institutions eliminate common programming errors that allow hackers to easily infiltrate databases and steal user names and passwords. The agency’s hope is that the program, which is voluntary, will make it easier for companies and agencies to better secure their corners of the Internet, thus contributing to a safer global network.Some security experts and hackers were skeptical of LulzSec’s sudden about-face and said they believed the group intended to continue its activities. The latest announcement could be just another ploy for attention, rival hackers said on Twitter and on private online message boards.Over the last several weeks, LulzSec had said repeatedly on its Twitter feed that it planned to continue attacking governments and financial institutions indefinitely.Members of LulzSec did not respond to phone calls and e-mails on Sunday.Whatever happens to LulzSec, the brash and public brand of hacking that it embraced and defined may be here to stay, some experts say. The group’s attacks on prominent targets, accompanied by raucous bragging on social networks and chat rooms, helped it amass more than 280,000 followers on Twitter. It has used that megaphone, as well as chat rooms, to try to recruit more hackers to its ranks.Some of LulzSec’s activities had a political tinge. For example, it said its theft and public disclosure of Arizona law enforcement records was in response to the state’s tough laws aimed at illegal immigrants. But the group claimed that its hacking was primarily a celebration of the “lulz,” or laughs, and the members seemed to lap up the media attention they generated.But if LulzSec had continued, it would have faced an increasing risk that its members would be captured, said Chris Wysopal, the chief technology officer of the security firm Veracode.“By stopping now and regrouping, I think they will live to hack another day,” he said. “If anything, there will be more people hacking in their footsteps.”Mr. Wysopal added, “Until they’re arrested — if they ever do get arrested — I don’t think anything will slow down.”The recent flurry of hacking done for notoriety rather than financial gain “feels like a kind of return to a period in the past,” said Gabriella Coleman, an assistant professor at New York University who is studying groups like LulzSec and Anonymous.In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of hacker groups brazenly attacked some major institutions. That wave was largely squelched after a crackdown in which well-known hackers, including Kevin Mitnick, were caught and given heavy punishments, Ms. Coleman said.After that, hackers began working more quietly, and many joined the security industry, where there was a safer place to employ their skills. Meanwhile, organized crime began moving online, following the money that was flowing through Web-based commerce and banking systems.The return of more public hacking has been inspired by WikiLeaks, whose disclosure of reams of United States government documents showed hackers and the computer adept that they could use their skills to participate in a new way in the public sphere, Ms. Coleman said.That notion was fed by Anonymous, a large collective of online hackers that opposed the Church of Scientology, championed freedom on the Internet and came to the defense of WikiLeaks by attacking the Web sites of companies like MasterCard and PayPal, which had refused to process donations to WikiLeaks after it disclosed confidential diplomatic cables.More recently, Anonymous has gotten behind an array of international political causes, from the democratic uprisings in the Middle East to anticorruption protests in India.LulzSec began as a splinter group from Anonymous, and LulzSec’s members now seem to be focusing on operating through that larger network.To judge from purported discussions between LulzSec members that were posted online by a rival hacker known as the Jester, the internal operations of LulzSec seem as chaotic as the anarchistic behavior online. The messages show continual infighting among group members as pressure from law enforcement agencies has increased, and some members have reportedly quit.But publicly, LulzSec insisted that its 50 days of online pandemonium had come to an end, its members would continue attacks on governments and corporations, either as part of a different group or acting individually.Perhaps to win allies, it called the new effort “AntiSec” in an apparent effort to tap an older, similarly named movement among malicious hackers known as “black hats” that opposed working cooperatively with software makers and the security industry to fix security vulnerabilities.'"
"'11-06-27,'1','The average price for regular gasoline at filling stations in the United States fell 11.22 cents to about $3.63 a gallon, according to the Lundberg Survey, a market research company.The price covers the two-week period that ended Friday and is derived from a survey of about 2,500 filling stations nationwide by Trilby Lundberg. She said that prices had dropped 37.2 cents a gallon since they hit almost $4 a gallon on average on May 8.“The rate of decline was reduced in the latest two weeks, but we have yet to see the impact of the government sale of crude,” Ms. Lundberg said Sunday.Prices have fallen after member countries of the International Energy Agency said last week they would release 60 million barrels of oil from emergency stockpiles and on concern that the United States and European economies are weakening.“If we suppose that crude oil prices fall another few dollars, then this could accelerate the drop another 20 cents” for gasoline, Ms. Lundberg said. “Poor economic news continues to be a factor in petroleum prices for crude and gasoline, with or without putting government oil up for bid.”Separately, AAA reported this weekend that the number of Americans traveling by automobile during the Independence Day holiday would fall 3 percent to 32.8 million, from 33.7 million a year earlier.'"
"'11-06-27,'1','Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers, William W. Taylor III and Benjamin Brafman, have sought from prosecutors any video recordings, including anything from the restaurant on West 52nd Street near Avenue of the Americas, the New York outpost of a nationwide chain. (The choice, perhaps incongruous for a man renting a town house listed for $50,000 a month, was made by his daughter, according to the person familiar with the defense inquiry.)But it is unclear whether the police and prosecutors have any recordings from the restaurant, and, if they do, what they show. Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, and Erin M. Duggan, the chief spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office, would not discuss the issue. Tori Harms, a spokeswoman for the restaurant company, which is based in Portland, Ore., would not answer questions about the matter, saying in a statement that “it is always our policy to cooperate fully with law enforcement authorities when matters or investigations involve our company” and that the company does not “discuss publicly details about any restaurant guest without his or her consent.”What seems clear, however, is that along with the details of the encounter on May 14 — prosecutors say Mr. Strauss-Kahn ripped the woman’s panty hose, tried to rape her and forced her to perform oral sex, while his lawyers say there is no evidence of force and suggest that any sex was consensual — both sides have focused on events later that day.At issue are Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s movements in the hours between the incident, which prosecutors say occurred around noon, and when police detectives from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey lured him from his first-class seat on Air France Flight 23 at 4:40 p.m., minutes before it was to depart Kennedy Airport for Paris.While few details have been made public, a picture of Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s afternoon has begun to emerge from interviews with people briefed on the defense inquiry and through court records filed in the case.Mr. Strauss-Kahn checked out of his suite, Room 2806 at the Sofitel on West 44th Street near Avenue of the Americas, at 12:28 p.m., according to a bail application filed on his behalf.One of the prosecutors in the case, John A. McConnell, said at Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s arraignment on May 16 that video recordings from a security camera in the hotel lobby that show him leaving “minutes after the incident” depict what “appears to be a man who was in a hurry.”Mr. Brafman, however, said then that Mr. Strauss-Kahn was rushing to his luncheon appointment.Mr. Strauss-Kahn traveled from the hotel by taxi, bringing along his two small dark-colored bags, one an overnight case and the other a briefcase, according to the person briefed on the defense investigation.Detoured by the street fair, traffic moved slowly, the person said. It took him 15 minutes to cover the eight blocks, arriving at roughly 12:45 p.m., according to the bail application.He and his daughter, the person who was briefed said, sat in one of several booths at the restaurant, which have dark green leather seat cushions and plush chenille backs and look out onto West 52nd Street.At Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s bail hearing on May 19, another of his lawyers, Mr. Taylor, called the meal “a leisurely lunch with a member of his family.”At the end of the meal, according to the person, father and daughter were joined briefly by her boyfriend; the meeting, the person said, was the reason for Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s visit to New York. Mr. Strauss-Kahn paid for lunch with his credit card, the person said.He was back in another taxi and headed to Kennedy Airport at 2:15 p.m., Mr. Taylor said at the May 19 hearing.On his way to the airport, he apparently realized he had lost track of one of the several phones he usually carried, and he used another to dial his daughter, the person said. The missing phone was the one issued by the I.M.F. and he was apparently concerned about sensitive material on the device, the person said.He asked his daughter to return to the restaurant to look for it, the person said, which she did. She and the waitress who had served them lunch were later seen crawling on the floor, looking under the table, another person with knowledge of the matter said.But they had no luck, and he eventually called the Sofitel at 3:29 p.m. to say he had left his phone in his suite, according to court papers filed by the prosecution. The police were already there, responding to the reports of the attack, and they listened in on the call, coaching a hotel employee to say the hotel would look for the phone in his room, according to the court papers. During a second call, at 3:42 p.m., Mr. Strauss-Kahn was told the hotel employee would bring his phone to him. In a third call, at 4:03 p.m., he asked when the hotel employee would arrive.He had arrived at Kennedy around 3 p.m., and a security camera there had captured a man that may have been him arriving at the curbside drop-off, according to a person with knowledge of his movements at the airport.Air France security cameras photographed him being escorted through the terminal by two Air France employees, and being shepherded through airport security screening and to the airline’s first-class lounge by one of the Air France employees, the person said.Any Air France recordings are also being sought by the defense, according to their discovery demand, a document that seeks evidence the prosecution may possess, but the person said that the airline had told investigators that additional recordings made by a security camera in the lounge, where he was awaiting the return of his phone, had been recorded over and were not available.It was apparently his effort to get the phone that ultimately resulted in his capture, according to the papers filed by the prosecution.The papers suggest that Mr. Strauss-Kahn left his seat and came to the doorway of the jetliner moments before the plane was to leave because he believed the two men there were hotel employees bringing him his phone.As he approached the men on the Gate 4 jetway at 4:40 p.m., he asked them, apparently before either had a chance to speak, “Do you have my cellphone?” according to the document.But the men, Detectives Terry Ng and Dewan Maharaj of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department, did not, and the document included the following exchange.“We would like you to come with us,” the detective said.'"
"'11-06-27,'1','Microsoft, Apple and Google — worth more than $650 billion combined — seem to have plenty of growth left in the tank, but it is not evident in their stock valuations. The shares of all three tech giants, after accounting for their cash hoards, trade at a discount to the market. This phenomenon is not new. Investors shunned the sector for long stretches twice over the last 40 years, worrying that obsolescence might pre-empt expansion.Intel, for one, can vouch for the experience. In the mid-1970s, shares of the rapidly growing chip maker could have been bought for just six times earnings. Few tech investors seized the opportunity, however, because of a recent scarring.A few years earlier, upstart mainframe companies like Control Data had been all the rage. And I.B.M. and Xerox once boasted spots in the list of “nifty fifty” large caps, whose growth was supposed to continue steadily unabated. Those bubbles popped when computer orders slowed and economic hard times hit blue-chip corporations.By the early 1980s, investors had regained their zeal for growth stocks. Hewlett-Packard, with its hot-selling desktops, was bid up to 28 times expected earnings. Intel regained favor, too, and was valued at a heady 60 times. Meanwhile, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was trading at a mere multiple of 12.Recession brought a fresh malaise at the end of that decade. Valuations on many smaller tech companies sank below even the cash on their books, according to Fred Hickey’s High Tech Strategist newsletter. More significant, growth companies suffered along with industry gorillas. Compaq, a leader in the sizzling PC market, was expanding its bottom line by more than 60 percent a year but traded at just nine times earnings, or about half the multiple of the broader market. It took another five years for tech stocks to rebound.'"
"'11-06-27,'1','Though the top leaders are now in court, many thousands of Khmer Rouge continue to live among the people they abused and will never face justice. The trial is expected to last for years, and the age and ill health of the defendants is a concern to court officials.Procedural hearings taking place now were to include managing the assignment of medical officers to assess the defendants’ mental and physical fitness to face trial. The physical condition of some of the defendants could influence the schedule set by the court in the months to come. Testimony in the case was expected to begin in August or September.The top Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998 before he could be brought to trial. Other possible defendants, including Son Sen, Pol Pot’s right-hand man, and Ta Mok, a top military commander, have also died.One Khmer Rouge figure has already been tried and convicted: Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who ran the main prison and torture house of the Khmer Rouge. He was sentenced to a term of 35 years that was reduced to 19 years. An appeal is pending.The tribunal is something of an experiment, attempting to graft international standards of justice onto Cambodia’s weak and politically malleable court system. A Cambodian prosecutor and Cambodian judges work together with foreign counterparts.The process has been dogged by accusations of corruption and manipulation by the Cambodian government.In the latest controversy, the international co-prosecutor, Andrew Cayley, is attempting to push ahead with cases against four more defendants, despite the assertion by Prime Minister Hun Sen that two cases were enough and the opposition of the Cambodian co-prosecutor, who echoed that view.Nevertheless, Mr. Cayley commended the government for bringing top figures to trial.“The Cambodian government itself brought about this process,” he said in a telephone interview. “The Cambodian government arrested these people and brought them into custody, and whatever the criticisms are, they have to be given credit for that.”In an innovation, the tribunal is including victims as civil parties whose lawyers have the right to question witnesses and demand reparations. A recent court decision allowed the inclusion of 3,850 victims in the current case.The trial is complex, said Clair Duffy, who has observed it for the Open Society Justice Initiative, a private legal and human rights group. In addition to the thousands of civil parties, it involves a 700-page indictment, hundreds of witnesses, thousands of pages of documentary evidence, scores of lawyers in the courtroom and three working languages — Khmer, English and French.It is also likely to be drawn out as the lawyers for the four defendants pursue different strategies, including the possible exchanges of accusations among the defendants themselves.Already in a pretrial court appearance, Mrs. Ieng Thirith has accused Mr. Nuon Chea of responsibility for the killings. In his trial, Duch also said he received orders from senior leaders, and it is possible that he could be a witness in the current trial.After the Khmer Rouge was driven from power in January 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion, its leaders and fighters retreated into the jungles and carried out a decade-long guerrilla war.As the insurgency collapsed, Mr. Nuon Chea and Mr. Khieu Samphan surrendered at the end of 1998 and were allowed to live quietly in a remote town that had been one of the last Khmer Rouge strongholds.Mr. Ieng Sary and his wife lived in an expensive villa in downtown Phnom Penh until all four defendants were arrested in 2007 and brought to a specially built jail, which they share with Duch, on the grounds of the tribunal.All four have been reported to have medical problems, and court officers say they are receiving the best care the country has to offer.'"
"'11-06-27,'1','SINSHEIM, Germany (AP) — On a great day for women’s soccer, it was a good day for Europe’s teams.The Women’s World Cup opened Sunday with two stadiums overflowing with goodwill, color and the cheer of nearly 100,000 fans. There were also four goals, including one stunner. Germany, the two-time defending champion, survived opening-game jitters to beat Canada, 2-1, in Berlin and showed that it will be the team to beat.France won the tournament opener against Nigeria, 1-0, in Sinsheim in the other match in Group A. The United States begins play in the 16-team tournament Tuesday, facing North Korea in Group C in Dresden.Beyond the games themselves, the upbeat spirit of the women’s game stood out Sunday. Riding the enthusiasm of the crowds, the atmosphere approached that of the men’s 2006 World Cup — also in Germany — even if the action rarely did.One clear exception came at Berlin’s Olympic Stadium. Canada’s Christine Sinclair, playing with a broken nose for most of the second half, highlighted the day with a stunning, perfectly curled free kick late in the game. That briefly gave Canada hope, but Germany survived on grit and goals by Kerstin Garefrekes and Celia Okoyino Da Mbabi.“The doctors told me her nose was broken, but she asked me to let her play,” Canada’s coach, Carolina Morace, said. “I asked if it would be dangerous, but Christine is a smart player — she knows what she can do and what she can’t do.”'"
"'11-06-27,'1','The title “Vincent Wants to Sea” is a painfully unpunny translation of the original German title “Vincent Will Meer,” a homophone of “Vincent will mehr” or “Vincent wants more.” Both titles boldly underline the metaphorical significance of the film’s literal journey — a road-trip from Munich to the Mediterranean by way of the Swiss Alps. The exact meanings may get lost in translation, but trite is a universal language apparently.Vincent (Florian David Fitz, who also wrote the screenplay) is a sensitive 27-year-old recluse with Tourette’s syndrome. His alcoholic mother has just died from cirrhosis, and his estranged father (Heino Ferch), a callous politician, has him committed to a psychiatric clinic so as not to disrupt the re-election campaign. But Vincent soon breaks out, and joined by an acerbic anorexic (Karoline Herfurth) and a neurotically fastidious obsessive-compulsive (Johannes Allmayer), he embarks on a quest to fulfill his mother’s final wish that her ashes be scattered over the Italian sea.Sounds pretty bleak. But don’t worry: every downbeat is pillowed in soft rock and gentle humor, every Ricola-commercial mountainscape is graced by colorful lens flares and rolling fog, and every clinical disorder is just an unredeemed ticket to self-realization. The principal characters can be reduced to a handful of tics, and the entire story line is immaculately devoid of incidental detail. It’s like sitting in a padded cell for about 90 minutes.That this film took the best-picture and actor prizes at this year’s German Film Awards is enough to make anyone a true believer in Hollywood.Directed by Ralf Huettner; written by Florian David Fitz; director of photography, Andreas Berger; edited by Kai Schroeter; music by Stevie B-Zet and Ralf Hildenbeutel; art direction by Heidi Lüdi; costumes by Natascha Curtius-Noss; produced by Viola Jäger and Harald Kügler; released by Corinth Films.

"'11-06-27,'1','The attacks have grown increasingly bold. On Friday, a suicide car bomber here in Aden killed three soldiers and a civilian, and wounded a dozen others. On Wednesday, at least 40 prisoners, including some Qaeda members convicted in a plot to attack the United States Embassy in Sana, escaped after a daring raid by gunmen on a prison in the town of Mukalla, 300 miles to the east, local officials said.The militants’ expansion is a serious concern for the United States, which has twice been made a target by Al Qaeda’s Yemen-based branch. So far, the American military has relied on airstrikes aimed at militant leaders, with mixed success.Thousands of refugees have streamed into Aden in recent weeks, telling shocking stories of the heavily armed jihadists who in late May captured the city of Zinjibar, a provincial capital less than an hour’s drive from here. The jihadists have delivered speeches calling for Islamic rule from mosque loudspeakers, the refugees say. Their members include men speaking in Saudi, Iraqi and Sudanese accents. They carry white banners with the words “Ansar al Sharia” on them — a name that Qaeda leaders identified this year as an alternate name for their own organization in Yemen.Many residents of Zinjibar said they were appalled by the Yemeni military’s quick retreat from the town and other areas in Abyan Province, just north and east of here.“These Al Qaeda people — they are mostly kids, young men,” said Ali Omar al-Qurshi, 49, camped out on the cement floor of a school in Aden along with several hundred other displaced people. “Are you telling me the army can’t defeat them? It’s a very strange thing. Honestly, we feel Ali Abdullah Saleh is behind it.”Some officials from the town said that they had no choice but to leave, and they denied that they had received orders to do so.“It was a war — they came with so many armed men,” Mr. Zawari, the governor of Abyan Province, said as he sat in an empty hotel lobby here. “They took advantage of the situation. Everything is divided now, the government, the army.”Zinjibar is now an eerie and silent wasteland, the refugees say, its houses shattered by artillery and machine guns, its streets full of the dead. Dogs have begun to feed on the corpses. Only a few young men stayed on, guarding their family houses against theft. The same is true of some other villages in the area, and of Jaar, a town seized by Islamist militants in March.General Somli, the army commander whose forces are in a base at the edge of Zinjibar, insisted during a telephone interview that the battle was over and that residents could return. But a number of residents who have returned to check on their houses said the town was firmly under the control of the militants. They said General Somli was effectively trapped at his base, and had done little to fight the militants beyond firing artillery shells at them, leveling many of the town’s houses in the process.Although the refugees were all deeply upset by the violence that had forced them from their homes, most seemed more frightened by the Yemeni military than the gunmen. Several refugees said the gunmen used loudspeakers to warn residents to leave their homes, especially in areas where the military was shelling heavily. The army, they said, showed no such concern for civilians.Some residents said they had initially been frightened by the gunmen, many of whom wore their hair long like northern tribesmen. But they added that the fighters treated them more respectfully than the local security and police officials, who are widely viewed as occupiers, or worse.“These Al Qaeda people didn’t steal our houses, they protected them,” said Ali Muhammad Hassan, a 31-year-old government clerk. “If they saw people carrying furniture or other things, looters, they would tell them to return it.”Mr. Hassan and others also said the militants seemed highly disciplined and had put local Yemenis in charge rather than northerners or foreign jihadists, in an apparent bid for grass-roots support.“They seemed to have a clear military plan,” he said. “They moved in cells; they were highly organized.”Zinjibar was not the first town captured by militants. Jaar, a smaller town about 12 miles away, was captured in March. The militants overran several smaller villages in the area as well, forcing out the local officials and police, according to several refugees.This month, another group of Islamists — apparently not connected to the ones in Zinjibar — attacked and occupied part of Hawta, a town in the neighboring province of Lahj. The governor fled there, too, residents said.'"

"'11-06-28,'1','To pick a candidate, the Socialists have scheduled a two-round primary for October. The only serious candidates so far, with the entry deadline coming soon, are François Hollande, 56, a legislator and former party leader, and his former partner, Ségolène Royal, 57, with whom he has four children and who lost the 2007 election to Nicolas Sarkozy.The current party leader, Martine Aubry, 60, announced her candidacy on Tuesday morning; she had a now-irrelevant agreement with Mr. Strauss-Kahn not to run against him. Mr. Hollande, who also runs the small departmental government of Corrèze, is currently in the lead, according to opinion polls, and he has had the time to prepare himself — he has lost considerable weight — and his campaign, which was originally aimed at defeating Mr. Strauss-Kahn.But none of these candidates, or Mr. Moscovici himself, has the domestic or international stature that Mr. Strauss-Kahn had, and it is less clear that any of them will be able to appeal to centrist voters as he did. “The battle is open, but the risk is to have a very divisive fight,” Mr. Moscovici said. “This is ‘the narcissism of small differences,’ as Freud said. The candidates are really not so different.”Making matters more complicated, the primary system the Socialists have outlined is odd, with any French person who states “sympathy with the left” being eligible to vote. Voters do not have to be party members or even registered to vote.The head of Mr. Sarkozy’s party, Jean-François Copé, has charged that the primaries are open to abuse, since records will be made of those who evince a sympathy for the left. The Socialists say those records will be destroyed within a week and accuse Mr. Copé of making mischief. But Mr. Moscovici said he was more concerned that since anyone can vote, Mr. Copé “can send out a message to thousands of Sarkozy supporters” telling them to vote for a weak Socialist candidate.It is early yet, with the presidential election scheduled for next May, but the opinion polls continue to show Mr. Sarkozy in a weak position in his effort to win a second five-year term. Both Mr. Hollande and Ms. Aubry would beat Mr. Sarkozy in a second-round runoff, and Ms. Royal would come close.“The good news,” Mr. Moscovici said, is that “Sarkozy is still in terrible shape.” Even after Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s disappearance, “people still reject Sarkozy and expect a new president,” he said. “Almost any Socialist defeats him.”Still, he conceded, “there is some new doubt among us and around us about whether in the end we will win this election.” The Socialist campaign is dominated by Mr. Hollande and Ms. Aubry, he said, “but no one clearly sees them as presidential.”Mr. Sarkozy is a skillful campaigner, and while the French do not like him very much, they do like a number of his policies, including his management of the economic crisis and his leadership in the war to oust the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.Mr. Sarkozy is trying to consolidate the center-right behind him and see off potential candidates in the tricky first round of the election. The loss of Mr. Strauss-Kahn is considered to leave more room for a centrist candidate, and a divided center-right, given the strength of the far right National Front behind Marine Le Pen, could result in Mr. Sarkozy running third in the first round and being eliminated.But the same risk exists on the left, where numerous candidates from the Greens to the far left could divide the vote, pushing the Socialist candidate into third, which happened in 2002.While for the moment Mr. Sarkozy is most concerned with undermining the support for Ms. Le Pen, the easiest path for his re-election would be to run against her in the second round.For Mr. Moscovici, the temptation to run in the primaries is strong, but he fears further dividing the party. If Mr. Strauss-Kahn had decided not to run a year ago, Mr. Moscovici would have run, he said.For now, he has sent a set of policy ideas to Mr. Hollande and Ms. Aubry, who have both approached him for support, and he is weighing his choices.“Above all, we need to have good primaries and a good debate,” Mr. Moscovici said. “And then we need to get together after the primaries and run a good campaign against a very good campaigner.”'"
"'11-06-28,'1','Iran unveiled underground silos on Monday that would make its missiles less vulnerable to attack, marking the country’s latest show of force in the long standoff with the West over its nuclear program.State television broadcast images of an unspecified number of silos deep underground, saying they held medium- and long-range missiles ready to hit distant targets. Subterranean silos are considered harder to destroy than surface installations, and Iran hailed them as a defensive asset meant to thwart attackers.Col. Asghar Qelichkhani said the silos “function as a swift-reaction unit.” State TV quoted him as saying that the missiles were permanently in the vertical position and “ready to hit the predetermined targets.”The silos were presented as Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards began 10 days of military exercises.Western powers have long cited evidence that Iran was investigating the design of nuclear warheads for its missiles, a charge Tehran denies. It insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.Western news organizations have reported sketchy evidence of the existence of Iranian missile silos near Tabriz and Khorramabad in northwest Iran. The presentation on Monday seemed to confirm the veracity of the scattered reports, if not the exact locations of the silos.'"

"'11-06-28,'1','Microsoft’s long-awaited move, analysts say, is a studiously crafted bet, including various offerings at different prices. They are not sure whether it represents wishful thinking or a workable strategy. Microsoft’s plan is to embrace the demand for cloud-based tools for office workers, which promise to be less costly for companies than conventional software, and yet avoid cannibalizing a business that is its biggest single money-maker.“If Microsoft stumbles, it really opens the door to Google,” said Matt Cain, an analyst for Gartner. “It’s a tremendous long-term threat to Microsoft and its Office franchise.”The Microsoft unit that includes the Office family of products is a $20 billion-a-year business with pretax profit margins of 60 percent. The business is even larger than the company’s other big profit engine, the Windows PC operating system.Google portrays the arrival of Office 365 as an endorsement, if not a capitulation. “This is a recognition that our business is for real,” said David Girouard, president of Google’s enterprise division. “We’ve really helped move the needle in the marketplace.”The company now claims more than 30 million active users of Google Apps, its collection of online office productivity and communications programs. But about 12 million of those users are university staff and students, who typically get free access to the apps. The standard charge for business and government customers is $50 per user a year. Google will not disclose how many customers pay that fee.It does say it is gaining momentum. Just this month, Google announced a series of large converts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal agency that conducts climate and ocean studies, with 25,000 employees, is adopting Google Apps. Others include the State of Wyoming, with 10,000 workers, and the McClatchy Group, a publishing chain, with 8,500 workers.The subscription renewal rates to Google Apps, Mr. Girouard said, are higher than 90 percent and for larger companies the rate is nearly 100 percent.There are other cloud-based business e-mail, productivity and collaboration tools including entries from Zoho, Zimbra from VMware, Lotus Live from I.B.M. and Chatter from Salesforce.com.Yet Google, analysts say, is the main rival that Microsoft has in mind with Office 365. “There’s no doubt that the increasing popularity of Google Apps has forced Microsoft’s hand,” said Melissa Webster, an analyst at IDC. “But Microsoft is really embracing the cloud now. This is the other shoe dropping.”At $50 a year, Google’s pricing seems far more appealing than the standard price for the Office PC software, from $200 to about $400, depending on features. Office 365 prices are from $2 per user a month to $27 per user a month. The $2-a-month service is just e-mail and is intended for companies that want to extend communications to employees currently not served, like factory workers. The $27-a-month offering is for all the online features, including Web conferencing and digital whiteboards for team projects, and a license to the most powerful version of the Office personal computer software.A $6-a-month offering is aimed at extending Microsoft’s e-mail server services and collaboration tools, like SharePoint, to small businesses. These small businesses typically have the Office PC software, but not the related software, analysts say.With cloud-based versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint, plus several new communications and collaboration tools, that offering could be quite appealing, analysts say. The price, at $72 a year, is somewhat above Google’s, but it carries the Microsoft name and familiarity. “It could be a lot of net new business, and stable recurring revenue, if Microsoft can pull it off,” Ms. Webster said.'"
"'11-06-28,'1','“Very clear rules are needed, and very understandable institutions — a very good judicial system, so that everybody will feel confident in his investments, in fair arbitration, in courts and in very efficient work of the government and federal bodies under its authority,” he said. “Of course, we will get away from our dependence on oil. It will be very difficult — it is necessary to create good rules of the game, and both Putin and Medvedev understand it.”“They understand it a little bit differently,” he added. “As a whole, yes, they understand it. Probably they are ready — I think they are ready for this work. I know this from our discussions. This is why, in principle, Russia will improve its investment climate and carry out reforms under either leader.”The Russian government is acutely aware of this line of reasoning, and on Saturday relaunched a party, Right Cause, which is meant to capture the aspirations of liberals and small businessmen disenchanted with United Russia, the political party Mr. Putin leads. Its new leader is Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the Kremlin-friendly billionaire owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team, who vowed to build a two-party political system. He was careful not to openly criticize Mr. Putin.Mr. Kudrin had already refused the position, to the evident frustration of President Medvedev. He explained last week that the new party needed to be built from the ground up, and that his government work would not allow for such an effort.But he said that he wholeheartedly supported the creation of a strong liberal party, and that the decision by no means foreclosed his role as an advocate of its causes. “I will always facilitate the development of the political system toward greater transparency and strengthening of those who defend rightist views,” he said. “Yes, of course I will facilitate this.”Vladimir V. Pozner, who hosts a political talk show on Channel One, said he believed Mr. Kudrin had made a calculated decision to step up his criticism during a pivotal period in Russian politics. “He is a major figure in the government setup of the Russian Federation, and he knows very well that when he says something it’s not just hot air,” Mr. Pozner said. “Who is it aimed at? I think it’s aimed at Putin.”“He knows that he has a very strong position — he is not opposition, in any political sense,” Mr. Pozner said. Political change, he added, “has to come from on top. And there is a strong liberal element that has some hold on power.”Mr. Kudrin’s importance is anchored in history. In 1996, he and Anatoly B. Chubais helped bring Mr. Putin to Moscow. Mr. Kudrin, then deputy chief of the presidential administration, recommended Mr. Putin as his replacement the next year, setting the stage for his rise through Russia’s political firmament.As Mr. Putin’s finance minister, Mr. Kudrin made it his mission to steer oil revenues into a stabilization fund, and he made influential enemies. He clashed with hard-liners behind the scenes, but remained quiet, at least in public, as Mr. Putin consolidated control over Russia’s political system. Russia’s weathering of the 2008 financial crisis vindicated Mr. Kudrin’s position, leaving him more secure than ever.After that his criticism slowly sharpened. This reached its clearest point in February when, during a speech at the Krasnoyarsk Economic Forum, he said Russia would not achieve its economic goals without introducing real political competition. He repeated that thesis in April remarks to the State Duma.Mr. Kudrin said the shift in his public language reflected “some stages of my personal development.” He spoke with pride of his accomplishments in imposing transparency on the federal budget, and said the time had come to extend that effort to the whole government.Mr. Kudrin is an ardent supporter of liberal arts education, which runs against the grain in a country whose schools encourage early specialization. Since 2003, he has served as a trustee of the Smolny Institute, an unusual dual degree program with Bard.The program’s future looked murky a few years ago, when the university’s new rector, Nikolai M. Kropachev, set about a strict review of independent programs within the university. Mr. Kudrin argued for transforming the Smolny Institute into something more prominent — Russia’s first free-standing department of liberal arts and sciences — and offered to step in as dean, a position that officials say will require him to spend about a day a month on its campus.“A new rector came in and he decided to review this program,” Mr. Kudrin said. “This worried many people. They thought that the rector’s attitude toward the program was somewhat cool. But today everything is O.K.”“Probably my attention to this department also allowed him to be more attentive,” he said.Susan H. Gillespie, director of the Institute for International Liberal Education at Bard, said she had been struck by Mr. Kudrin’s immersion in the details of teaching and curriculum.“In the United States, I cannot imagine any of our public figures doing this,” Ms. Gillespie said. “It’s improbable. Imagine Timothy Geithner stepping in to save a Russian-American exchange program and putting his name on the line. I don’t see it happening.”'"

I did so with casual indifference: like the fall of the Berlin Wall, gay marriage was not going to happen in my lifetime, so what was the point?Twenty-five years from now, people will wonder what the big deal was.

Same-sex marriage should not be left to a change in public perception or to the whim of the electorate or its elected representatives.The very bedrock of our country is that neither the government nor the will of the majority can deprive a minority of basic human rights.Forty-four states still don’t permit gays to marry, which is why I hope that the courts ultimately decree in the lawsuit challenging Proposition 8 in California that neither government nor the ballot box can deprive gays of a right to which all people should be entitled.'"
"'11-06-28,'1','The Iowa Straw Poll on Aug. 13, which she described as “a big deal” to an audience of admirers here, will be the first test of the depth of Mrs. Bachmann’s support. She has brought on a team of new strategists, several of whom were at the side of Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, when he won the Iowa caucuses in 2008.Mindful of how Mr. Huckabee surged four years ago, her Republican rivals are paying close attention to Mrs. Bachmann. Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota who probably has the most to lose if her candidacy takes off, released a radio advertisement in Iowa with the slogan “Results, not rhetoric.”Mrs. Bachmann, 55, was once seen as an understudy to Sarah Palin. But Mrs. Bachmann has essentially reversed roles, plunging ahead into the campaign to fill what she perceives as a void in the field.Ms. Palin is scheduled to arrive in Iowa on Tuesday to attend the premiere of a documentary on her life, “The Undefeated,” a rare appearance here that is sure to stir speculation about her political intentions. But by the time she arrives, Mrs. Bachmann will be well into her three-state announcement tour, with stops in New Hampshire and South Carolina, which hold the first primaries next year.While Mrs. Bachmann announced her candidacy at her party’s first major presidential debate two weeks ago, she made it official on the steps of the Snowden House, a historic brick building in downtown Waterloo. Her message to a crowd of about 200 people, including a large contingent of relatives, on a sun-splashed morning was accompanied by an occasional chorus of honking horns, as trucks passed on a nearby highway.She introduced herself as a candidate with broad appeal, acknowledging the spirit of Tea Party activists, but pointing out that she also hails from a long line of Democrats. (Yes, she conceded, she once volunteered for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.)“Our problems don’t have an identity of party, they are problems created by both parties,” Mrs. Bachmann said. “Americans agree that our country is in peril today and we must act with urgency to save it. Americans aren’t interested in affiliation. They are interested in solutions and leadership that will tell the truth.”By declaring her candidacy in Iowa, she signaled that the state is a critical piece of her strategy. But it remains less clear how essential the Iowa caucuses will be in selecting the party’s nominee.Mr. Romney, who won the Iowa Straw Poll four years ago and finished second in the caucuses, is declining to participate in the straw poll this time. He has played coy about his overall Iowa strategy until the field emerges. The rise of Mrs. Bachmann could create an opening for an alternative candidate, particularly a former governor like Mr. Romney or Mr. Pawlenty, or it could push the electorate to the right and make the Iowa caucuses less relevant.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said candidates would be unwise to bypass the state, particularly because of its importance as a general election battleground. (Mr. Obama is heading to Iowa on Tuesday, countering the parade of Republicans visiting the state.)“The weakness of the economy makes it possible for almost any of those candidates to give President Obama a race and possibly win,” Mr. Grassley said in an interview on Monday. Asked about the prospects of Mrs. Bachmann, he paused a moment and said: “Of course she could be the nominee. She’s got a commitment to a cause, and she sticks to it.”A wide circle of relatives and friends surrounded Mrs. Bachmann, including Bruce Munson, a cousin, who joined for a family picture after her speech. Mr. Munson said the nation would grow to love her tenacity, adding, “If anyone can break the glass ceiling, it will be Michele.”Mrs. Bachmann, who rose to prominence with her evocative quips and spirited presence in television interviews and appearances at Tea Party rallies last year, has also experienced a string of gaffes. She added a new one to the list during her visit back to Waterloo, a city that she left in 1968.She spoke adoringly of her town, recalling the Dairy Queen, her house on East Ninth Street and the Wonder Bread Factory, where her mother picked up ingredients for her favorite mayonnaise and lettuce sandwiches. But as she stood in her old neighborhood, she misstated a piece of Iowa lore as she explained the important role that Waterloo had in shaping her character.“John Wayne was from Waterloo, Iowa,” Mrs. Bachmann told Carl Cameron of Fox News in an interview. “That’s the kind of spirit that I have, too.”The actor was actually born in Winterset, Iowa, which is about 150 miles southwest of Waterloo. It was John Wayne Gacy, known as the killer clown who raped and murdered 33 teenage boys in the 1970s, who lived in Waterloo.'"

If Mom or Dad has allergies to cats or dogs, it is probable that the home will not be graced by Fido or Whiskers. And conversely, adults without pet allergies are more likely to have a pet than adults with allergies. In the study, the children exposed to pets early may have had fewer allergies simply because they did not inherit this tendency from their parents. And conversely, the children who were not exposed to pets may have parents who wheeze and sneeze around furry darlings, keep a pet-free home and pass on the allergic tendency to their children.'"
"'11-06-28,'1','The decision Monday, the Roberts court’s first direct look at public campaign financing, concerned only systems that use matching funds, as opposed to lump-sum grants. About a third of the states have some form of public financing, as does the federal government for presidential elections.“We do not today call into question the wisdom of public financing as a means of funding political candidacy,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “That is not our business.”Supporters of the law said the decision could have been worse. “Chief Justice Roberts at least recognized that public financing is a valid constitutional option,” said Monica Youn, a lawyer with the Brennan Center for Justice, which represented one of the defendants in the case.As a consequence of the decision, states and municipalities are now blocked from using a method of public financing that is simultaneously likely to attract candidates fearful that they will be vastly outspent and sensitive to avoiding needless government expense.“The government can still use taxpayer funds to subsidize political campaigns, but it can only do that in a manner that provides an alternative to private financing” said William R. Maurer, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, which represented several challengers of the law. “It cannot create disincentives.”Chief Justice Roberts said that all escalating matching funds placed an unconstitutional burden on politicians who chose not to participate. But he added that Arizona’s system also created problematic asymmetries and anomalies. Candidates with several opponents could generate multiple subsidies every time they spent money, and spending from unaffiliated supporters could do the same.Three years ago, in Davis v. Federal Election Commission, another 5-to-4 decision with the same justices in the majority, the court struck down a superficially similar federal law known as the “millionaire’s amendment.” That law allowed candidates to raise amounts over the usual contribution limits when rich opponents spent more than a given amount of their own money.Justice Alito, writing for the majority, said the law imposed “an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises” free speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.Chief Justice Roberts said the logic of the Davis decision required the court to strike down the Arizona law. Indeed, he said, it is one thing for the government to allow candidates to seek additional contributions and another for the government to send a check.“The cash subsidy, conferred in response to political speech, penalizes speech to a greater extent and more directly than the millionaire’s amendment in Davis,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote.The decision concerned two consolidated cases, Arizona Free Enterprise Club v. Bennett, No. 10-238, and McComish v. Bennett, No. 10-239. It was the fifth ruling from the Roberts court cutting back on the government’s ability to regulate campaign finance.In a dissent summarized from the bench, Justice Elena Kagan said the Arizona law advanced First Amendment values.“What the law does — all the law does — is fund more speech,” she wrote. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor joined the dissent.“Arizona, remember, offers to support any person running for state office,” Justice Kagan wrote. The candidates who challenged the law declined to accept that help, she said.“So they are making a novel argument: that Arizona violated their First Amendment rights by disbursing funds to other speakers even though they could have received (but chose to spurn) the same financial assistance,” Justice Kagan wrote. “Some people might call that chutzpah.”The Davis decision, Justice Kagan wrote, involved a different issue, as it concerned a law that raised contribution limits disproportionately.The majority and dissent disagreed about whether the Arizona law was supported by a permissible government rationale.Chief Justice Roberts wrote that its main purpose was to level the playing field for political speech, which several earlier decisions have said is an improper goal.“It is not legitimate for the government to attempt to equalize electoral opportunities in this manner,” he wrote. “And such basic intrusion by the government into the debate over who should govern goes to the heart of First Amendment values.”“ ‘Leveling the playing field,’ ” Chief Justice Roberts wrote, “can sound like a good thing. But in a democracy, campaigning for office is not a game.”Justice Kagan countered that the main purpose of the law was to root out corruption and the appearance of corruption by encouraging candidates to participate in public financing systems, a goal the Supreme Court has endorsed.“Like citizens across this country, Arizonans deserve a government that represents and serves them all,” she wrote. “And no less, Arizonans deserve the chance to reform their electoral system so as to attain that most American of goals. Truly, democracy is not a game.”'"

"'11-06-28,'1','Wall Street led global stocks higher on Monday and the euro rallied against the dollar on increasing investor confidence that the Greek Parliament would pass an unpopular austerity plan and as French banks outlined an agreement to roll over Greek debt.Treasury prices fell as the news from Europe lured investors into riskier assets, while low yields in the government’s sale of two-year notes discouraged some potential buyers.Bank shares were among top gainers in New York markets, which rebounded after three days of losses.“We don’t see this being the start of a major rally, but this is welcome strength in the market and hopefully a welcome short-term bottom,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, N.Y.He said financial shares were “a very oversold group” that was due for a bounce.Greek lawmakers were to begin debating on Monday evening an almost $40 billion package of measures to increase taxes and cut fiscal spending that is critical to winning a new round of international funding to keep the country afloat.“As long as the Greek Parliament votes ‘yes’ this week on an austerity plan, stocks are going to go up,"" said Cary Leahey, economist and managing director at Decision Economics in New York.'"
"'11-06-28,'1','“If it wasn’t voluntary,” Mr. Sarkozy said, “it would be viewed as a default, with a huge risk of an amplification of the crisis.”Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of the Brussels-based Bruegel research institute, said the announcement reflected Europe’s problems in coming to grips with the Greek crisis.“A year ago, it was a short-term plan,” he said. “Now, it’s becoming a much longer-term bailout.”France has never wavered in its view that banks should be involved in the debt workout on a voluntary and limited basis. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, French lenders would lose more from a collapse of Greek banks than those from other countries. Aside from that, Paris is also worried about the impact that a Greek default would have on the euro and that it could bring a repeat of the problems engendered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, through financial ripple effects.In announcing the plan, Mr. Sarkozy was confirming a report earlier in the newspaper Le Figaro. French bankers and a government official, who were not permitted to speak publicly, filled out the details, acknowledging that the banks, in return for agreeing to roll over 70 percent of the bonds falling due between July 2011 and June 2014, would be able to pocket the remaining 30 percent for themselves.Of the amount to be rolled over, just over two-thirds would be reinvested in new Greek securities with a maturity of 30 years that paid a coupon close to the current official interest rate on the loans to Greece. If Greece’s economy improved beyond current projections, a sweetener would be added in the form of a higher interest rate.The remaining securities, just under one-third, would be invested in a separate “guarantee fund,” consisting of AAA rated zero coupon bonds. Government officials did not say who would guarantee the bonds, but analysts said the only possible candidate for such a role would be the French government or some other institution like the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank or the European Union.Officials said the deal, which still needs to be worked out in detail, was the fruit of recent meetings among the presidential Élysée Palace, the French Treasury, the Bank of France and the French banking federation.The initiative is likely to be supported by Jean-Claude Trichet, the outgoing president of the European Central Bank, who had stood against plans to automatically impose “haircuts” or losses on banks.Large French banks, including Société Générale and BNP Paribas, declined to comment on the announcement individually or through their national banking federation.The French plan was presented separately for discussion at a meeting of Greece’s creditors convened in Rome Monday by the International Institute of Finance, which represents many of the largest global finance institutions, and the Italian Treasury. The I.I.F. managing director Charles Dallara, who attended the meeting, said participants had “engaged in a constructive exchange of views on Greece and progress was made in advancing the discussions.”The reaction from France’s partners was muted.A finance official from a euro zone country said France had not briefed other member on its plan, which he said sounded similar in parts to the Brady Plan, an initiative started in the late 1980s allowing creditors of Latin American countries to swap defaulted bank loans for a choice of new, more secure bonds, usually collateralized by U.S. Treasury bonds.“France is showing leadership, it has the largest exposure to Greece,” he said. “But this is not a done deal.”He said it was not clear whether all of Greece’s creditors would be willing to switch bonds with a short maturity bonds into issues stretching out as far as 30 years, given the huge loss of value that it implied. At the same time, there are dangers, he said, in a “decentralized” approach, whereby some government would ask banks to do more than others.In a statement, the British Treasury said it was “monitoring the situation closely but no specific proposals for private sector involvement have been tabled.”“We are conducting our own talks,” a German Finance Ministry official said Monday. “The French plan is the French plan. We are not commenting yet on what we might do.”The official, not permitted to speak publicly, said Berlin would probably wait for a meeting of euro-area finance ministers in Brussels on July 3 before publicly outlining its stance in detail.Gilles Moec, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said there would be “quite a few hurdles” for the French plan. Apart from needing backing from Germany and other European countries, he said that the Union’s structures created to bail out struggling economies would need to be altered to create the “guarantee mechanism” and that could necessitate national ratifications.“This does not protect against a political meltdown in Greece this week if the government can’t manage to get its austerity plan endorsed by Parliament,” he added.A vote on Greece’s latest austerity measures is scheduled for Wednesday, to be followed by another vote Thursday on separate legislation to implement the reforms. If the measures are passed, the European Union is expected to announce the size and details of a second bailout package at the meeting of ministers July 3.But many economists believe that even if Greece passes the austerity measures this week, it will merely delay an inevitable restructuring because Greece is effectively insolvent.'"
"'11-06-28,'1','Some analysts say an economic slowdown could expose huge hidden liabilities in the banking system. Many of the problems are tied to a $586 billion stimulus package Beijing announced in late 2008 and a huge wave of state-backed lending in 2009 and 2010. Those money infusions were aimed at buffering China from the global financial crisis.Although many economists argue that the country’s enormous stash of foreign exchange reserves helps make Beijing strong enough to cope with the local government liabilities, they also point to worrisome signs of mounting debt.The auditor’s report on Monday was similar to a warning earlier this month by the Chinese central bank. The bank said that at the end of last year, local government liabilities were as high as 30 percent of gross domestic product, or about $2.2 trillion — far higher than previous estimates.That survey said local governments had created 10,000 investment companies to borrow money from banks, mostly to finance ambitious infrastructure projects. (China does not allow local governments to issue bonds to finance projects.)But the national auditor’s report varied from the central bank’s in saying its survey had counted only about 6,500 local government investment companies. Analysts cited the possibility that that auditor’s survey was not as thorough as the central bank’s.Many analysts have grown cautious about China’s economy. Some have reduced growth estimates and downgraded their ratings of Chinese banks over concerns about a coming wave of nonperforming loans associated with local government debt.Last week, Charlene Chu, an analyst at Fitch, the credit ratings agency, said China’s growth had recently become too reliant on loose credit and that “easy money” was helping fuel inflation and a property bubble, according to a presentation she delivered at a global banking conference in Hong Kong.She also said there were growing risks because of a shadow banking system that had emerged beyond regulatory scrutiny in China and because of an “overextension” of loans to local governments.“Rapid expansion of off-balance-sheet transactions is distorting bank financial statements,” she said.Victor Shih, a professor of political science at Northwestern University in Illinois and one of the first to warn about a sharp rise in local government debt in China, said on Monday that the recent surveys were useful antidotes to local government efforts to keep much of their borrowing secret from Beijing.“It’s a significant step for them to release these numbers,” he said in a telephone interview. “But I think the problem is much, much bigger.”Mr. Shih and other analysts say local governments create their own investment companies to borrow from state banks to finance infrastructure projects. And because much of that borrowing is done off official balance sheets, often using government land or assets as collateral, the debt can be hard to track and assess.And often the projects, which include roads, bridges, tunnels and subway systems, do not generate enough earnings to repay the loans.In its report Monday, the national audit office said it had found many irregular activities. For instance, many local governments were using “unreal” or illegal collateral to secure the loans, the report said, and some of the money they borrowed was funneled into the stock and property markets. At other times, the auditor said, the local governments were “overestimating the value of the collateral” — which was often tied to land values.'"

"'11-06-29,'1','The issue is a hot one because some consumer advocates say that financial companies were able to get away with lax lending standards and predatory behavior during the surge in home sales before 2008 in part because the lenders could claim that more restrictive state rules did not apply to them.Banks, on the other hand, say it is more efficient for them to follow national rules as the industry has consolidated and added customers in many states.The comptroller has been criticized since the financial crisis for often siding with bank-friendly policies, and the office’s critics point to the recently proposed rules on pre-emption as a sign that the regulator has not changed.“There is extreme consternation in the consumer community that the O.C.C. is continuing to side with banks over consumers to a considerable extent,” said Paul Bland, a senior staff lawyer who works on consumer banking cases at the law firm Public Justice, referring to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.“A clear message of the Dodd-Frank law,” he said, “was that Congress felt that federal regulators, especially the O.C.C., had not been sufficiently aggressive in dealing with advertising by banks. And, because state banks and state regulators were so much more favorable to consumers, Congress wanted to free state regulators from the O.C.C.’s grasp. In these proposals the O.C.C. is very close to trying to pretend that the Dodd-Frank act never passed.”The comptroller gained expanded oversight responsibilities in the Dodd-Frank law last year, when the Office of Thrift Supervision was shut down, and some of its rules proposed in May applied to merging parts of those two regulators. The regulator is working under an acting director and awaiting the nomination of a permanent leader.The comments on its proposed rules were due on Monday, and at least 24 were received, including some from Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase & Company and Citigroup.A spokesman for the comptroller’s office, Bryan Hubbard, declined to discuss the comments and said there was no timeline for the comptroller to finish evaluating them. “We will be carefully reviewing all comments we’ve received as we move toward a final rule,” he said.New York State’s new Financial Services Department was one of the strongest critics of the proposed rules, arguing in its comment letter that the rules would “narrow and hamper the application of state consumer protection laws.”Created this year, the New York department could prove to be a thorn in the side of federal regulators because so many financial companies are based in the state. The department, an amalgam of the state’s old insurance and banking divisions, is being led by one of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s most trusted advisers, Benjamin M. Lawsky. He helped manage many of the cases against banks filed by Mr. Cuomo when he was New York’s attorney general.In an interview, Mr. Lawsky said that the comptroller was trying to “hinder the intent of Dodd-Frank.”Mr. Lawsky added: “We think it’s important for consumers and for the financial service industry writ large for the states to continue their vital role. The importance of the states as regulators has been on display the last several years.”In particular, Mr. Lawsky wrote, the comptroller is trying to use an overly broad definition to determine whether it can overrule a state law and ignoring a mandate to review state consumer laws on a case-by-case basis. He also says that the comptroller is trying to ignore a provision of Dodd-Frank that would allow state attorneys general to enforce federal laws as well as state laws.Several banks, however, wrote letters supporting the comptroller’s proposals. Citibank wrote, “It would be extremely difficult for these banks to stay current on all state and local laws that could possibly apply to them across the United States, to be certain which ones would cover their activities, and to attempt to comply with such a multiplicity of different — and potentially inconsistent — requirements.”Wells Fargo wrote that the comptroller’s confirmation of a 1996 Supreme Court ruling on pre-emption helped support a “robust national banking system.” The implications of that case, though, remain in dispute, and the National Association of Attorneys General wrote in a comment letter that the comptroller’s office was basing its proposed rules too heavily on that case and not enough on the intent of Dodd-Frank.Beyond supporting the comptroller’s proposed rules, JPMorgan made suggestions to try to protect itself from state laws that might hinder the bank’s ability to lend money or demand collateral. JPMorgan also said that it supported the positive comments by the Clearing House, a bank-owned company that handles payments within the financial system. The Clearing House asserted that “any suggestion that federal pre-emption has encouraged predatory lending practices or somehow led to the subprime crisis is baseless and incorrect.”'"

"'11-06-29,'1','Monday’s meeting between President Obama and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, was intended to revive the debt-limit talks after Republican negotiators walked out last week, insisting that they won’t agree to raise the limit unless Democrats agree to trillions of dollars in deficit reduction — with no tax increases at all.Before the meeting, Mr. McConnell insisted that “it’s time for Washington to take the hit, not the taxpayers.” While both sides said the talks would continue, there is little sign the Republicans will consider a compromise. The government has barely a month to raise the debt limit or begin to default on its obligations, with potentially disastrous consequences for the economy.Talking about Washington taking the hit may play well on the hustings, for now. But the truth is that if the Republicans get their way, taxpayers will be the ones to take the hit, as basic services are cut drastically.Nor will a spending-cuts-only approach fix the deficit. If the Bush tax cuts are extended beyond their expiration at the end of 2012, lost revenue from the cuts — plus related interest costs — would account for 45 percent of the projected $11.2 trillion in deficits in this decade.The Republicans’ fierce opposition is even more absurd when you consider the relatively modest tax increases proposed by Democrats.Ending unnecessary subsides for oil companies would raise $40 billion over 10 years, while a tax accounting change that would also apply mainly to oil companies could raise $72 billion over five years. Getting rid of a tax break for corporate jets would raise about $3 billion. Closing a loophole that allows private-equity money mangers to pay tax at about the lowest rate in the tax code would raise about $20 billion over 10 years.'"
"'11-06-29,'1','Some experts and the funds themselves play down the risks, expressing confidence in the underlying safety of the European banks’ debt that they own.A primary fear is that if a European bank indebted to the funds is weakened in the crisis, then it might have a hard time repaying its loans. But even the perception of trouble could, in a worse case, cause financial markets to seize up and send investors rushing to withdraw money. That is what happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 hit one fund that owned Lehman debt, the Reserve Primary Fund, causing a huge run on all funds.Some investors have already withdrawn money from these funds. Their worry is that the chance of a Greek default increases if the country’s lawmakers fail to approve a set of tax increases, wage cuts and asset sales. The legislation is necessary to qualify the country for $17 billion in outside aid to get it through the summer. Unless the European governments step in, the fear of a default could potentially set off turmoil across the world’s financial markets.If that happens, analysts say, Greek bond yields would jump. The euro and stock markets would fall. The cost of lending between European banks might potentially spike as banks doubt one another’s creditworthiness.The funds hold large amounts of debt of banks in nations at the core of Europe, like France and Germany. They now lend about $240 billion to French banks, or 14.8 percent of the funds’ assets, according to Fitch Ratings. French banks are among the biggest holders of the government debt of Greece and other weak countries, which would leave them exposed if Greece or other nations run into more trouble.As the crisis has simmered over the last two years, fund managers have decreased their direct lending to banks in the weakest countries of the euro currency zone — Greek, Portugal and Ireland — and even in Spain and Italy. Their holdings in Greek debt are zero. Their percentage of assets in Spanish debt has declined to 0.2 percent from 3.3 percent in 2008.“With very few exceptions, the money market mutual funds don’t have much direct exposure to the three peripheral countries which are currently dealing with debt problems,” Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said last week. “They do have substantial exposure to European banks in the so-called core countries: Germany, France, etc. So to the extent that there is indirect impact on the core European banks, that does pose some concern to money market mutual funds.”Underscoring those worries, the Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it was keeping open its dollar lending program with the European Central Bank and other central banks beyond the Aug. 1 expiration date. That move should help ease some of the pressure on European banks by providing an alternative to money market funds to help them fund their daily operations in dollars. The program is with the E.C.B., the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank. The Bank of Japan is also considering extending the operations.In his earlier remarks, Mr. Bernanke said the industry was still working on reforms to make money market funds safer. After the financial crisis of 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission put in tougher regulations, cutting to 60 days from 90 days the average maturity of debt that the funds can hold so that they can get out of bad loans more quickly.In addition, at least 30 percent of their assets must be in cash or other holdings that can be exchanged for cash within a week, and 10 percent in assets that can be changed for cash in a day. Regulators also have new powers to suspend redemptions if there is a run on a fund.But the moves are incomplete. The industry and regulators are still discussing possible changes, like plans for buffer funds to bail out investments that get into trouble.In the last two weeks, investors have withdrawn $45.6 billion from prime money market funds, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. That is the biggest two-week withdrawal since another jittery two weeks in March last year. After the Lehman panic in 2008, investors lost out when the Reserve Primary Fund “broke the buck,” reporting a share price of 97 cents to savers who had long expected an unwavering share price of a dollar.They faced another cost when, amid the panic, redemptions were frozen and they could not get to their money. There were also bigger systemic costs since American corporations that borrowed from money funds were shut out of the market for a time.Michael Matson, of Matson Financial Advisors in Danbury,  Conn., said that in the last year he has had 20 to 30 clients ask to move out of money market funds and into short-term bank accounts because of rising global concerns. .Money market accounts have typically offered a higher return than bank accounts. But their returns have dwindled as interest rates have fallen in recent years — and bank accounts offer the additional security of a guarantee from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.“There is a heightening anxiety about protecting principal, linked to the craziness of 2008, Madoff and what is happening around the world,” said Mr. Matson, who advises people living in the Westchester County and Connecticut area and are making investments from $500,000 to $3 million. “People are now realizing we are interconnected and what happens in Greece may impact on Main Street, Connecticut.”'"
"'11-06-29,'1','In Maryland, Delegate Heather R. Mizeur, Democrat of Montgomery County, sent a letter to the state comptroller and the attorney general calling for an investigation into disclosures related to the financial and environmental risks of drilling.In New York, Assemblywoman Barbara S. Lifton, a Democrat and longtime critic of drilling, sent a letter to the New York State comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, calling for a similar investigation and citing roughly $1 billion in state pension funds invested in shale gas companies.The New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, sent subpoenas to five oil and gas companies ordering them to provide documents relating to the disclosure the companies made to investors about the risks of hydrofracking, according to sources briefed on the investigation.A spokesman from Mr. Schneiderman’s office declined to provide copies of the subpoenas.The five companies subpoenaed — Talisman, Chesapeake Energy, E. O. G. Resources, Baker Hughes and Anadarko — all declined to comment.The calls for investigations follow articles in The New York Times describing doubts reflected in internal e-mails from federal regulators and natural gas industry officials about the costs associated with shale gas and the reliability of company reserves estimates.Oil and gas companies and energy market analysts strongly rejected the views expressed in the industry and federal e-mails published by The Times.In an open letter to his employees, the chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, Aubrey McClendon, said the company’s prospects were bright.“There is no reason to believe that shale gas wells will have shorter lives than our conventional wells — some 8,000 of which are 30 years old or older,” Mr. McClendon wrote.Some financial services companies also released research notes saying they believed shale gas was now profitable for many companies.But four federal lawmakers — Mr. Hinchey; Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts; and Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney and Jerrold Nadler, both Democrats of New York — sent letters calling for the S.E.C. to reconsider recent rule changes that allow companies to avoid disclosing details about the proprietary technology used to predict future gas production and to avoid some third-party audits of those predictions. They asked the commission whether third-party reserves audits should be made mandatory.The lawmakers also called for an investigation into industry representatives’ accusations of possible illegality or reserves overbooking. A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.In a letter to Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, Ms. Maloney and Mr. Nadler asked his department to assess how inaccuracies in production projections could affect energy policy.The federal Energy Information Administration also faced questions from Mr. Markey and Mr. Hinchey about its reports related to natural gas and its use of industry-tied contractors in writing those reports.Voicing strong support for the natural gas industry, a bipartisan group of eight federal lawmakers from gas-producing states sent a letter to President Obama on Monday asking him to promote continued natural gas development “by any means necessary, but most specifically, by unconventional shale gas recovery.”“The need for the United States to move toward energy independence becomes more crucial as the crisis in the Middle East and North Africa worsens,” the letter said.'"
"'11-06-29,'1','The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly confirmed the absence of any evidence of diversion of declared nuclear material to illicit activities.

Unfortunately this has not happened, solely as a result of political pressure on the I.A.E.A. and a wealth of calibrated disinformation on Iran’s peaceful nuclear program.Instead of adopting at face value the disinformation on Iran, the American media should carefully scrutinize the facts regarding Iran’s nuclear program objectively and without political bias.ALIREZA MIRYOUSEFIHead of Press OfficeIran’s Mission to the United NationsNew York, June 21, 2011'"
"'11-06-29,'1','At the same time, metrics used to judge possible defaults are indicating more risk. Increasingly, appraisers are taking into consideration higher future rents and occupancy rates, rather than using only current figures. Inflated appraisals were common during the market peak but disappeared after the crash. There are also more interest-only loans, where the borrower pays interest on the loan but does not pay down the principal, with a large balloon payment due at the end of the term.Appraisers say their figures are not inflated, but rather reflect the improving market in some areas of the country. “It is important to point out that commercial real estate is a two-tier market: there are distressed properties and markets and premier properties and markets,” said Leslie Sellers, the 2010 president of the Appraisal Institute, an industry group that has more than 24,000 members. Appraisers are accounting for a rosier future in only those top-tier markets, he said. “If we didn’t do that, we would be remiss.”A sharp increase in the number of commercial real estate lenders is mostly driving the surge in mortgage-backed securities. Large banks like Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have resurrected their commercial mortgage-backed securities, also known as C.M.B.S., lending again after the downturn, while new players have also entered the market, like Cantor Fitzgerald and the hedge fund giant Citadel.“Banks need to generate earnings, but they aren’t underwriting many new mortgages or other loans, so securitization is a very attractive option,” said K. C. Conway, the executive managing director of real estate analytics at Colliers International.Insurance companies and foreign investors are also lending as they look to rotate into hard assets and out of cash and other investments that are vulnerable to inflation, Mr. Conway said. In the search for hard assets, the commercial real estate market is attractive because it is widely perceived to have bottomed out.Yet there are only a relatively small number of properties that are not highly leveraged and in a position to borrow funds. According to Trepp, over one trillion dollars’ worth of commercial real estate loans due in the next five years are still underwater, meaning the market value of the properties is less than their debt.“It is the classic scenario of too many dollars chasing too few deals,” said Peter J. Mignone, a partner at the New York office of the law firm SNR Denton.With so few opportunities, lenders are facing multiple pressures. To create bonds, they must pool together several commercial loans, but with so few strong borrowers, “their only choice is to leave the primary markets and look to the secondary and even tertiary markets to fill up these loan pools,” said Lawrence J. Longua, a clinical associate professor at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University.At the same time, these lenders have built infrastructure and need to put their capital to work. “A critical mass is needed to justify the C.M.B.S. platforms they have built, so they may be willing to look at making riskier loans if that is what is available,” Mr. Longua said.So far, the deals being underwritten today are consistent with the types of deals seen in 2004, according to research by Moody’s. That year “was one of the last normalized years before the aggressive underwriting began to ramp up,” Mr. Philipp said, “so we are right at the inflection point.”Underwriters are also coming up with novel structures. For example, in a deal led by Deutsche Bank and UBS, the management of the Crystal Gateway Marriott in Virginia is set to receive a fee if it meets certain profit requirements.While this so-called incentive management fee is not striking on its own, it is to be paid first, ahead of the debt service. Standard & Poor’s called this “highly unusual” in a recent research note.There are have also been several commercial mortgage-backed securities deals underwritten in the past year where the leases expire before the loans come due.This leaves the buildings vulnerable to the possibility of losing rental income. At 7 Hanover Square in lower Manhattan, for example, the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America occupies nearly the entire building, and its lease expires in 2019, but the loan does not come due until 2021.A loan for 660 Madison Avenue has a similar structure. The building is fully occupied by Barneys New York, but its lease expires 18 months before the loan matures. In addition, Standard & Poor’s has a low rating for the company and says it is as risk of a downgrade.“If lenders are going to be aggressive, there should be a really good reason, and not just to win a lending assignment,” Mr. Mignone said. “If you have a few lenders who choose to be aggressive, then their competitors’ only alternatives are to also be aggressive or to close their checkbooks. This is when you risk having a race to the bottom.”But while there are examples of eroding underwriting standards, more safety measures now exist than before the downturn. For example, there are more interest-only loans, but many are for short periods and not the entire life of the loan.And while some leases expire before the bonds mature, many include safety provisions like agreements with tenants to renew their leases or requirements to post letters of credit as collateral.“On balance, it is true that the deals are less conservative now, but as a result, we are on the path to do $30 billion in C.M.B.S. deals this year, versus just $12 billion,” said Thomas A. Fink, a senior vice president and managing director at Trepp.Still, said Barbara Duka, a managing director at Standard & Poor’s, “what has surprised us is the speed at which the metrics have gone from very conservative to much less so.”'"
"'11-06-29,'1','CAIRO — An Egyptian court on Tuesday ordered the dissolution of municipal councils nationwide, taking a major step toward dismantling one of the last political institutions of the former president, Hosni Mubarak.The decision, if implemented, would satisfy another demand of the democracy demonstrators whose protests forced Mr. Mubarak from power and ultimately led to his arrest. The military council now ruling the nation can appeal the decision, though it has indicated support for the order, Egyptian news media reported.Hossam el-Hamalawy, a blogger, called the councils “the arteries of the corruption machine that ran the country.” He said they allowed Mr. Mubarak’s party to control “the daily affairs of the Egyptian people: decisions on water, electricity, garbage collection — the minute details of the Egyptian lives.”The councils, which oversee administration of local governments, were elected in 2008 in a vote that was widely seen as rigged in favor of Mr. Mubarak’s National Democratic Party. Of 52,000 open seats, 99.13 percent went to Mr. Mubarak’s allies, including 43,600 that were uncontested because of administrative or security decisions. Only 8,400 seats were contested, and of those 6,900 with to Mr. Mubarak’s party, 400 to independents and 1,100 from registered opposition parties.Judge Kamal el-Lamei of the Supreme Administrative Court issued the decision in response to lawsuits that claimed the councils were corrupt and only served the interests of Mr. Mubarak’s party. (The party was dissolved by court order in April.)Hamdi el-Fakharani, who filed the successful lawsuit, warned that the councils could provide a platform for members of Mr. Mubarak’s party to plot a comeback.Local councils only be dissolved only by judicial order, and elections must take place within 60 days. Egypt’s interim government was scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss the ruling. Until new council election dates are set, Egypt’s municipalities will be managed by unelected local executives and provincial officials.'"

An elegant center, he won his third and final Stanley Cup playing for Burns in New Jersey. It was the Devils’ third Stanley Cup and remains its most recent.“For me, he’s a Hall of Famer in my mind,” Nieuwendyk said on the teleconference.Gilmour, who played for Burns with the Toronto Maple Leafs, said: “We’d love to see him in there some day. We know he will be.”Burns had a 501-353-151 record with four teams, including Montreal and Boston. He became the first three-time winner of the Jack Adams Award, presented to the league’s top coach. He coached the Devils for two seasons.Also not selected was Fred Shero, the former coach of the notoriously rugged Philadelphia Flyers teams, known as the Broad Street Bullies, that won the Stanley Cup in 1974 and 1975. Shero, who also coached the Rangers, died in 1990.As many as two people from the builders category can be selected to the Hall of Fame in one year. Jim Devellano, the Detroit Red Wings executive, and Daryl Seaman, a part owner of the Calgary Flames, were inducted last year with the Hall’s first female players, Cammi Granato and Angela James.Belfour, 46, who was nicknamed Eddie the Eagle for the distinctive design on his helmet, was the only player among the four to be selected in his first year of eligibility. Belfour lives in Dallas and said he still played in two adult men’s leagues.Howe, 56, is the son of Gordie Howe, the Hall of Famer who spent most of his career with the Red Wings. Mark Howe, a Detroit native, finished his career by playing for the Red Wings for three years.“I don’t think I would have been able to handle that experience as a young man,” he said of playing in Detroit.No women or players born outside North America were chosen for the Hall by the selection committee, which is composed of league and team executives, journalists and former players.“It’s always been the Hockey Hall of Fame, not the National Hockey League Hall of Fame,” Hay said. “We’re strong in recognizing the international game here at the Hall.”'"

"'11-06-29,'1','NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa. — Tiger Woods did not rule out playing in the British Open. But the bulk of his remarks Tuesday indicated that his ailing left knee and left Achilles’ tendon would not be healed in time for him to make the tournament, the season’s third major championship, at Royal St. George’s in two weeks.Woods, who is here at the AT&T National this week in his role as the nonplaying tournament host, said that other than some putts, he had not hit any golf balls since he withdrew from the Players Championship after nine holes almost seven weeks ago. He said he exacerbated the strains to his left lateral collateral ligament and Achilles’, which he originally injured at the Masters in April.“Probably in retrospect, it was a borderline call whether I should have played the Players,” Woods said.He added: “I pushed it too hard and hurt myself. Now this time around, it’s different. I’m setting no timetable.”By not making a call on whether he will be ready for the British Open, he leaves open the possibility that he could play if he improves drastically in the next two weeks. But based on previous training regimens he has used when preparing to return to competition after an injury, the chances of a return appear virtually nil.Relaxed, joking at times and wearing an almost full beard, Woods looked as if he has been on summer vacation. That is hardly the case, he said.'"
"'11-06-29,'1','BEIJING — China’s largest oil company has begun operations at Al-Ahdab oil field in Iraq, making the field the first major new area to start production in Iraq in 20 years, according to an official news report on Tuesday.Operations began June 21, and the field is expected to produce three million tons of crude oil per year, reported China Daily, an official English-language newspaper. The oil field was discovered in 1979 and is believed to contain a billion barrels of crude.The Chinese company, the China National Petroleum Corporation, a state-owned enterprise, secured rights to the field under a technical services contract signed with the Iraqi government in November 2008. Under the contract, the company has development rights for 23 years, China Daily reported. It is investing $3 billion.The contract, the renegotiation of a deal first signed in 1996 with the government of Saddam Hussein, was postponed after the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq and the American military toppled Mr. Hussein in 2003. Analysts say the Ahdab operation is China National Petroleum’s largest in the Middle East.The contract stipulates that the company receive a fee for every barrel of oil produced, rather than an equity interest in the oil field, as it would have under the original agreement with Mr. Hussein’s government. A Chinese oil executive said in 2009 that the company would make a profit of less than one percent, but that the contract was a way to “get a foot in the door” of the Iraqi oil industry, which has much larger fields than Ahdab.The deal began drawing intense criticism from residents and officials in Wasit Province, where the field is located, shortly after the contract was signed. Some people demanded that Wasit be granted a royalty of $1 a barrel to improve access to clean water, health services, schools, roads and other public needs in the province, which is among Iraq’s poorest. The Iraqi government rejected the demands.'"
"'11-06-29,'1','Both speak American-accented English but continue to represent their countries of origin: for Sharapova and for Lisicki. Both are trying to get back to where they were: Sharapova to winning Grand Slam titles after a major shoulder injury and Lisicki to the fast track to stardom after a major ankle injury.“It’s the road that you sometimes have to take,” Sharapova said. “It’s not always straight. There are a lot of zigzags. A lot of time, you feel like it’s a dead end. You have to turn around and have a few other options.”Sharapova certainly had other options. As the world’s highest-paid female athlete, and with three Grand Slam singles titles to her , she could have continued to develop her business interests without developing her game. But she was just 21 when she decided to have surgery on her right shoulder in 2008, still deeply enamored of competition and the daily structure and challenges it provides.Now 24, she is back in the Wimbledon semifinals for the first time since 2006. For Lisicki, this will be her first Grand Slam semifinal. It seemed that it might not take this long after she reached the quarterfinals here in 2009 at age 19 with her huge serve and convincing baseline game. But later that year, she severely sprained her left ankle in the second round of the while facing Anastasia Rodionova’s match point and lay sobbing on the court before being taken off in a wheelchair.There were more tears of pain and frustration. Lisicki injured the same ankle in March 2010 at the tournament in Indian Wells, Calif., and came back too soon in , ultimately missing nearly five months of last season and falling out of the top 200 in the rankings. She said part of the problem was a misdiagnosis of the Indian Wells injury.“It cost me a lot of time,” she said. “So I went to the German doctors much later. I should have done that earlier. I know that for the future, I’ll be going on the first plane back to Germany to see my doctors if I have something. It was tough, but it happened. Nothing I can change. You know I was fighting to get back, working very, very hard, and that’s all I could do. And now I’m back.”She is back after winning on the grass court in and then receiving a late wild card into Wimbledon after using up her allotment of three wild cards on the regular tour. She has now matched the run of Zheng Jie of , the only other women’s wild card to advance this far at Wimbledon. Lisicki is also the first German woman to reach the semifinals here since in 1999 and is part of a German revival that includes Andrea Petkovic and Julia Görges, who have both risen into the top 20.“It’s not only me,” the 21-year-old Lisicki said.With her powerful lower body and smooth motion, Lisicki has one of the most powerful serves on tour, but she relied on much more than that to hold off Bartoli, who defeated the defending champion in the fourth round. Lisicki used drop shots in abundance — some of them ill-advised but many of them effective — to break Bartoli’s rhythm and test her physical reserves. She also hit several outstanding lobs under duress to extend rallies. But she was also able to hold her own with power from the baseline. After cracking in the second set, she took command in the third as Bartoli, full of and nervous energy early, wilted under the roof.“I really do feel if I had the same level of energy as yesterday, I will still be able to come up as a winner,” Bartoli, the No. 9 seed, said. “But I just couldn’t anymore.”It was an indoor-outdoor round at the All Club. Rain forced the closure of the roof over Centre Court and delayed the start of the two quarterfinal matches on Court 1 between Kvitova and Tsvetana Pironkova of and between Azarenka and Tamira Paszek of .Kvitova, a powerful left-hander, eventually defeated Pironkova, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-2. Azarenka and Paszek, after playing one game on Court 1, were shifted to Centre Court and finished under the roof, with Azarenka reaching her first Grand slam semifinal with a 6-3, 6-1 victory.Even with the roof closed, Lisicki and Bartoli were battling the elements. A huge thunderclap startled Lisicki at one stage, causing her to laugh nervously, and as rain pounded on the fabric above, it was often difficult for spectators to hear the ball making contact with the strings.“Definitely something different to play on grass indoors and have a big thunderstorm out there,” Lisicki said. “But you just have to focus on the match and on each point, so it’s all right.”Focusing on the match at hand sounds like a wise move for Lisicki against Sharapova. They have played just once before: on a hardcourt in Miami in the third round of this year’s Sony Ericsson Open. Sharapova won, 6-2, 6-0.'"
"'11-06-29,'1','Finally, perhaps some good news on housing values.On Tuesday, the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index, a closely watched measure of home prices, posted a rise for April, the first in eight months.The index increased 0.7 percent, reflecting increases in prices in 13 of the 20 cities tracked. That compared with a 0.8 percent decline in March, when the index hit a new low.But analysts said it was unclear that a sustained rebound in the housing market was under way, noting that sales were typically stronger in the spring.David M. Blitzer, the chairman of the index committee at S.& P. Indices, called the April increase a welcome shift from previous months. “However, the seasonally adjusted numbers show that much of the improvement reflects the beginning of the spring-summer home buying season,” he added in a statement. “It is much too early to tell if this is a turning point or simply due to some warmer weather.”When seasonally adjusted figures are used, the index shows a less broad improvement.“For a real recovery, we would need to see several months of increasing home prices, large enough to shift the annual momentum to the positive side,” Mr. Blitzer said. “In short, better news, but still a lot of questions and a long way to go.”Only seven cities experienced lower prices, compared with 18 in March, the statement said. But six metropolitan areas were at their lowest levels in nearly four years: Charlotte, N.C., Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas, Miami and Tampa, Fla.'"
"'11-06-29,'1','After weeks of worries about the economy pulled stocks down, indexes have risen sharply for two days in a row.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 145 points on Tuesday, in part on signs that concerns about a global slowdown may be overblown. The increase followed a 109-point gain on Monday.Quarterly results from Nike that beat analysts’ expectations helped a rally in stocks of clothing stores, restaurants and jewelers on Tuesday. Such companies tend to do well when consumers are less worried about things like high gas prices and are willing to spend on themselves.Other industries that do well during periods of economic expansion led the stock market higher. Caterpillar, one of the 30 Dow stocks, gained the most, rising 2.3 percent. Industrials gained 1.2 percent over all. Consumer discretionary companies gained 1.6 percent.Signs of gains in the housing market helped lift Home Depot, which benefits when consumers spend on home improvement. It gained 2.1 percent after a report that home prices rose in April in 13 of the 20 cities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index. The index rose for the first time in eight months after the annual spring increase.'"
"'11-06-29,'1','Pilots say Air India is engaging in unsafe practices, including changing schedules so often that some pilots refer to the company’s management style as “schedule by wake-up call.”An Air India spokesman, Kamaljeet Rattan, did not respond to calls or e-mails for comment about the letter or the accusations. Air India has said in the past that pilot scheduling is not computerized, but has denied any safety problems.A Star Alliance executive said the network had received the letter from the Air India pilots. He indicated that he thought it had more to do with a fight between management and unions than actual safety concerns.Entry into Star Alliance, which would allow frequent fliers to claim air miles for using Air India, could add more than 10 percent to Air India’s revenue, the airline’s executives say. The airline lost more than $1 billion in the year that ended March 2010. It is 400 billion rupees ($8.9 billion) in debt, and is appealing to the government for more cash to continue operations this year.Air India has significantly reduced fares in recent weeks to try to woo back customers after a pilots’ strike that led to hundreds of canceled flights this year.Air safety in India has come under a spotlight in recent months. Passenger numbers grew faster than nearly anywhere else in the world in recent years, as a booming economy helped millions of people move from trains to airplanes. At the Paris Air Show last week, Indian carriers placed a third of all new jet orders, a total of $23 billion.So far, however, government oversight of the industry and local training for pilots and safety personnel have lagged far behind the fast growth.Hundreds of positions created in India’s central government to better police the industry remain unfilled, years after they were created. In March, India’s aviation regulatory agency said it had stripped a dozen commercial pilots of their licenses, after uncovering fraudulent training documents and favoritism.Despite the lack of safety infrastructure, India has had only one major air crash in the past decade, the May 2010 crash of an Air India flight to Mangalore that killed nearly 160 people.The aviation agency, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, says it is toughening flight safety rules. It said Monday that there would be no more exemptions of the kind that had allowed airlines to fly with fewer crew members than recommended because of employee shortages.“These people must have the necessary personnel who are well trained in an emergency,” E. K. Bharat Bhushan, director general of the aviation agency, said in an interview.The agency is also considering whether to increase training requirements for pilots and co-pilots, he said. “We felt that people could use more experience,” he said.In June, three representatives from Star Alliance airlines visited Air India’s facilities for a week, checking training procedures, scheduling, maintenance and other operations. They did not find any serious safety violations or major problems that would endanger the safety of a flight, Jaan Albrecht, the Star Alliance chief executive, said in a telephone interview.Air India has been having other problems, including a long-delayed reorganization, he said, but “regarding safety issues, we have the full satisfaction that the issues were examined, and we came up with a clean report.”Officials from Star Alliance are scheduled to meet with the Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation on July 4 to confirm that the government will honor commitments to allow Air India and other foreign airlines to work together.Star Alliance executives are eager to sign up a second carrier in India, Mr. Albrecht said. “Now that Air India will probably become a member by the 31st of July, we need to formalize the second carrier,” he said. Star Alliance has not formalized any agreement with that airline, Jet Airways.'"
"'11-06-29,'1','A.: In a way, yes. I’ve written some 150 books, for adults and children, both fiction and nonfiction. I do engineering, I design monuments, I design buildings. In Germany I designed a kindergarten in the shape of a cat. The children enter the mouth and go downstairs inside the tail. I’m a bit of bee, but basically I am an author.Q. You’ve called your books “the nightmare of the pedagogues.” Why is that?A. In my children’s books, you’ll always find an element of fear. I think children are thrilled with fear, and they have to be taught how to get over it. When I was a child, I was scared of the night and the dark, so my brother took me to the cemetery on a moonlit night. And I got over it. Then I would go out at night in a bed sheet and try to scare other people.Why am I the pedagogues’ nightmare? They think I traumatize children. They think children should be loved and protected. But if you do only that, they’re not ready for life.Q. You have also been called the bad boy of children’s literature.A. I’ve been an instigator. I want children to make fun of adults. As I’ve often said, children know where children come from, but not where adults come from.Q. Is there an overriding message in your children’s books?A. Yes, possibly. Every human being has something the others don’t have. That makes him an individual. You should be aware of your differences and exploit them. This is why I often use animals that everyone hates — a snake, a vulture, a bat — in my books. All those animals are redeemed by the fact that they had appendages or qualities the others didn’t have. In the end they become the heroes.Q. Your books avoid simple words like tree or bird or flower.A. Yes. I’m in love with language. Between the ages of 3 and 7, children can learn three languages a year. If you’re not teaching them another language, you can always develop their vocabulary. Make them ask, “What does that mean?”Q. Do you think children’s literature underestimates children?A. Absolutely. Children are born critical; they’re not stupid. They know what’s going on.The very fact that they have lists of words for different ages: these are the words a 6-year-old should know. That was what was so wonderful about Ursula Nordstrom [Mr. Ungerer’s celebrated editor at Harper & Row]: she let me use the words I wanted to use. I always go back to Edward Lear and Hilaire Belloc and Lewis Carroll. Nonsense words. Everybody should learn “Jabberwocky.”Q. In your conversation with Jules Feiffer, you talked about the difference in writing and illustrating children’s books rather than just doing one or the other.A. Look, it’s a fact that the children’s books that withstand the grinding of time all come from authors who did both. Because the author has a vision, and there’s an osmosis between the oral and the visual, which come together and mix.Q. Is there a line between children’s literature and grown-up books?A. That’s a very good question. If I write a book, I do it mostly for myself, for the child in me and for the adult in me. The criterion for my children’s books is: If I were a child, would I like it? That’s very egotistical, but it’s the same thing with my books for adults. I wouldn’t do a book if I didn’t want to partake and share. With a book, I can do both: I give and I share.'"

They could also use Richards’s skill on the power-play point.Richards won the Cup and his Smythe and Byng Awards in 2003-4 at Tampa Bay, with John Tortorella as his coach. Now coach of the Rangers, Tortorella has made no secret of his admiration for Richards.Though the Rangers have $25.6 million available, they must sign seven more players, including Ryan Callahan and Brandon Dubinsky, part of the young core Richards demands. Another drawback is that they are probably two years away from being a Stanley Cup contender.¶ Richards was with the Lightning when they won the Cup and had a house in the area until last April, even though he was traded from Tampa to Dallas in 2008.The Lightning missed the Stanley Cup finals last month by a goal, falling to the Boston Bruins, 1-0, in Game 7 of the conference finals. They have an engaged new owner in Jeff Vinik, a respected young general manager in Steve Yzerman and an innovative young coach in Guy Boucher.The team is poised to win and has about $18 million of cap space. Even if Tampa is not a hot hockey market, Richards knows the place and likes it.But the Lightning are stacked with centers, led by Steven Stamkos and Vincent Lecavalier. And although Lecavalier has been a close friend of Richards’s since they played together in the Quebec league as teenagers, Morris, Richards’s agent, hinted of resentment, referring to “what Brad had to endure in Tampa” under the now-departed ownership duo of Oren Koules and Len Barrie, who, he added, “basically took Vinny over Brad and pushed Brad out.”¶ The Flyers need a productive forward after trading Mike Richards and Jeff Carter for cap space to sign the former Coyotes goalie Ilya Bryzgalov. But those trades unsettled those Flyers left behind, and General Manager Paul Holmgren must still sign Wayne Simmonds and Jakub Voracek, role players he acquired in the trades. That leaves the Flyers with just $8 million to spend. It looks as if more players will need to be dumped. Will Richards see that as a hindrance to the Flyers’ once-promising Cup chances?Also, the Flyers already have quality centers in Danny Briere and Claude Giroux.¶ The Blackhawks cleared $7 million of space last week by trading defenseman Bryan Campbell, and now have $14 million to spend. And Richards would be a strong complement to the Hawks’ other top pivot, Jonathan Toews.¶ Toronto satisfies all of Richards’s requirements except for the most important one: the Leafs are not close to being a Stanley Cup contender.¶ Buffalo has become an intriguing place under the Sabres’ new owner, Terry Pegula. There may be no place in the United States where hockey matters more than Buffalo, but it still lacks the glamour of Richards’s other suitors.Morris said that when the free-agent market opens, Richards will be in Morris’s office in Mississauga, Ontario, to listen to offers.Morris said he would not be surprised if by the end of the day, he and Richards had narrowed things down to “three or four teams” for Richards to “think about overnight.”So by Saturday, Richards may have decided whether he is bound for Manhattan.The Penguins are awaiting an answer after offering Jaromir Jagr, a former most valuable player, a one-year contract. ... St. Louis forward Paul Kariya announced his retirement after scoring 402 goals in a 989-game career that spanned 15 seasons. Kariya made his name with Anaheim, where he scored 25 or more goals in six of seven seasons. But his career was marred by concussions, and he sat out last season with postconcussion syndrome. ... Todd Marchant, who won a Stanley Cup with Anaheim in 2007, retired after an 17-year career as a solid checking center. He will remain with the Ducks as director of player development. ... Tampa Bay has agreed to re-sign the 41-year-old goalie Dwayne Roloson, who led the Lightning to within a game of the Stanley Cup finals this spring. Roloson would have been an unrestricted free agent but reached agreement for a one-year contract. ... Columbus acquired the rights to negotiate with James Wisniewski, one of the most coveted free-agent defensemen, from Montreal. In exchange, the Canadiens get a conditional late-round pick in next year’s draft.'"

Those detained are both monks and laypeople. The protests took place in an area that Tibetans call Kardze, known to the Chinese as Ganzi. The local police headquarters had no comment. The area has been unsettled since April 2008, when at least eight Tibetans were killed by Chinese security forces firing into a crowd of protestors, Tibetan exile groups said at the time. Those protests took place as part of a large uprising that began in Lhasa, Tibet, and unfolded across the Tibetan plateau. The report this week also said two monks from Kardze held a protest in the Barkhor market in Lhasa on June 22, possibly the first there since March 2008.

"'11-06-30,'1','Combat experiences are like Tolstoy’s unhappy families: no two are alike, which may be why they often make for great novels, as Tolstoy also knew. The cause need not even be noble, since a hopeless situation and senseless violence can actually fortify a work of fiction. Certainly that is the case with António Lobo Antunes’s “Land at the End of the World,” set in Angola in the early 1970s, as Portugal’s ludicrous effort to preserve its African empire was meandering to an inglorious end.The unnamed narrator is a young doctor wrenched from a comfortable life in Lisbon and forced to spend 27 months on the front lines treating his hapless fellow soldiers. He resents that they have been made “agents of a provincial form of fascism that was corroding and eating away at itself with the slow acid of its own sad, parochial stupidity.” But mostly he is sickened by the mutilated bodies delivered to his care, and fearful the same may happen to him. Though there are flashes of humor, almost always mordant, this is not “M*A*S*H” but something far darker and more absurd.“The Land at the End of the World,” newly translated by Margaret Jull Costa, was originally published in 1979, four years after Portugal’s withdrawal from Africa and the final collapse of America’s intervention in Vietnam. At that time it was interpreted as a comment on the inherent futility of those recent Western adventures in the third world. But read at more than 30 years’ remove from those events much of this account of what Mr. Lobo Antunes’s narrator calls a “painful apprenticeship in dying” would no doubt make sense to survivors of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.“What have they done to us,” the narrator asks in one of his typically long and torrential sentences, “sitting here waiting in this landlocked place, imprisoned by three rows of barbed wire in a land that doesn’t belong to us, dying of malaria and bullets, whose whistling trajectory sounds like a nylon thread vibrating, fed by unreliable supply lines whose arrival or not is dependent on frequent accidents en route, on ambushes and land mines, fighting an invisible enemy, fighting the endless days that never pass, fighting homesickness, indignation, and remorse, fighting the dark nights as thick and opaque as a mourning veil.”Back home in Lisbon, his marriage yet another casualty of the war, the traumatized doctor finds no solace. “Rootless, I float between two continents, both of which spurn me,” he says. “I have no place anywhere, I went too far away for too long to ever belong here again, to these autumns of rain and Sunday Masses, these long winters as dull as blown light bulbs.”Even sex cannot provide relief, or a distraction, since he is capable only of collecting women “the way you might find odd bits of change in the pocket of a winter coat.” The narrator’s story unfolds over the course of a long, drunken night in which he successfully, but only half-heartedly, seduces a woman he has just met in a bar, who has the “aseptic, competent dandruff-free air of an executive secretary.” He knows this erotic escapade will end like all his others: with “the damp defeat of two exhausted bodies on the mattress” after an act of coitus that has all “the limp joy of two strands of spaghetti entwining.”'"
"'11-06-30,'1','On Tuesday, at a Chelsea diner, Mr. Ellner made no apologies. “I find connections, and I don’t let go until someone moves their position,” he said. “I’m sure there are a lot of people who have me on auto-delete on their e-mails.”During the frenetic run-up to the vote, he would send embargoed statements to writers for several possible poll outcomes. However news might break, he wanted to make sure articles would include his positive spin.His new prominence represents a personal success, from a bleak moment last May, after Mr. Ellner had been tapped to lead the Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay rights organization. At the time, Mr. Ellner, a Harvard Law School graduate who had done extensive pro-bono work in public education and gay rights, had been a senior adviser to Joel I. Klein, the then-schools chancellor. While Mr. Ellner received endorsements from state and city politicians, advocates in the gay community derided him because he worked for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who was seen as being too moderate on gay issues, and they threatened to cut ties with the organization if Mr. Ellner was appointed. He withdrew his candidacy.“When someone calls someone else an opportunist, it’s because they’re jealous,” said Richard Socarides, a friend who was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton on gay rights.THIS fall, Mr. Ellner helped raise money to target vulnerable candidates who had voted against the same-sex marriage bill in 2009. He quietly met with Republicans, seeking to change a few votes.“He could have done a hard sell,” said Senator James S. Alesi, a Republican from the Rochester area who had voted against the 2009 bill. “But he was smart enough to know I would come to the decision on my own. His interpersonal capabilities are superb.”But Mr. Ellner also wanted to drum up popular momentum for the bill, to frame it as a moderate issue. So he called his friend from Dartmouth, Annie Sundberg, a filmmaker who co-directed “Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,” to make the videos, which rolled out on a steady basis: Whoopi Goldberg, Mayor Bloomberg, Anna Wintour, Russell Simmons.But at a fund-raiser, a straight friend pulled him aside and said bluntly: “Brian! Hollywood? Gay. Fashion? Gay. Music? Gay. Usual suspects. I’m the guy you want to reach: get cops and athletes.”By January, Barbara Bush, a daughter of George W. Bush, had made a video supporting the cause. Then William J. Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner. And finally, through his older brother who used to date the daughter of a New York sportscaster — connection, connection, connection — hello, Sean Avery, the New York Ranger.“Brian made me feel comfortable and totally relaxed,” Mr. Avery said. “And we kept in contact afterwards. He was just persistent in not letting go.” Athletes like Steve Nash, the basketball star, and Michael Strahan, the former New York Giants defensive end, followed.Although the impeccably dressed Mr. Ellner, with his Ivy League background and jobs at top-label law firms, would seem to radiate the easy confidence of privilege, he comes from neither.He grew up in Queens, with middle-class parents, neither of whom attended college. When his parents divorced messily, he lived with his father, who had just lost his job, for two years and switched from private school to public school. Mr. Ellner describes that time as dark and scarring. Friendless and depressed, he put on weight. Eventually he moved to Manhattan to live with his mother, who was on her third marriage.Perhaps, Mr. Ellner believes, he developed his remarkable networking skills out of need to create a support system. At Dartmouth, he became president of his freshman class, then president of his sophomore class. Typically, candidates for schoolwide leadership run as juniors, to hold office their senior year. But, said Mr. Ellner with a grin: “I saw there were three juniors running. I was a sophomore. I saw an opportunity to split the vote. And I did.”In 2005, he adopted the same strategy as he considered the crowded field of Democratic candidates for Manhattan borough president. Though he did not win, it whetted his appetite, and he does not rule out a future in politics.Because he was hired by the Human Rights Campaign to help get the job done in Albany — mission accomplished — he doesn’t yet know his next move.Will Mr. Ellner now propose to someone? He is speechless. He would like to marry one day, he said.“I’ve been dating someone for just over a year,” he said. “I move slowly.”He went to his apartment to change for that evening’s victory party. He re-emerged in his conservative finery, dressed as Clark Kent to do Superman’s work. Ralph Lauren suit, wide tie, Church’s brogues. Is it true that his Turnbull & Asser shirts are custom-tailored?'"
"'11-06-30,'1','Three team competitions at the fifth European Open Championships in Poznan, Poland, finished on Wednesday.The open event was won by Jim Mahaffey, Gary Cohler, Jeff Meckstroth, Eric Rodwell, Sam Lev and Jacek Pszczola (Pepsi, as he is known) from the United States. They defeated Michel and Thomas Bessis (father and son) from France and Josef Piekarek and Alexander Smirnov from Germany by 155 international match points to 133.The women’s teams was taken by Mine Babac, Lale Gumrukcuoglu, Serap Kuranoglu and Dilek Yavas from Turkey. They beat the Dutch team of Carla Arnolds, Bep Vriend, Laura Dekkers, Marion Michielsen, Jet Pasman and Anneke Simons by 89 imps to 51. (Geeske Joel, Tobi Sokolow, Jill Levin, Jill Meyers and Janice Seamon-Molson from the United States and Sabine Auken from Germany were fourth.)The senior competition went to Patrick Grenthe, Philippe Vanhoutte, Patrice Piganeau, François Leenhardt, Guy Lasserre and Philippe Poizat from France. They defeated an English-Swedish team of Paul Hackett, Tony Waterlow, David Price, Colin Simpson, Gunnar Hallberg and Hans Gothe by 111 imps to 64.All finals were over 48 boards. In the open event Mahaffey was losing by 25 imps after the first session and 16 after the second. But a powerful last set, won by 51 imps to 13, saw the Americans capture the gold medals.The diagramed deal was Board 38. Piekarek (East) opened one spade; Pepsi (South) overcalled two diamonds; Smirnov (West) made a negative double to show four hearts (or, as here, five in a hand too weak to respond two hearts); Lev (North) cue-bid two spades to promise at least game-invitational values with diamond support; South rebid his second suit (perhaps partly as a lead-inhibiter); North settled for three diamonds; and South signed off in three no-trump.'"
"'11-06-30,'1','The Kentucky Derby winner Animal Kingdom is out for the year after he was found to have a fracture in his right hind leg.Barry Irwin, chief executive of Team Valor International, the syndicate that owns Animal Kingdom, said that Animal Kingdom would have surgery Thursday at the New Bolton Clinic in Pennsylvania. Dr. Dean Richardson will insert a screw to compress what Irwin called a “hairline fracture.”Animal Kingdom was initially found to have a small fissure in that hind leg in the days after a sixth-place finish in the Belmont Stakes. He was bumped, and he nearly unseated his jockey in the early stages of the Belmont.“We could really go without the surgery, but by doing so we’re cutting the recovery time from four months to four to six weeks,” Irwin said.Irwin said that not only did he intend to run Animal Kingdom next year, but also that he would like to campaign him as a 5-year-old. Among the races circled is the 2012 Dubai World Cup at Meydan Racecourse, on a synthetic surface the likes of which Animal Kingdom has thrived on. He won a maiden race at Keeneland on a synthetic track at age 2 and the Spiral Stakes at Turfway Park over a similar surface before the Derby.“We’d like to put him back on grass at some point, too,” Irwin said. “We have a lot of options with this colt, and let’s just hope no other injuries surface.”'"
"'11-06-30,'1','PARIS (Reuters) — François Baroin, a protégé of the former president of France, Jacques Chirac, was named French finance minister by President Nicolas Sarkozy on Wednesday.Mr. Baroin, 46, whose youthful air once earned him the nickname Harry Potter, is taking the post after 14 months as budget minister. In that job, he advocated fiscal discipline and economic convergence with Germany, albeit gradually and without painful austerity measures. He succeeds Christine Lagarde, who on Tuesday was named managing director of the International Monetary Fund.Emerging from the shadow of his mentors, Mr. Chirac and Dominique de Villepin, the former prime minister, Mr. Baroin will be under pressure to create a political legacy in a landscape largely occupied by longtime figures.He faces a tough comparison with Ms. Lagarde, whose experience as chairwoman of the American law firm Baker & McKenzie gave her status as a seasoned international player and a hard-nosed negotiator, equally at ease in English and her native French.By contrast Mr. Baroin speaks English poorly, has not proved himself in talks on a European or global level, and has worked abroad only as minister to France’s territories.'"
"'11-06-30,'1','With so much anticipation before the vote, analysts said that by the time it took place, investors had fixed positions.“This is classic ‘buy the rumor, sell the news,’ ” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. “The equity market was up in anticipation. We priced it in ahead of time.”Still, the news was enough to lead major indexes higher. The DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 1.7 percent at 7,294.14, while the FTSE 100 in London rose 1.5 percent to 5,855.95.In the Asia-Pacific region on Thursday, the reaction was muted, with the Nikkei 225 flat by the midday break in Tokyo. On Wednesday, the Nikkei had risen 1.5 percent on optimism that the Greek Parliament would pass the austerity measures.Stocks in South Korea edged up 0.3 percent on Thursday, and Singapore and Taiwan climbed 0.7 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was 1.7 percent higher by midmorning.In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 72.73 points, or 0.60 percent, at 12,261.42. The Dow has now risen every day this week, putting it up 326.84 points, or 2.74 percent, in that period.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 10.74 points, or 0.83 percent, at 1,307.41 and the Nasdaq composite index was up 11.18 points, or 0.41 percent, at 2,740.49.The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 24/32, to 100 1/32. The yield rose to 3.12 percent, from 3.03 percent late Tuesday.Bank stocks helped lift the Dow, and Bank of America was the most actively traded in the broader markets’ financial sector, which rose more than 2 percent. Bank of America, which said it would set aside $14 billion to pay investors who bought securities it assembled from mortgages that later soured, rose nearly 3 percent to $11.14. The company said it expected the agreement to lead to a second-quarter loss of $8.6 billion to $9.1 billion.Citigroup was up more than 3 percent at $41.50. Morgan Stanley rose 4.75 percent to $23.39.Other sectors that forged ahead were materials and energy, which each closed more than 1 percent higher. Oil closed up $1.88 at $94.77.Yields on benchmark 10-year Spanish, Portuguese and Greek bonds declined, while those in safer equivalents issued by Germany and France rose, indicating investors were willing to switch back into riskier securities.The euro ended the day at $1.4431, up slightly from $1.4370 Tuesday.The agreement by Greek lawmakers on the austerity measures was a crucial step in the international rescue of the crippled economy, and the relatively muted market reaction to the vote showed that investors knew that the country’s financial troubles were far from over.“What’s really important is not the vote itself,” said George Magnus, senior economic adviser at UBS in London, “but the implementation of what they’re voting on, and that’s where the programs will come unstuck.”The vote was critical to unlocking near-term financing, specifically the disbursement of the fifth installment of the original 110 billion euro bailout for Athens (roughly $140 billion when agreed to last year).That installment would be worth 12 billion euros and would enable Greece to meet obligations like bond coupon payments in July, while paving the way for a new international lending program to provide financing through 2014.Euro area ministers are expected to provide details of the program on July 3.In a research report released Tuesday, Citigroup analysts said: “Despite the aid package, eventual Greek haircuts may be inevitable, with estimated private sector haircuts of 65 to 77 percent,” referring to the write-downs that bond holders will be required to accept.“In other words, a bailout package addresses the liquidity issue much more than the solvency issue,” Citigroup said.Two Commerzbank analysts, Benjamin Schröder and Peggy Jäger, said early Wednesday that “even if the bills are passed, worries could still linger on for longer, if no broader consensus across Greek political parties forms.”'"
