"'06-04-01,'0','Bernard H. Siegan, a conservative legal scholar whose unsuccessful nomination to a federal appellate judgeship was one of the most bitterly disputed judicial nominations of the Reagan era, died on Monday in Encinitas, Calif. He was 81 and lived in San Diego.The cause was complications of a stroke he had last year, his wife, Shelley, said.At his death, Professor Siegan was a distinguished professor of law at the University of San Diego, where he had taught for more than 30 years.In early 1987, President Ronald Reagan nominated Professor Siegan to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which comprises nine Western states, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. In July 1988, after nearly a year and a half in which Professor Siegan was publicly denounced by liberals and also by some conservatives, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected his nomination.Professor Siegan was best known for his ardent libertarian views on economic matters, and on property rights in particular. In his many books and articles, he maintained that the Constitution protected what he called the ""economic liberties"" of individuals. The courts, he argued, should return to their pre-New Deal stance of enforcing such liberties.Though Professor Siegan had his defenders, some conservatives considered his views extreme, seeing him as a ""judicial activist"" who thought the courts should invalidate much of the economic and social legislation of the modern era.Judge Robert H. Bork, whose nomination to the Supreme Court was rejected by the Senate in 1987, had cautioned in a 1985 speech that Professor Siegan's economic ideas could engender ""a massive shift away from democracy and toward judicial rule.""'"
"'06-04-01,'0','""Many national studies on victims of domestic violence tell us that their abusers have threatened to kill, threatened to harm or actually harmed their pets as a means of keeping the victim from leaving the relationship,"" Mr. Baldacci, a Democrat, said. ""With this new law, we hope to help remove another tool for emotional and physical violence used by the abuser to exert power and control over their victims.""Maine is believed to be the first state with such a law. But the issue has captured attention around the country as police departments, domestic-violence programs, animal protection societies and state officials become increasingly aware of a link between domestic violence and animal abuse.A new program in Columbus, Ohio, takes animals of victims of domestic violence and places them in a women's prison, where the inmates care for them. In Nashville, the city gives such pets a safe haven for up to 30 days. And in St. Louis, the Domestic Violence Pet Assistance Program finds foster homes for the animals.""There are some batterers who are prone to using coercion and terrorizing tactics who very well know how strongly attached their partner is to the animals in her life,"" said Frank A. Ascione, a psychologist at Utah State University. ""It's the dynamic of preying on the love and affection that women often have for the animals in their lives, who may be their only source of solace, their only source of unconditional love.""In the late 1990's, Dr. Ascione and colleagues interviewed 101 women in shelters for battered women and 120 women who were not victims of domestic violence.They found that 54 percent of the battered women said their abusers had harmed or killed their animals, compared with 5 percent of women in the other group. Thirty-four percent of the women whose pets had been both threatened and harmed delayed going to the shelters out of concern for their pets.In 2002, Dr. Ascione said, he interviewed 42 men in prison who had had violent relationships with women and found that half of them said they had hurt or killed pets.""Police and prosecutors are well aware of the very close link between threats to pets and threats to family members,"" Maine's public safety commissioner, Michael P. Cantara, said. He cited a 2002 case in which an abusive husband had beaten the family's cats to death, buried them in the backyard and threatened a similar fate for his wife and children.""To our horror,"" Mr. Cantara said, ""that yard was filled with dead Maine pets.""Karen Days, president of the Columbus Coalition Against Family Violence in Ohio, said of her work at the Columbus city prosecutor's office: ""I had a victim who was in my office, and the prosecutor agreed to issue a warrant for the arrest of her partner. But she was just adamant that she be able to go home first and get her dog. When I asked why, she said, 'When I left him before, he started mailing me pieces of my cat to tell me if you don't come back this is what I'm going to continue to do.' ""Ms. Days and others said that battered women without children might be the most attached to their pets. But in homes with children, there are other concerns, Dr. Ascione said.He said that seeing animals abused made ""some kids likely to act out what they may have witnessed,"" while others ""get even more strongly attached to their pets,"" which can be dangerous if the ""children start trying to intervene to protect the animals.""Jill Morris, the public policy director at the National Coalition against Domestic Violence, said that she had not heard of another law like Maine's but that some judges had begun to include animals in protective orders.Ms. Days said her organization would be lobbying the Ohio Legislature to make penalties for domestic violence stiffer if animal abuse was involved.Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States, said his organization conducted workshops for police departments, prosecutors and social workers on the problem.""Oftentimes these situations go on for a long period, say months or years,"" Mr. Pacelle said. ""We really try to spread the word about this.""'"
"'06-04-01,'0','Norman Leonard, an eloquent courtroom voice for unpopular causes — West Coast longshoremen in the 1930's, left-wing dissenters in the 1950's, free-speech rebels and antiwar protesters in the 1960's and 70's — died on March 7 at a hospital in San Francisco. He was 92.His death was reported by the family.Mr. Leonard, who represented the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union for five decades, became nationally known with the government's efforts to deport the union's founding president, Harry Bridges, as an undesirable immigrant. Mr. Leonard defended him against perjury charges when Mr. Bridges, an immigrant from Australia, was accused of having falsely denied being a Communist at his naturalization hearing.Widely respected for his skills as a researcher, legal writer and appellate strategist, Mr. Leonard wrote the brief in the 1953 appeal of the Bridges case to the Supreme Court, which overturned the union leader's conviction. The court held that Mr. Bridges had been wrongly indicted after the statute of limitations on the charges ran out.During the same decade, Mr. Leonard helped defend West Coast leaders of the Communist Party against charges, under the Smith Act, of advocating the violent overthrow of the government. The Supreme Court reversed their convictions on First Amendment grounds.He also represented clients called to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, defendants charged with harboring a fugitive, and one who was tried under the Taft-Hartley Act for serving as a union officer while being a member of the Communist Party.'"

"'06-04-01,'0','THE DAVIS AND NOAH SHOW -- Short news conferences before big sports events do not necessarily reveal character or even dimensions of personality. But they sometimes hint at an athlete's state of mind.Consider Glen Davis of L.S.U. and Joakim Noah of Florida, who addressed the news media Friday. They are two leading personalities in this unlikely Final Four.The smiles and laughter of Davis, the 6-9, 310-pound forward nicknamed Big Baby, spread to his teammates alongside him on the dais and to the reporters trying to interview him.He seemed to enjoy the exposure and sought even more.Davis compared eating organic oatmeal to stay fit to contestants eating ""nasty food"" on the television show ""Fear Factor"" and added: ""If I eat this, I can make a lot of money one day. That was my motivation.""Referring to U.C.L.A.'s history of success in the N.C.A.A. tournament, Davis said he had checked the current roster and did not see the names of Bill Walton or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.""We can't let that scare us,"" he said of the Bruins' tradition, adding that U.C.L.A. was ""just a couple of letters on the front of a jersey.""He also said he could not stand tobacco, alcohol or drug use. ""Every time I see somebody smoking or just drinking a wine cooler, it just makes me sick to my stomach,"" he said. ""So, nah, I don't mess around with stuff like that. I've seen the result.""Noah, a 6-11 forward and center who is the son of a former tennis star and the former Miss Sweden, also tried to be pithy in his remarks. But he seemed weary of all the recent attention, and his words had an edge.On his long hair, he said: ""My hair gives me strength and power. Yeah, it does. So don't cut it.""When asked about the many pronunciations of his first name, Noah said, ""Don't call me Joe,"" and added that "" 'Yokum' is probably the most extreme"" pronunciation that he has heard.Of his teammate Taurean Green, Noah said, ""I hate him,"" in a way that apparently was meant to be funny.But his facial expression and tone of voice brought little laughter from his teammates or his audience. Nor did he win friends with his answer to a question about how Florida would match up against George Mason on Saturday.""You guys are usually wrong when it comes to things like that,"" Noah said of the reporters on hand.""You guys have only seen us play maybe three, four times in the year, and you guys think you have it all figured out. We can't worry about what you guys say. Otherwise, our heads would explode.""FOUR-STAR MOTIVATION -- To describe how 11th-seeded George Mason made it to a national semifinal game against third-seeded Florida, Patriots Coach Jim Larranaga quoted a line from ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" about a chase by lawmen.""Who are these guys?"" said Larranaga, who is known to love movies. ""Basically, that does represent George Mason University men's basketball team. Nobody knows us. We've been flying under the radar screen.""'"
"'06-04-01,'0','When the initial estimate of economic growth in the first quarter is released on April 28, economists expect it to show expansion accelerating to an annual rate of 4 percent or more. At that rate, economic growth could push prices higher.NERVOUS TIME -- An anxious standoff loomed over the automobile industry as the Delphi Corporation filed papers in federal bankruptcy court yesterday seeking to unilaterally impose wage and benefit cuts on its 34,000 hourly workers. The move came after the company, the world's second-largest auto parts maker, could not get its employees to agree to cuts before its self-imposed deadline of Thursday.Seeking the unilateral cuts sets up a confrontation with Delphi's two big unions. One, the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers-Communications Workers of America, has already authorized a strike if the court approves the cuts. A bigger union, the United Automobile Workers, could also seek its members' authority to strike.A walkout would affect most major carmakers in the United States, including factories in the country owned by foreign companies, including Nissan. But the biggest effect would be felt at General Motors, which spun off Delphi as a separate company in 1999 and still relies on it for many of its parts. G.M., which had joined the negotiations, said it lost $10.6 billion last year, in part because lower sales did not support its high labor costs.A federal bankruptcy court judge is scheduled to consider Delphi's request on May 8. Workers will continue to receive full pay and benefits -- and their unions are urging them to remain on the job -- at least until then.THE ENRON TRIAL -- Prosecutors in the trial of two former Enron chief executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, rested their case after eight weeks of testimony by 22 witnesses before a federal court jury in Houston.As soon as the government finished presenting evidence, Judge Simeon T. Lake of federal district court dropped 3 of the 31 counts against Mr. Skilling and one of the seven counts against Mr. Lay. The prosecutors, seeking to simplify their case, chose not to present evidence to support those accusations.Defense lawyers are scheduled to open their case on Monday, and they have said they plan to have both Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling testify.MANY HAPPY RETURNS -- While millions of people were preparing to file their tax returns, a former partner at the KPMG accounting firm pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud by admitting he had helped rich people escape paying millions of dollars in taxes using phony tax shelters.As part of his plea, the former partner, David Rivkin, who had worked for KPMG in San Diego, agreed to cooperate with the government as it pursued similar charges against 16 other former employees of the firm as well as an outside lawyer and an independent investment adviser.Prosecutors have focused their investigation on four tax shelters that they contend were bogus and that they say created $11 billion in phony losses that allowed wealthy individuals to avoid paying about $2.5 billion in taxes.Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of federal district court, who accepted the guilty plea, said that Mr. Rivkin's sentence would depend on how well he cooperated with prosecutors. He could be sentenced to as much as five years in prison for each count he admitted.SUE YOU BLUES -- It was Apple v. Apple in Britain's High Court -- again. The Apple Corps music publishing company of the Beatles sued Apple Computer for the third time since 1980, accusing the computer maker of infringing on its trademark.Specifically, Apple Corps said Apple Computer violated a 1991 agreement between the companies when it started its iTunes online music service. The Apples had settled earlier disputes over the rights to their names by agreeing that Apple Computer would stay out of the music business.Lawyers for the computer maker argued in court that their client had not violated that agreement because it did not publish music, it only sold it for use on its popular iPod music players.Justice Edward Mann is not expected to rule on the matter for some time.MOST VIEWED Following are the most-viewed business news articles on nytimes.com from March 25 through March 31: 1.

"'06-04-01,'0','George Lucas has acknowledged the influence of Akira Kurosawa's 1958 samurai film, ""The Hidden Fortress,"" on his ""Star Wars"" saga, and there are many other examples in the science fiction and fantasy canon that play on the powerful resemblance between bushido blades and light sabers.Imperial Edo is reflected in the malignant intergalactic empires of space operas; the long-suffering Japanese peasantry becomes the victimized population of peaceful planets like Luke Skywalker's Tatooine; and the pure-hearted samurai of ancient folk tales mutate into the idealistic warriors who populate films like the ""Lord of the Rings"" cycle.With ""Samurai 7,"" an elaborate, 26-episode animated series from Japan that starts tonight at 10:30 on the Independent Film Channel, the circle is closed. Broadcast in Japan in 2004, the series, produced by Gonzo Digimation under the direction of Toshifumi Takizawa, is a retro-future reimagining of Kurosawa's best-known samurai film (and one of the best-known Japanese films in the West), the 1954 ""Seven Samurai.""The similarities between the projects seem fairly superficial. In the original, a village of starving rice farmers, tired of having their yearly crop stolen by bandits, sends a group of emissaries to a neighboring city, in hope of finding unemployed samurai hungry or idealistic enough to fight for food and lodging. The villagers return with one dignified veteran fighter, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), who enlists six other candidates. They include Heihachi, a samurai so poor that he has been reduced to chopping firewood for a living; Katsushiro, an eager young apprentice who hasn't yet earned his samurai stripes; and, most famously, a raging, colorful drunk, Kikuchiyo -- the role that turned the charismatic Toshiro Mifune into an international star.In the anime version, the rice farmers are still starving, but the bandits now ride around in flying horseshoe-shaped fortresses, which they use to terrorize the locals into turning over both crops and women. The envoys to the big city are three anime-friendly figures, redesigned to appeal to the youthful audience of Japanese animation: Kirara (with the dubbed voice of Colleen Clinkenbeard) is a water priestess, with a midsection bared à la Britney Spears, who uses her ""dousing crystals"" to tell her which samurai to hire. She is accompanied by her adorable kid sister, Komachi (Luci Christian) and Rikichi, a boy from the village, whose desire to fight masks a terrible secret. Only Rikichi is a character in Kurosawa's film.'"
"'06-04-01,'0','BRUSSELS, March 31 - Microsoft left a two-day antitrust hearing in Brussels on Friday claiming it had reached a breakthrough with European regulators, but regulators and rivals dismissed the claim as an exaggeration.Microsoft was making a last-ditch attempt to avoid daily fines of up to two million euros ($2.4 million) for failing to honor an antitrust ruling handed down by the European Commission in March 2004.The commission, Europe's top competition authority, has accused Microsoft of failing to provide adequate technical details about its Windows operating system. The information would allow rival makers of server systems to design programs that work as well with PC's running Windows as Microsoft's own server software does.The commission ruled two years ago that by withholding this information, Microsoft was stifling competition. Microsoft maintains that it has provided the information.But in December, Neil Barrett, the British computer scientist picked to oversee Microsoft's compliance with the 2004 ruling, dismissed the documents offered as ""unusable.""'"

"'06-04-01,'0','OTTAWA, March 31 - MDS, a Canadian drug and medical testing company, suspended operations at its Montreal laboratory on Friday after another unfavorable audit from the United States Food and Drug Administration.The laboratory conducts tests for generic drug makers to show regulators that their products produce the same results as brand name pharmaceuticals. The F.D.A. audits the Canadian lab because its findings are presented for drug approvals in the United States.The audit that set off the temporary closing is part of a long-term review of the lab's operations from 2000 to 2004. In December 2004, F.D.A. inspectors told the company that it failed to properly investigate the causes of abnormal test results and that samples of drugs undergoing tests had been contaminated.Documents posted on the F.D.A.'s Web site indicate that some of the test results involve generic versions of loratadine, an allergy tablet sold by Schering-Plough under the Claritin brand name in the United States. Neither the regulator nor MDS have named the generic drug makers that use the testing company.Sharon Mathers, the vice president for investor relations at MDS, said an audit by the F.D.A. in February found that some problems discovered by the 2004 inspection, which she did not specify, still persisted at the Montreal lab.As a result, Ms. Mathers said, all testing at the Montreal lab has been moved to other MDS operations in Britain, Canada, Switzerland and the United States.'"

Fiocco Jr., a freshman at the College of New Jersey, since Sunday afternoon. At a news conference on Friday morning, Joseph L. Bocchini Jr., the Mercer County prosecutor, said that Mr. Fiocco's disappearance was still classified as a missing person case but added that investigators had begun to search two Pennsylvania landfills for possible evidence.Mr. Fiocco, of Mantua Township in Gloucester County, N.J., was last seen early Saturday morning when he returned to the dormitory after an off-campus party. Friends told the authorities that he appeared to be intoxicated and that he ended up sleeping in a room down the hall with two other students. Mr. Fiocco was not in the room when the others awoke in the morning.On Sunday, the following day, Mr. Fiocco's roommate reported him missing to the campus police about 3 p.m.Over the last several days, the police have been paying close attention to a garbage chute that feeds into a large bin at Wolfe Hall, a freshman dormitory. Earlier in the week, the police ran a camera down the length of the 10-story chute, but investigators would not comment on what they found, what theories they were pursuing or if they believed Mr. Fiocco was still alive.'"
"'06-04-01,'0','""Everybody expected big things from him because of basketball,"" she said. ""But more than that, he was just a really, really good kid.""Fearing he had no place in the United States, Konate once tried to run away. He took a bus from Boston to New York and checked out a few flights back to Mali, where he was raised. But one of Konate's cousins in New York persuaded him to return. And the Carlsons persuaded him to stay.Their house in Shirley, Mass., in the countryside near the New Hampshire border, had just enough room for a 6-foot-7, 200-pound boarder. When the Carlsons, a family of four, went on vacation, Konate tagged along. When they celebrated Christmas, he was the one tall enough to put the angel on top of the tree. When he became eligible to play basketball as a sophomore, Peggy Carlson put him through shooting drills.""When I first moved in with them, I was very shy,"" Konate said. ""I would just go to my room and not come out. They were the ones who got me to start talking and joking and enjoying it here. They became my second family.""Still, he was consumed with his first family. In Mali, Konate's mother was found to have breast cancer. His father was killed by rebels in an ambush on a bus.Konate said his father was an aid worker trying to bring food to the Mali army in 2001. At some point during the bus ride, his father asked to sit next to a window so he could smoke a cigarette. He was sitting next to that window when a bullet tore through his neck.Whenever Konate thought about his mother and father, he felt as though he were getting kicked in the stomach, over and over again. Before his junior year of high school, doctors concluded that he was the one doing the kicking. Konate had bleeding stomach ulcers, partly because of stress, and he was ordered to sit out another season.Although Konate did not develop many post moves on the sideline, he learned enough English to enroll at Worcester Academy, where the team regularly contended for championships, and the players were often rewarded with college scholarships. The first time Konate was sent into a game at Worcester, he ran directly onto the court, too excited to check in at the scorer's table.Mo Cassara was Konate's coach at Worcester, and he also drove him home after late practices. Every time they drove together, Konate was sure he knew the way, and every time, they would get lost. ""We couldn't tell the difference between one highway and another, between one back road and another,"" Cassara said. ""It was a 45-minute ride that always turned into a two-hour adventure.""Anybody who meets Konate cannot help but be patient with him. On Jan. 26, in the final minutes of a blowout victory over William & Mary, Konate sank a fadeaway jump shot that was meaningless only to those unfamiliar with his struggle. The crowd at George Mason's Patriot Center celebrated Konate's first basket as if it were a berth in the Final Four. Teammates rode on his back. Fans chanted his name. Even the coaches jumped up and down.""You should have seen it,"" said Tim Burns, a George Mason guard who went to Worcester Academy with Konate. ""It was one of the highlights of our season.""This from a team that has supplied highlights like few others in college basketball history. When George Mason received its bid to the N.C.A.A. tournament, Konate sent copies of the newspaper home to Mali. And when the Patriots cut down the nets Sunday in Washington, Konate, a junior, waved a piece of the twine to his older brother in the stands.Away from the excitement of the tournament, Konate has not seen his mother in two years. When he thinks about her, he sometimes feels the kicking again in his stomach.He talks about returning to Mali, not as a superstar, but as a community servant. He wants to get back on the bus that his father once rode, and deliver the food that his father could not.""I only wish my dad were here to see me right now,"" Konate said. ""He's my idol. I just want to fill his footsteps and get the same job he did. I want to be an aid worker.""Friends back home think Konate is a professional basketball star making millions of dollars right now. They do not realize that he is only the last player off the bench for a college team that was practically unknown two weeks ago. They do not understand the difference between the Final Four and the N.B.A.For Konate, and for the Carlsons, the road here was long and trying. The family drove Friday from Shirley to Boston, flew to Philadelphia, was set to catch a connection to Dayton, Ohio, and then drive 100 miles west to Indianapolis.They are going to sit in the family section at the R.C.A. Dome on Saturday night. They are going to wear T-shirts emblazoned with Konate's photograph. And they are going to cheer whether he gets off the bench or not.'"

"'06-04-02,'0','NEW ORLEANS, April 1 (AP) — Hundreds of protesters led by the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton rallied Saturday, demanding that all displaced New Orleans residents be allowed to vote in the April 22 municipal election.Critics of the voting system — proposed for the election for mayor and other city positions — say it makes it difficult for displaced voters to participate.""We want the Voting Rights Act,"" Mr. Jackson said at a news conference before the rally. Black leaders have argued that city elections, should they proceed, could violate the act.Mr. Sharpton said the election rules could have a national effect. ""What happens in New Orleans will affect voting rights all over the United States,"" he said.Mr. Jackson and others are demanding satellite polling places for displaced voters in cities beyond New Orleans and even outside Louisiana. Fewer than half the city's 460,000 residents have returned since Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans on Aug. 29. Demonstrators also urged the release of updated lists of displaced-voter addresses, a request the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied, saying it would breach privacy.'"
"'06-04-02,'0','In the end, her captors freed her for no clear reason, dropping her off on Thursday on a street not far from where she was taken. They also posted a videotape of her praising the Iraqi insurgency and condemning the American presence, adding that she felt ""guilty"" about being released when Iraqis were still suffering.She arrived in Germany yesterday morning on her way back to the United States.In her first comments about that tape, in a statement released yesterday by the newspaper she has written for, The Christian Science Monitor, she said had been coerced.""During my last night of captivity, my captors forced me to participate in a propaganda video"" to secure her release, the statement said. ""I was living in a threatening environment, under their control, and I wanted to go home alive. So I agreed.""She said that her comments on the tape were not her own views, and that her kidnappers had threatened her many times. She called them ""criminals, at best.""Through her captivity, Ms. Carroll struck a chord in the Arab world as well as in the West, perhaps in part because of her passionate attachment to Iraq and its people. Conservative Islamist politicians in Iraq issued emotional pleas for her release, as did some of the most militant anti-American groups in the Middle East, like Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. Her earnest face — usually framed by a traditional Muslim head scarf — became familiar on television screens across the globe.In her statement, she said she was ""humbled"" by so much sympathy and support.And finally, she asked for privacy. ""This has been a taxing 12 weeks for me and for my family,"" the statement said. ""Please allow us some quiet time alone, together.""Even after her release, there were signs that her captors retained some power over her. She was initially reluctant to go to the Green Zone, where the American Embassy is based, because her kidnappers had told her it was ""infiltrated by the mujahedeen"" and that she might be killed if she cooperated with Americans, The Monitor reported.Ms. Carroll has yet to say much about her ordeal beyond the bare facts. She was kept in a small room where she was well fed but cut off almost completely from the sounds and sights of everyday life, she told The Monitor. The room had a window that was obscured, and most of the time she sat in silence. She was allowed to watch television and read a newspaper only once.""If I had to take a shower I walked, you know, two feet, to the next door to take a shower or go to the bathroom and come back,"" she said. She had occasional contact with Iraqi women and children in the house, and found that comforting.The reasons for her capture and her release remain mysteries. The little-known group that was holding her, the Revenge Brigade, said the American government had agreed to some of its conditions. But American officials said emphatically that they had ""not entered into any arrangements with anyone"" to free her. The Monitor also said it had not had any negotiations with her kidnappers.Some of Ms. Carroll's friends said they suspected that her love for Iraq helped her survive through the months of fear and isolation, and may have helped win her release.""I think she had to bank on the fact that she could connect in some way with her captors,"" said Jackie Spinner, a reporter for The Washington Post who was based in Baghdad until recently, and who has been a friend of Ms. Carroll. ""Unlike most Western journalists, she spoke good Arabic. And if you look at her work, she comes across as compassionate, as balanced.""Ms. Carroll went to Iraq in 2003 after spending a few months learning Arabic in Jordan. A freelancer, she belonged to a small and daring group of reporters who work without the protections afforded by big news organizations.Writing about her experience last year in The American Journalism Review, she made clear that she understood the risks and relished the adventure. She even said she believed her low-budget, low-profile status made her safer.""All I ever wanted to be was a foreign correspondent, so when I was laid off from my reporting assistant job at The Wall Street Journal in August 2002, it seemed the right time to make it happen,"" she wrote of her decision to try to cover the war in Iraq.Ms. Carroll was close to Marla Ruzicka, a young American aid worker who was killed in a suicide bombing in Baghdad in April 2005. She helped organize a memorial service for Ms. Ruzicka days afterward, collecting a vivid collage of impressions from other reporters and reading them aloud at the service.Afterward, Ms. Carroll took a long vacation in Bali, to try to overcome her grief and exhaustion. She had always sought solace in the water, swimming regularly in the pool at the Hamra Hotel compound in Baghdad, and organizing raucous water polo games. In Bali, she tried to learn to surf.She did not shy away from risky assignments after she returned to Iraq. In November, she traveled by car to Najaf to report on tensions within Iraq's Shiite community, a dangerous journey that few reporters were willing to undertake at that time.Her kidnapping, on Jan. 7, electrified the dwindling Baghdad press corps. American reporters had been abducted before, but the circumstances in Ms. Carroll's case were especially worrying. She was taken in western Baghdad, an area rife with Sunni Arab insurgents, and her translator, Allan Enwiyah, was shot and killed.After fevered talks among reporters — mostly people who knew her well — a decision was made to not report the kidnapping immediately, in the hope that without publicity, her captors would release her quickly.But within a few days, the reporters, and The Monitor, decided that there was nothing to be gained in hiding the story. Her family and The Monitor also began working with American officials in Baghdad in a long, tortuous effort to secure her release.Over the following weeks, various people approached the family or The Monitor claiming they could help, including some who demanded large ransoms, The Monitor reported. None of the trails led anywhere.Meanwhile, an unusual campaign began in Iraq, in which several Iraqi newspapers and television stations editorialized for her freedom. Some donated public-service announcements designed by The Monitor asking for her release.Ms. Carroll's friends in Baghdad never gave up hope. They often thought of a word she had coined, ""feeh"" (pronounced ""fee,"" apparently derived purely from her imagination), which she used when saying goodbye to friends, Ms. Spinner said.""It was a kind of code word, meaning love and respect,"" Ms. Spinner said. ""But it also meant, 'I'm going to see you again.' ""'"
"'06-04-02,'0','In the competitive game of contemporary art, Turin, Italy, is going for the gold. Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo is one of the foremost reasons that this noble city may catch the ring. In the last few years, this dynamic lady with a tripping aria of a name has emerged as Turin's leading champion of work by younger artists.Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, a foundation established 11 years ago, rivals Castello di Rivoli as Turin's most eagerly watched venue of contemporary art. Now housed in a warehouselike structure designed by Claudio Silvestrin, the foundation's Center for Contemporary Art and Culture occupies a site formerly owned by the wheelmaker Fergat, one of the many auto companies that built this town. Fiat, the pillar, has fallen into economic and aesthetic decline. And no one is counting on art museums and cultural tourism to make up for the loss of manufacturing jobs. Still, like other aging industrial cities, Turin is seeking a new civic identity for a postindustrial future. Contemporary art is one of the paths the search has taken.The Fondazione is a disarmingly friendly place. Don't go there looking for aesthetic enigmas. Instead, a cadre of assertive young docents is on hand to strike up conversations with visitors about the art on view. This engaged approach originated with Sandretto Re Rebaudengo's personal experience as a young collector. She discovered her calling not just by looking but also by talking, when she began to visit studios and initiate dialogues with artists whose work caught her eye at galleries. Words can limit the effects of art, but conversations with artists often help people with their ideas. And the circulation of language is the lifeblood of contemporaneity. It is the means by which viewers transform an artist's vision into a technique for describing the world.At Sandretto Re Rebaudengo's home, the world begins with a huge round of cheese. Bel Paese, to be precise. The entrance hall to her house, a Liberty-inspired palazzo, is carpeted with an immense wool rendition of the familiar Bel Paese label, a 1995 work by Maurizio Cattelan. This is not a house where little canapés will be served. It is a theatrical setting, with high ceilings and tall windows, made for grand entrances and gestures garnished with wit. Even the collector's bed has been envisioned as a proscenium stage. And it's a house that brings to the surface Turin's heritage as a metropolis where Surrealism stirred into being almost a century ago.That de Chirico spirit is less evident in the individual artworks than in the placement that Sandretto Re Rebaudengo has given them in her domestic order. Shown in a gallery, Allan McCollum's ""480 Plaster Surrogates"" might not strike you as Surrealist. Displayed on the walls of a dining room, however, the work hits an uncanny note. The framed miniature black rectangles read less as art than as signs of absent intimacy, erased or uninscribed scenes of family life.'"

"'06-04-02,'0','So there was mlb.com, dancing the broadband cha-cha with the Cinderellas and the top-seeded teams while bonding with millions of hoops crazies, some of whom might be converted to baseball fans.On March 16, the first day of the tournament, mlb.com transmitted 16 games. It also carried the Cuba-United States game at the World Baseball Classic and four spring-training games, as well as college wrestling, baseball and volleyball for CSTV's Web site. In all, 1.3 million users made 5 million visits to the March Madness On Demand site, snapping up 15 million video streams.Bowman was certain that mlb.com could carry March Madness. So was CBS, which had used other companies in past years to handle online video for the tournament.""In terms of confidence that a vendor can pull it off, with multiple events at the same time, there were only a few who can do it,"" said Joe Ferreira, the executive producer of cbs.sportsline.com.Baseball's decision to stream games -- nearly 3,000 in spring training and the regular season -- was matched recently by the National Basketball Association's decision in January to let subscribers who pay for the ""League Pass"" cable package also view the games on nba.com if they have access to broadband Internet connections.The National Football League's web site, nfl.com, does not carry games.Jon Gibs, director of media analytics for Nielsen Net/Ratings, which tracks Internet usage, said mlb.com had taken ""a different perspective on the market than other major sports sites, which focus on providing unique Web news content."" He added, ""Baseball knows what it does well, which is to show games.""There was a time a few years ago when streaming video of games was not a definite feature for mlb.com.""We heard in 2002 that there was no market for it,"" Bowman said during an interview at the company's capacious offices at the Chelsea Market in Manhattan, where Nabisco once baked Oreo cookies. ""We kept finding that no one could handle the sheer weight of baseball.""But mlb.com, having built its own broadband thoroughfare, streamed a few games in late 2002. Nearly all of the games followed in 2003. A full schedule was added in 2004 to complement the site's news and statistics, and the sale of merchandise, game-used items and tickets.Now, live video streaming is mlb.com's fastest-growing source of revenue. The bulk of its estimated $60 million in subscription revenue last year came from streaming video of games (which cost $79.95 a season) and audio packages ($14.95 a year), with the rest from fantasy leagues and other products.Another $110 million in revenue flowed from merchandise and ticket sales; about one-quarter of all tickets sold last year were bought on the site. Another $30 million comes from advertising and sponsorships. All of the financial figures were provided by the company.The company received an unexpected bonus last month with the success of the World Baseball Classic: 40,000 fans paid $9.95 to watch the games, not all of which were on English-language television.Bowman said the company's broadband artery would soon be capable of handling far more concurrent video feeds (to 5 million from the maximum of 268,000 for March Madness). The Web site has become a platform to attract a variety of customers who then agree to profit-sharing deals with baseball's company.In addition to CBS, mlb.com's client list includes the baseball players union and all minor league teams; Major League Soccer; the Web sites for Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter; the YES Network; the World Championship Sports Network, which carries track and field, cycling and skiing; and the musical performers LL Cool J, Scott Stapp and Train, who have performed live in mlb.com's studio.The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum's site will soon be run by mlb.com.""Better content helps our business,"" Bowman said. ""If people watch March Madness, they'll watch baseball. They know we're out there.""Two years ago, the company contemplated, but declined, to sell a piece of itself to the public.""One of the reasons for an initial public offering was to raise money to expand,"" Bowman said. ""But we don't need it. We can do it through internally generated cash or borrowings.""Bowman, a former president of ITT, added: ""Baseball is uniquely situated for the Internet. It's live, local, every day, with endings Hollywood can't write. I thought there'd be huge growth, so I'm not surprised by what has happened.""This season, teams will receive their first financial dividend from mlb.com. Selig said the decision to reward the clubs, who invested $60 million in the company, was subjective. In the past, he said, ""we wanted to plow all the money back into the company."" He added, ""Now, we've done so well.""More coverage is available online.Slide shows with Tyler Kepner, who covers the Yankees, and Ben Shpigel, who covers the Mets, previewing each team for the season.An interactive chart of Barry Bonds and his pursuit of the career home run record that includes a comparison of Bonds, Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron.Player and team statistics from the 2005 season, as well as team-by-team schedules for the season.'"
"'06-04-02,'0','Ms. Melgarejo, who carried an American flag, also weighed in on the presence of foreign flags at yesterday's march and at others across the country, something that critics have seized upon as a symbol of recent immigrants' unwillingness to fully embrace their adopted country.""That is not the message we want to send,"" she said. ""I feel that they should take the biggest American flag they can find and wave it in the air.""The crowd of thousands, mostly Hispanic, gathered near Brooklyn Borough Hall, by midmorning. Over the next three hours, they crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, spanning neighborhoods that were home to successive waves of European and Asian immigrants, and took in views of the Statue of Liberty. By noon, the bridge was jammed. Those who came across spilled onto Centre Street and massed in Foley Square, where immigration advocates, members of the clergy and elected officials mounted a small stage to speak to the crowd. By 2:00 p.m., the square and the surrounding streets were packed with people.United States Representative Nydia Velázquez, Democrat of New York, came on stage chanting, ""Sí, se puede!,"" the old farm workers' cry meaning ""Yes, we can!"" She took aim at the Republican Party's stance on immigration issues. ""We should not be in the business of criminalizing undocumented immigrants.""Thomas Suozzi, the Nassau County executive and a candidate for governor, tried out his own Spanish skills in front of the crowd.""My father was born in Italy and came to the United States as a young boy to live the American dream like all the people here today are,"" he said. ""So I say, justicia para todos. Justice for all.""Adolfo Carrión Jr., the Bronx borough president, also spoke, as did Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York and State Senator Rubén Díaz Sr., a Puerto Rican native and another of the key organizers of the march.In Newark, about 300 students, union members and immigration activists marched to a church yard near City Hall for an hourlong training rally.Marching from Essex County College, the crowd chanted, ""No justice, no peace,"" and ""Immigrants united will never be divided,"" cries that were echoed a few miles away in Lower Manhattan.Many at the Brooklyn Bridge protest appeared acutely aware of the details of different immigration legislation being debated in Washington, and some made clear that they regarded certain proposals as direct assaults on them.""They want to make it illegal to support immigrants,"" said Hector Marrero, 27, referring to legislation approved by the House of Representatives that critics say would criminalize any aid offered to illegal immigrants.Mr. Marrero, who was born in Puerto Rico, also criticized the bill's defenders for saying it was intended to bolster homeland security. ""How many Latinos have committed terrorist acts?"" he asked.Near the middle of the bridge, an elderly man did a brisk business in small American flags, $2 each. Asked how many he had sold, the man replied that he could not answer.'"

"'06-04-02,'0','""We've seen this movie before,"" Mr. Schweitzer said, noting that two decades ago, many investors believed -- incorrectly -- that the Japanese stock market was the place to be if they wanted to make real money. Of course, soon after conventional wisdom said that they had to have a substantial stake in Japan, the Nikkei 225 index of Japanese stocks fell into a steep bear market from which it still has not fully recovered.So how much foreign exposure should a buy-and-hold investor have? How much is too much?New research by S.& P. would seem to indicate that keeping around 25 percent of your equity exposure in foreign securities would be optimal.Having some foreign exposure clearly helps diversify a portfolio. From 1970 to 2005, a portfolio invested entirely in domestic stocks had a standard deviation -- a popular measure of volatility -- of 16.8 percent, according to S.& P. By comparison, a portfolio that was 75 percent invested in domestic stocks and 25 percent in foreign shares had a standard deviation of 16.4 percent, implying a slightly less bumpy ride.But beyond a 25 percent international allocation, the more foreign stock you own, the more volatile your portfolio becomes -- without generating much in additional returns.Over the last 35 years, for example, a stock portfolio with 25 percent foreign exposure gained 11.4 percent a year, annualized, according to S.& P. That is based on the performance of the S.& P. 500 index of blue-chip stocks and the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index of foreign shares.During the same period, a 50 percent foreign portfolio returned only a hair more -- 11.5 percent a year. And a 100 percent foreign stock strategy returned slightly less -- 11.2 percent. ""I was amazed at how tightly packed the returns were,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P.Of course, an all-foreign stock portfolio had a standard deviation of 21.8 percent, making it by far the most volatile mix.Jeff Mortimer, head of equity portfolio management at Charles Schwab Investment Management, said researchers at Schwab had done their own analysis and had come to a similar conclusion. Conservative investors with 40 percent in stocks and 60 percent in bonds should probably have around 10 percent of their total portfolio in foreign equities, Mr. Mortimer said. More aggressive investors, with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds, should keep around 20 percent of their money in overseas shares.Of course, investors may sometimes choose to slightly overweight or underweight foreign stocks, as opportunities arise. John Thompson Jr., portfolio manager at Ibbotson Associates in Chicago, says he thinks that an aggressive investor should feel comfortable putting as much as 30 percent of total equity exposure overseas.But it's also important, Mr. Thompson said, not to deviate too much from your long-term asset allocation strategy.That is especially true if you plan to hold emerging-market shares. Investors should probably keep their emerging-market exposure from growing beyond 5 percent of their total portfolio, he said. After all, the whole point of having a long-term asset allocation strategy is to reduce your portfolio's risk.Moreover, given the recent outperformance by foreign stock markets, there is always the risk of being whipsawed if they begin to lose ground to domestic equities.To be sure, not all investors are going overboard. Many Americans, in fact, still have a home-country bias. Only around 10 percent of the equity allocation of a typical 401(k) investor is invested in foreign holdings, according to Hewitt Associates, the employee benefit research firm. But that's more than double the exposure that 401(k) investors had to foreign shares in January 1999.And this could shoot even higher if the same euphoria that swept up technology investors in the 1990's keeps driving domestic investors to foreign equities.So far this year, about 70 cents of every new dollar invested in equity funds has been directed to internationally oriented portfolios, according to the mutual fund tracker AMG Data Services. And emerging-market stock funds -- by far the hottest foreign category -- have pulled in more new money in the first three months of 2006 than they did in all of 2003, 2004 and 2005 combined.Kevin M. Cronin, head of investments at Putnam Investments in Boston, says the foreign markets continue to look attractive. But he noted that opportunities abroad -- especially in the emerging markets -- come with clear-cut risks.""The history of the emerging markets,"" he said, ""is littered with sociopolitical and economic problems.""The average emerging-market fund is up 22.7 percent a year, on average, for the past five years. Yet it is important to remember that these funds also managed to lose money in two of those five years -- just as they lost money in seven of the past 12 years.This history suggests that while you may want to own some foreign shares, you may be advised to keep your holdings in moderation.FUNDAMENTALLY Paul J.

"'06-04-02,'0','The name of 11th Street Linen, on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, only begins to do the place justice. In addition to linens, the products on display on the sidewalk outside the store on a recent morning included cases of dishwashing liquid, rows of suitcases, boxes of paper towels and racks of 69-cent shirts, the selection promoted by iridescent orange, red and green signs flagging the low prices.The shirts, in a motley assortment that draws a steady stream of browsers, are actually on display around the corner from the Fifth Avenue storefront, steps from the tiny European-style Café Regular and a tasteful block of brick row houses on 11th Street. The value of these houses has been rising steadily, and, not coincidentally, their owners take a jaundiced view of the store's high-visibility, low-price wares. The most recent encroachment by the merchandise onto the sidewalk, they say, began in February.Although there are other discount stores offering similarly displayed goods along Fifth Avenue, 11th Street Linen is one of the largest. Millie Caputo, a lifelong resident who has watched Fifth Avenue become safer and more prosperous in recent years, has complained to the city about the stores -- 11th Street Linen in particular -- and circulated a letter imploring neighbors to do the same.""We have all the improvements that are going on,"" she said. ""Then you get these disgusting stores that open up and cheapen the area, and they couldn't care less.""Kathy Dawkins, a spokeswoman for the Department of Sanitation, said that five complaints about the store reached her office in the past few weeks. Four of them, alleging an obstructed sidewalk, led someone from the department to visit the store and explain the law: sidewalk displays must be within three feet of the building, and no taller than five feet. Another complaint, about streamers hanging from lampposts and telephone poles, led to a summons.The store's owner, Nahla Abudayeh of Brooklyn, did not respond to two telephone messages and two visits to the store seeking comment. On Wednesday, a man working the register and sales floor seemed unfazed by the complaints. ""I never heard about it,"" said the man, who would not give his name.Anne Zavelo, Café Regular's owner, understands neighbors' unhappiness.

"'06-04-02,'0','Finally, in the spring of 2004, Deanna's psychiatrist at the hospital, Dr. Gebrehiwot Abraham, received a fax from a University of Toronto research team asking if he had an appropriate candidate for a clinical trial of a new, experimental surgery for treatment-resistant depression. The operation borrowed a procedure called deep brain stimulation, or D.B.S., which is used to treat Parkinson's. It involves planting electrodes in a region near the center of the brain called Area 25 and sending in a steady stream of low voltage from a pacemaker in the chest. One of the study's leaders, Dr. Helen Mayberg, a neurologist, had detected in depressed patients what she suspected was a crucial dysfunction in Area 25's activity. She hypothesized that the electrodes might modulate the area and ease the depression.The procedure, Dr. Abraham told Deanna and Gary, had worked safely in thousands of Parkinson's patients. But it would carry some risk of neural complications (it was, after all, brain surgery), it would be uncomfortable and it might not work.""We were in tears,"" said Deanna, who is now 41. ""We felt we'd tried everything and nothing worked. But we talked about it and decided, 'Well, what have we got to lose?""'What she hoped to lose, of course, was her depression. But depression, which 5 to 10 percent of Americans suffer in any given year and about 15 percent will suffer in their lifetimes, can be hard to lose. Drugs, as shown in a comprehensive study released last month by the National Institute of Mental Health, are effective in only half of patients with major depression. Psychotherapy does no better. For those people who are not helped by therapy or drugs, electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, can bring relief. But few of those cures are complete. These therapies usually ease rather than cure depression while sometimes bringing side effects like insomnia or memory loss, and their potency often proves fleeting; as many as half to two-thirds of those successfully treated relapse within two years. Neither neuroscientists nor psychiatrists can say exactly what depression is. Neurologically and psychologically, what Hippocrates called the ""black bile"" and Susan Sontag ""melancholy minus its charms"" presents an almost impossibly complicated puzzle.The expectations for the Toronto team's D.B.S. study were accordingly modest. When I later asked Mayberg's collaborator Dr. Andres Lozano, the neurosurgeon who performed the operations, what he had expected, he replied, ""Nothing.""As it turned out, 8 of the 12 patients he operated on, including Deanna, felt their depressions lift while suffering minimal side effects -- an incredible rate of effectiveness in patients so immovably depressed. Nor did they just vaguely recover. Their scores on the Hamilton depression scale, a standard used to measure the severity of depression, fell from the soul-deadening high 20's to the single digits -- essentially normal. They've re-engaged their families, resumed jobs and friendships, started businesses, taken up hobbies old and new, replanted dying gardens. They've regained the resilience that distinguishes the healthy from the depressed.These results brought a marvelous surprise to both the patients and the doctors involved -- and nervous anticipation about whether their luck will hold. Though a few of the patients are more than two years out from the surgery, none completely trust their cure. No one can tell them for sure that it will last, and they worry. The study doctors and the wider medical community, meanwhile, are guarded about whether D.B.S. will prove so effective in larger trials. ""I can't emphasize enough that we need a large, randomized study to confirm this as a treatment,"" says Valerie Voon, a University of Toronto psychiatrist who was with the team for the first six patients and who is now a research fellow at the National Institutes of Health.Those caveats notwithstanding, many scientists following the trial say they believe it will change how psychiatrists define and treat mood disorders. Mayberg, who speaks of a ""paradigm shift,"" notes that she developed the trial to evaluate not a treatment but a hypothesis. In that sense the trial succeeded. Mayberg's focus on Area 25 tests the emerging ""network"" model of mood disorders, a new way of looking at psychiatric conditions that isn't restricted by the neurochemical model of mood that has dominated over the past quarter century or so. Rather, it incorporates neurochemistry into the concept of the brain as a circuit board or wiring diagram. The network model carries profound implications for research and, ultimately, treatment. The Prozac revolution showed everyone that tweaking neurochemistry can dampen and sometimes extinguish depression -- but only through a generalized approach, hitting the entire brain. (""Carpet-bombing,"" one neuroscientist calls it.) And the 50 percent success rate of antidepressant drugs suggests that they aren't hitting depression's central mechanism. The network approach, on the other hand, focuses on specific nodes, pathways and gateways that might be approached with various treatments -- electrical, surgical or pharmacological. This small trial appears to confirm this model so emphatically that it's already changing the neuropsychiatric view of the brain and the direction of research.""People often ask me about the significance of small first studies like this,"" says Dr. Thomas Insel, who as director of the National Institute of Mental Health enjoys an unparalleled view of the discipline. ""I usually tell them: 'Don't bother. We don't know enough.' But this is different. Here we know enough to say this is something significant. I really do believe this is the beginning of a new way of understanding depression.""When she started her research in the late 1980's, Helen Mayberg, too, looked at neurochemistry. ""That's where biological psychiatry was then,"" she told me. ""It was about the brain as a bowl of soup. You whip up a chemical, add it and stir. An alchemist point of view. But I soon realized I wanted to find out where things were changing.""Lively, smart and quick-witted, Mayberg talks of brain science with contagious excitement. She possesses just the kind of presence someone having a hole drilled in his head would welcome -- authoritative but warm. Mayberg originally considered becoming a psychiatrist, but she didn't like the discipline's resistance at the time (it was the 1970's) to neurological explanations of mood. So she became a behavioral neurologist, doing a residency at Columbia University and then moving to Johns Hopkins.Setting aside the bowl-of-soup model did not mean deciding that neurochemicals weren't important. Rather it meant deciding that neurochemistry, and particularly the chemistry dictating how individual neurons communicate with one another, was probably driven by traffic between different brain areas, and that identifying the patterns in that traffic might yield new understanding. (Or, using another metaphor, if the brain is an orchestra, then the neurochemical approach focuses on how well individual players listen and respond to the players adjacent to them; the network approach, like a conductor, focuses on how the orchestra's sections -- strings, winds, brass, etc. -- coordinate and balance volume and tone. When both are working well, you've got music.)Imaging tools for tracking these relationships, like PET scans and later functional magnetic resonance imagery, were just maturing as Mayberg pursued her work. Neuroscientists were soon using these tools to help identify networks involved in mental processes ranging from distinguishing facial expressions to experiencing alarm or pleasure. Each of these networks engages different brain areas in different combinations. The areas active in recognizing a fearful expression, for instance, won't match those for recalling old memories, though some areas might overlap. Defining the network involved in any given process requires figuring out not just which parts are involved but also which parts are most vital and how one affects another.By the 1990's, Mayberg was trying to define the network that goes awry in depression. She and other researchers soon established that depression involved abnormal patterns of activity in a network that includes limbic areas (a cluster of evolutionarily older brain areas around the top of the brain stem), which control basic emotions and drives like fear, lust and hunger, and the newer cortex and subcortex responsible for thought, memory, motivation and reward.Several researchers were working on this. But Mayberg, and, separately, Dr. Wayne Drevets, then at Washington University and now at the N.I.M.H., increasingly homed in on Area 25, which seemed crucial in both its behavior and its position in this network. They found that Area 25 was smaller in most depressed patients; that it lighted up in every form of depression and also in nondepressed people who intentionally pondered sad things; that it dimmed when depression was successfully treated; and that it was heavily wired to brain areas modulating fear, learning, memory, sleep, libido, motivation, reward and other functions that went fritzy in the depressed. It seemed to be a sort of junction box, in short, whose malfunction might be ""necessary and sufficient,"" as Mayberg put it, to turn the world dim. Maybe it could provide a switch that would brighten the dark.To work the switch, Mayberg needed a knife. In 1999 she moved from the University of Texas at San Antonio to the University of Toronto, where she met Lozano, who had become expert at using deep brain stimulation for treating Parkinson's, the neurological affliction that causes tremors and rigidity as well as cognitive and emotional declines. By the time he and Mayberg met, he'd slipped electrodes into the brains of almost 300 patients.Depression is more elusive than Parkinson's. But approaching Area 25 with D.B.S. allowed the researchers to use a known tool. Neurosurgeons found as early as the 1950's that they could treat Parkinson's by destroying a small portion of the hyperactive globus pallidus, a brain area that is crucial to movement. The treatment illustrated one of the brain's many oddities: some areas can cause more trouble when they are excessively active than when they have no activity at all. In the early 1990's, surgeons increasingly began to use D.B.S. to quiet the globus pallidus by sending it steady, rapid pulses of low voltage. Patients' tremors would instantly ease or cease; their rigidity and uncontrollable body movements would fade over a week or two. Killing the current revived the symptoms. Surgeons have now implanted D.B.S. electrodes in some 30,000 Parkinson's patients worldwide. The procedure is not a cure-all. It helps some patients less than others, does little to alleviate Parkinson's cognitive and emotional decay and occasionally creates complications including infection, bleeding and memory loss. Its biggest problem may be its success. So many medical centers now do it that some do it badly or on poorly qualified patients. But done well, it usually works.Mayberg knew all this from the literature and learned more in conversations with Lozano. She grew increasingly convinced that applying D.B.S. to Area 25 might control depression.""So one day,"" she told me, ""I went to Lozano and said: 'I want to turn off Area 25. Can we put a stimulator there and see if that does it?' And he goes, 'Why not?' ""Occasionally, Deanna felt good enough to go home. This feeling seldom lasted more than a few days. ""You could tell she was getting bad again when she couldn't sleep,"" Gary said. ""That was the red flag. She'd be around the house all night, watching TV, up worried, cleaning. Then she'd get worse each day. Her eyes got that sunken look. Those were the scariest times, when she was getting like that and I would drop the kids at school and go to work and know she was home alone.""During the bad periods, which was much of the time, Deanna thought about suicide almost constantly. Through the windows of the locked ward she could see Lake Ontario, cold and immense. While she was there, one patient managed to reach the lake, beyond the parking lot and a grove of trees, and drown himself. Deanna thought obsessively of doing the same.""I imagined that all the time,"" she said. ""That I would walk out there and walk into the lake and that would be it.""As the months and years passed and all treatments failed, it began to feel as if there were only one way out.""It started to seem like, this is not going to stop,"" Gary said. ""This is our life now. There were times I thought that it was going to end"" -- helooked across the table at Deanna -- ""only when you committed suicide.""""The worst part for me,"" Deanna said, ""was not being able to feel anything for my children. To hug them, to have them hug me, and feel nothing. That was devastating. An awful, awful place to be.""The D.B.S. operation involves an intrusion that is delicate but brutal. The patients are kept awake so they can describe any changes, and the only drug administered is a local anesthetic. The surgical team shaves much of the patient's head and attaches to the skull, with four screws drilled through skin into bone, the stereotactic frame that will hold the head steady against the operating table and serve as a navigational aid. Mounting the frame takes only about 10 minutes. But because it involves driving screws into the skull (""You can't truly feel it,"" as one patient said, ""but you can hear it and see it and smell it""), and because it leaves you with a steel frame around the head, many patients find this the most distressing part of the whole business.Gary found the frame more than he could take. He kissed his wife and went elsewhere, hoping she wouldn't be a vegetable when he next saw her. Then Deanna was rolled to an M.R.I. machine, where scans would be taken; the scans would help guide Lozano in placing the electrodes.During the hour or so while the computer processed the scans, Deanna chatted with Mayberg. The day before, she told Mayberg, on video, that what she most wanted was to hold her children and feel it.When the scans were ready, she went to the operating room. She was placed on a table, which was tilted back like a La-Z-Boy. Lozano and his team bolted the stereotactic frame to the table, as it was described to me later. There was some scrubbing on her head, some chitchat among the surgical team, much fiddling with sterile drapes and instruments. Then Lozano fit a half-inch burred bit into a drill, turned it on and started drilling. He drilled right into the top of Deanna's skull, which brought a rattling sensation and a sound like that made by an air wrench removing the lugs off a car's wheel. Then he did it again.Now Lozano threaded a guide tube -- ""It's a straight shot,"" he said later, ""really quite easy"" -- down between crevices and seams to one side of Area 25, which is in two small lobes at the midline of the brain. He slid the first electrode and its lead down the tube, then repeated this for the other side. All this took nearly two hours. After he double-checked his locations, he wired the leads to a pacemaker and gave Mayberg a nod. They could turn it on anytime now.Mayberg had squeezed into a spot at Deanna's side some time before. She had told Deanna that if anything felt different, she should say so. Mayberg wasn't going to tell her when the device was activated. ""Don't try to decide what's important,"" Mayberg told her. ""If your nose itches, I want to know."" Now and then the two would chat. But so far Deanna hadn't said much.""So we turn it on,"" Mayberg told me later, ""and all of a sudden she says to me, 'It's very strange,' she says, 'I know you've been with me in the operating room this whole time. I know you care about me. But it's not that. I don't know what you just did. But I'm looking at you, and it's like I just feel suddenly more connected to you.' ""Mayberg, stunned, signaled with her hand to the others, out of Deanna's view, to turn the stimulator off.""And they turn it off,"" Mayberg said, ""and she goes: 'God, it's just so odd. You just went away again. I guess it wasn't really anything.'""It was subtle like a brick,"" Mayberg told me. ""There's no reason for her to say that. Zero. And all through those tapes I have of her, every time she's in the clinic beforehand, she always talks about this disconnect, this closeness and sense of affiliation she misses, that was so agonizingly painful for her to lose. And there it was. It was back in an instant.""Deanna later described it in similar terms. ""It was literally like a switch being turned on that had been held down for years,"" she said. ""All of a sudden they hit the spot, and I feel so calm and so peaceful. It was overwhelming to be able to process emotion on somebody's face. I'd been numb to that for so long.""It worked that way for other patients too. For those for whom it worked, the first surges of mood and sensation were peculiar to their natures. Patient 4, for instance, was fond of taking walks, and she had previously told Mayberg that she knew she was getting ill when whole landscapes turned dim, as if ""half the pixels went dark."" Her first comment when the stimulator went on was to ask what they'd done to the lights, for everything seemed much brighter. Patient 5, an elite bicycle racer before his depression, told me that a pulling that he had long felt in his legs and gut, ""as if death were pulling me downward,"" had instantly ceased. Patient 1, who in predepression days was an avid gardener, amazed the operating room by announcing that she suddenly felt as if she were walking through a field of wildflowers. Two days after going home, she put a scarf over her shaved, stitched head, found her tools and went out to reclaim her long-neglected gardens.Not all was light and flowers. On a purely biological level, the improvement made by D.B.S. sometimes amplified the side effects of the high doses of medication the patients had been taking. Doctors don't quite understand this phenomenon, but they see it happen in other instances too; it is as if the patient, deadened, is again made sensate. Deanna broke out in hives and felt nauseated; her hands shook. These symptoms eased when she (as several of the patients have done) reduced her meds -- slowly, so as not to introduce new variables. She now takes standard doses of Effexor, an antidepressant, and Seroquel, an anti-psychotic drug.The cure also brought challenges at home. As with other disabilities, any partner turned caretaker gets used to calling the shots, and rearranging power, dependencies and expectations after a sudden recovery can prove hard. One patient, the cyclist, faced this challenge starkly, for he had started a relationship and married while he was depressed. ""Frankly,"" he told me, ""I'm not sure we've quite finished working this out."" All the patients have benefited from coordinated assistance from psychiatrists, social workers and occupational therapists who try to smooth the transition.""That help is crucial,"" says Mayberg, who is now a professor of psychiatry and neurology at Emory University in Atlanta. ""We're just fixing the circuit. The patient's life still needs work. It's like fixing a knee. They need that high-quality physical and supportive therapy afterward if they're really going to move around again.""This transition is not back to a former self and family but to a new one. Gary Benjamin says he sees similar things in military families. ""These soldiers get sent away for six months, they come back and all they want to do is return to their old home. But their old home isn't there, because everybody's changed. It takes some tough rearranging sometimes.""For a change so profound, these seem acceptable adjustments. And the treatment so far seems remarkably free of side effects. No one has suffered significant neural complications, probably because, unlike ECT, which sends 70 to 150 volts through the entire brain, these electrodes deliver only about 4 volts to an area about the size of a pea.But what will happen when larger groups are treated? The team is continuing to operate on depressed patients, with a goal of 20. And would the successes stay high and the side effects low in a large, placebo-controlled trial? Neither Mayberg nor any of the other collaborators cares to guess. Other treatments have started this well and fizzled. For instance, vagus nerve stimulation, which sends a low current to the brain via a major nerve with connections to various brain areas, appeared to help about half of the patients in a small, initial, uncontrolled trial, but failed its only placebo-controlled trial. (In a controversial move, the Food and Drug Administration overruled its own reviewers and approved the device as a depression treatment anyway.)""What if you do a hundred patients,"" I asked Mayberg one day, ""and they do no better than placebo?""""I suppose that's possible,"" she said. But she doesn't think that will be the case. The several authorities I talked to agree that the high success rate so far, along with the soundness of the theoretical base and D.B.S.'s track record with Parkinson's, suggests that this isn't just a lucky run.""This just makes so much sense,"" says Dr. Antonio Damasio, director of the University of Southern California's Brain and Creativity Institute and a renowned neurologist, ""and the weight of the results is so sizable. I would be surprised if they had no results with a larger body of patients.""On the other hand, even if it works, no one sees this becoming the new Prozac. The procedure costs too much (around $40,000) to use on anyone who hasn't tried everything else. The appropriate candidates for D.B.S. probably number in the thousands, not the millions. Perhaps the most sensible worry is that if the thing works, doctors might use it too freely, as they tend to do with successful new treatments; witness the problematic boom in D.B.S. for Parkinson's.In the end, the procedure's greatest clinical value may lie in inspiring less intrusive ways of tweaking key nodes -- localized delivery of drug or gene therapies, or other means still to come. Such possibilities probably lie at least a decade away.Regardless of how it pans out in the clinic, Mayberg and Lozano's D.B.S. study is already changing how neuroscientists and psychiatrists think about depression. One possibility, for instance, is that refining the networks that go awry in depression may reveal neurological subtypes of depression that can be diagnosed and treated differently. For example, Mayberg has already found that patients who respond well to Prozac usually show a change in their brain scans only a week after they start medication -- even though they don't feel a difference for 3 to 10 weeks (a long and sometimes dangerous wait). She's done preliminary work suggesting she might be able to identify such Prozac-friendly patients before they even start the drug. If she or others can replicate and elaborate on this diagnostic ability, doctors might be able to characterize a patient's depression and choose a best-odds therapy -- Prozac for one patient, talk therapy for a second, both for a third -- at the very beginning of treatment, savings weeks or months of trial and error.The network model -- which some scientists also call a ""systems"" model -- also offers an organizing principle for research. Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, a researcher with the N.I.M.H., points out that research on depression has so far followed clues left by drugs that were found to be effective only by chance. ""We'd find a drug that helped depression, figure out how it works and make hypotheses from that about how the brain works,"" he says. The effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (S.S.R.I.'s) like Prozac, for instance, inspired piles of research showing that mood regulation depends heavily on the availability of the neurotransmitter serotonin. (Neurotransmitters are chemicals that help carry messages across the spaces between neurons; S.S.R.I.'s treat depression by making more serotonin available in those spaces.)This focus on neurotransmitters is the ""bowl of soup"" approach that Mayberg speaks of, and it has formed the bulk of depression research for more than two decades. Defining the networks the neurotransmitters move within, however -- and in particular identifying Area 25 as a key gateway within the depression network -- will let researchers bring their neurochemical knowledge to bear on specific targets.""With this D.B.S. work,"" Meyer-Lindenberg says, ""they have characterized in detail a system"" -- or network -- ""underlying a major disorder. It's not a simplistic thing where you're saying it's all about this one area and you inject a current and everything's fine. It's a very complicated system. But this D.B.S. work shows us that amid this complicated system there is a place of overlap, a common denominator"" -- Area 25 -- ""that's a very attractive treatment target."" Here, Meyer-Lindenberg says, researchers can try to apply the knowledge they've gained about neurochemistry and genetics. The network theory presents a framework around which to apply these perspectives.Meyer-Lindenberg's own work shows the power of this approach. Last June he published a study on the serotonin transporter gene, or sert gene, which helps determine serotonin availability. Other research had shown that people with the ""short"" version of the sert gene run more depression risk. Meyer-Lindenberg found a way to identify how various brain areas were affected by having that short version. Then he took 112 patients, half with the long version and half with the short, scanned their brains and asked the computer to find areas that scanned differently in the two groups. The area showing the most difference was Area 25.Along with redirecting research, the quieting of Area 25 may also change our conception of depression from a condition in which something is lacking -- self-esteem, resilience, optimism, energy, serotonin, you name it -- to one in which an active agent makes a person sick.""Most people think of depression as a deficit state,"" Mayberg says. ""You're low, you're negative. But in fact, talk to a depressed person, and you have this bizarre combination of numbness and what William James called 'an active anguish.' 'A sort of psychical neuralgia,' he said, 'wholly unknown to healthy life.' You're numb but you hurt. You can't think, but you are in pain. Now, how does your psyche hurt? What a weird choice of words. But it's not an arbitrary choice. It's there. These people are feeling a particular, indescribable kind of pain.""This anguish, Mayberg suggests, is the manifestation of a neural circuit run amok. For doctors, establishing this should focus research and care. For those of us who've never known depression, recognizing it may help us see depression not as a dead absence but as a live affliction. We might even stop indulging the romantic notion of depression as intrinsic to one's identity. For this notion, too, was tested by Mayberg's experiment. When a steady, 4-volt thrum calmed these patients' anguish, they did not lose their identities. They regained them, feeling again the engagements with the world that most define them: flowers for the gardener, lightness for the cyclist and, for Deanna, a long-missed connection to others.When Deanna, Gary and I finally finished talking, they insisted on driving me to my hotel. Halfway through town, Gary pulled off the main road, drove up a long, sinuous driveway and parked in a lot facing a dark, rambling building.""This is the hospital,"" Gary said. ""You see where Deanna stayed.""In the winter dark, the secure ward, off to the left, was easily discerned. It was a low wing, the only one with a few lights still on inside. Outside, bright flood lamps illuminated an exercise yard ringed by 20-foot-tall cyclone fencing topped with razor wire.""And there's the lake,"" Gary said, motioning behind us. Through trees I could make out its blackness.We sat several minutes, but no one said much.""Well,"" Gary said, putting the minivan in gear. ""We'd better get home.""David Dobbs writes on science, medicine and culture. His last article for the magazine was about autopsy.'"

His fastball is as lively and hard as Roger's,"" he said, referring to Roger Clemens.""His breaking ball is as good as Doc Gooden's at his best, a 12-6 curve"" -- that is, dropping sharply as from 12 on a clock to 6 -- ""and his changeup, well, it might be as good as Greg Maddux's,"" Bell said. ""Even from an opposing manger, he was fun to watch.""Kevin Appier, a 16-year veteran whose locker was near Hernandez's, said, ""If he stays healthy, if he keeps his head on straight, Felix has a chance to become the greatest pitcher of all time.""The Mariners left-hander Jamie Moyer, in his 20th major league season, said: ""Felix handles himself on the mound like a seasoned veteran. It's as if he's been there before, like maybe in another life.""Mike Hargrove, the Mariners' manager, said that the club planned to limit Hernandez to no more than 200 innings.""And that includes spring-training games and postseason, as well as regular season,"" he said. ""It's kind of selfish on our part, but we're looking long term with Felix. We don't want to rush his progress, and we want to keep his arm as strong as possible. We'll go as deep into a pitch count as we can, but we probably won't go more than 100 pitches with him in a game this season.""But what if Hernandez is making a bid for a no-hitter? ""Which he surely will be,"" Hargrove said. ""Then, well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.""After pitching spectacularly in the minor leagues for two-plus seasons, Hernandez was called up last August from Class AAA Tacoma. While his record was a so-so 4-4 in 12 games, he earned great admiration with a 2.67 earned run average and 77 strikeouts in 841/3 innings, including an 11-strikeout game against Kansas City. He gave up only 61 hits and 23 walks.He has been compared to Gooden, who came up with the Mets in 1984 at 19. Gooden was the rookie of the year that season and the Cy Young award winner the next. Gooden, too, was hailed as the next great pitcher.But he was never as dominating after that. Drug addiction was a major factor in his decline. Just one day before Hernandez pitched so brilliantly against the Diamondbacks on March 23, Gooden, out of baseball since 2001, was in court for violating probation by using cocaine. He is scheduled to be sentenced on April 5 and faces up to five years in prison.In his first season, Gooden pitched 218 innings, and 276 2/3 the next.""I wasn't so concerned with his innings pitched,"" said Davey Johnson, then the Mets' manager, ""but in the pitch count and in the quality of his outings. I didn't want him to struggle mentally. If I felt he was beginning to, say, tire in the sixth, I'd hook him, even if the bullpen wasn't so good. I wanted him to have positive outings, so he could gain confidence.""""I can't tell you of a better young man than Doc; polite, and he was eager to get better as a pitcher,"" Johnson said. ""I was never so shocked as when he came into my office in spring training in 1987 and said, 'Skip, I've got a problem.' That's when he told me he was going away, to rehab, for two months.""Gooden had two problems, Johnson said: ""The neighborhood he found himself in, and his not being able to say no. Some of those people around him away from the ballpark would say, 'You're not one of us? Too big for us?' ""In Johnson's view, that was the beginning of Gooden's downfall.Bill Bavasi, the Mariners' general manager, said: ""I don't know much about Gooden's habits, but of course I know what's happened to him, and it's something for us to keep in mind. But what I do know about Felix is that he comes from a caring family background. His mother and father often travel with him. And it seems he has a really good head on his shoulders. And, sure, a young man has tough choices to make. And you discuss things with him. You just hope he makes the right choices.""Bavasi recalled Hernandez's first outing in the majors, in Detroit, on Aug. 4. ""I assumed he was nervous,"" Bavasi said. ""How could you not be?""In the first inning, Hernandez loaded the bases, on a single and two walks, with no one out. The Mariners' players moved forward on the bench, waiting to see how the rookie would handle this. He got out of the inning with one run scored, the only earned run he allowed in five innings.""He kept his composure,"" Bavasi said. ""Another young pitcher just might have unraveled in that first inning.""Bavasi considered the outing as a possible metaphor for Hernandez's future, in regard to staying calm and making the right decisions, on and off the field.After the recent spring outing against Arizona, Hernandez, who has blond streaks in his dark curly hair, recalled that first game, and that first inning. ""Yes, the excitement was boiling over,"" he said through an interpreter.But he said he recalled the advice from Hargrove in a game the previous spring, when he got into trouble and began to throw harder and harder.""I was told that harder wasn't necessarily better, and that batters were just sitting there looking for the fastball,"" Hernandez said. ""I had to go back to pitching, hitting the corners and mixing up my stuff.""He said he was aware of Gooden, of his ability at a young age, and also the troubles Gooden has encountered.""There's no chance of that happening to me,"" Hernandez said. ""I've received a good education from my family.""As for keeping his head amid all the high hopes, and his being called King Felix, he said: ""I don't care what they call me. I just want to go out and pitch.""Appier said with a smile: ""I call him Felix the Cat, to keep him in perspective. I know he's on a pedestal, but it's a small pedestal, easy to fall off of. He likes the joking. He's got a real boyish side.""The Mariners, trying not to overburden Hernandez with expectations, plan to initially use him as the fifth starter, with his first start coming this Friday. A case of shin splints might slightly alter that schedule.""I don't care if they put me in the bullpen,"" he said. ""I'll do whatever I can to help the team win. I know they're trying to protect me. I understand.""I'm ready for the season,"" he said evenly.And so it appears.'"

"'06-04-03,'1','California may become the first state to impose limits on the emissions of all greenhouse gases, under legislation introduced today in the State Assembly.The bill would require that emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming be reduced by 145 million tons, or 25 percent less than the current forecast, by 2020. That would bring the emissions back to the 1990 level.The gases in question are produced when fossil fuels are burned, whether in motor vehicles, power plants or other industrial facilities. Many scientists have linked the growing concentration of these gases in the atmosphere with an observed increase in surface temperatures.The bill, which was introduced by the speaker of the State Assembly, Fabian Nuñez, Democrat of Los Angeles, would also require the California Air Resources Board to set up a mandatory emissions reporting and tracking system to ensure compliance with the limits, which many of the state's business leaders have opposed.The proposed legislation could have more than a statewide impact, because California has traditionally led the nation in pollution-control efforts. Standards and rules established by the air control board have often been emulated by other states, particularly those in the Northeast.'"
"'06-04-03,'1','Neither Ms. Rice nor Mr. Straw would specify whether they had applied even tougher pressure on the Iraqi leaders. But Ms. Rice's references to the loss of lives — more than 2,300 American soldiers alone have died here since the March 2003 invasion — and the many billions of dollars spent clearly reflected the growing impatience in Washington and London for more progress.The fracturing of the Shiites became clear in the late afternoon, as a senior official in the leading Shiite party, Sheik Jalaladeen al-Sagheir, said in a telephone interview that his party was putting forward another candidate to replace Mr. Jaafari. ""I've asked Jaafari to resign from his job,"" said Sheik Sagheir, a deputy to the Shiite bloc's leader, Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim. ""The prime minister should have national consensus inside the Parliament, and he should have the support of the international body.""Any dispute between the Shiite bloc's two biggest factions — Mr. Hakim's party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, and the party led by Mr. Sadr — carries with it the possibility of armed violence. The factions are longtime rivals, have backing from Iran and operate militias with members in the Iraqi security forces. Their militias fought street battles last August throughout Baghdad and the south, even hijacking double-decker buses to storm office buildings.Nasr al-Saadi, a Sadr member of Parliament, said Sunday that Mr. Jaafari still had the backing of Mr. Sadr's faction. ""He was elected in a democratic way,"" Mr. Saadi said, referring to the fact that Mr. Jaafari won his nomination in a secret ballot among the Shiite bloc's 130 members. ""This is democracy. I haven't been informed that the Shiite alliance will change candidates.""The eruption among the Shiites could also redraw Iraq's political coalitions, if some Shiite politicians leave the bloc to side with other groups in the 275-member Parliament. That would weaken the religious Shiites, and it is one of the great fears of the most powerful Shiite cleric in Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. Since cobbling together the fragile Shiite coalition in late 2004, the ayatollah and his aides have been working hard to keep it together to ensure that the religious Shiites assume power over Iraq's minority Sunni Arab and Kurdish populations through elections.The Supreme Council's defection came a day after a senior Shiite politician, Kassim Daoud, called for Mr. Jaafari to step down. Mr. Daoud has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Mr. Jaafari, as has Vice President Adel Abdul Mahdi, a deputy in the Supreme Council. Mr. Mahdi lost to Mr. Jaafari by just one vote in February's balloting.Negotiations to form the government have been deadlocked over Mr. Jaafari's nomination. The Constitution gives the largest bloc in Parliament the right to appoint a candidate, but a two-thirds vote of the entire assembly is needed to install the government. In late February, the main Sunni Arab, Kurdish and secular blocs demanded that the Shiites withdraw Mr. Jaafari and select someone else.Last Tuesday, Mr. Hakim fired the opening salvo in his campaign to unseat Mr. Jaafari by having his aides tell reporters that the American ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, had informed Mr. Hakim that President Bush preferred another candidate. That set off a furor here, with Mr. Jaafari saying in an interview that the Americans should stop interfering. ""I accept this position because it's an Iraqi, democratic choice,"" he said.Mr. Hakim, a former exile in Iran, and Mr. Mahdi were among the dozen Iraqi leaders who met with Ms. Rice and Mr. Straw on Sunday.Others in the Shiite bloc who oppose Mr. Jaafari include the Fadhila Party, led by a fundamentalist cleric who has called for Mr. Khalilzad's resignation, and many independent politicians.Mr. Mahdi is considered the front-runner to replace Mr. Jaafari, but a compromise candidate could end up on top because of the enmity of the Sadr faction toward Mr. Mahdi and the Supreme Council. Options include Hussain al-Shahristani, a former nuclear physicist, and Ali Allawi, the finance minister and a cousin of Ahmad Chalabi, the former Pentagon favorite.Mr. Mahdi visited Washington last fall and was believed to have the backing of the Americans at the time. A rotund, bearish-looking man, he is a Western-educated proponent of free market economics, having disavowed earlier Maoist beliefs. He owns a house in the south of France, and American officials hope his exposure to the West tempers Islamist ideals honed by years in Iran.Ms. Rice and Mr. Straw flew into Baghdad in an unusual thunderstorm early on Sunday and were driven to the Green Zone in armored military vehicles. Sectarian violence and migrations have been soaring across Iraq partly because of the power vacuum, and American officials, including Ms. Rice, say a new government must be formed quickly to help stabilize the situation.""The Iraqi people are losing patience and that's showing up in polling, it's showing up, I'm told, in cartoons, it's showing up in the news coverage here,"" she said. In the evening, after the rains had ended, Ms. Rice said she had carried ""a very direct message"" to the Iraqis, and they had responded favorably.Asked whether she had indicated to Mr. Jaafari that he drop out, she said only that ""the message to all parties"" was to form a government quickly. She added that Iraq's leaders ""have to realize there is a particular urgency to this case.""Ms. Rice was last here in October, Mr. Straw in February. They made plans to spend the night — a rarity for a visiting American official, particularly since an insurgent rocket attack on Al Rashid hotel in 2003 while Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz was staying there.The decision to stay overnight was intended as something of a political statement. Last month, a senior official noted there was concern within the administration that it seemed hypocritical for top officials to assert that progress was being made in Iraq while refusing to spend more than a few hours. Visiting dignitaries also rarely leave the Green Zone.The world outside the zone is often awash in blood. The American military said Sunday that two soldiers had died from the crash on Saturday evening of an Apache attack helicopter, shot down south of Baghdad. Two other soldiers were killed Saturday in Baghdad by a roadside bomb, and a soldier died from noncombat injuries sustained in an operation on March 30 in Kirkuk.In Diyala Province, gunmen killed two civilians in Balad Ruz, and insurgents blew up a Shiite mosque northeast of Baquba. A policeman in Baghdad was killed, as was a lawyer in Basra. Six bodies were found in Baghdad, two of them abducted hospital workers; all had been shot in the head. Armed men kidnapped Waleed Subhi al-Dulaimi, the official in charge of religious tourism.'"
"'06-04-03,'1','""It's always easy to impose controls, but hard to eliminate them,"" said Juan Luis Bour, the chief economist at the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research here. ""The more successful you are in the short run, the more problems you are generating in the long term, because you are creating a disequilibrium.""Other economists, too, are warning that Mr. Kirchner, who has so far been a successful steward of Latin America's third largest economy (after Brazil and Mexico), could be sowing the seeds of a new disaster. After suffering a traumatic collapse four years ago, the government devalued the peso significantly and declared the largest debt default in history.Since then, the recovery has been remarkable. Argentina's economy has rebounded by nearly 9 percent annually over the past three years. But that growth spurt has been accompanied by a surge in inflation that worries Mr. Kirchner, who faces an election next year if he wants to serve a second four-year term.In an effort to hold the official inflation rate to 1 percent a month, Mr. Kirchner has sought to persuade producers and stores to agree to voluntary freezes on prices of hundreds of products, including sugar, flour, noodles, bread, shampoo and pencils. Because red meat accounts for more than for 4.5 percent of the consumer price index here, more than seven times its weight in the United States index, it has become the government's most visible and symbolic target.On a per capita basis, people here may be the biggest consumers of beef in the world. Each year, the average Argentine eats nearly 150 pounds of beef, more than twice as much as an average American does.Their tastes are so ingrained, in fact, that Argentines largely ignored Mr. Kirchner's original boycott call. With disposable income rising now that the economic crisis is over, they are eager to consume more and better varieties of food, with red meat at the top of the list.""I always buy beef, and I'm not going to stop now just because a politician tells me to,"" Amelia Rava, a homemaker, said outside a supermarket here Thursday. ""If I came home without beef, the family would kill me.""Besides, no sooner had Mr. Kirchner urged Argentines to switch to other types of meat than ""the price of chicken, fish and pork also started rising,"" complained Leonor Martino, another homemaker. ""So where is the benefit for me if the price of everything is going up?""Mr. Kirchner's first attempt at jawboning producers into forgoing price increases came a year ago, when oil companies here wanted to charge more for fuel and lubricants. When Shell ignored his suggestion, he ratcheted up the pressure and told Argentines they should buy ""nothing, not even a can of oil,"" from the company.Late last year came the supermarkets' turn. After Mr. Kirchner warned the owners of two leading chains to ""stop extorting us,"" they and other companies agreed to 60-day price freezes. Those expired, but have been renewed and expanded to about 300 products, with some supermarkets voluntarily adding other goods in order to win the favor of consumers.In its campaign to hold the line on prices, the government has also begun looking beyond food products. For instance, in late February, with the school year about to begin, the Finance and Education Ministries negotiated an agreement with private schools in which those institutions agreed to freeze tuition, after increases of up to 40 percent last year.Similar accords have frozen the prices of more than 200 widely used medicines, and natural gas prices have also been subjected to policies that inhibit increases. But Mr. Kirchner's campaign against meat producers and middlemen is his biggest, most audacious yet.On Thursday, he intensified his criticisms of meat producers, saying that some of them were ""scoundrels"" profiteering at the nation's expense, and he threatened to impose even harsher measures. The first protest demonstrations also broke out in the countryside last week, with ranchers and their supporters holding rallies at which they threatened to block highways and bridges.The ranchers are particularly upset at the 180-day prohibition on exports, which is aimed at increasing the domestic beef supply. They argue the decree will affect the country's credibility as a reliable exporter and lose them ground in new markets where they have become big players, like Russia.""Producers are perplexed and bewildered,"" said Fernando Sáenz Valiente, a leading beef broker at the main producers' market here. ""Some are already switching from cattle to agriculture, and planting soy or sunflowers because they can't be sure of what is going to happen.""It is not clear how long the government expects the price freezes to last. The economy minister, Felisa Miceli, told the daily Clarín last week that even though ""the tendency toward increases has been deactivated"" and stores are ""complying with the price agreements,"" the government must also ""wait for things to happen to think about the next step.""In the meantime, Mr. Kirchner's supporters here are introducing legislation to send official inspectors into stores to assure compliance with the accords. Those that are not would be subject to fines and public censure.""These are voluntary, negotiated agreements, so nobody is putting a gun to anybody's head, and the stores are still operating with a margin of profit,"" said Diego Kravetz, the bill's main author. ""But this is something that needs monitoring on a permanent basis"" and ""requires the involvement of civic and consumer groups.""'"
"'06-04-03,'1','Margaret Sanger, founder of the organization that became Planned Parenthood, drew clergy members in the early 20th century by relating the suffering of women who endured successive pregnancies that ravaged their health and sought illegal abortions in their desperation, said the Rev. Thomas R. Davis of the United Church of Christ, in his book ""Sacred Work, Planned Parenthood and Its Clergy Alliances.""In the 1930's, Jewish and mainline Protestant groups began to voice their support for birth control. In 1962, a Maryland clergy coalition successfully pressed the state to permit the disbursal of contraception. In the late 1960's, some 2,000 ministers and rabbis across the country banded together to give women information about abortion providers and to lobby for the repeal of anti-abortion laws.""The clergy could open that door because the clergy had a certain moral authority,"" said Mr. Davis, who is chairman of Planned Parenthood's clergy advisory board but whose book is not sponsored by the group. ""They balanced the moral authority of the critics.""As the scrape of silverware quieted at the breakfast, the Rev. W. Stewart MacColl told the audience how a Presbyterian church in Houston that he had led and several others had worked with Planned Parenthood to start a family planning center. Protesters visited his church. Yet his 900 parishioners drove through picket lines every week to attend services. One Sunday, he and his wife, Jane, took refreshments to the protesters out of respect for their understanding of faith, he said.Mr. MacColl said a parishioner called him the next day to comment: ""That's all very well for you to say, but you don't drive to church with a 4-year-old in the back seat of your car and have to try to explain to him when a woman holds up a picture of a dead baby and screams through the window, 'Your church believes in killing babies.' ""Mr. MacColl said of the abortion protester: ""She would, I suspect, count herself a lover of life, a lover of the unborn, a lover of God. And yet she spoke in harshness, hatred and frightened a little child.""Mr. MacColl quoted the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr: "" 'Sometimes the worst evil is done by good people who do not know that they are not good.' ""Then Mr. MacColl challenged them. ""The trouble is, I find myself reflected in that woman,"" he said. ""Because I can get trapped in self-righteousness and paint those who oppose me in dark colors they do not deserve. Is that, at times, true of you, as well?""It is not lost on Mr. Davis how the passion of the Christian right in its effort to abolish abortion and curtail access to birth control now mirrors the efforts of clergy members 40 years ago to do the opposite.""They're a religious tradition, too, and they are moved by Scripture,"" he said, although the Bible says nothing explicit about abortion. ""When we understood the suffering in these kinds of situations that women were in, we understood that for reasons of justice, we had to act. We're doing it for theological and Biblical reasons.""A perception may exist that the denominations supporting abortion rights are outnumbered and out-shouted by their more conservative brethren. But that worried Mr. Davis little, he said, for he and other like-minded clergy members were in the minority in the 1960's, too.Still, some clergy members could barely contain their outrage. ""The more we are able to cultivate the capacity in every person — women and men — to make informed ethical judgments both in ourselves and our society, the more we are coming into relationship with the transcendent, with God,"" said the Rev. Susan Thistlethwaite, president of Chicago Theological Seminary.""Human existence as a materialistic quest for power and dominance, a crass manipulation of fear and intolerance for political gain, drives us apart both from one another and from God,"" she said. ""For what does it profit you to gain the whole world and lose your soul?""'"
"'06-04-03,'1','TEHRAN, April 2 — Iran said Sunday that it had test-fired what it described as a sonar-evading underwater missile just two days after it announced that it had fired a new missile that could carry multiple warheads and evade radar systems.The new missile is among the world's fastest and can outpace an enemy warship, Gen. Ali Fadavi of the country's elite Revolutionary Guards told state television.General Fadavi said only one other country, Russia, had a missile that moved underwater as fast as the Iranian one, which he said had a speed of about 225 miles per hour. State television showed what it described as the missile being fired.""The missile carries a very powerful warhead that enables it to operate against groups of warships and big submarines,"" he said.He contended that the boats that would launch the missile were able to evade detection systems but that ""even if an enemy's warship sonar can detect the missile, no warship can escape from this missile because of its high speed.""'"

"'06-04-03,'1','Two such moves happened last week, when G.M. sold a 78 percent stake in GMAC Commercial Holding Corporation, its real estate venture, to a group of investors headed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a deal that raised $1.5 billion in cash, while GMAC Commercial Holding agreed to pay GMAC for $7.3 billion in loans once the transaction is final.Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors of Japan said it was in talks to buy some of G.M.'s shares in Isuzu, another Japanese auto company, for $340 million.The long-awaited GMAC sale will be ""a relief to investors,"" said John Casesa, a managing partner at Casesa Strategic Advisors, a New York investment firm. ""It buys some time to solve the problems at the auto company.""But he and other analysts have criticized the deal as a short-term solution that could come back to haunt the company. ""G.M. is having to throw furniture into the fireplace to keep the house warm,"" Mr. Casesa said.On Friday, G.M.'s biggest parts supplier, the Delphi Corporation, asked a bankruptcy court judge for permission to cancel its labor contracts and impose sharply lower wages on members of six unions, including its largest, the United Automobile Workers. G.M. owned Delphi until 1999 and is liable for the pension and health care benefits of workers who were at G.M. before the spinoff.G.M. estimates its liability from the Delphi bankruptcy will be anywhere from $5.5 billion to $12 billion, meaning that the GMAC sale may not be enough to cover it.Two weeks ago, G.M. said it would offer all 113,000 of its workers and 13,000 Delphi workers up to $140,000 if they would leave the company, but it has not estimated precisely what that would cost.Delphi also said last week that it expected G.M. to offer incentives of $50,000 to its U.A.W. members if they would accept a significant pay cut. Otherwise, Delphi said, it would impose wages of $12.50 an hour. If Delphi were to do so, the U.A.W. warned, it could face a strike that could shut down G.M. and lead to its own bankruptcy filing.Standard & Poor's Ratings Services placed G.M. on credit watch with negative implications last week, meaning that its debt rating could be cut even deeper into junk. The move came after G.M. disclosed that it might have trouble tapping a line of credit and might have to renegotiate its terms.Robert Schultz, an auto industry analyst at S.& P., said the sale of a stake in GMAC would have a ""neutral impact"" on G.M. While it would bolster the company's cash, Mr. Schultz said the situation at Delphi ""seems to be unfolding in a potentially fairly negative way.""The sale of GMAC would end a months-long auction for the unit. Besides Cerberus, a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had vied for it.'"
"'06-04-03,'1','""To hear about the use of dogs in this way within the United States is truly shocking,"" said Jonathan Turley, a professor of national security and constitutional law at George Washington University, who is not involved in the case. ""But Abu Ghraib didn't spring from the head of Zeus.""Mr. Turley, an expert in prison law, said in an interview on Friday that the use of the dogs to frighten detainees in the New Jersey jail underscored ""the trickle-down effect"" of the disregard for immigrants' civil rights that top government officials showed after 9/11. ""It trickled down through military intelligence, through low-level personnel and to sheriffs,"" he said. ""Suddenly people who were predisposed to the use of such harsh measures thought they had license to use them, and 9/11 gave them a great appetite.""While dozens of jails and prisons that house federal immigrant detainees use dogs, largely to search for drugs, only seven used them to control prisoners. Jail officials defended the dog patrols, which were used before 9/11 and continue for control of other inmates. Bill Maer, a spokesman for the Passaic County sheriff, Jerry Speziale, denied that the post-9/11 detainees had been mistreated and said that the dog teams are used ""strictly for security and contraband detection purposes"" and ""act in a professional manner when interacting with inmates.""But the dogs were described as part of a nightmarish form of psychological torture by the two plaintiffs, who spoke in separate telephone interviews last week -- Mr. Turkmen from Konia, Turkey, and Mr. Sachdeva from Toronto.Two or three times a week, they said, often around 3 a.m. when the detainees were fast asleep in dormitory cells housing about 50 men, the electronic doors would open and 10 to 20 officers would rush in with four to six unmuzzled, barking dogs on leashes. The dogs, mostly German shepherds, would strain to within inches of the detainees' faces, they said.""The guards would barely be able to hold the dogs back,"" said Mr. Turkmen, who could not come for his scheduled deposition because he was denied a visa by the Canadian government, without explanation. ""The day of judgment would begin for me -- that's what it would feel like.""Mr. Sachdeva said that he found himself trembling uncontrollably, and that some detainees started to cry. ""The guards who were holding the dogs used to always laugh,"" he recalled. ""There were like four or five dogs, barking, terrorizing, and the officers shouting: 'Get up! Raise your hands! Against the wall!' One time the dog was so close his tongue touched me.""It was worst, they said, for detainees who, like Mr. Turkmen, lacked English to understand the officers. Once, Mr. Sachdeva said, a Pakistani man of 51 who did not speak a word of English was beaten bloody by guards because he had stayed on his bed after twice being ordered off.. Government officials will not discuss the lawsuit, brought in 2002 by the Center for Constitutional Rights. But when the Justice Department's inspector general criticized the post-9/11 detentions of immigrants in a scathing 2003 report, John Ashcroft, then the attorney general, said he had ""no apologies"" for measures taken to protect the public.Nevertheless, after the inspector general's report, ""there were changes made and new detention standards issued nationwide,"" said Dean Boyd, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, part of Homeland Security.The report found conditions at Passaic considerably less harsh than those at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where solitary confinement was the norm and beatings of shackled detainees were caught on videotape. But it criticized Passaic for mingling immigrant detainees with felons, and it said that immigration officials had failed to properly monitor the jail and to investigate complaints of abuse.It told of a detainee with a black eye and a limp who told investigators that he had been assaulted by guards and put in an isolation cell, where guards brought a dog. He said the guards told him ""that if he did not get out of bed by the next day, they were going to 'let the dog loose.' ""The report criticized the way federal authorities swept up immigrants after 9/11 as ""indiscriminate and haphazard.""Mr. Turkmen, who has four daughters, now 7 to 19, had overstayed a tourist visa to work at a gas station in West Babylon, N.Y., when federal agents came to his apartment. Though an immigration judge agreed to let him leave voluntarily, a standard option in minor immigration violations, he was held for four months more.Two years after his return to Turkey, he said, he saw a news report about Abu Ghraib and the dogs. ""I told my children that this exact form of torture is what I experienced,"" he said through a translator. ""All my children were completely shocked.""Mr. Sachdeva, who is Hindu, had returned to the United States to complete his divorce from an American woman who owned a gas station in Port Washington, N.Y., when F.B.I agents came there looking for someone else.""At this point I have no faith in the system,"" said Mr. Sachdeva, 34, who said he was now self-employed as a metals trader because his arrest and deportation made it impossible to get a job. ""I'm glad at least I can speak what really happened.""'"

"'06-04-04,'1','California may become the first state to impose limits on the emissions of all greenhouse gases, under legislation introduced yesterday in the State Assembly.The bill requires that emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming be reduced by 145 million tons, or 25 percent less than the current forecast, by 2020. That would bring the emissions back to the 1990 level.The gases in question are produced when fossil fuels are burned, whether in motor vehicles, power plants or other industrial facilities. Many scientists have linked the growing concentration of these gases in the atmosphere to an observed increase in surface temperatures.The bill, which was introduced by the Assembly speaker, Fabian Núñez, Democrat of Los Angeles, also requires the California Air Resources Board to set up a mandatory emissions reporting and tracking system to ensure compliance with the limits, which many of the state's business leaders have opposed.The legislation could have more than a statewide impact, because California has traditionally led the nation in pollution-control efforts. Standards and rules established by the air control board have often been emulated by other states.""As California goes, so goes the rest of the world,"" said Fran Pavley, a Democratic Assembly member and a co-sponsor of the bill. ""As California leads and innovates, we believe that Congress and other states will also implement economywide clean energy standards.""'"
"'06-04-04,'1','Every month, newspapers report that tens of thousands of bottles of illicit liquor are confiscated by the police around the country. The Mehr news agency last month quoted a senior security official, Gen. Hooshang Hosseini, as saying that the amount of liquor in the country was increasing at an alarming rate.Despite the crackdown, there is no sense of an alcohol shortage. With one phone call, one can get anything from smuggled French-made wine to Russian or homemade Armenian vodka. One bootlegger delivers the goods on a scooter, wrapping bottles in black plastic bags and hiding them in a saddlebag. Allan puts them in the trunk of his car.Before the revolution, about a dozen Iranian factories produced beer, vodka and wine. The Iranian grape is so good for making spicy wine that Australian Shiraz, sometimes known as Syrah, is made from the same grape that grows in Iran's southern city of Shiraz, which gave the wine its name.In fact, the Islamic leaders are caught in a bewildering situation. Islam forbids the consumption of alcohol and the Koran explicitly calls intoxicants ""the abominations of Satan's handiwork.""But drinking and wine are integral parts of Persian culture. Mey, the word for wine, and Saki, the wine pourer, have been the central theme of Persian poetry for more than a thousand years.Most poems by Iran's popular 14th-century poet, Shamsudin Mohammad Hafiz, who was from Shiraz, revolve around wine.""A rose without the glow of a lover bears no joy,"" he wrote. ""Without wine to drink the spring brings no joy.""Wine in ancient Persia predates the birth of French wine. The earliest evidence of wine making dates from 5400 B.C., in Haji Firuz Hills, near Western Azerbaijan Province, south of where the city of Orumieh is today.""The French are in fact jealous about that because the earliest evidence in France goes back to 500 B.C.,"" said Rémy Boucharlat, a French archaeologist who works in the southern archaeological sites in Iran.After the election of Mohammad Khatami, a reformist, as president in 1997, the government allowed drugstores to freely sell pure grain alcohol, without the dangerous chemical methanol. Until then only doctors were permitted to get a limited number of bottles for medical use.Since then more than 40 factories, some of which have imported machinery from China and Europe, are competing in the market. A thin plastic bottle of 600 milliliters, known here as pocket size, has few indications of medical use, but is available in stores for under $3. The common recipe is to mix one shot of alcohol with two shots of juice, preferably pineapple.One factory, which produced beer and wine before the revolution, was producing 20,000 bottles of alcohol a day until the government forced it to add Bitrex, a substance that made the alcohol too bitter to drink. Its sales have dropped to 3,000 bottles a day. Nonetheless, the rule has not been enforced on all other producers, so pure alcohol is still widely available.One senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said the decision to permit such widespread production of alcohol was made to limit the number of deaths and casualties caused by illegal drinks. Some 19 people were killed in 2004 after drinking bad bootleg liquor. ""A lot of people had turned to drugs such as opium because they were cheaper and more accessible,"" said the official.After the fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the availability of alcohol only increased. Different kinds of liquor are now smuggled into Iran from Iraqi Kurdistan. Different flavors of Absolut are available on the black market for $21 a bottle; a bottle of Baileys costs $43.Allan, the liquor seller, said he was arrested once during the student demonstrations of 2003 on his way home from a delivery. The police thought he was among the pro-democracy protesters. He said he was put in jail for a month and beaten every day until police officers went to search his house and found his basement full of liquor.""From then on, it took me a day to get out,"" he said. ""The judge asked me if they were for my personal use and I said yes. He fined me 12 million rials,"" equal to about $1,300, ""and a month in prison,"" he said, adding that he was allowed to buy himself out of his prison term for a little more than $3 a day.Business is so good, Allan said, that he selects his customers. ""I try to avoid the alcoholics because they have no patience and they drive me crazy,"" he said, as his cellphone interrupted him every few minutes and he had to jot down long lists for delivery.The only time business is slow is during the Shiite mourning month of Muharram, Allan said. His more than 100 customers are reduced to just a few. The rest of the year he works up to 18 hours a day.""The only problem with the job is that it is hard to get married,"" he said. ""Families are reluctant to let their daughters marry someone who can get arrested any day.""'"
"'06-04-04,'1','People who frequent emergency rooms are widely assumed to be there because they lack insurance, the implication being that their complaints are too minor to take up the E.R.'s valuable time.A new study argues that this is largely a myth. In Annals of Emergency Medicine, researchers say they have found that most patients who make frequent emergency room visits are insured and have a regular source of health care.But the researchers argue that, given the variety of serious illnesses that these generally low-income patients often suffer, it is not inappropriate for them to seek emergency room treatment.""In many cases, the emergency department is exactly the right place for them to be,"" said one of the authors, Dr. Ellen J. Weber of the University of California, San Francisco.The researchers, led by Kelly A. Hunt of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, based their findings on a national survey that asked almost 60,000 adults about their emergency room use. The researchers defined a frequent patient as one who made four or more visits a year.The issues of who goes to the emergency room and why have grown in importance as pressures on E.R. doctors have increased. From 1993 to 2003, the study said, emergency room visits went up about a quarter. In 2003, most emergency departments said they were at or over capacity at least half the time, the researchers said.'"
"'06-04-04,'1','There is a moment in ""Pepper Dennis"" that perfectly captures the absurd underbelly of television news. The reporter's phone rings at 5 a.m. with a text message directing her to a ""code red"" breaking news story — a bank robbery. The camera pans a sleek instant-espresso machine, a well-groomed hand methodically applying pink lipstick, a foot snuggling into a stiletto-heeled pump, and a row of identical expensive ballpoint pens. The reporter selects one, then sails out the door, ready for her stand-up.Unfortunately, this new WB series, starring Rebecca Romijn as an ambitious, aggressive television reporter, does not have the courage of its ""To Die For"" details. Instead of maintaining Nicole Kidman's icy, narcissistic veneer, Ms. Romijn comes off as a younger, blander Candice Bergen — Murphy Beige.And she is not very appealing in even that limited role. There are careers on television in which tall, beautiful blondes can command sympathy, but they tend to be in fields like medicine or law — professions where even gorgeous women must be judged more by their skills than by their smiles. (See ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Cold Case,"" ""Close to Home."") Television news, with its premium on good looks and poise, is the ultimate uncaring profession, which is why it works best as a sitcom setting, from ""Murphy Brown"" to ""Less Than Perfect."" Television reporters are, after all, a widely shared joke. In a 1996 movie, ""The Associate,"" Whoopi Goldberg's character needs help adopting the right look for a fancy black-tie affair. ""Sexy, yet intelligent,"" her friend muses. ""News anchor!""Ms. Romijn's hourlong show tries to combine the arch satire of ""Desperate Housewives"" with the chick-lit romance of ""Grey's Anatomy,"" and falls short of both. It's hard enough to feel warmly about an ambitious would-be news anchor. It's quite impossible to accept the statuesque Ms. Romijn as a hapless Bridget Jones-style heroine forever thwarted in love. (In Hollywood, it's a common casting mistake: Heather Graham was so laughably implausible as a spinsterish book editor on ""Emily's Reasons Why Not"" that ABC canceled the show after just one episode.)""Pepper Dennis"" begins with the same joke as the first episode of ""Grey's Anatomy"": the heroine goes home with a handsome stranger in a bar, then discovers at work the next morning that he is her colleague and immediate superior. Pepper, who is single-mindedly determined to become the next news anchor of her local Chicago station, finds out that her one-night stand is Charlie Babcock (Josh Hopkins), the new anchor. He tries to pursue their idyll anyway, but she refuses to mix work with her personal life and risk a scandal.'"

"'06-04-04,'1','Noah won the tournament's most outstanding player award. He scored 16 points, grabbed 9 rebounds and set a title-game record with 6 blocked shots. But four Gators finished in double digits, and many others could have easily laid claim to the award.Corey Brewer had 11 points and for the second consecutive game proved the defensive star. He shut down U.C.L.A.'s leading scorer, Arron Afflalo, holding him scoreless in the first half and forcing him into 3-for-10 shooting for the game.Lee Humphrey, the offensive star of Saturday's victory against George Mason, finished with 15 points. Just as on Saturday, when he made three 3-pointers in the first two minutes of the second half to blow open the George Mason game, Humphrey sparked the game's defining stretch Monday night. He hit two 3-pointers to boost Florida's 11-point halftime lead to 17. U.C.L.A. never seriously threatened again.The roll call of standouts does not end there; Adrian Moss scored 9 first-half points off the bench and point guard Taurean Green had eight assists and one turnover. ""That's been our M.O. the whole year: balanced scoring, defense and rebounding,"" Moss said. ""That's our blueprint to a championship.""The greatest night in Florida basketball history came at the expense of U.C.L.A., a second-seeded team that was aiming to add to its Division I record by winning its 12th national title. And a dark day was played under a cloud as the renowned U.C.L.A. coach John Wooden, 95, was admitted to a hospital Sunday. He watched the game there with his family. U.C.L.A. officials and Coach Ben Howland said that Wooden's illness was not serious.The Bruins looked overwhelmed at times, and Howland admitted that Florida controlled the tempo by making it a fast-paced game and not letting the Bruins play the grinding style they are accustomed to.U.C.L.A. shot just 3 for 17 from 3-point range, had 12 turnovers and just 11 assists, and never looked in sync all night. The Bruins forced just six turnovers and had 10 of their shots blocked.""They're obviously an outstanding team and they won the national championship tonight,"" Howland said. ""They play in all phases, and their defense was terrific.""From the tornado that whipped through downtown Indianapolis on Sunday night to the presence of No. 11-seeded George Mason to the absence of a No. 1 seeded team for the first time since 1980, this weekend at the Final Four has not lacked for story lines. What it has not had, however, is competitive basketball. That didn't change Monday night.U.C.L.A. played sloppy basketball in the first half and trailed Florida 36-25 at halftime. The tenor of the game made it feel as if the lead could be even bigger.Noah had already set the title game record for blocked shots with his five in the first half. U.C.L.A. had three offensive fouls in the first six minutes. It also allowed a bevy of easy shots inside, uncharacteristic of a team predicated on defense.Afflalo, did not even get a shot off in the first eight minutes. He averaged 16 points a game this year but finished with just 10 Monday night. In the first half, Afflalo missed all three of his shots from the field and made a mental blunder by not holding the ball for the final shot of the first half.""There was a lot of mistakes,"" Howland said of the first half. ""Usually, the team that makes the most mistakes is going to end up on the wrong side of the win-loss column.""The Gators forced eight turnovers and blocked seven shots in the first half. Five of those blocks came from Noah, who pestered U.C.L.A. center Ryan Hollins into shooting 2 for 7 in the first half.But the half's defining moment came from Humphrey, who hit six 3-pointers against George Mason on Saturday. He rolled off a screen on the right side and drained a 3-pointer. He also drew a foul on U.C.L.A. guard Cedric Bozeman, who threw his hands up at disbelief at the referee Tony Greene. Humphrey made the free throw to give Florida a 25-15 lead, and the Gators spent most of the rest of the half with a double-digit lead.A frustrated Bruin and a celebrating Gator became a fitting theme for the night, as the better team completed its improbable journey with the most fitting team effort.'"

"'06-04-04,'1','WASHINGTON, April 3 - A draft regulation on emissions from oil refineries, chemical plants and other industrial operations has angered regional directors of the Environmental Protection Agency, who say they were not consulted on a change that they predicted would harm the environment.Officials in 9 of the agency's 10 regional offices raised their concerns in an internal memorandum to E.P.A. officials that was dated Dec. 13 and made public Monday by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.The memorandum, written by Michael S. Bandrowski, chief of the air office in San Francisco, said he and his colleagues had ""varying degrees of concern"" about the proposal, which he characterized as a ""drastic change in interpretation"" of existing regulations under the Clean Air Act.""The proposal, as written, would be detrimental to the environment,"" said the memorandum, which the defense council posted on its Web site.The memorandum's disclosure comes two days before a Senate committee is to consider the confirmation of Bill Wehrum, President Bush's nominee to head the E.P.A.'s air office.

"'06-04-04,'1','Maybe Zito should have slept in. He entered the game with a personal five-game losing streak against the Yankees, and he pitched warily; even his third strike to Damon seemed to be off the plate.The Yankees did not score in the first inning, but they made Zito throw 23 pitches, and 14 were balls. His wildness would quickly catch up to him.In the second, he walked Matsui and Jorge Posada, making it four walks in five hitters. Bernie Williams made Zito pay with a single to left center that scored Matsui with the first run of the season.The Yankees want to play little ball when they can this season, and Robinson Cano dropped a bunt down the third-base line. Catcher Jason Kendall picked it up before it had a chance to roll foul, and he tossed to third baseman Eric Chavez, who was retreating to the bag.But Posada beat him there, and everyone was safe. Damon singled through the right side to score another run, and with the bases loaded again, Derek Jeter singled to left to make it 3-0. Gary Sheffield swung out on a checked swing, bringing Rodriguez to the plate.With Kirk Saarloos already warming in the bullpen, Zito tried a 1-1 curveball and Rodriguez belted it over the tall scoreboard in left center. It was his 12th career grand slam, and before Johnson had even given up a hit, the Yankees had given him a 7-0 lead.Frank Thomas homered in his first Oakland at-bat, leading off the second, but otherwise, Johnson was terrific. He gave up no extra-base hits aside from the homer and issued no walks.Making his 14th career start on opening day, Johnson struck out three in the first two innings and none after that. He was efficient more than dominant, getting easy ground balls and fly outs and giving way to Tanyon Sturtze for the top of the eighth.Zito was gone after just four outs, the shortest of his 189 career starts. The Yankees went to work on his replacement, Saarloos, in the fourth inning.Sheffield reached on an error by shortstop Bobby Crosby, who would leave the game with a bruise on his left index finger. Rodriguez and Jason Giambi followed with singles, scoring Sheffield and bringing up Matsui with two on and no outs.As he starts his fourth season in the majors, Matsui still has his flair for showcase games. He lined a homer into the right field seats to break open the game. It was 11-1 Yankees, and after two more singles, Matsui had lifted his opening day average to .529 (9 for 17) for the Yankees.On and on it went. A Sheffield double kicked off a two-run rally in the fifth, when the former Yankee Brad Halsey hit two batters and got a warning from the umpire. Three innings later, Jeter and Rodriguez singled in runs to make it 15-1.At that point, the A's set a club record for runs allowed on opening day. The previous record, 14, came when the franchise was based in Philadelphia.The Yankees have done better on opening day; they beat the Washington Senators by 19-1 in 1955. That was a season that ended in the World Series, where these Yankees clearly believe they are headed.They will not play like this every night, but they showed right away that they can indeed be as fearsome as they look on paper. Late at night on the East Coast, Steinbrenner, their principal owner, must have slept peacefully.The Yankees sent Carl Pavano's magnetic resonance imaging results to his California back specialist, Robert Watkins. Pavano, recovering from a back injury, bruised his buttocks last week, and the Yankees have not cleared him to resume pitching. Reliever Scott Proctor re-joined the team after missing four days to be with his infant daughter, who was hospitalized in Miami. Manager Joe Torre said Kelly Stinnett would catch Randy Johnson on Saturday night in Anaheim. Torre said he arranged it that way because the Yankees have a day game Sunday, when Jorge Posada will start.'"
"'06-04-04,'1','Xavier Nady, who was General Manager Omar Minaya's first off-season acquisition, went 4 for 4, scored a run and knocked one in. Lo Duca, who arrived three weeks later, notched two hits, including a two-out blooper in the third that scored the Mets' first run of 2006. David Wright, the talented anchor at third base, hit an opposite-field homer that provided the margin of victory.But judging by the raucous ovation he received in pregame introductions and the deafening response he got when the bullpen door opened before the ninth inning, Billy Wagner was the player the crowd most wanted to see. Jogging toward the mound to the pulsating bass of Metallica's ""Enter Sandman,"" Wagner, the Mets' new closer, said he was so nervous that he would not have heard rockets if they were being shot off behind him. The pounding of his heart, he said, was louder than the noise coming from the fans.He fired a first-pitch strike -- a 92-mile-an-hour fastball -- to Marlon Byrd before inducing a groundout. He caught Matthew LeCroy looking on a nasty slider for the second out. And then Jose Vidro lined a high fastball into the left-center-field gap. From the moment he watched the ball skid on the wet outfield grass, Vidro said, he knew he was not stopping at first.Carlos Beltran, the boobirds' favorite target yesterday, made up for going 0 for 4 by firing a throw to Anderson Hernandez that beat Vidro by five steps.""I started immediately thinking about Jose Guillen,"" Wagner said, referring to the on-deck hitter. ""Then, it was like, 'Thank you, Jesus.' ""Wagner's outing provided a fitting contrast to last season's opener at Cincinnati, when, in nine pitches, Braden Looper turned a two-run, ninth-inning lead into a miserable loss that preceded four more. Wagner's 285th career save -- and first as a Met -- punctuated the 276th career victory for Glavine, who was the victim of so many combustible bullpens during his three full seasons in New York.Glavine allowed six hits, walked three and struck out five, and he managed to overcome some early wildness to keep the Nationals at bay. With runners on second and third and one out in the fifth, he roared back from a 3-0 count to strike out Nick Johnson looking on an inside fastball. Then he struck out Soriano on a similar pitch. In the sixth, Glavine fielded a sharp comebacker and initiated an inning-ending double play that left him pumping his fist as he walked off the field.If Glavine provided the consistency, Soriano offered the curious sideshow. Playing his first regular-season game in left field, Soriano caught all four fly balls without incident, but he revealed his inexperience in outfield nuances in the fourth inning. With Cliff Floyd on first, Nady ripped a ball inside the third-base line. Soriano, unfamiliar with how balls carom out of the corner, waited for the ball to skip to him. It did not, and the wasted moment allowed Floyd, not the speediest of runners, to score standing up and give the Mets a 2-1 lead.After Wright's homer, Manager Willie Randolph turned to Aaron Heilman to bridge the innings to Wagner.Heilman, a right-hander, allowed three consecutive hits to left-handed batters in the seventh as the Nationals drew to 3-2. In the eighth, he allowed a leadoff single to Soriano, bringing up Zimmerman. He slammed Heilman's first pitch into the left-field corner. Soriano darted around second and toward third as Floyd corralled the ball and threw to the cut-off man, José Reyes.Even with nobody out and his team down a run, the Nationals' third-base coach, Tony Beasley, windmilled Soriano home. With Soriano running as quickly as he was, only a textbook relay throw could have caught him. Blocking the plate, Lo Duca fielded the one-hopper as Soriano slid headfirst. The throw beat Soriano, but the first-base umpire, Tim Tschida, who had correctly rotated to the plate during the play, waited to make the call as he moved himself into better position. He appeared screened by the sprawled Lo Duca.An instant after Lo Duca tagged Soriano, the ball slipped out of his glove. Tschida never saw it, and Lo Duca snatched the ball and thrust it into the air, as if he were a reclining Statue of Liberty. That was the evidence Tschida needed, and he called Soriano out.""Just show it and sell it,"" Lo Duca said. ""It trickled down my arm, and I just grabbed it and showed the umpire. It was a break.""The Nationals did not argue the call. Television replays indicated that Soriano's hand had touched home before he slid into the tag.Soriano said he did not see the ball fall out of Lo Duca's glove because of the commotion around the plate. Manager Frank Robinson said he would have disputed the call if he had seen a clear replay.""Do you think I would have stayed in the dugout if I had?"" Robinson said.The answer, of course, is no, but by that time, the Mets were savoring a hard-earned victory, the result of solid fundamentals and luck, a necessity for any team with playoff expectations.'"
"'06-04-04,'1','""Typically, a first business trip is intended to test the mettle of an employee,"" said Lyssa Menard, a clinical health psychologist at the Wellness Institute of Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. ""Their presentation skills and people skills are on display the entire time.""Some new travelers are insecure; others are overconfident. Ms. Walsh says that was to blame for her mishap. ""I was very excited and thought I was just the best businesswoman on the planet,"" she said. But after her shuttle driver made a reluctant detour to the locksmith, her attitude changed. With her morale deflated, she said she was grateful to the other shuttle van passengers who agreed to wait while she bought a new key.In fact, baggage and clothing are perhaps the two biggest reasons that fledgling business trips go awry.On Karin Amour's first time out, she made the mistake of packing only two changes of clothes for a three-day trip. ""I had been given exactly 90-minutes warning before I had to leave work to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco,"" said Ms. Amour, who was at the time a manager of marketing communications for a managed care company.The flight encountered some rough air. Seconds later, her drink spilled in her lap, leaving her with only one change of clothes. The résumés she had been poring over went flying in every direction.""The other passengers had free reading material,"" she said. ""And every single one of them had a comment. 'Hire this guy,' or 'Hey, can I borrow this one?' ""Gary Zeune learned to pack an extra suit after his first business trip for an international accounting firm in 1973, a flight from Los Angeles to New York. ""The stewardesses -- that's what we called them back then -- had just served dinner of beef Wellington, wine and a great dessert,"" he said. ""Then we hit an air pocket, and the food ended up on the cabin ceiling, in our laps, and there was sauce dripping from our heads.""At least Mr. Zeune had something to wear the next day. Other first-timers are not so lucky. John Hartman remembers his first business trip to Columbus after being hired at the Health Department for the State of Ohio. The night he arrived, he had visited a few of the city's country and western bars.""When I got up the next morning and looked for my blue government-issue business suit, I was shocked to realize that the clothing bag was still hanging on the back of my bedroom door 150 miles away,"" he said.Mr. Harman pressed on, attending his first meeting in worn jeans, cowboy boots, and, ""God help me, a sweaty Western shirt,"" he said. ""I left the cowboy hat in the room.""He made a lasting impression on his new supervisor -- fortunately, a more positive one than he expected -- and continued working for the department for the next 30 years until his retirement.But not all inaugural business trips have such happy endings. Bill Armstrong, now an information technology consultant in Calgary, Alberta, recalled his first business trip as a laborer for an oil company.""When they told me I had a job with them, they asked me to fly to their office in order to fill out paperwork before going to the field,"" he said. It was his first flight, and a snowstorm delayed his arrival by three hours. ""At some point, they felt I wouldn't show up and gave the job to someone else."" (Ultimately, he was offered another job.)Disastrous conclusions to first business trips are not uncommon. Deborah K. Jensen, a librarian in Boston, wrecked a rental car as a subscription representative for an international agency. The vehicle was towed away, and when she returned to the airport, ""all I had were the rental paperwork, the police report, and the car keys,"" she said. ""I was still picking dirt and gravel out of my hair.""Although so much could go wrong on a first trip, corporate America does little to prepare new employees for life on the road. ""Companies are more than willing to pay for courses on dressing for success or networking, but they are reluctant to train new employees to become better business travelers,"" said Christopher McGinnis, director of the Travel Skills Group, a San Francisco-based company that used to offer classes on business travel. ""They don't see the payoff.""And if recent hires are not instructed on the basics of business travel -- how to fill out an expense form, check into a hotel, book a flight -- then at least they ought to be trained in relaxation techniques, said Dr. Menard of Northwestern Memorial Hospital.""But I have seen very little anecdotal evidence that strides are being made in this area,"" she added. ""Often, employees are left to devise strategies themselves or seek assistance from stress management psychologists.""Eventually, travelers do learn from their missteps and mistakes. Hope McGhee's employer, the financial services division of a Japanese car maker, asked her to fly to Los Angeles for systems training on her first business trip. ""I soon discovered that I was too young to rent a car, and I had to bum a ride with one of my co-workers,"" she said.Ms. McGhee says she now tries to prepare the employees she sends on the road. ""When I ask people to travel, I am careful to include packing lists, weather reports and cost information,"" she said. ""I wouldn't want them to make the same mistakes that I did.""'"

"'06-04-04,'1','MEXICO CITY, April 3 - Verizon Communications announced Monday that it was selling its interests in phone companies in Venezuela, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic for $3.7 billion, saying they no longer fit in with its business focus.All three transactions involved América Móvil, a large cellular telephone service provider controlled by the Mexican multibillionaire Carlos Slim Helú that has grown steadily across Latin America as global telecommunications companies withdrew from some national markets.Verizon's move fits in with a broader shift by phone companies in the United States, which are concentrating on their domestic wireless and Internet businesses. Companies including BellSouth, AT&T and the Vodafone Group have left Latin America in recent years, either because their business strategies there failed or because they were struggling at home.Analysts say América Móvil, which reported revenue of $17 billion last year, has achieved much of its success through its ability to sell cellphones to Latin America's fast-growing working class.More than 90 percent of wireless service users in the region use prepaid cards that give them a set number of minutes. But wireless companies must set up wide distribution channels to sell those cards, said Omar Salvador, an analyst at Pyramid Research in Cambridge, Mass. In Mexico City, for example, vendors in yellow jumpsuits sell cards for the América Móvil local unit Telcel at traffic lights.'"
"'06-04-04,'1','""History is filled with defendants who had their testimony blow up in their face,"" said Stephen Meagher, a former federal prosecutor who now runs his own law firm in San Francisco. ""It is a little like pulling the pin on a hand grenade and hoping that you get it to the other side before it blows up.""Experts say that a jury is willing to lay aside all of the previous evidence and make its judgment based on whether it finds the defendant believable.""The defendants put the whole case on the line when they testify,"" said Mark Zauderer, a partner at the law firm of Flemming Zulack Williamson Zauderer, and a specialist on juries. ""Once they take the stand, the whole focus changes from the government evidence to whether the jurors can buy the credibility of the defendants.""But that, of course, cuts two ways, experts said. Not only will the jurors put the government's evidence to the test based on the defendant's testimony, but they will do the same with any points that the defense lawyers have scored in the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses.""Skilling or Lay could undo in a stroke whatever progress the defense has done against the government's witnesses if the jury doesn't believe they are being forthcoming,"" Mr. Meagher said.Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling face complex balancing acts in their testimony. For example, Mr. Skilling prides himself on his intelligence and he has made no secret of his desire to get on the stand and explain the workings of Enron in detail. But, lawyers said, going too far with that approach could backfire on him.""It would be a mistake for Skilling to come across as a very shrewd, very knowing guy because it could lead the jury to conclude that he should have known of these irregularities,"" said John J. Fahy, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at Fahy Choi in Rutherford, N.J. Such a conclusion could lead a jury to decide that Mr. Skilling acted with willful blindness when he failed to see wrongdoing around him, a deduction that could be used to support a conviction.Moreover, the jurors will not be the only people listening to their testimony. If Mr. Skilling or Mr. Lay presents a defense that strikes Judge Simeon T. Lake III, who is hearing the case in Federal District Court, as simply not credible, their decision to testify could result in longer sentences for committing perjury if they are ultimately convicted.The testimony of the defendants underscores their ignominious fall after Enron's collapse. Once they were celebrated as Houston's greatest corporate citizens. They had the ear of many a power broker, from City Hall to Wall Street and even the White House. Those days are gone. Now, they can only hope to persuade the 12 people on the Houston jury that they are not liars and crooks.In the courtroom, the defendants are a study in contrasts. Mr. Skilling usually sits up straight and stares at the witness with wide eyes. His expression has been pained at times, as when his protégé, Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer, testified against him.Mr. Lay often slouches in his chair, looking with an impassive poker face at the witness, frequently scanning the jurors' faces. During some tough moments, as when Ben F. Glisan Jr., the former treasurer, was testifying, Mr. Lay turned his chair and put his back to the witness stand.While their legal teams plan a combined defense, Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay face different challenges in responding to the government's case. Mr. Skilling, 52, is charged with 28 counts of conspiracy, fraud and insider trading for time he spent as both chief executive and as the company's president and chief operating officer. Mr. Lay, 63, is charged with six counts of fraud and conspiracy, mostly related to the four months he spent as chief executive after reassuming the post when Mr. Skilling suddenly resigned in mid-August 2001.In contrast to their situation with Mr. Lay, who kept a low profile and gave no sworn testimony before the trial, prosecutors will have about 2,000 pages of Mr. Skilling's previous testimony with which to challenge him. After Enron's bankruptcy filing in December 2001, Mr. Skilling gave sworn testimony to Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission and did television interviews proclaiming his innocence. On the stand, Mr. Lay will describe his life like a Horatio Alger story, of growing up poor in rural Missouri, then rising to create what became the seventh-largest corporation in the world. Mr. Skilling will tell jurors about how a fast-rising management consultant joined the fledgling Enron and transformed the natural gas industry.Both will buttress their cases with character witnesses. For Mr. Lay, these will include some of Houston's leading lights, like Philip J. Carroll Jr., the former Shell Oil Company chief executive; Robert Lanier, a popular former mayor; and Drayton McLane Jr., the owner of the Houston Astros. They are expected to highlight Mr. Lay's philanthropy and other civic acts.In Mr. Skilling's case, his character witnesses will focus on why he claims he abruptly resigned as chief executive -- because of physical and mental exhaustion and out of concerns for his family -- after only six months in the job.Both men have spent an extraordinary amount of time plotting strategy with their lawyers. Mr. Skilling has practically become a lawyer himself. He set up the Houston offices for Daniel Petrocelli, his lead lawyer, across the street from the courthouse. He secured office space there for himself, his wife and his younger brother, Mark, a lawyer who moved back to Houston from Istanbul to help Mr. Skilling with his defense.Mr. Skilling has forged a close bond with Mr. Petrocelli, who is only three months older than him and exhibits the same brash confidence.Every morning, Mr. Skilling picks up Mr. Petrocelli at his hotel at 7 a.m. in his Mercedes and they stop at a Chevron station to get coffee before heading to the courthouse. In the months leading up to the trial, Mr. Skilling burned the midnight oil at the offices of O'Melveny & Myers seven days a week. Now Mr. Petrocelli says he makes him go home about 8 p.m. after he dines with the lawyers, so that he can appear rested during the trial.Both Mr. Petrocelli and Michael W. Ramsey, Mr. Lay's lead lawyer, say that neither defendant has received any coaching or done any mock trials in preparation for testifying. ""Nada,"" said Mr. Petrocelli, who said he was not worried that theemotional Mr. Skilling could lose his temper or otherwise blow up on the stand. ""I am sure he will have his moments,"" Mr. Petrocelli said, ""but I have a high degree of confidence that he will be fine.""Both men have fought to contain their feelings in court and generally emerge from the courthouse smiling at day's end. But there have been flashes of raw emotion. Mr. Skilling seemed especially pained as he watched Mr. Fastow and David W. Delainey, who headed the wholesale division and later the retail energy division, testify that Mr. Skilling took part in broad deceptions.And after Mr. Glisan outlined what he said were public fabrications by Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling about the health of the company, Mr. Lay, uncharacteristically, erupted outside the courthouse. ""I've never heard so many lies in one day in my whole life,"" Mr. Lay told reporters, according to several accounts. Mr. Lay's wife, Linda, nodded her head and added, ""Unbelievable.""Recent white-collar criminal trials have demonstrated high stakes when a chief executive takes the stand. For example, Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, tried to portray himself as unknowledgeable about many aspects of his own business to explain how he could have been unaware of the company's multibillion-dollar accounting fraud. Mr. Ebbers was convicted, with many legal analysts portraying his testimony as simply unbelievable.Another chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski from Tyco, testified at his criminal trial that he accidentally failed to report $25 million in special bonuses on his taxes and also accidentally overlooked disclosing those payments in the company's public filings. The jury rejected his arguments and convicted him on charges of looting the company.Other former chief executives have seen their sentences grow as a result of their testimony at trial. For example, Paul A. Bilzerian, the former chairman of the Singer Corporation, received a four-year prison sentence, one of the longest handed down during the Wall Street scandals of the 1980's, as a direct result of his testimony. During that testimony, Mr. Bilzerian made statements that the judge found unbelievable, like claiming to have no knowledge that he was legally required to file a tax return.""If Mr. Bilzerian had not testified at all at the trial, his sentence would not be what it was,"" Judge Robert Ward, who presided over the Bilzerian case in federal court, said at the time of sentencing.Indeed, many chief executives who have testified at their own criminal trials have found that the aggressive, cocksure attitude that helped them climb the corporate ladder can undermine their jury appeal.""The skills that made them a charismatic leader of a company don't always translate into making them a good witness for the defense,"" said Robert Mintz, a former prosecutor who is a partner at McCarter & English. ""Historically the odds are stacked against a C.E.O. taking the stand.""'"
"'06-04-04,'1','Indeed, according to sales figures provided by Prudential Douglas Elliman, the number of sales of apartments with two or more bedrooms rose 44 percent in the first quarter of this year, to 1,017 from 705 in the last quarter of 2005.Yet there were some signs of caution in the figures released yesterday. Although prices were up 7 percent to 8 percent from figures reported a year ago, depending on the report, they remained below the spikes in prices reported last spring. And the inventories of unsold apartments also rose significantly, with a rising supply of new condominiums coming to the market. Hundreds of additional new or newly converted condominium apartments are due to come on the market this year.Each brokerage firms tracks inventory differently, but in the first quarter they showed the same trends. Prudential Douglas Elliman put the current unsold inventory of apartments at 6,904, up 60 percent from the 4,327 it reported a year ago and 16 percent from the previous quarter. Corcoran listed 9,206, more than double the 4,492 it listed a year ago, and up 10 percent from the previous quarter.Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm that prepared the Prudential Douglas Elliman report, said that when the changing mix of apartments sold is taken into account, using the average price per square foot, condo prices actually declined slightly from the previous quarter, by 4.2 percent, while co-op prices rose by 2.8 percent.Mr. Miller said that looking at the numbers this way suggested that price appreciation was ""essentially flat.""""Right now I see there being parity between buyers and sellers,"" he said.Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, offered a more optimistic interpretation. ""People really became confident again, and people got bonuses at the end of the year,"" he said. ""The strength continues to be there.""During the second half of last year, sales of studio apartments and one-bedrooms remained strong, perhaps as buyers rushed to lock in mortgage rates, and were up this quarter as well. Although prices per square foot on smaller apartments have sharply trailed larger ones over most of the last decade, Mr. Heym's data showed that average prices on one-bedroom and studio apartments in Manhattan were both about $905 a square foot, close to the $1000 average for all apartments.'"

"'06-04-05,'0','The discovering scientists called the fossils the most compelling examples yet of an animal that was at the cusp of the fish-tetrapod transition. The fish has been named Tiktaalik roseae, at the suggestion of elders of Canada's Nunavut Territory. Tiktaalik (pronounced tic-TAH-lick) means ""large shallow water fish.""In two reports in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, the science team led by Neil H. Shubin of the University of Chicago wrote, ""The origin of limbs probably involved the elaboration and proliferation of features already present in the fins of fish such as Tiktaalik.""Dr. Shubin, an evolutionary biologist, let himself go in an interview. ""It's a really amazing remarkable intermediate fossil — it's like, holy cow,"" he enthused.Two other paleontologists, commenting on the find in a separate article in the journal, said that a few other transitional fish had been previously discovered from approximately the same Late Devonian time period, 385 million to 359 million years ago. But Tiktaalik is so clearly an intermediate ""link between fishes and land vertebrates,"" they said, that it ""might in time become as much an evolutionary icon as the proto-bird Archaeopteryx,"" which bridged the gap between reptiles, probably dinosaurs, and today's birds.The writers, Erik Ahlberg of Uppsala University in Sweden and Jennifer A. Clack of the University of Cambridge in England, are often viewed as rivals to Dr. Shubin's team in the search for intermediate species in the evolution from fish to the first animals to colonize land.In a statement by the Science Museum of London, where casts of the fossils will be on view, Dr. Clack said the fish ""confirms everything we thought and also tells us about the order in which certain changes were made.""H. Richard Lane, director of paleobiology at the National Science Foundation, said in a statement, ""These exciting discoveries are providing fossil 'Rosetta Stones' for a deeper understanding of this evolutionary milestone — fish to land-roaming tetrapods.""The science foundation and the National Geographic Society were among the financial supporters of the research. Besides Dr. Shubin, the principal discoverers were Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia and Farish A. Jenkins Jr., a Harvard evolutionary biologist.Michael J. Novacek, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, who was not involved in the research, said: ""Based on what we already know, we have a very strong reason to think tetrapods evolved from lineages of fishes. This may be a critical phase in that transition that we haven't had before. A good fossil cuts through a lot of scientific argument.""While Dr. Shubin's team played down the fossil's significance in the raging debate over Darwinian theory, which is opposed mainly by some conservative Christians in the United States, other scientists were not so reticent. They said this should undercut the creationists' argument that there is no evidence in the fossil record of one kind of creature becoming another kind.One creationist Web site (emporium.turnpike.net/C/cs/evid1.htm) declares that ""there are no transitional forms,"" adding: ""For example, not a single fossil with part fins part feet has been found. And this is true between every major plant and animal kind.""Dr. Novacek responded in an interview: ""We've got Archaeopteryx, an early whale that lived on land and now this animal showing the transition from fish to tetrapod. What more do we need from the fossil record to show that the creationists are flatly wrong?""Dr. Shubin and Dr. Daeschler began their search on Ellsmere Island in 1999. They were attracted by a map in a geology textbook showing the region had an abundance of Devonian rocks exposed and relatively easy to explore. At that time, the land was part of a supercontinent straddling the equator and had a warm climate.It was not until July 2004, Dr. Shubin said, that ""we hit the jackpot."" They found several of the fishes in a quarry, their skeletons largely intact and in three dimensions. The large skull had the sharp teeth of a predator. It was attached to a neck, which allowed the fish the unfishlike ability to swivel its head.""Fish feeding in water readily orient the mouth toward food by maneuvering the entire body,"" said Dr. Jenkins, who assisted in the interpretation of the fossils. ""The head is rigidly attacked to the trunk by bones linking the skull and shoulder girdle, and thus fish have no neck.""If the animal spent any time out of water, he said, it needed a true neck that allowed the head to move independently on the body.Embedded in the pectoral fins were bones that compare to the upper arm, forearm and primitive parts of the hand of land-living animals. The scientists said the joints of the fins appeared to be capable of functioning for movement on land, a case of a fish improvising with its evolved anatomy. In all likelihood, they said, Tiktaalik flexed its proto-limbs primarily on the floor of streams and may have pulled itself up on the shore for brief stretches.In their journal report, the scientists concluded that Tiktaalik is an intermediate between the fish Panderichthys, which lived 385 million years ago, and early tetrapods. The known early tetrapods are Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, about 365 million years ago.Tiktaalik, Dr. Shubin said, is ""both fish and tetrapod, which we sometimes call a fishapod.""'"
"'06-04-05,'0','By winning the most votes in December's election, the main Shiite political bloc earned the right to choose the country's next prime minister. Mr. Jaafari won the nomination in a close internal ballot but has faced a fierce campaign by a coalition of Sunni Arabs, Kurds and independents — joined more recently by some Shiite leaders — to step down.The Bush administration has not concealed its disapproval of Mr. Jaafari and the visit by Ms. Rice and Mr. Straw was widely viewed here as an attempt to ratchet up the pressure against him to relinquish the nomination.But according to several political leaders interviewed today, the trip appeared to have the opposite effect.""I think it hardened the position of Jaafari"" and his allies, most notably the militant Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, said Saleh Mutlak, a hard-line Sunni Arab.Mr. Mutlak, in a telephone interview, said the diplomats' trip was little more than a dramatic photo opportunity in response to waning support in the United States and Britain for the war. If they wanted to pressure the prime minister, he said, ""they could have done this without coming here,"" and done it more effectively and more subtly through Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad.Efforts to break the logjam continued today as President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, sounded out other political leaders on the possibility of taking the issue before Parliament, a Kurdish official said. But some Shiite leaders have promised to resist that move because it is not prescribed in the Iraqi constitution.Nearly four months after elections, the country is still being led by a caretaker government, and violence has flourished in the political vacuum. The American and Iraqi military commands have been trying to counter shifts in the conflict that have resulted in skyrocketing civilian casualties inflicted by both Sunni Arab insurgents and sectarian death squads.In Baghdad, two car bombs detonated this afternoon within about 20 minutes of each other, killing three people and wounding at least 16, an official at the Interior Ministry said.Gunmen wearing the uniforms of Interior Ministry commandos and driving ministry vehicles opened fire on guards outside the Baghdad headquarters of the Iraqna cellular phone company, wounding a guard then abducting him, the ministry official source said.The security forces belonging to the Interior Ministry are heavily infiltrated by members of Shiite militias and have been accused of committing crimes. Top ministry officials did not comment on today's assault but have in the past blamed such crimes on criminals using false or stolen ministry uniforms and vehicles.An Iraqi cameraman for CBS News, who was detained a year ago on suspicions of abetting the insurgency, was acquitted today by a three-judge panel at the Central Criminal Court of Iraq here.On April 5, 2005, Abdul Ameer Younis Hussein was shot in the hip by an American sniper while he was filming the wreckage of a car bomb that had wounded several American soldiers. He was taken to a hospital where he was detained by the Americans. They said that he had tested positive for explosives and that footage on his camera linked him to the insurgents.After a yearlong journey through the detention system, his ordeal came to an end just as suddenly as it had begun. At his trial, a prosecutor stood up in a half-lit courtroom at the Central Criminal Court and, in a statement that lasted less than one minute and was delivered in a phlegmatic monotone, requested that the case be dismissed for lack of evidence.After a brief recess, the judge declared Mr. Hussein not guilty. Mr. Hussein, wearing a prison-issue canary-yellow jumpsuit, fell to his knees, dropped his forehead to the ground and prayed in silence. He was returned to Abu Ghraib where he would await final approval of his release by the American military, his lawyers said.""The mystery is why this case got referred to the court in the first place,"" Scott Horton, a lawyer from New York who flew to Baghdad to help defend Mr. Hussein, said after the ruling. ""It's intimidation and the potential use of lethal force against journalists. This case was brought to fire a shot across the bow of a free press.""The American military did not respond to requests for comment.Free-press advocates have pointed to the case of the CBS cameraman as an example of the unique difficulties that Iraqi reporters face in covering the war, particularly the American military. While Western reporters are largely confined to fortified compounds and military bases, their Iraqi employees are often left to cover much of the day-to-day violence in urban Iraq.Dozens of Iraqi journalist working for Western news organizations have been detained while on assignment and sometimes released weeks or months later with no explanation.Last month, the American commander in charge of detainee operations in Iraq told Reuters that the military would accelerate the cases of detained journalists in which a news organizations could vouch for the journalist. The commander, Maj. Gen. Jack Gardner, also said troops would be given more training to help them identify and protect to journalists in a war zone.'"
"'06-04-05,'0','""Our message is that common interests are on the increase and the basis of the bilateral relationship is being constantly strengthened,"" he said.Mr. Hu will visit the United States from April 18-22, including his first trip to the White House since becoming China's Communist Party chief in 2002 and president in 2003. Chinese officials are eager to ensure a positive reception for Mr. Hu and to demonstrate that he can keep China's most delicate diplomatic relationship on an even keel.China last year piled up a $200 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States, a record trade gap for Washington. The deficit has triggered Congressional proposals to impose tariffs on Chinese imports unless Beijing moves faster to raise the value of its currency, the yuan, which some critics say is kept artificially low, giving China's exports an unfair edge in international markets.Bush administration officials have said for months that Chinese leaders were underestimating the surge of anti-China sentiment in Congress and among some influential interest groups. They have pressed Beijing to increase imports from the United States, allow the yuan to appreciate faster and do more to stop rampant violations of American copyrights and trademarks by Chinese companies and government entities.China has ruled out any sudden shifts in its currency policy, insisting that it will move steadily, but gradually, toward a market-driven exchange rate.Officials here have signaled a willingness to do more to protect intellectual property rights, a perennial sore point with American companies. They have publicized fines imposed on Chinese companies that use pirated software. They may also commit to purchases of American software for government computers.The biggest action is on the trade front, with China expected to order at least 80 new Boeing aircraft, mostly single-aisle 737 models, state media reported. It could also commit to unprecedented purchases of agricultural commodities and cutting-edge telecom equipment needed to upgrade its fixed-line and mobile phone networks.The foreign ministry official said the trade delegation, which also includes representatives of a dozen government ministries, is hoping to establish long-term ties with companies in the American heartland to promote imports in the future.""We would like to emphasize that this is not a one-off,"" the official said.The effort to ease trade tensions comes despite the fact that Chinese officials and some independent analysts argue that the current economic relationship, even with the large bilateral deficit, strongly favors the United States.Chinese officials point out that China is now American's fourth largest export market, with United States exports to China expanding at a 21.5 percent annual pace since 2001.Officials have also cited academic studies showing that if inexpensive goods from China were not available, American business and consumers would have had to pay up to $100 billion more for the same products made elsewhere. They also say that much of the profit from manufacturing in China goes to American and other foreign companies and patent holders who assemble goods and license technology in China.""The general feeling here is that the trade deficit does not really come at the U.S. expense,"" said, an international relations expert at Beijing University. ""The US makes money at every stage of Chinese production.""But, Mr. Jia added, China is eager to help Mr. Bush ease protectionist pressures in the United States and also create a more positive atmosphere for discussing more contentious political and diplomatic matters.""Bush wants to strengthen relations with China but he is politically weak at the moment,"" Mr. Jia said. ""For political reasons, we feel we need to help Bush.""'"
"'06-04-05,'0','By evening, more than 300 people had been arrested in Paris. But the clashes seemed less fierce than those of just a week ago, as riot police officers managed to keep discipline and maintain order.In the northern city of Lille, however, hundreds of youths smashed shop windows, vandalized cars and threw rocks, bottles and other objects at the riot police, who fired back tear gas. A female reporter was assaulted while filming the violence and a young man suffered burn injuries from the shell of a tear gas grenade, Agence France-Presse reported.The police also used tear gas to disperse casseurs in other cities, including Caen, Rennes and Lorient.The protests brought more than one million people into the streets in cities and towns throughout France, slightly lower than the 1.16 million protesters of a week ago, according to the Interior Ministry. Union organizers estimated the number for both demonstrations at three million.The protests even reached as far as the French island of Réunion, nearly 6,000 miles away, where thousands of people in two cities marched against the law.The strikes that accompanied the protests on Tuesday disrupted daily life but, again, not as severely as those of last week. Some offices, hospitals, shops, universities and high schools were closed or working less efficiently; some transportation services were disrupted.Only 24 of France's 84 universities were functioning normally, with others either partly blocked by demonstrators or closed. The Eiffel Tower was closed, as it was during last Tuesday's protests.But, in a sure sign that this was not a country paralyzed, the Paris Métro and bus system ran on a normal schedule. Mail and many newspapers were delivered. Only 18 percent of railroad workers were on strike, compared with 28 percent a week ago. Fifteen percent of domestic flights were canceled, half the percentage of last week. The Education Ministry reported that 23 percent of its workers were absent, compared with 36 percent last week.In the National Assembly, Mr. de Villepin faced savage criticism from the opposition.""Mr. Prime Minister, who is governing France today?"" asked Jean-Marc Ayrault, the leader of the Socialist party bloc in the Assembly. At another point he said: ""You govern no more. You hold the appearance of power, but you no longer exercise it.""Mr. Ayrault said France was mired in a ""crisis of regime with two prime ministers,"" apparently referring to the active role that Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy has played in trying to open a dialogue with the unions.In reply, Mr. de Villepin vowed, ""The government will not give in."" Despite predictions that the law is doomed, he insisted: ""What we want is a victory against unemployment. This is a victory for France.""The attacks on Mr. de Villepin, who has never held elective office, have grown fiercer over this issue in recent weeks. On the streets of Paris, one sign read, ""In memory of a virtual prime minister.""The position of the government deteriorated even further after President Jacques Chirac's televised address on Friday, when he made a compromise offer that watered down the youth labor law.The law, as passed by Parliament and upheld by the Constitutional Council, created a new labor contract for people under the age of 26 that gave employers up to two years to fire them without cause.Mr. Chirac said he was sending the measure back to lawmakers, asking them to cut the probation period to one year and to require employers to give a reason for any dismissal. He asked companies not to issue contracts under the law until it had been modified. But two days later, Mr. Chirac signed the original youth initiative into law.Fifty-five percent of those polled for a survey by BVA in the newspaper Les Échos on Tuesday said Mr. Chirac's decision to amend the law was ""not enough.""According to a BVA poll that will appear in the weekly magazine L'Express on Thursday, only 49 percent of those polled said they hoped that Mr. de Villepin would stay in the post of prime minister, while 45 percent expressed the hope that he would resign.Mr. Sarkozy, who is also the leader of the governing Gaullist party, meanwhile, has given the impression that he, not Mr. de Villepin, his political rival, is managing the crisis. Over the weekend, Mr. Sarkozy spoke by phone with leaders of the main unions, and on Monday night held talks with party deputies to discuss amendments to the new law.'"
"'06-04-05,'0','BANGKOK, April 4 — Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire turned populist politician, said Tuesday that he would step down as Thailand's prime minister, ending five years of increasingly tumultuous rule and breaking a political stalemate over demands for his resignation that had gripped the country for the past two months.It was a sudden reversal for Mr. Thaksin, who a day earlier had claimed victory in national elections held Sunday that had been boycotted by opposition parties.""Our country needs to move on,"" Mr. Thaksin said in a hastily arranged, 10-minute appearance on national television late Tuesday. ""Our children need to have a much better future. There's no point if adults keep trying to beat each other up and finally destroy the country.""Mr. Thaksin said he would stay on as caretaker prime minister until a new leader was chosen, which according to Thai law must take place within 30 days of the election. Thai media have speculated about several possible replacements, including the commerce minister and close Thaksin ally, Somkid Jatusripitak.By adopting universal health care, cracking down on drug dealers and offering debt relief to farmers, Mr. Thaksin endeared himself to rural voters, who make up 70 percent of the country's 63 million people.'"
"'06-04-05,'0','With 860,000 meals a day, New York has the largest school feeding program in the country, second only to the military in the amount of food it serves.Although the district also sells sliced, bagged pineapples, oranges and carrots, the apples are the most popular and they are the only locally grown produce. Called ""Grab Apples"" and preserved with ascorbic acid so they stay fresh for up to three weeks, the bagged slices are much more popular than whole apples, which, Mr. Berkowitz said, tend to be used as baseballs or stuffed down toilets.After his speech, people gathered for the conference applauded and headed to the lunchroom, where a debate about the sliced apples began. Were they a brilliant move toward getting children to eat better? Or a stumble that takes children further from healthy, whole food?Some thought the apples smelled strange. They complained about the impact all that plastic would have on landfills. And they thought the package illustration, a tree with plastic bags growing from its branches, was appalling.""Are we trying to teach children that this is where apples come from?"" said Josh Viertel, who runs a program at Yale University that puts local, sustainable food in dorm cafeterias. ""What's wrong with actual apples?""Ann Cooper, a chef recently hired to bring local, organic and sustainable food to the 15 public schools in Berkeley, Calif., relies on bagged carrots and apples for snacks in schools without kitchens. But the plastic isn't environmentally friendly, and whole fruits and vegetables taste better, so she plans to eliminate bagged produce altogether.""I understand the need for efficiency, but in the end, apples should look and taste like apples,"" she said. ""All of the pollution just doesn't make sense.""The slices are also more expensive than a whole apple. Each bag costs about 25 cents, compared with a dime for an apple, said Jerry Dygert, the owner of Champlain Valley Specialty in Keeseville, N.Y., which produces the slices for the city's schools and four other New York State school districts.But they are appealing to children, especially younger ones who have a hard time biting into whole apples. Plus, they help the campaign to get local produce into schools, said William Jordan of the Department of Agriculture and Markets. He is working to provide other prepared New York produce to school lunch lines, including bagged carrots.""The apple slices have become sort of a symbol that things can change,"" he said.Margo Wootan, Nutrition Policy Director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group, would much rather have the children eat bagged apples than nothing at all.""What's the alternative?"" she said. For her, there are bigger issues when it comes to reforming the food America's schoolchildren eat.Tomorrow, federal lawmakers plan to introduce legislation setting new standards for school lunches. The bill, which the Center for Science in the Public Interest helped draft, has Democrats and Republicans from both houses among its sponsors. It is aimed at eliminating sodas, candy bars and other foods with questionable nutritional value from school campuses.The Department of Agriculture now has much stricter standards for foods allowed as part of the regular school lunch line than it does for food sold in vending machines, snack bars and à la carte food lines.Correction: April 12, 2006, Wednesday An article last Wednesday about the sale of packaged apple slices in New York City schools misattributed an assertion that whole apples had been thrown into toilets. That account was given by people who work with the school food service program, not by David Berkowitz, executive director of the program. (Mr. Berkowitz said the apples were sometimes used as baseballs.)'"

Computer Sciences employs 80,000 workers worldwide. Its shares closed up $2.51, at $59.80.Speculation about an acquisition of Computer Sciences, based in El Segundo, Calif., has been building for several months.Last fall, the company was approached by a consortium that included Lockheed Martin and several private equity firms with an offer that was reportedly as high as $12 billion, but the negotiations fell apart because the two sides could not agree on a price.At its current price, the company is worth about $11.3 billion, up from about $10.4 billion at the start of 2005.'"

The team moved to Texas from San Jose, Calif. The six league games averaged four goals a game. Chivas USA yesterday signed the American midfielder John O'Brien, 28, on a free transfer. O'Brien, who has been hampered by injuries the past few years, has played in the Netherlands since his signing with Ajax Amsterdam when he was 17.In 1982, Dietrich Mateschitz was the marketing director for the international division of Blendax, a German cosmetic company. On a trip to Thailand, he encountered rickshaw drivers who drank an Asian tonic drink, Krating Daeng, which translates to red bull in English. He tweaked the formula and, with Thai partners, brought Red Bull to the market in 1984.Now Mateschitz's company, which has headquarters in Fuschl am See, Austria, is days away from its latest marketing splash, when the New York Red Bulls (née the MetroStars) of Major League Soccer play their first home game in their new incarnation. Mateschitz, who has conducted fewer than a half-dozen interviews, according to a Red Bull spokeswoman, responded to questions via e-mail.Q. There were protests in Salzburg last year when Red Bull acquired the soccer team there. Was it a difficult time for you?A. It was over as fast as it began. Our stadium is almost sold out for every match and the audience has more than tripled. There were a handful of radical soccer fans who took the renaming of the club as an excuse to riot. An overwhelming majority of fans appreciated our taking over the club because everyone wanted a significantly better performance. People know that behind all investments made by Red Bull one can expect long-term planning, passion and professionalism.Q. What is your favorite club?Q. Did the reaction by some people to the use of New York in the team name surprise you?A. Yes. We didn't quite understand the reason at first. It does matter, and we have been working closely with local officials in New Jersey. We are proud of being located in New Jersey and most of our fans will come from the surrounding areas.Q. Have sports become too commercialized?A. There is no professional league without investors. There is no professional athlete without sponsors, no Champions League, no motor racing, nothing. Even the Olympic Games have major sponsors. Do you know many sports leagues that can survive on entrance fees or TV rights alone, without sponsors?NEW YORK NOTES -- Bruce Arena, manager of the United States national team, yesterday named Red Bulls goalie Tony Meola, 37, to the 23-man squad that will face Jamaica in a friendly match in Cary, N.C., on Tuesday. The team is composed entirely of M.L.S. players. If he plays, Meola will be making his 100th appearance for the national team. Meola has not played for the national team since May 2002.WORLD CUP -- Last week, FIFA released a 23-man roster of the referees from 23 countries who will call the 64 games at the World Cup. The number is down from the 36 who called games in South Korea and Japan in 2002 and from 34 in France in 1998. The list does not include a Canadian or an American, or referees from the Netherlands, Portugal or Sweden. Kevin Stott, an American who has been sanctioned by FIFA since 1995, was on a list of 44 candidates but did not make the final cut. ""The 23 referees who will be in action in Germany are currently the best match officials in the world,"" Joseph Blatter, the president of FIFA, said. The list includes referees from minor soccer nations like Benin, Singapore and Jamaica.'"
"'06-04-05,'0','The new office, which will include at least two employees and be part of the city's Economic Development Corporation, represents a recognition that skyrocketing rents have made it much harder for smaller arts groups to flourish. It will help such groups navigate the real-estate market, obtain technical advice and attract financing.The conference was intended as a response to a report in December that described the ""creative sector"" -- defined broadly to include advertising, publishing and broadcasting as well as the arts -- as a critical element of the city's economy. The Partnership for New York City, an alliance of business leaders, organized the conference, along with the city, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Center for an Urban Future, a Manhattan-based research organization that prepared the report with help from the consulting firm Mt. Auburn Associates.""This is our competitive advantage, and we are losing it,"" said Robin J. Keegan, a research fellow at the Center for an Urban Future and co-author of the report.While many conference participants offered suggestions for maintaining the city's cultural edge, an equal number provided a grim diagnosis of the city's prospects for remaining at the vanguard of global cultural production.There was little agreement about the exact nature of the problem. Some said that globalization added challenges to the city's future as a cultural hub.""We're moving into a world where everybody in the world will have access to the best of everything, at the touch of a button,"" said Clive Gillinson, executive and artistic director at Carnegie Hall. ""From the point of view of culture, it makes it all the more important that everything we do here in New York City be the very best and most extraordinary.""Barry Diller, a leading media investor and the chief executive of IAC/InterActiveCorp, said India, China and South Korea were now the true hotbeds of creativity because of their governmental support for technological investments. ""New York's ability on into the future to remain the communications capital is really questionable,"" he said.Other speakers focused on the local problems facing creative workers.Terry J. Lundgren, the chief executive of Federated Department Stores, which owns Macy's, said that because once-bohemian neighborhoods were no longer affordable, ""what is vital is to make sure that our transportation system is effective,"" so creative workers who have been priced out of Manhattan can still reach their jobs and even form new communities of artistic ferment.James Schamus, a co-president of Focus Features and a producer of the film ""Brokeback Mountain,"" said that since 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq, the tighter restrictions on entering the United States have made New York seem less hospitable to international artists. Widely reported abuses of American-held prisoners at the Guantánamo Bay military prison in Cuba and elsewhere have also taken their toll, he said. ""Water-boarding your potential clients is really not good for the culture,"" he said, referring to a form of torture, and he received scattered if nervous applause.Mr. Diller seemed swayed by some of those arguments. ""We're certainly not an inviting place that greets people with a big happy smile to come into the melting pot,"" he said.Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, told the gathering that New York City had lost 894,000 residents from 2000 to 2004 and that those who left were in general better educated than those who remained. ""We're constantly having to replenish our supply of people who power this city, particularly creative people,"" he said.Cities in Europe and Asia are ""stealing our cultural institutions,"" he said, adding, ""We've got to stay ahead of the pack.""The new office will be similar to those that already exist for the financial, media, real estate, biotechnology and retail industries. According to Andrew M. Alper, president of the Economic Development Corporation, the entire nonprofit sector accounts for 720,000 jobs in the city, or roughly a fifth of the work force, and the number of nonprofit employers, now 40,000, grew by 57 percent from 1990 to 2002. The office will try to help nonprofit groups secure low-interest or tax-exempt loans through the city's Industrial Development Agency, he said.'"
"'06-04-05,'0','""The right hand doesn't appear to know what the left hand is doing,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, this is just one symptom of a very sick system.""A Health Department spokesman, Robert C. Kenny, said that at least once a year his agency sends updated lists of Medicaid recipients to local social service departments. When instances of overpayment occur, the money is recouped, he said.The solution, Mr. Suozzi said, ""is a simple technological fix"" of coordinating the Health Department's computer files. He criticized the state yesterday for failing to correct the problem even after an internal report in 2004 found that lags in ending various Medicaid services for dead people resulted in $36 million in overpayments over three years.It is still going on, Mr. Suozzi said.In the past, Mr. Suozzi has accused Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, his rival for the Democratic nomination, of failing to use his powers to police the Medicaid program properly. Referring to a recently publicized Medicaid crackdown by the attorney general, Mr. Suozzi said, ""It is never too late to do the right thing, even after seven years in office.""But a spokesman for the attorney general's office said that it had aggressively pursued fraud and that the crackdown was nothing new.The spokesman, Paul Larrabee, said Mr. Spitzer was aware of the problem of overpayments made after patients died and had already recovered millions of dollars. A report from his agency last week cited the examples of two nursing homes that refunded $3 million for overbilling in such cases.With the advent of Mr. Suozzi's candidacy for statewide office, announcements and disputes that might not have attracted wide attention are examined for political significance. For example, the housing advocacy group Acorn said yesterday that its members were resigning from a Nassau housing advisory panel because of a disagreement with Mr. Suozzi over the future of a county-owned property in Garden City. Acorn has long pushed for moderately priced housing at the site.Mr. Suozzi has said he has no authority to supercede Garden City's strict zoning regulations, under which higher-priced housing is planned for the site.'"

"'06-04-05,'0','The federal Bureau of Prisons failed to address concerns that inmates and staff members at several prisons were exposed to toxic chemicals in recycling programs where inmates use hammers to smash discarded computers, according to the agency that handles whistle-blower complaints.In a letter to President Bush and Congress on Monday, the agency, the Office of Special Counsel, called for an independent investigation into the complaints, which were brought to the federal government by a whistle-blower from a California prison in 2004.The office criticized the Bureau of Prisons for not investigating the accusations thoroughly, saying the agency's review was deficient and ""appears to be cursory at best.""The inmates dismantled the computers as part of the federal prison industries program, or Unicor, which has become one of the nation's largest recyclers, providing low-cost recycling to government agencies, schools and private companies.The whistle-blower, Leroy A. Smith Jr., the former safety manager at Atwater Federal Prison outside Merced, Calif., said factory workers in the recycling facility there and at four other federal prisons in the country were exposed to hazardous materials including lead, cadmium, barium and beryllium when the inmates took hammers to cathode ray tubes from computers.'"
"'06-04-05,'0','The bad blood goes back to 1999, when the grand rabbi chose Zalmen, his third son, to take over the sect's main congregation in Williamsburg. He had previously named Aaron, his eldest son, to run the second-largest Satmar congregation, in Kiryas Joel in Orange County.Zalmen's supporters claim that the move made Zalmen the de facto heir. Aaron's supporters say otherwise. The dispute has spawned a never-ending court battle and periodically erupted in the streets and synagogues of Williamsburg.There is much at stake. In Hasidism, an ecstatic, mystical brand of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, the grand rabbi is revered as a god-king and holds profound sway over members' lives. In the temporal realm, the Satmar grand rabbi controls a real estate empire worth hundreds of millions of dollars, a powerful network of schools and social services and a famed matzo factory.In 2004, a judge in Brooklyn refused to rule in the Satmar dispute, saying that the matter was for the grand rabbi to decide. But the grand rabbi has been silent.Samuel Heilman, a distinguished professor of sociology at Queens College who studies Orthodox Jewish sects, said he did not expect the grand rabbi to clear up the succession issue now. Hasidic leaders are often reluctant to choose their successors, he said.""They often have many sons and they want to keep them in the business, so succession is a real problem,"" Professor Heilman said. ""Or the guy doesn't believe he's going to die. There are so many variations on this theme.""The Lubavitcher Hasidim have not chosen a successor to their last grand rabbi, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who died in 1994. Last year, the death of the head of the Bobov Hasidim set off a succession battle between his half-brother and a son-in-law.Professor Heilman said that the Satmars were probably the largest Hasidic sect in the country and certainly the biggest in New York.Moses Teitelbaum himself was chosen by the sect's board of rabbis after a contentious interregnum in 1979, when the previous grand rabbi, his uncle Joel Teitelbaum, died childless without naming a successor. In his 27 years at the helm, Moses Teitelbaum has presided over explosive growth of the communities that Joel established in New York after fleeing the Holocaust and helped his followers fight off pressure to assimilate, Professor Heilman said.Now the Satmars have two boards of rabbis, each claiming legitimacy. Mr. Weiss, the spokesman for Aaron's faction, said it was unclear what would happen next. ""This time it won't be so smooth, so straight,"" he said.'"
"'06-04-05,'0','Most of the businesses that have resumed operations fall into one of two categories: restaurants (29 percent of the food establishments operating in the city before Katrina have reopened, according to the city) and large companies with the economic means to fix up their facilities and cover the extra costs of doing business in an area that is functioning but disabled.""Small businesses don't have the large cash reserves like the big guys do,"" Mr. Hutchinson said.A lack of working capital, though, is only one potential hurdle confronting a small business here. Another is a lack of customers.Ruston Henry, for instance, the younger half of a father-son team that ran the H & W drugstore in the Lower Ninth Ward, figures that they need to borrow more than half a million dollars before they are able to reopen.But money, Mr. Henry said, is not their main concern. The Lower Ninth Ward, still without drinkable water or gas, is an unpopulated swath of town that has lain in ruins since the levees were overwhelmed, drowning the area.""We were a neighborhood pharmacy,"" Mr. Henry, 44, said. ""And what's a neighborhood pharmacy without a neighborhood?"" They have applied for a Small Business Administration loan to gut, refurbish and restock a store that Mr. Henry described as having been destroyed by the flooding. (Flood insurance, he said, would cover only a small part of their losses.)But they are in no rush, Mr. Henry said, to reopen this storefront, which his father and a partner established in 1963.Thousands of business owners are apparently confronting the same sorts of issues. There is no reason to reopen a shuttered auto repair shop in the Ninth Ward or New Orleans East, an area north and east of downtown where a majority of the city's black professionals lived before Katrina, when most of the cars one sees in these devastated communities are abandoned vehicles destroyed by the storm.A tour of the ravaged eastern half of the city shows mile after mile of abandoned businesses and vacant malls. It does not seem to make a difference whether a business is part of a chain, like a McDonald's or a Rite Aid, or a big-box retailer like Toys ""R"" Us, or simply a mom-and-pop dry cleaner or boutique store. All sit unoccupied -- forlorn, damaged reminders of how far New Orleans must go to recover from what many describe as the worst natural disaster in modern American history.In the meantime, Mr. Henry and his wife, Kim, a self-employed environmental engineer, are living with their two teenage children in Jackson, Miss., where Mr. Henry found work as a pharmacist with Wal-Mart. The couple, who lived in the Lower Ninth before the storm, also lost their home.Virgil Robinson Jr., the chief executive of Dryades Savings, a black-owned bank based in New Orleans, said, ""You would think we would be making lots of commercial loans to business damaged by the storm, but so far we're not."" Businesses, like homeowners, Mr. Robinson said, are putting off making big decisions until federal authorities publish new flood maps, which will provide critical guidance for rebuilding.They are also seeking ""a clearer sense of which communities will be coming back when,"" Mr. Robinson said, before seeking money to rebuild.""There's so much uncertainty that basically most of our customers are taking a wait-and-see attitude,"" he said.A lack of housing is proving another roadblock for even the most well-intentioned businesses, as is the lack of essential services. Dryades's crosstown rival, Liberty Bank and Trust, one of the country's largest black-owned banks, was situated in a six-story glass tower in New Orleans East before Katrina struck. It invested the money required for its head office to be ready again for occupancy by January, yet two more months would pass before BellSouth could re-establish phone service and Internet access in a part of town covered by six feet or more of water.""We basically need to rebuild the entire telecommunications infrastructure in the eastern half of the city,"" said Merlin Villar, BellSouth's director in the area. Pockets, though only pockets, of New Orleans East have phone service, Mr. Villar said, and BellSouth is in the process of replacing switching stations and trunk lines destroyed by flooding.Liberty reopened its headquarters in late March, though the building that was once occupied by some 75 employees now has perhaps 15 workers.""Housing is still a big issue,"" said Alden J. McDonald Jr., the bank's chief executive. ""We can only move back employees who have been able to find a place to live back in New Orleans."" The majority of Liberty's employees, including Mr. McDonald, are working out of a temporary beachhead that the bank established in Baton Rouge shortly after the storm, 80 miles to the north and west.""My feeling is we're only at the beginning of the Katrina curve,"" said Ken Murray, an entrepreneur who has founded two companies in New Orleans. ""I think another year or two will pass before we fully understand how big a chunk of activity was taken out of the city's economy.""That is a phenomenon, however, that Mr. Murray will be observing from afar. Shortly after the storm, he moved his two businesses -- one a 50-person sales and marketing firm called Parker, Murray & Associates, founded in 1990, and the other a software start-up, VanillaSoft, that employed 16 people before the storm -- to Dallas. That affects other businesses because he relied heavily on local merchants for supplies and services, but he said he felt that he had no choice but to leave town.Mr. Murray cited both a lack of housing and the uncertainty of the business climate for years to come as two of the primary factors prompting him to move his operations to Texas.""I'm talking to a lot of other business owners who want to be part of the recovery, but share my concerns,"" he said.Those who express optimism about the future of the New Orleans economy note that most of the city's hotels are again open for business, as are the majority of companies in the central business district. Economic development ideas that languished before the storm -- like a vague plan to establish New Orleans as a worldwide center for biotechnology innovation -- have been revived as city leaders hope to leverage the sympathy expressed by people around the country into actual businesses.At first glance, the employees of Energy Partners would seem to provide some hope. The company, a publicly traded oil exploration business, chose to move back into its downtown headquarters in December, despite the many headaches that persisted, including unreliable mail service and an incomplete health care system.Yet while Energy Partners and its chief executive, Richard A. Bachmann, exhibited the kind of can-do spirit that the city needs these days, the company also embodies the precarious nature of the local economy. Whether Energy Partners and its 100 or so employees will stay in New Orleans remains to be seen. The company's commitment to New Orleans, Mr. Bachmann said, is no stronger than the city's will to reform itself. If he does not think that city, state and federal officials have made progress on a number of fronts over the next year -- from shoring up the levee system, much of which is federal responsibility, to an overhaul of a public school system that ranked as one of the worst in the nation -- then he may leave town.""There are a number of companies like us that are working for change that will leave if it continues to be the same old business as usual,"" Mr. Bachmann said.Yet for some, business as usual would be a dream come true. Mr. Robinson of Dryades Savings described ""the general unreliability of everything right now."" The electrical equipment at his downtown branch, two blocks from the corner of Canal and Bourbon Streets, was destroyed when the basement of his building took nine feet of water. He ordered new equipment and lined up electricians, but delivery of the equipment took much longer than expected. And he learned the hard way about the demands on tradesmen working in New Orleans now. He had initially hoped to reopen the branch in December, but it did not open until March.""The concept of a completion date is a very fluid concept right now,"" Mr. Robinson said.'"
"'06-04-05,'0','Asked about the report on Tuesday, Mr. Pataki focused on the Legislature's borrowing plans.""I'm very concerned about the level of borrowing, state debt in the legislative budget, and that's one of the areas that we think should be addressed,"" Mr. Pataki said in a news conference in Albany. Under Mr. Pataki's budget proposal, state-supported debt would rise to $51.6 billion by the fiscal year ending in March 2008, although lawmakers want to add nearly $5 billion to that amount.Legislative leaders have argued that the debt in their proposal is higher because they are responding to court orders to pump billions of dollars of new money into New York City schools, but that Mr. Pataki has not done so.Mr. Pataki has also proposed extending New York's borrowing reach abroad. In his January executive budget proposal, he authorized the state's Dormitory Authority to issue bonds to help finance an expansion of Hadassah Hospital Ein Kerem in Jerusalem, where Ariel Sharon is being treated.The State Legislature rejected the proposal in its own budget, which it submitted to the governor last week. The Pataki administration and legislative leaders are now negotiating their differences in the overall budget.The Citizens Budget Commission report recommends overhauling the constitutional limits on state- and city-supported debt so that state leaders do not feel compelled to go around the voters when seeking to borrow more. The report also proposes a number of steps to make public authorities more transparent and prudent in their borrowing.""We're using and misusing authorities to borrow,"" said Charles M. Brecher, the research director of the Citizens Budget Commission and a professor at New York University. ""Clearly we need to fix the misuses.""Many political leaders reject the idea that the state is borrowing beyond its means.In comments to reporters on Tuesday, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, cited the state's improving credit rating, which has been upgraded several times in recent years, as proof of prudent fiscal management.""Would you report please that the state has never enjoyed a higher bond rating then it presently has today,"" he said. ""The experts that rate the state and what we do and how we do it think the state is doing the best job that's ever been done. Would you report that? Would that be a headline tomorrow? It's never been better.""Mr. Brecher said credit ratings were not necessarily the best measure of the state's ability to handle its debt.""They're telling people how likely you are to get your money back if you buy this bond,"" he said of the credit rating agencies. ""The state has done things to increase the likelihood of that. They dedicate a specific tax and say we're going to pay the bondholders back with this money before we turn it over to the general fund.""What it doesn't say is that if you have a lot of debt, you have less money to pay for schools, health care, and all the other things that the state wants to do,"" he said.In a separate report on Tuesday, New York City's Independent Budget Office said the city's economic base was expanding at a faster rate than the growth in its outstanding debt.'"
"'06-04-05,'0','Mr. Ma appeared in his role as leader of the Silk Road Project, an ensemble bringing together musicians from across Central Asia and the Middle East, which he founded a decade ago.While the hearing was strongly focused on the difficulty of bringing in nonartists, like technology workers from India and graduate students from China, Mr. Ma was clearly the star of the show. But by the time his question-and-answer period came, only the committee's chairman, Representative Tom Davis, Republican of Virginia, was in attendance.""You don't need a passport or a plane to visit someplace new,"" Mr. Ma testified. ""Music provides a shortcut, allowing you to be transported thousands of miles away and back during the two-hour span of a concert.""Mr. Ma said barriers to foreign musicians ""have become extraordinarily high."" He cited the case of two Iranian musicians, Siamak Aghaei and Siamak Jahangiri, who have visited the United States eight times with the Silk Road Project since 2000 and must still wait months before receiving visas. They have to fly to Dubai for a consular interview and then fly back to pick up the visa. In the last year, Mr. Ma said, they went a third time because the visa printer was out of order. The latest procedure lasted three months and cost $5,000.In another case, the Hallé Orchestra of Manchester, England, canceled a two-concert United States tour partly because of the cost of having to take all 100 players and staff members to the United States Embassy in London for personal interviews, said Sandra L. Gibson, the president and chief executive of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters. Ms. Gibson said the cost mounted to $80,000.Post-9/11 rules now require almost all nonimmigrant visa applicants to undergo face-to-face interviews. The wait for an interview can often take three months in some places and sometimes up to five months in India. Costs have gone up, too. Performing arts presenters must apply here to bring in performers, another process that can drag on for weeks or months. The United States Customs and Immigration Service charges organizations a $1,000 ""premium processing fee"" to do it in two weeks, instead of the normal $190 fee. Many organizations just pay the larger fee. In addition, each individual applying for a visa must pay $100.The arts presenters association represents a field of 7,000 organizations. Ms. Gibson said 75 percent of them presented foreign artists in 2002. The percentage was down to some 60 percent last year, she said, because of the red tape.Arts presenters acknowledge that the United States immigration service is hard pressed for funds, staff and facilities, and that the number of visa requests is rising.Tony Edson, the State Department's deputy assistant secretary for visa services, defended the government's record on visas, saying that 515 consular jobs had been created since September 2001. The State Department has improved training, computer systems and efficiency, he added. Paperless visas and digital video interviews are being considered. Personal interviews, he said, are an ""incredibly useful"" security tool.Committee members acknowledged that security was important but argued that it had to be balanced with openness. ""In the long run, our security is enhanced and not diminished by the exchange of people and ideas,"" said Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California.'"

Belarus, Iran and Venezuela abstained.""This is a major retrenchment in America's long struggle to advance the cause of human rights around the world,"" said Rep. Tom Lantos, Democrat of California, ""and it is a profound signal of U.S. isolation at a time when we need to work cooperatively with our Security Council partners.""The leading Democrat on the House International Relations Committee and founding co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, Mr. Lantossaid that the failure to push for the 96 votes needed for acceptance ""projects a picture of profound weakness in U.S. diplomacy.""Since American officials had last month approved the budgeting of the council and pledged to support it, today's negative announcement was unexpected. Numbers of congressmen, including some of the United Nations' harshest Republican critics, had joined rights groups in lobbying the Bush administration to make the United States a candidate despite the council's flaws.The director of the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights, Felice Gaer, said it was a mistake for the United States to wait for future elections to run.""All key decisions about serious reform issues from the curtailment of inappropriate bodies to whether and how countries are scrutinized will be made in the first year,"" Ms. Gaer said. `Among the Republican critics who had counseled joining the panel despite its acknowledged flaws were Senators Norm Coleman of Minnesota and Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the foreign relations committee chairman, and Representatives Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey and Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, who is chairman of the House International Relations Committee.When the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, proposed a resolution calling for an American boycott of the new council on March 31, Representative Smith put out a statement calling for the measure's defeat.Human rights groups speculated that the United States was worried that revelations of abuses of detainees in Iraq and of clandestine prisons abroad had raised fears in the Bush administration that it could not get the needed 96 votes for membership.""It's childish for the U.S. government not to cooperate with the new Human Rights Council when it cooperated for decades with the vastly inferior Human Rights Commission,"" said the executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth.""It's unfortunate that the Bush administration's disturbing human rights record means that the United States is today hardly a shoe-in for election to the council,"" he added.A Democratic member of the House committee, Robert Wexler of Florida, faulted the United States ambassador, John R. Bolton, for isolating the United States and thwarting the United Nations human rights effort.` ""This decision reflects the colossal diplomatic failures of Ambassador Bolton,"" Mr. Wexler said in an interview.""It's a national disgrace for America that we will not be a present in guiding and leading that council in a productive direction,"" he added, ""and that under Mr. Bolton's leadership at the U.N. the world's single superpower cannot muster up the necessary votes to win an election.""'"
"'06-04-06,'0','The discovery team called the fossils the most compelling examples yet of an animal that was at the cusp of the fish-tetrapod transition. The fish has been named Tiktaalik roseae, at the suggestion of elders of Canada's Nunavut Territory. Tiktaalik (pronounced tic-TAH-lick) means ""large shallow water fish.""""The origin of limbs,"" Dr. Shubin's team wrote, ""probably involved the elaboration and proliferation of features already present in the fins of fish such as Tiktaalik.""In an interview, Dr. Shubin, an evolutionary biologist, let himself go. ""It's a really amazing, remarkable intermediate fossil,"" he said. ""It's like, holy cow.""Two other paleontologists, commenting on the find in a separate article in the journal, said that a few other transitional fish had been previously discovered from approximately the same Late Devonian time period, 385 million to 359 million years ago. But Tiktaalik is so clearly an intermediate ""link between fishes and land vertebrates,"" they said, that it ""might in time become as much an evolutionary icon as the proto-bird Archaeopteryx,"" which bridged the gap between reptiles (probably dinosaurs) and today's birds.The writers, Erik Ahlberg of Uppsala University in Sweden and Jennifer A. Clack of the University of Cambridge in England, are often viewed as rivals to Dr. Shubin's team in the search for intermediate species in the evolution from fish to the first animals to colonize land.H. Richard Lane, director of paleobiology at the National Science Foundation, said in a statement, ""These exciting discoveries are providing fossil 'Rosetta Stones' for a deeper understanding of this evolutionary milestone — fish to land-roaming tetrapods.""The science foundation and the National Geographic Society were among the financial supporters of the research. Besides Dr. Shubin, the principal discoverers were Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia and Farish A. Jenkins Jr., a Harvard evolutionary biologist. Casts of the fossils will be on view at the Science Museum of London.Michael J. Novacek, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, who was not involved in the research, said: ""Based on what we already know, we have a very strong reason to think tetrapods evolved from lineages of fishes. This may be a critical phase in that transition that we haven't had before. A good fossil cuts through a lot of scientific argument.""Dr. Shubin's team played down the fossil's significance in the raging debate over Darwinian theory, which is opposed mainly by some conservative Christians in this country, but other scientists were not so reticent. They said this should undercut the argument that there is no evidence in the fossil record of one kind of creature becoming another kind.One creationist site on the Web (emporium.turnpike.net/C/cs /evid1.htm) declares that ""there are no transitional forms,"" adding: ""For example, not a single fossil with part fins, part feet has been found. And this is true between every major plant and animal kind.""Dr. Novacek responded: ""We've got Archaeopteryx, an early whale that lived on land, and now this animal showing the transition from fish to tetrapod. What more do we need from the fossil record to show that the creationists are flatly wrong?""Duane T. Gish, a retired official of the Institute for Creation Research in San Diego, said, ""This alleged transitional fish will have to be evaluated carefully."" But he added that he still found evolution ""questionable because paleontologists have yet to discover any transitional fossils between complex invertebrates and fish, and this destroys the whole evolutionary story.""Dr. Shubin and Dr. Daeschler began their search on Ellesmere Island in 1999. They were attracted by a map in a geology textbook showing an abundance of Devonian rocks exposed and relatively easy to explore. At that time, the land had a warm climate: it was part of a supercontinent straddling the Equator.It was not until July 2004, Dr. Shubin said, that ""we hit the jackpot."" They found several of the fishes in a quarry, their skeletons largely intact and in three dimensions. The large skull had the sharp teeth of a predator. It was attached to a neck, which allowed the fish the unfishlike ability to swivel its head.If the animal spent any time out of water, said Dr. Jenkins, of Harvard, it needed a true neck that allowed the head to move independently on the body.Embedded in the pectoral fins were bones that compare to the upper arm, forearm and primitive parts of the hand of land-living animals. The joints of the fins appeared to be capable of functioning for movement on land, a case of a fish improvising with its evolved anatomy. In all likelihood, the scientists said, Tiktaalik flexed its proto-limbs mainly on the floor of streams and might have pulled itself up on the shore for brief stretches.In their report, the scientists concluded that Tiktaalik was an intermediate between the fishes Eusthenopteron and Panderichthys, which lived 385 million years ago, and early tetrapods. The known early tetrapods are Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, about 365 million years ago.Tiktaalik, Dr. Shubin said, is ""both fish and tetrapod, which we sometimes call a fishapod.""'"
"'06-04-06,'0','Five leading European scientists are criticizing officials involved in human and animal health in an article appearing today, saying the officials are not doing enough to monitor cats, dogs and other carnivores for their possible role in transmitting avian influenza.Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists also urge people living in areas where the A(H5N1) virus has infected poultry and other birds to keep their cats indoors.The scientists are from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. They directed much of their criticism at the World Health Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health for emphasizing the lack of evidence that domestic cats play a role in transmitting the virus and contending that more research is needed.Cats, tigers and leopards are known to have been infected with the virus in Asia and Europe. An author of the article, Dr. Albert Osterhaus, a virologist and veterinarian at Erasmus Medical Center, has performed experiments showing that cats can give the virus to other cats. But whether they do so in real life, and if so how often, is unknown.Dick Thompson, a spokesman for the W.H.O., said yesterday by telephone that it agreed that more work was needed to determine the role of cats and other carnivores in the epidemiology of avian influenza.'"

Ms. Curry chimed in with her customary cloying intensity, saying she felt as if her sister were moving out to go to college. (She was at least smart enough not to say ""older sister."") As ""Today"" begins a momentous transition, Ms. Curry was a useful reminder of why NBC wants Meredith Vieira of ABC for the job.Ms. Couric's on-air persona has inevitably changed, sometimes gratingly, since her saucy debut in 1991, but no other network morning personality is as vibrant. Outside her isolation booth at the news desk, Ms. Curry is downright unwatchable, and none of the network's other aspirants seem personable and down-to-earth enough to win over the show's mostly female, middle-aged audience. Ms. Vieira, 52, is an engaging, good-humored and experienced newscaster who may not always enthrall viewers, but is unlikely to bore or repel them.Mr. Lauer said all the right things, without seeming too distraught. After Ms. Couric ended her statement with an emotional thank you to viewers for ""15 great years,"" her co-host mischievously added, ""also coming up in this half-hour.""

"'06-04-06,'0','LONDON, April 5 - Five pharmaceutical companies and nine executives are facing criminal charges of conspiracy to defraud the British National Health Service, after a three-year investigation into prices of antibiotics and blood-clotting drugs.The companies are Kent Pharmaceuticals, Norton Healthcare (now a unit of Teva Pharmaceuticals), Generics U.K., Goldshield Group and the British arm of Ranbaxy in India. The Serious Fraud Office of Britain said on Wednesday that the companies and executives were accused of fixing prices and sharing market information.The charges stem from an investigation begun in April 2002 after allegations that British generic drug providers had colluded to set prices from 1996 to 2000. Suppliers of generic penicillin-based antibiotics and warfarin, an anticoagulant, were the focus of the inquiry.The criminal charges focus on conspiracy to defraud because price-fixing was not a criminal offense until 2002, when Britain passed a law making it illegal. Some of the companies facing charges have already paid more than £10 million (about $17 million) to settle charges with the Department of Health, without admitting any liability.Norton Healthcare said it believed that sales of warfarin and antibiotics during the time covered by the investigation were in compliance with existing laws. Goldshield said it and its executives had not acted in an unlawful or improper way, and Ranbaxy said that it had not yet seen the allegations. Generics, which is owned by Merck of Germany, and Kent Pharmaceuticals had no comment.""This important case involving an allegation of dishonest price fixing by companies is likely to have a significant impact upon the business culture of this country,"" said Philip Lewis, an assistant director with the Serious Fraud Office.'"
"'06-04-06,'0','In the report, researchers used data from a 2003 survey of 530 restaurant workers and a 2005 survey of 350 workers.The center said it sought out workers for interviews on ""subways, in their neighborhoods, in the vicinity of restaurants during breaks or at the end of shifts, and inside the restaurants themselves."" Many of the workers in the study did not want to be identified because they are illegal immigrants.Nonetheless, the center said the types of restaurants, workers and occupations reflected the industry as a whole.E. Charles Hunt, a spokesman for the Greater New York City Chapters of the New York State Restaurant Association, said, ""They're trying to make it look like every single restaurant in the city is taking advantage of illegal immigrants."" He said that most restaurants did no such thing and that ""food safety is the No. 1 priority of restaurant operators.""Mr. Hunt, who once owned a restaurant in White Plains, said the 880 workers cited in the study did not represent the city's 250,000 restaurant workers. ""Just no way are these valid data,"" he said.In the study, titled, ""Dining Out, Dining Healthy,"" researchers for the Restaurant Opportunities Center divided workers into a group that experienced ""many labor violations"" at restaurants, such as the lack of overtime pay or sick leave, and a group that experienced few such violations, based on their responses in interviews.The center, for example, reported that 22 percent of the group with many violations reported ""sneezing, coughing or spitting on food,"" citing a lack of health and safety training, compared with 14 percent for the group with few violations.Cooks and dishwashers at a ""small Upper West Side restaurant"" reported that when workers cut themselves, they were ordered to put on gloves and continue working even when the gloves filled with blood. The workers cited understaffing as the cause.""The blood inevitably gets into the food that is served,"" one worker was quoted as saying.'"

And some go hunting for the kinds of man vs. nature parables that Jon Krakauer (""Into the Wild"") and Werner Herzog (""Grizzly Man"") found: mysterious disappearances heightened by the drama of the landscape and its four-legged perils. When there's not much left of an outdoorsman other than his wristwatch, the details are gruesome, but the story has the makings of a hit.So the template for ""The Last Season"" is unmistakable. Eric Blehm, who was a serious High Sierra backpacker, not to mention the editor of a snowboarding magazine -- has tried to shape the story of James Randall Morgensen along these familiar lines. Randy was a park ranger with a deep love of the outdoors. Then he suited up into his hiking gear, headed out into the backcountry of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and disappeared. What happened to him? More to the point, is there a book in it?Regardless of the fair answer to that last question, Mr. Blehm has written a book. He begins by setting the scene. ""A hermit thrush broke the alpine silence,"" he writes about the fateful morning of July 21, 1996, because Randy obliged his future biographer by recording the thrush's presence in his official logbook. Less officially, the once-rhapsodic Randy had been saying things like ""I don't find much pleasure in the flowers anymore"" and ""after all these years of being a ranger, I wonder if it's been worth it."" Then there were worrisome remarks in letters to friends: ""Nothing seems predictable, except pain.""As ""The Last Season"" reveals, in steroid-enhanced versions of points that might shape a magazine article, there were obvious factors contributing to Randy's discouragement. He mourned the death of his father, Dana Morgensen, whose love of nature and job at Yosemite National Park had had a huge effect on Randy. (""It was obvious that the cone hadn't fallen far from the pine tree."")Dana's work had allowed Randy to grow up in an extraordinarily inspiring setting. (The great nature photographer Ansel Adams was a family friend and an early mentor to Randy.) At 54, he had never had much luck with a writing career -- for reasons that this book, by quoting all too freely from his journals, makes clear.'"

Ford's plan was announced a few weeks after General Motors, which lost $10.8 billion last year, revealed its own program to close all or part of a dozen plants and eliminate 30,000 jobs through 2008.G.M.'s troubles, and the bankruptcy of its biggest parts supplier, Delphi, have led to speculation that G.M. might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Analysts say the fallout from a G.M. filing could damage Ford's recovery efforts.Mr. Ford said executives were continually studying what might happen to the company, based on the quickly deteriorating conditions in the industry.He would not say if a G.M. bankruptcy was one of those possibilities, but said he was not considering such a move for Ford.""We don't see it at all,"" Mr. Ford said. He pointed to the company's cash, which stood at $25 billion at the end of 2005, as well as to the profitability of Ford Credit, the company's financing arm.""We're going to keep our strengths like Ford Credit,"" Mr. Ford said, indirectly referring to G.M.'s sale on Monday of a 51 percent stake in its financing unit. ""We're going to keep our liquidity.""But Mr. Ford went on, ""We're acutely aware of how precarious this industry is. It's really up to us to be nimble enough to react.""Despite the gloom surrounding the industry, much of Mr. Ford's speech was lighthearted.Asked which Ford model excited him the most, Mr. Ford quipped, ""Except for my wife, you mean?""

Kiss protocol is so routinely bungled that it was parodied in a short video that the fashion designer Kenneth Cole used in February to unveil his autumn collection. The video shows how a young woman's efforts to bestow the affectation end in repeated disaster.The awkwardness -- and inevitability -- of the social kiss has led to strategies to deal with it.

That slight turn of the head can take you past the lip and the cheek.""If being bussed on the cheek is way too intimate, some advise that sticking your hand out firmly -- keeping a straight elbow -- is the best way to show yourself willing to shake hands and nothing more.That's what Mr. Hay did at a nightclub opening in February, then added his own follow-through.""A woman was coming in for the kiss, so I took a step back and then put my hand out in front of me,"" he said. ""I turned left and kept going in one continuous movement, like a dance step, to escape.""While the handshake still holds sway in big corporations, said Barbara Pachter, who heads an etiquette-training firm in New Jersey, the kiss has migrated into areas like sales, where it can denote a warm relationship that encourages buying. Still, figuring out where the limits are can present problems, she noted.""I had one pharmaceutical saleswoman client -- young and attractive -- who would kiss and hug her clients,"" Ms. Pachter said. ""Then she saw one doctor at dinner and gave him a kiss and hug. His wife didn't appreciate that, and it was not appropriate.""The kiss is ""happening more and more,"" agreed Peggy Post, a spokeswoman for the Emily Post Institute founded by the doyenne of etiquette. ""We're much more informal in everything from the clothes we wear to how we greet people.""Ms. Post advocates the handshake and agrees that it's better ""to steer clear of kissing people of the opposite sex, which can be misconstrued in some cases."" This is especially true on first meetings. Later, kissing as a greeting depends on the relationship, she and others said.At one time the handshake had to be initiated by a woman before the man would extend his hand, Ms. Post noted. That's long past since most women in the work force don't hesitate to extend their hand in greeting.But the social kiss is often initiated by men who are higher ranking. For example, at a ceremony in January, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg planted a double kiss on Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye of New York State.""The more powerful person is the one who determines the amount of physical space,"" said Ann E. Fuehrer, a professor of psychology and women's studies at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. ""They are taking the initiative to determine the degree of proximity.""Sarah Felix, 27, a features editor at Good Housekeeping, remembered a cheek-and-lip collision with a former boss, which she found unsettling because, she said, ""there is always a certain amount of tension in that gesture between an older man and a younger woman.""P. M. Forni, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, who wrote ""Choosing Civility: The 25 Rules of Considerate Conduct"" (St. Martin's, 2002), said, ""You can use the kiss to overpower a person."" But, Professor Forni said, ""in an age when there are all these prohibitions on physical contact, such as putting an arm around someone's shoulder, we are looking for a way of physical contact that is beyond reproach.""He added: ""The social kiss is a gentle reminder that we are physical beings. It is face-to-face encounters that make us human.""In Mediterranean countries, he said, ""there is less of a stigma when it comes to touching,"" but American men are still tentative. While President Bush bestowed kisses on Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice and Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings when they were appointed to his cabinet, his public goodbye last week to Andrew H. Card Jr., his longtime chief of staff, consisted of very brief backslapping.""Social kisses can be a nonverbal signal that you are embraced and respected,"" observed Pamela S. Eyring, the director of the Protocol School of Washington. ""Still, they should be reserved for friends.""Some believe that cheek kissing simply codifies welcoming behavior. ""Cheek kisses are customs of politeness, not more,"" said Polly Platt, the director of Cultural Crossings in Paris, a training service for corporate managers.The double kiss is frequently used in the diplomatic world, which has adopted the two-cheek European version as a compromise between the kissier (three or four times) approach used by some Continentals and the tepid one-kiss welcome.Donald B. Ensenat, the United States chief of protocol, said he greets women with the double kiss but men with a handshake, a pat on the back or an embrace, depending on their relationship.""I'm from New Orleans,"" Mr. Ensenat said. ""I was used to one kiss. It's a Southern thing to give a cheek peck, so it wasn't hard to get used to two kisses.""The social kiss may have roots going back to Roman times, some academics believe. Its popularity has waxed and waned. In the early decades of the 20th century, it was mostly seen among the aristocracy and spread gradually after World War II, gathering speed as the traditional handshake was deemed stodgy.Even so, confusion often reigns because there is no set formula for social kissing. The French, for example, kiss on both cheeks -- one kiss each -- although in a few regions it is the double-double kiss with two on each cheek. The Belgians, the Dutch and even the dour Swiss go for the triple kiss. If you can'tkeep that straight and need a refresher, the lip balm company Blistex has a rundown of kissing customs on its website, www.blistex.com, under the heading Global Lip Customs.In most countries the social kiss begins with the right cheek, probably because most people are right-handed and, according to a German study in 2003, most people tilt their heads to the right when heading for a lip kiss. So it follows that they would lean right for a cheek kiss.National customs are reflected in the diplomatic world, but that does not mean it is easy to learn them, Madeleine K. Albright, the former secretary of state, wrote in her 2003 memoir, ""Madam Secretary."" While she typically got a single peck on the cheek from foreign ministers, she wrote, ""in Latin America the maneuver was complicated by the fact that in some countries they kiss on the left and in some on the right.""She added, ""I could never remember which, so there were a lot of bumped noses.""She took it in stride, but others who accidentally encounter noses, lips and cheeks less often find it more unsettling.Ms. Colloff, for example, said that after knocking into the other lawyer, ""I was so embarrassed that I pretended throughout dinner that it had not happened.""And he, a perfect gentleman, did the same.""'"
"'06-04-06,'0','""The mass affluent group is so critical to America,"" Mr. Grooms said. ""It sounds as if they have a lot of money, but this is really middle-class Americans who have done some responsible saving over the past 30 years.""The mass affluent are either fending for themselves or struggling to find good financial advice. ""For this group of investors, the smaller firms actually offer an advantage because it's the relationship that is the critical asset, the differentiator, not the product push,"" said Constance M. O'Hare, managing partner of Beacon Advisors. Her firm recently published a study on the mass affluent.""These investors want to feel that their advisers are making time for them, personalizing it for them,"" Ms. O'Hare said. ""They don't consider themselves rich but they don't want to be treated as if they are small.""Indeed, the financial advisers whose clientele includes both the mass affluent and high-net-worth individuals say they offer the same kind of service and attention to both groups. Leo Ryan, who owns an independent Ameriprise franchise office in Natick, Mass., works with more than 170 clients who cross into the high-net-worth category.""The goals are the same for the mass affluent and those with high net worth,"" Mr. Ryan said. ""They want someone to be a filter for them and help them understand change in the investment marketplace, sort through the product offerings, and act as a coach to make sure that they follow through on whatever actions they need to take to achieve their goals. Sometimes the accounts have a couple of extra zeroes but the objectives are the same.""Other independent advisers echo those sentiments. Debra Brede, who runs DK Brede Investment Management Company in Needham, Mass., spent much of her career working at large brokerage houses like Shearson and later Prudential. She was taught to sell products rather than form relationships with her clients.""Those firms are missing a big market,"" said Ms. Brede, whose firm manages $300 million for 400 clients. ""These investors don't want packaged products. They want a tailored suit at a good price. They want value. This segment is so underserved that they are turning to their accountant or insurance agent for financial assistance and they end up getting sold whole life insurance instead of a personalized financial plan.""Ms. Brede pointed out that 90 percent of her clients fell into the mass affluent category and a large number of those were small-business owners. These clients have much of their net worth tied up in their businesses. ""They'll come to me with $100,000 or less to invest and I'll work with them and eventually, if and when they sell their business, they suddenly are in the high- net-worth category but they'll stay with me because we've developed a strong relationship over time,"" she says.According to the Beacon Advisors study, the mass affluent are practical, cautious investors who are generally immune to the marketing campaigns of giant financial players like Merrill Lynch or Charles Schwab. They do not have financial plans but their money was hard earned and any losses from bad investments are not easily replaced.Linda Lubitz works with 110 families in Miami managing about $130 million in client money. She started her firm, Lubitz Financial, in 1994, and today she looks for clients with $500,000 and more in liquid assets.""We work with a lot of people in their early 50's, which is an age when people have a wake-up call and realize they really need to start paying attention to their finances,"" Ms. Lubitz says. ""Our clients have had corporate 401(k) accounts for 15 or 20 years and they've built up some serious money and don't want to make mistakes now.""The large firms, not unexpectedly, have taken notice of the mass affluent opportunity. Companies like Merrill Lynch, Fidelity and Charles Schwab have all introduced advisory services for mass affluent clients in the last few years but none offer the kind of sustained, personalized relationship that makes the small, independent firms attractive.Bill Carey is president of the Registered Investment Advisors Group at Fidelity Investments in Boston, the nation's largest mutual fund company. Mr. Carey's group offers brokerage services for independent financial advisers and he says that Fidelity research has shown a dearth of financial planning among the mass affluent.""Our research has shown that the typical working American is on track to replace just 56 percent of his income in retirement and that only one in five Americans retire with any retirement income plan,"" Mr. Carey says. ""So we really see an opportunity here for investment advisers.""Indeed, his group grew 40 percent in 2005 and he already has 3,000 independent investment firms on board. ""People are waking up to a need for more advice and guidance,"" he said. ""There are a lot of new businesses being formed in this space.""'"
"'06-04-06,'0','""The religion has changed,"" said Charles Wolf, a financial analyst at Needham & Company, a New York investment firm. ""Apple is saying we have the chance to really build the Macintosh platform, and although there are risks, we're going to do it.""Indeed, although much is still made of the rivalry between Apple and Microsoft, and Steven P. Jobs, Apple's co-founder and chief executive, has continued to poke fun at Microsoft's struggles to modernize Windows, Apple has steadily moved to accommodate itself to the rest of the computing world.Shortly after he returned to Apple in 1997, Mr. Jobs persuaded Microsoft to commit to make its Office software run on his computers and invest in his company. More recently, in 2003, he developed a version of his popular iTunes software that runs on Windows-based computers, giving him an opening to sell his wildly popular iPods to tens of millions of PC users.Last year Mr. Jobs stunned the computer world by announcing that he would break away from his alliance with I.B.M. and recreate the Macintosh based on Intel microprocessors. It was the switch to Intel chips, long the standard in the Windows world, that opened the door to Mac-Windows harmony.Through all of these moves, Mr. Jobs has managed to maintain his loyal base of customers. In fact the Macintosh religion can still be palpably felt among those who have remained loyal to the user-friendly computer even as its market share dipped below 3 percent.""I love the Mac platform, I just hope I won't have to boot Windows even for Photoshop in a few years,"" Alexandros Roussos, a student at the University of Paris who is founder and editor of the MacCulture network, a group of Web sites for Macintosh enthusiasts.Wednesday's move also won an important endorsement from Apple's other co-founder, Stephen G. Wozniak, who long ago left the company but remains a vocal Macintosh user and is idolized by the Mac faithful.""It's a great thing for Apple,"" he told a reporter by e-mail. ""I don't see the earth being rocked, but I can now recommend Apple hardware to a lot more people. One pitch is that if Windows gets too frustrating and unbearable and unsafe, then they can easily switch.""And Microsoft took the opportunity to salute the move, and itself. ""Windows is a great operating system,"" a Microsoft statement said. ""We're pleased that Apple customers are excited about running it, and that Apple is responding to meet the demand.""But even as it introduced the new capability, in the form of a free program called Boot Camp available for download, Apple tried with not-so-subtle body language to play down its significance.Ever the showman, Mr. Jobs had been accused of excess in a recent product introduction, when he called reporters to Apple's headquarters on short notice for a presentation that included a leather glove to protect the finish of an iPod music player. But he was nowhere in evidence for Wednesday's announcement, which was made in a simple news release.Word of the new offering was not visible Wednesday morning on the front page of Apple's Web site, which usually trumpets new products and capabilities. Instead, to obtain the Boot Camp software, it was necessary to navigate to an inside page on the Web site, where the download button was buried in a small box.""Obviously ever since the Macintosh was moved to Intel, we've been getting this question from customers,"" said Philip W. Schiller, Apple's senior vice president for worldwide product marketing, explaining the Windows decision. ""We always said it's possible.""Its muted announcement notwithstanding, Apple did a significant amount of technical work to make Windows run cleanly on a Macintosh computer. Part of the challenge was writing software modules called device drivers that connect the Microsoft software to the Macintosh hardware components like disk drives and video displays.The Boot Camp system makes it possible for an Intel-based Macintosh to start up running either Windows XP or the Mac operating system, OS X. But one system must be stopped before the other can be started. Moreover, the user must also purchase a copy of the Windows operating system, at $99 or more.Apple said Wednesday that it planned to make the Boot Camp capability a standard feature of the next version of OS X, which is expected to be introduced later this year or in early 2007.Entering the mainstream of the computing world might undermine one of Apple's greatest selling points recently: that the Macintosh has been largely immune to computer viruses and other malicious software.But because the Macintosh programs are shut down when Windows is running, and the Windows XP operating system does not know how to read and write information to the Macintosh file system, Mr. Schiller minimized the risk that Macintosh users might be taking in adding Boot Camp.To be sure, this is not the first time that a Macintosh has been able to run Windows software. At one time Macs could be outfitted with special cards that ran Intel processors, and more recently several companies have produced software emulators that permitted Windows and Macintosh programs to coexist. But those were improvised solutions, with sluggish results.Several companies, including VMware, a subsidiary of the data storage company EMC, are working on a technology that slips a thin layer of instructions underneath the existing Macintosh operating system. Such an approach would conceivably allow the Macintosh to run Macintosh, Windows and Linux programs simultaneously at full speed.A number of analysts and software developers said Apple's greatest risk was that by opening its machines to Windows software it might inadvertently chill the enthusiasm of software developers for producing programs to run with the Mac operating system.The potential downside was far outweighed by the opportunity to expand the number of Macintosh users, Mr. Schiller said, which is a central factor in attracting software developers.""We thought long and hard about this,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, the most important factor is Mac market share.""Mr. Wolf, the Needham & Company analyst, said that he had done several user surveys since Apple's shift to Intel to measure the potential sales increase from a Windows-compatible Mac, and that user enthusiasm had come back so strong that he had distrusted his results.He said the biggest and most immediate increase would come in home and education markets in the United States; Apple has 14.8 percent of the elementary and secondary education market, and 5.1 percent of the home market, according to the market research firm IDC.""It will double Apple's share in these markets,"" he said.But in the ranks of Mac veterans on Wednesday, some remained leery of crossing the threshold.""I had the Windows disk halfway into my MacBook Pro,"" said Jason D. O'Grady, the editor of Powerpage.org, a Macintosh enthusiast site. Then he recalled the reports he had heard about the risks of exposing unprotected Windows-based computers to the Internet and how quickly they could become infected.""I thought to myself, 'Do I have an entire afternoon to waste?' "" he said.Correction: April 7, 2006, Friday A front-page article yesterday about Apple Computer's introduction of software enabling some Macintosh models to run the Microsoft Windows operating system referred incorrectly in some copies to the typical retail price of Windows XP. It is $199 or more, not $99. The article also misstated the extent of Apple's promotional efforts. The new software, Boot Camp, was indeed promoted on the front page of Apple's Web site, in one of several alternating headlines at the bottom of the screen.'"

"'06-04-06,'0','Merck said it was pleased that the jury had not connected Vioxx to Mr. Cona's heart attack and said it would make a longer statement after the trial was finished.Judge Carol E. Higbee, who is overseeing the case, barred the jury of six women and two men from speaking to reporters until they reached a verdict in the punitive damages phase.As of the end of last year, 9,600 product liability suits had been filed, representing 19,000 groups of plaintiffs, according to Merck.""Merck must dissect the loss and retool its trial strategy for the next round,"" said Peter Bicks, a defense lawyer for Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe who is not involved in the litigation but has followed it closely.Merck stopped selling Vioxx in 2004 after a clinical trial showed that the drug increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes in people who took it for at least 18 months. More than 20 million Americans took Vioxx from 1999 to 2004. Epidemiologists have estimated that 100,000 people might have suffered heart attacks because of the drug.After 14 hours of deliberations over two days, the jurors found that Vioxx had caused Mr. McDarby's heart attack and that Merck had failed to warn patients and doctors of Vioxx's heart risks. They awarded $3 million to Mr. McDarby and an additional $1.5 million to his wife.The finding that Merck had failed to warn of the drug's dangers was the only unanimous vote. In the other findings against the company, the votes were 7 to 1.The verdict was read about 5:30 p.m. in Courtroom 3A of the Atlantic County Superior Court, a squat, block-long brick building in the middle of this seaside casino town.Jurors also found that Merck had committed consumer fraud by misleading doctors about the risks of Vioxx. For that, they awarded Mr. McDarby an additional $12,000 -- triple the amount he spent on Vioxx prescriptions.The finding of consumer fraud will also force Merck to pay at least some of the lawyers' fees for Mr. McDarby.The fraud finding could have bearing on another New Jersey fraud lawsuit that is pending before Judge Higbee, which was brought against the company by health plans and insurance companies.Though Mr. Cona will not receive compensatory damages, he will receive $135, triple his spending on Vioxx prescriptions, as a result of the consumer fraud award.Mr. Lanier and Robert Gordon, Mr. McDarby's lawyer, said they were very pleased with the verdict, even though Mr. Cona did not receive damages.""This verdict is a victory of 100,000 Americans who had heart attacks from Vioxx,"" Mr. Gordon said. ""This is a victory for the tens of thousands of doctors who were lied to by Merck about the dangers of Vioxx.""Lawyers for both sides had viewed this trial as pivotal, because Mr. McDarby had taken Vioxx continuously for 48 months, much longer than plaintiffs in earlier trials.Merck acknowledges that Vioxx increases heart attack risks when it is taken for more than 18 consecutive months but says that the drug has not been proven to increase risk when it is used for shorter periods. Plaintiffs' lawyers and many independent scientists dispute that assertion and say that Vioxx raises the risk of heart attacks after only a few months of use.Both sides agree that plaintiffs' odds of victory increase sharply if they can prove they took Vioxx for more than 18 months. In the two lawsuits Merck has won, the plaintiffs took Vioxx for only a few weeks, and many plaintiffs' lawyers are now reluctant to bring those cases.Had Merck won this case, plaintiffs' lawyers might have wondered if the $253.5 million award that Mr. Lanier won in a Vioxx case in Texas in August was an aberration. (Texas law will automatically reduce that award, for the widow of a man who died in 2001 after taking Vioxx for seven months, to $26.1 million.)Now Merck has lost a large verdict less than 100 miles from its headquarters in Whitehouse Station, N.J.Because Mr. McDarby had diabetes, clogged arteries and formerly smoked, Christy Jones, a lawyer for Merck, argued that he might have suffered a heart attack even if he had never taken Vioxx.But jurors rejected that argument, voting 7 to 1 that Vioxx had caused his heart attack. As a result, plaintiffs' lawyers will be more willing to bring lawsuits where patients had severe risk factors, as long as they can prove they had taken the drug for at least a few months in a row, Mr. Gordon said.""Lawyers are going to go back through their files"" and look for people who had severe risk factors whom they previously rejected, he said. Jerry Kristal, another lawyer for Mr. McDarby, said the verdict showed that risk factors were Merck's ""worst defense.""NEW ORLEANS, April 5 (AP) -- A New Orleans man dropped his federal lawsuit on Wednesday that had claimed that Vioxx caused his heart attack, in part because a judge refused to delay the trial.Bonnie Zakotnik, the lawyer for Ellis Maximo Diaz, said there was no way she could go through all of the available documents from Merck, the maker of Vioxx, by June 12, when the trial was to start. She had asked Judge Eldon E. Fallon of Federal District Court in New Orleans to delay the trial until fall, but he refused.Mr. Diaz, a retired medical photographer, had taken the once-popular painkiller for 19 months before his heart attack in May 2004. Merck withdrew the drug from the market in September 2004. His case was among at least 9,600 filed against Merck, at least 4,000 of them in federal court.'"

"'06-04-07,'0','With exports more than doubling in three years and poverty dipping, the question of why Peru seems set to join the tide of countries that have tilted toward populist leaders goes to the heart of the region's recent political transformation.The new leaders are all quite different when it comes to policies; President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, for instance, has opposed market-driven policies, while Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has embraced them. But they have one thing in common: previously disenfranchised voters put them in power.After a generation of erratic fiscal performance, with the economy spiking one year and nearly collapsing the next, Peru has averaged 5 percent growth rate the last four years. Foreign investment last year was twice as high as when Mr. Toledo took office.But Peru is a young country, and while its growth has been impressive, Peru needs to register 7 percent growth a year consistently to make any real headway against poverty.""You'd never think that a vote of protest would be justified right now,"" said Fritz Du Bois, director of the Peruvian Economic Institute, a free-market policy analysis group.""But the big lesson of the appearance of this anti-system vote is that the Peruvian economy has to be much more ambitious. In a young population like we have here, if you grow 4 percent or so a year, you're just stagnant.""That fact is not lost on business owners like Mr. Chlimper, 50, the son of Eastern European immigrants. The country is clearly generating jobs, he said, including his business, called Agrokasa, and he believes that still more will come once free trade kicks in.""But the job deficit is so big that we're not persevering,"" he said. ""We had one year of 6.7 percent growth. But we need 20 years of persevering.""Many Peruvians simply cannot wait, and this is reflected in the backing given Mr. Humala, whose talk of increasing state control over the economy had helped give him a slight edge over Ms. Flores in a recent poll by Apoyo Opinión. Another poll, by CPI, shows Ms. Flores with a razor-thin lead.Either way, Ms. Flores may still win the election in the second round, polls show, but Mr. Humala is hoping disillusioned voters put him over the top in the first.""The poor have been forgotten, discriminated against, and what Humala offers is work and change,"" said Justo Paco, 55, a baker who lives in one of Peru's richest regions, Tacna, near the bustling border with Chile. ""The economic model we have now is very bad.""In an interview, Prime Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the architect of the economy, acknowledged shortcomings. But he said Peru had built a good base for future growth by putting in place other, little-noticed measures, like collecting more taxes and lowering military spending. The taxes paid by companies have risen to $2.6 billion last year from $877 million in 2001.He cautioned, however, that growth would be moderate and stable, far from fast-paced. ""In order to run, you have to learn to walk,"" Mr. Kuczynski said, explaining that extricating Peru from poverty could take a generation.With Peruvians clamoring for change, though, the candidates have offered quick fixes. Even Ms. Flores, who is known as a fiscally prudent manager, has promised growth of 7 percent a year and 650,000 new jobs annually, which economists say is unlikely to happen.In this coastal region of southern Peru, normally covered by sand as far as the eye can see, asparagus sprouts along row after row of neatly tilled and irrigated plots. Under a broiling sun, workers carefully cut the asparagus.Nine hundred employees, all wearing white lab coats, hairnets and plastic rubber boots, then clean the asparagus in special tanks, select the best stalks off a conveyer belt and pack them. The work is tough and repetitive.But for Magdalena Oviedo, 40, who has been employed here five years, it has given her new opportunities. She recently bought a house, she said. Other workers talk of how the region, benefiting from new taxes, has built roads and improved infrastructure.""People are pleased because there used to be no work,"" Ms. Oviedo said. ""People now have a way of making a life.""'"
"'06-04-07,'0','Several members of Congress, including some of the United Nations' harshest Republican critics, had joined rights groups in lobbying the Bush administration to make the United States a candidate.Although it voted against the council last month, saying that the new membership requirements still would not do enough to keep major human rights violators out, the United States had agreed to help finance the panel and pledged to support it.""This is a major retrenchment in America's long struggle to advance the cause of human rights around the world and it is a profound signal of U.S. isolation at a time when we need to work cooperatively with our Security Council partners,"" said Representative Tom Lantos of California, the top Democrat on the House International Relations Committee and a founding co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus.Mr. Lantos said the decision ""projects a picture of profound weakness in U.S. diplomacy.""Felice Gaer, director of the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights, said it was a mistake for the United States to wait for future elections to run.""All key decisions about serious reform issues, from the curtailment of inappropriate bodies to whether and how countries are scrutinized, will be made in the first year,"" she said.Countering that argument, John R. Bolton, the United States envoy, said, ""I believe rather strongly that our leverage in terms of the performance of the new council is greater by the U.S. not running and sending the signal 'this is not business as usual' this year than if we were to run.""Among the Republican critics who had counseled joining the panel were Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota, who has frequently called for Secretary General Kofi Annan to quit; Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman; and Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, who is sponsoring a bill that would withhold United States dues from the United Nations.When Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, proposed a resolution on March 31 calling for an American boycott of the new council, Representative Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey, another Republican detractor of the United Nations, put out a statement urging the resolution's defeat.Human rights groups speculated that the United States was worried that revelations of abuses of detainees in Iraq and of clandestine prisons abroad had raised fears in the Bush administration that it could not get the 96 votes in the 191-member General Assembly needed for election.""It's unfortunate that the Bush administration's disturbing human rights record means that the United States is today hardly a shoo-in for election to the council,"" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch.The new council was approved on March 15 by a 170-to-4 vote, with Israel, the Marshall Islands and Palau joining the United States in opposition. Belarus, Iran and Venezuela abstained.A Democratic member of the House International Relations Committee, Robert Wexler of Florida, singled out Mr. Bolton for isolating the United States and thwarting the United Nations human rights effort.""This decision reflects the colossal diplomatic failures of Ambassador Bolton,"" he said. ""It's a national disgrace for America that we will not be a presence in guiding and leading that council in a productive direction, and that under Mr. Bolton's leadership at the U.N., the world's single superpower cannot muster up the necessary votes to win an election.""'"
"'06-04-07,'0','The audit did not detect signs of corruption, however, even though the former schools superintendent, Angelo Petrone, departed under a cloud and is serving five years' probation after pleading guilty last September to lying to the city's inspector general during an investigation of the hiring of an inexperienced accountant for a $90,000-a-year job.Mayor Amicone appointed Mr. Badillo a week after Mr. Petrone's guilty plea. Over the next several months, auditors dug through file cabinets, pored over forms and scrutinized box after box of personnel, payroll and accounting records.What they found was a system that was hard to supervise, since it was nearly impossible for anyone to promptly obtain and share information. Further, important decisions and projects were bound to be delayed because workers gave every transaction equal weight, regardless of complexity, urgency or cost, the auditors concluded.Because the school district relies heavily on paper, about 40 percent of its operating costs pay for the time supervisors spend correcting the mistakes that inevitably show up in many of the forms they review, the audit says. Besides, policies intended to provide checks and balances are not followed, mostly because the process is too difficult.""The system needs a complete overhaul,"" Mr. Badillo said, calling for more internal controls. ""There is, of course, a lack of technology in the whole process,"" he added.Yonkers schools, which have been undercut by perennial budgetary woes, a bitter desegregation battle, cronyism and scandal, have had little opportunity to update or modernize the system.Like New York's other major cities, Yonkers finances its public schools through the city budget, not through property tax levies, and year after year there is a push and pull between parents and educators on one side and city officials on the other about how much to spend on education.This time, legislators squeezed about $60 million in aid to the Yonkers schools into next year's state budget, which still has to be approved by Gov. George E. Pataki. The money would go toward closing the city's projected $100 million deficit for the fiscal year that starts on July 1. The city budget does not include any pay raises that may be given to city teachers, who have worked for three years without a contract.It is hard to tell how much money has been wasted by the schools over the years, in part because it is unclear how many of the school district's employees were doing duplicate work or handling jobs that could have been performed with the push of a button. Auditors estimate that the Board of Education could save up to $13 million by becoming computerized. With that, a staff reduction will be inevitable, but the mayor said he hopes to achieve it through attrition rather than layoffs.The 105-page audit's recommendations include the consolidation of administrative services between the Board of Education and City Hall. The board functions independently, although its members are appointed by the mayor. Mayor Amicone has said that he wants to gain control of the schools, much as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has in New York City, but that the sharing of services can be done whether that happens or not.The schools superintendent, Bernard P. Pierorazio, appointed Joseph Pastore Jr., a professor at the Pace University Lubin School of Business, to be chairman of an advisory council to help the schools carry out the changes. Some are already in place, like a tracking system that ensures the removal of an employee's name from the district's payroll list as soon as that employee retires or leaves his job, Mr. Pierorazio said.A second audit of the Board of Education, by the state's comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, is under way.'"
"'06-04-07,'0','Lonely, plain Adelaide, who indeed possesses a small financial legacy from her late Auntie Myra, is soon subject to the full force of George's charms, which include an upper-crust accent, tales of his adventurous career in the diplomatic corps and earnest declarations like, ""I cannot tell you how much I ache to take you in my arms.""Lonely, plain Adelaide cannot resist these blandishments, and in her confusion apparently doesn't find it odd that they are being proffered within hours of her first meeting with this handsome seducer. Nor does she blanch when George suggests she bring her bank book on their honeymoon ""so we can have your account changed to Love, Mrs. Love-to-be.""But Ms. Leach and her able director, Joe Brancato, have more than an hour of stage time yet to fill, so you can be sure that George's smooth plot to swindle his guileless bride of her savings will hit a few speed bumps. Things begin to go awry when Adelaide evinces little enthusiasm for George's erotic overtures on their wedding night, preferring a nice cup of tea and a card game. He'd been more than willing to do the gentlemanly thing by performing his husbandly duties.Adelaide's nervous twitchings at George's touch signal the first of several twists sprung in ""Tryst,"" and I must do the gentlemanly thing myself by drawing a curtain over the rest of them. I might only say that with the perspective of a century of developments in the pop-psych field to draw on, Ms. Leach adds a few unexpected layers to these standard-issue characters. So much so that at times ""Tryst"" plays like an antique stage melodrama as rewritten by the self-empowerment-obsessed producers of ""Oprah.""The characters reveal new psychological nuances in rhythm with the contrivances of Ms. Leach's plot, but Ms. Campbell and Mr. Caulfield manage to make even the hairpin turns convincing. Ms. Campbell wisely retains traces of Adelaide's eager-eyed naïveté even as the character undergoes a series of emotional transformations. And Mr. Caulfield keeps us guessing about the essential nature of this apparent blackguard, so that the question that drives the play forward -- will he or won't he? -- plausibly remains unanswered until the denouement.In those last moments, Ms. Leach tosses in a final twist that felt gratuitous to me. But it's in keeping with the overall texture of the play, which happily sacrifices psychological credibility to keep the plot on the boil.By Karoline Leach; directed by Joe Brancato; sets by David Korins; costumes by Alejo Vietti; lighting by Jeff Nellis; sound by Johnna Doty; wig design by Paul Huntley; production stage manager, David H.

"'06-04-07,'0','Everyone saw it coming. First, Apple chose Intel, synonymous with Microsoft, to make chips for a new line of personal computers. Now Apple has announced Boot Camp, which will allow some versions of Windows to run more or less natively on an Apple machine. How you feel about this depends very much on whether you're a Windows or an Apple person.From one angle, Boot Camp looks like a sensible effort to expand Apple's slice of the personal computer market. So far, switching from a Windows desktop to a much sleeker iMac has meant abandoning Windows for Apple's Mac OS X operating system. That means giving up some highly specialized applications for which there is no Apple equivalent. For better or worse, Apple has never quite been able to destroy the preconception that Windows belongs to business in roughly the same way that Apple belongs to the arts. An Apple computer that can run Windows will do away with such distinctions.Apple people do love their hardware. But the soul of the machine is still the operating system. And most people who switch from Windows to Mac OS X do so not merely for the pleasure of owning Apple hardware. (An iPod would do, after all.) They switch because, so far, Apple's Unix-based operating system has been far more stable than Windows -- as clean and elegant as the product design for which Apple is noted.So the prospect of Boot Camp raises two very different scenarios. Windows users will buy Apple machines to run Windows. Or they may try out Apple's operating system just for the fun of it and get hooked.All well and good. Still, serious Apple users who are very worried about letting Microsoft into their Windows-free environment can take comfort in the fact that Apple will allow Windows into its computers, but will not actually support it. It will merely be the ghost in the machine.'"

"'06-04-07,'0','""It's like being brought up in a family where public service is highly regarded,"" said Lisa Endlich, the author of ""Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success"" (Touchstone, 2000), a history of the firm. ""Culture is too weak a word. From the moment he went to work there he was told that this is the higher calling.""As of this June, Mr. Paulson will have run the firm for eight years, a period of time that exceeds Mr. Rubin's, Mr. Friedman's and Mr. Corzine's and matches Mr. Whitehead's stint as co-chairman, which ended in 1984.But, even if Mr. Paulson forgoes a trip to Washington, his long tenure as chief executive, as well as the increased time, energy and capital he has devoted to his deep interest in environmental issues, has led to talk that, like his predecessors, he may have his eye on more public pursuits.Last week, he made a gift of $100 million in Goldman stock to a family foundation dedicated to conservation and environmental education. Even after the gift, Mr. Paulson has a net worth of more than $500 million and has said privately that he plans to give his fortune away.The donation was further proof of Mr. Paulson's unflagging devotion to a cause that generally does not rank high among Wall Street chief executives. Mr. Paulson, who shuns golf for bird-watching walks in Central Park, is the chairman of the Nature Conservancy and the chairman emeritus of the Peregrine Fund.And he has not shied away from mixing the business of Goldman with his environmental activism. Goldman Sachs is one of the few Wall Street firms that has a detailed environmental policy. Last year, the firm, at Mr. Paulson's request, donated 680,000 acres in Chile to the Wildlife Conservation Society. The move elicited a shareholder resolution from an activist group that broadly accused Mr. Paulson of putting his own personal environmental passions ahead of shareholder interests. The resolution was voted down.Driving much of the talk about Mr. Paulson and the Treasury post has been the recent appointment of Joshua B. Bolten, a former Goldman Sachs executive, to be the president's chief of staff. Mr. Bolten recruited Mr. Friedman, now a board member of Goldman, to a top job as the president's economic adviser and he has a relationship with Mr. Paulson as well.Republicans have been pushing the White House to find a more forceful public advocate to promote what they see to be the underappreciated strengths of the American economy: low unemployment, robust economic growth and a resilient stock market. And while Mr. Snow has done his best, the feeling is that a Wall Street executive with better communication skills might be in a better position to make the case that the economy and the financial markets can continue to thrive despite growing federal budget and trade deficits.While Mr. Paulson's status as the dean of Wall Street chief executives makes him an obvious candidate, White House officials are also interested in attracting a black chief executive, according to a person who has been briefed on the administration's plans. This person said that Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of Time Warner, has already been approached, unsuccessfully, and that other prominent executives like E. Stanley O'Neal, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, and Kenneth I. Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, are also high on the administration's wish list. Mr. O'Neal was approached for the job in 2004, but has made clear his intent to remain with Merrill Lynch.Mr. Paulson, who is recognized for his relentless courting of corporate clients, has an infectious ardor and a web of influential ties in important areas like China, India and Europe that could make him an effective salesman for the administration's trade policies. A committed Republican and prominent fund-raiser for the president during the 2004 campaign, Mr. Paulson has a love of the outdoors that recalls Theodore Roosevelt, although in his case one would substitute binoculars for an elephant gun.But in an administration that largely sets economic policy within the White House and then expects cabinet members to toe the line, Mr. Paulson's independence might remind some of Paul H. O'Neill, the president's first Treasury secretary, who frequently clashed with the administration. A Christian Scientist who does not drink or smoke, Mr. Paulson is also known to have a streak of rectitude that sometimes bemuses his peers on Wall Street.In 2002, at the peak of the wave of corporate scandals, Mr. Paulson gave a speech calling for governance and accounting reforms as well as fresh attention to avoiding conflicts of interest.More than anything though, Mr. Paulson may be reluctant to take on a Treasury Department job that in comparison to the stature it commanded during Mr. Rubin's time under President Clinton, carries much less punch in the present administration. He would also be leaving what many consider to be the best job on Wall Street.Goldman's stock closed yesterday at $162.04, just pennies off its record high. The firm's model of offering blue-chip advice while also making aggressive bets with its own capital has become the envy of the financial industry.'"

In exchange, it will surrender a small but crucial section of gas pipeline to Russia.Armenia will pay $110 for each 1,000 cubic meters of gas, about half the European average but twice what the country pays now, the Russian monopoly Gazprom said in a statement on Thursday.Gazprom in turn will buy a 24-mile section of pipe connecting Armenia to Iran, which other than Russia is the only plausible source of energy supplies in the region. Also under the deal Gazprom, through a joint venture, was granted a concession to build a larger second pipeline along this route.In financial terms, the deal is considered small by the usual standards of the huge Gazprom, but it could have strategic importance as the company seeks to maintain its dominance in Eurasian natural gas trading. The gas sales are expected to bring some $187 million annually.The pipeline route from Iran through Armenia that Gazprom now controls with its 24-mile section has been discussed by energy analysts as a possible export corridor for Iranian gas to Europe.'"
"'06-04-07,'0','ATLANTIC CITY, April 6 - Lanier v. Gilmartin turned out to be more fizzle than sizzle.The punitive damages phase of the fourth Vioxx case began Thursday with testimony from Raymond V. Gilmartin, the former chief executive of Merck, who faced the plaintiff's lawyer, W. Mark Lanier.Mr. Gilmartin took the stand the day after the jury in this seaside casino town awarded $4.5 million to John McDarby, a 77-year-old who had a heart attack in 2004 after taking Vioxx for four years, and his wife.But Mr. Gilmartin seemed relatively unfazed after a day of difficult questions from Mr. Lanier, who was co-lead counsel for Mr. McDarby and who in August won an even larger verdict against Merck in the first Vioxx personal injury case.Thursday was the first time that Mr. Gilmartin had testified before a jury in a Vioxx case, although he has previously had his deposition taken under oath.The testimony came as part of a hearing to determine whether Mr. McDarby and his wife will receive punitive damages in addition to the award they won on Wednesday.

Every once in a while, goalie Cory Schneider makes York even more nervous whenever he head-mans the puck to a teammate.""It's something that's got me in trouble a little bit this year,"" Schneider said with a smile.A gamble by Schneider in the final seconds of the second period set up a key power-play goal as Boston College went on to defeat North Dakota, 6-5, Thursday in an N.C.A.A. Frozen Four semifinal game at the Bradley Center. The Eagles (26-12-3) advanced to the championship game for the first time since 2001. On Saturday night, they will meet Wisconsin, which defeated Maine, 5-2.With Boston College leading, 4-2, and North Dakota changing defensemen while trying to kill a penalty, Schneider flipped a pass to Benn Ferriero just short of the Fighting Sioux's blue line. Ferriero slid the puck to the middle to a streaking Chris Collins, who had just jumped onto the ice.North Dakota goalie Jordan Parise had no chance on Collins's shot with 22.7 seconds left in the period. It was the third goal for Collins, a finalist for the Hobey Baker award, which goes to the college hockey player of the year.York, who had surgery last summer for prostate cancer, turned red afterward as Schneider recounted the play and York's season-long concern about such gambles.'"
"'06-04-08,'0','The decision gives Mr. Cox the opportunity to reopen the proceedings and consider whether those rules or others should be adopted to address the conflicts of interest and manipulative trading practices exposed by the mutual fund scandals. In the process, Mr. Cox will also have to decide whether to side with the two dissenting Republicans, or to follow his predecessor and one of the Democrats who voted for the rule, Roel C. Campos, who remains on the commission. A fifth member of the commission, Annette L. Nazareth, was not a commissioner when the rules were adopted.Officials said they expected that Mr. Cox, who previously served as a member of Congress, would try to fashion a compromise that satisfies a bipartisan group of commissioners, as he did earlier this year when the agency issued guidelines on when it would seek to impose corporate fines.While some large fund providers, like Fidelity, have criticized the rules, and they have not been put into effect because of the legal challenges, the rules have already been voluntarily adopted by many funds. At the time the rules were first suggested in 2004, some 80 percent of the nation's fund companies had chairmen who were also senior executives.Mr. Cox issued a carefully worded statement that did not disclose his views on the underlying rules or what plans he had regarding them.""The commission will comply with the court's decision in every respect,"" the statement said. ""We take seriously our responsibility to subject all of the commission's proposed rules to public notice and comment.""""I am confident that the result of the process that the court has prescribed will be final mutual fund governance rules that protect the interests of the funds and the fund shareholders they serve.""Each side of the debate urged Mr. Cox to adopt its position.""If Cox wants to side with investors and improve the governance of funds and reduce readily apparent conflicts, he will have the commission review the rules a last time,"" said Lynn E. Turner, the managing director of research at Glass Lewis and a former chief accountant at the commission who supported the changes. ""If he wants to side with those who charge the investors fees for running the mutual funds, he will not.""Eugene Scalia, a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who represents the Chamber of Commerce, hoped ""the commission will accept the court's judgment and move on to other important items on its agenda.""The decision in the case, Chamber of Commerce v. Securities and Exchange Commission, was the second time that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had ruled that the commission failed to comply with administrative procedure in adopting the two mutual fund rules. The rules were issued in response to disclosures of manipulative trading, improper fees and illegal payments, and large mutual funds, including some run by Bank of America and Putnam, were forced to settle lawsuits brought by investors and regulators.In June 2005, shortly before Mr. Donaldson's departure from the agency, the court sent the rules back to the commission for similar reasons.Then, a day before Mr. Donaldson left, the commission voted 3 to 2 to reissue the same rules after deciding it was unnecessary to reopen the rule- making record for further comment. The commission justified its decision by noting that estimates of the cost of compliance were publicly available and, while imprecise, suggested that they would be minimal. It also defended its swift action by noting that since the agency's membership was about to change, further deliberations would delay the imposition of rules that were needed to redress ""a serious breakdown in management controls.""The court said that the commission should have explained the basis for its cost estimates and given groups opposing the rules like the chamber a chance to comment about them.The opinion was written by Judge Judith W. Rogers and joined by Judges Karen Lecraft Henderson and Janice Rogers Brown.'"
"'06-04-08,'0','Analysts warn that gasoline prices could jump further when the driving season begins. Yet there have been no shortages or hurricanes to blame for the high cost of fuel this year. Now, strong demand, limited growth in supplies and instability in some of the leading oil-producing nations are all contributing to more volatile oil markets, therefore higher gasoline prices.Americans are increasingly facing the fact that inexpensive gasoline, like airline meals, has become a thing of the past. ""Motorists need to prepare themselves for the possibility that gasoline will continue to go up each year,"" said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for the national office of AAA in Heathrow, Fla. ""There will be peaks and valleys, but prices will keep going up.""A. J. Teixeira, who works as an information technology specialist for the World Bank in Washington, says that since Hurricane Katrina drove up gas prices, he cut down on his family's twice-a-month weekends at their Ocean City, Md., beach house, and now does the 300-mile round trips only once a month. If gasoline prices rise more -- as he expects they will -- Mr. Teixeira might make minor adjustments to his routine, including carpooling when taking his two children to school or cutting down on trips to the mall.""I struggle to adjust to the reality of higher prices,"" Mr. Teixeira said. ""Our lifestyle is designed around the car and cheap gasoline. There's very little we can do about it to reduce our dependency on our automobiles -- between the schools, the children's activities, the soccer practice, and the rest, nothing is within walking distance anymore.""Unsurprisingly, the volatility of crude oil, which has doubled in price over the last two years, is the primary driver of gasoline prices. Oil accounts for about 60 percent of the price of gasoline -- the rest is broken down among taxes, 20 percent, and then refining and marketing costs, which remain fairly constant. Yesterday, oil futures in New York traded at $67.39 a barrel.After Hurricane Katrina, gasoline prices briefly increased above an average $3 a gallon nationally when refineries along the Gulf Coast were shut down. That brought prices, once adjusted for inflation, above records reached during the oil shocks of the late 1970's and early 1980's. There were even short-lived gasoline lines as supplies failed to reach consumers.To be sure, producers are starting to make the huge investments that will eventually increase the world's production, but that process will take years to complete. Meanwhile, there is very little extra oil to put on the market to damp prices.With such a tenuous -- and unstable -- system, there is not much margin for error, said Jan Stuart, an economist at UBS in New York.""The big wild card this year is that there's little to no room for anything to go wrong,"" Mr. Stuart said, ""and certainly nothing like a refinery blowing up or a hurricane hitting the coast.""Still, the biggest surprise so far is that high prices seem to have had little impact on driving habits. Gasoline demand, which averaged 9.1 million barrels a day last month, remains very strong; in fact, it is up by 2 percent since January 2004 when oil prices began to rise. Analysts are puzzled.""The real question is, What will consumers do?"" said John Felmy, the chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group. ""That's a key part of the equation.""In Washington, the prospect of high energy prices during an election year has spurred Congress into action. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee introduced a bill aimed at increasing competition in the oil and gas industry and strengthening antitrust regulations.While demand remains robust, there have also been mounting concerns about gasoline supplies, especially this summer.Indeed, refiners have been hard pressed to catch up with rising demand. While refining capacity has increased in recent years, it has been outpaced by the growth in consumption. The domestic capacity is around 17 million barrels of oil a day, but the country consumes some 20.5 million barrels of oil products a day, nearly half of that as gasoline.To make up the difference, the nation has grown increasingly dependent on imports of a wide range of petroleum products, chief among them gasoline. For example, gasoline imports reached one million barrels a day last year, or nearly 11 percent of the country's daily needs.Faced with strong public and political pressure, refiners announced in recent months plans to increase the country's total capacity by about 1.4 million barrels by 2010, according to Bob Slaughter, the head of the refiners' trade group.""This year presents the refining industry with several significant challenges,"" Mr. Slaughter said. ""But we are experts at trying to make the whole supply system work.""Still, he added, ""In any scenario, the imports are going to continue going up.""The problem is that some imports from European or Caribbean refiners might not be available much longer as the United States tightens it environmental regulations. This year for example, refiners must start producing ultra-low-sulfur diesel that meets standards much more stringent than those in Europe.""Will foreign refiners step up and meet this increased demand from the United States? That's really uncertain now,"" said Mr. Felmy of the petroleum institute.Also, many analysts have voiced concerns about the industry's move to abandon a popular but highly controversial additive to gasoline, called methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE, and replace it with ethanol by May. The Energy Department issued a stark report in February that warned of a possible shortfall of 130,000 barrels a day, which ethanol producers might not be able to fill. The Senate also held hearings late last month to warn refiners about potential shortages this summer.Consumers seemed somewhat resigned to paying more for gasoline.""I understand it's a matter of supply and demand and there is now more competition for energy resources around the world,"" said Roger Smith, a 40-year-old senior software engineer with Apple Computer in Cupertino, Calif. ""Whoever's willing to pay the higher price is going to gain access. But there is always that straw that will break the camel's back and cause people to change their driving habit.""""If gasoline reached $4,"" Mr. Smith said, ""I'd think twice about driving to the supermarket to buy milk.""'"
"'06-04-08,'0','He has since started 19 other Web sites, among them infomercialscams.com and infomercialratings.com, that give consumers a chance to vent or to praise the products they bought.The Wind Storm vacuum cleaner has been under attack by customers, who post anonymously. For instance, ""Cynthia,"" who said she paid $282 for four machines, recently wrote in: ""It is now March 2006. After numerous weekly calls to the 800 number on my bank statement, I have still not received the vacuums or a refund that was requested in January 2006. I feel so used and abused.""A spokeswoman for Igia, which sells the Wind Storm, said that it had improved customer service in recent months and that it had resolved about 95 percent of disputes.Reading the postings can be an eye-opener if only because they alert you to problems besides product quality. In many instances, the refusal to make refunds or the imposition of high shipping costs is as much a concern.Mr. Leonard has bills to pay to keep the sites going, including programmers in India who process consumer comments and pictures of infomercial products. So, he does something that would make the staff at Consumer Reports cringe: Mr. Leonard links to merchants who sell the products, whether they are overwhelmingly panned by his readers or given glowing reviews. He is paid a commission, averaging about 15 percent, on every sale he generates.Mr. Leonard, a 28-year-old Arizona State University graduate student, said he was sued once by a manufacturer because of negative comments about a product, so he removed the offending comments from the site. ""That shows you how much money I don't have,"" he said. ""I didn't want to risk it.""Stephen Barrett, a retired psychiatrist in Allentown, Pa., who has been chronicling medical frauds since the 1960's, has pretty explicit advice for consumers about infomercials making medical claims. ""They should ignore all of them.""But he isn't too hopeful his advice at Quackwatch.org does much good. ""People think that if it is not true it wouldn't be allowed to be advertised,"" said Dr. Barrett, who is 73. ""There seems to be new things everyday,"" he said.He thinks the worst infomercials he's seen are the ones by Lorraine Day, an orthopedic surgeon who says she reversed her cancer using ""natural therapies."" She sells two videos for $29.95, ""Cancer Doesn't Scare Me Anymore"" and ""More on Cancer,"" promising to outline a diet that can cure cancer, as well as prevent mad cow disease and attention deficit disorder. Her Web site lists many more books and videos, including the latest, a way to reverse vision problems without surgery, for $21.95.She claims bird flu is a hoax and warns her critics with Biblical injunctions.""It's the most dangerous one I have seen to date,"" said Dr. Barrett, who analyzes one of her infomercials at www.infomercialwatch.org/tranday.shtml. ""It resonates with people who are scared.""John T. Reed also gets that Sisyphian feeling. He started tracking get-rich-quick gurus back in 1986, but today his Web site, www.johntreed.com/Reedgururating.html, lists 125 names, more than ever. He recommends only 25 of them. The most frequently seen gurus -- John Beck, Carleton Sheets, Russ Whitney and Robert Kiyosaki -- aren't among that select group. Mr. Reed sells his own books on real estate investing on the Web site, but he says he isn't competing with them in what is their real line of work, the seminar business.Most of this segment of the industry uses infomercials to lure people to free seminars where they are pitched training courses that cost money, naturally. After all these years, he still marvels at the contradictory psychology used. ""They tell you it's not your fault you are a failure; then they tell you it's within your power to fix it,"" said Mr. Reed, who is labeled a ""dream stealer"" by the seminar holders. ""But then if you fail, it's because you didn't try hard enough."" And you need to take another course to get it right.His site also includes a list of 50 techniques that are a tip-off that a wealth-creation guru is thinking only about his own wealth creation. For instance, Mr. Reed says that testimonials that identify the speaker with only an initial for a last name is a bad sign. So is an emphasis in the infomercial on the guru's luxurious lifestyle, his religiousness or his use of the words sure-fire, foolproof or risk-free.Why do infomercials work? ""People do respond to the hard sell,"" said Timothy R. Hawthorne, chief executive of Hawthorne Direct, one of the largest producers of infomercials, with clients that include Nissan Motor and Apple Computer as well as Ronco and Ginsu. He said the classic boardwalk spiel was adaptable to all brands.""Traditional direct response TV is like a carnie sideshow,"" Mr. Hawthorne tells his clients. The infomercial tries to sidetrack an audience and pull them into the pitch. ""People like to be sold.""The first thing infomercials have going for them is a self-selected audience. If you didn't have a bald spot, a spare tire, or the desire to get rich with no work, you wouldn't be watching. Half of the infomercial audience has a college education and the average household income is almost $67,000. The best part for the marketers: there is a class of infomercial watchers. Two-thirds make multiple purchases and spend an average of about $260 a year.If you feel silly because you bought that Tae Bo video, remember that Americans forked over $600 million during the 18 months its commercials ran on television. Carleton Sheets, who advertises a system for buying real estate, has garnered revenue of $2 billion over the last 18 years, according to figures from Hawthorne Direct.We'll never be able to stop you from falling for an infomercial. But as you feel yourself about to get sucked in, try to remember what to watch out for.Repetition isn't annoying, it is crucial. Repeating ""set it and forget it,"" as Ron Popeil does for his Showtime Rotisserie Oven throughout the show gives the customer time to justify the buying decision. Infomercial fans, by the way, watch the average hard-sell infomercial for about 15 minutes, Mr. Hawthorne said, and they hang on to a ""storymercial,"" a fictional tale set around a real product, for almost the entire length of the infomercial.Mr. Hawthorne said the successful infomercial shows a ""magical transformation."" Whether it is the balding guy whose hair gets thicker after just one application of Procede or the guy with no college education standing next to a Jaguar, people want to know their lives will be changed.Testimonials are important, but they don't necessarily have to come from celebrities. Mr. Hawthorne's research found that only about 1 percent of infomercial watchers are drawn in by a well-known face. Just as you probably suspected, infomercials don't use real people. They hire little-known actors who use the product and then record their reactions.Most of all, audiences are drawn to product demonstration, so action is critical. People want to see the peeled egg erupting from the Eggstractor or the Nad's gel deforest the back of a hairy guy.Setting the right price is critical. It has to look like a bargain, even though infomercial products have to have fat profit margins to cover the cost of telemarketing and fulfillment. The infomercial maker does a lot of testing to measure the impact of dropping the price, adding more things to the offer, or making it seem like the offer is good for only a limited time.Mr. Hawthorne's research found that even slight changes in an offer create a disproportionate response. Evinrude, a Hawthorne's client, offered a $1,000-off coupon on its E-TEC outboard motors and retail sales jumped 175 percent.Infomercial marketers are being pinched by higher media rates as well as a fragmenting audience. The ""one-step"" marketers, the companies that say ""call now"" are finding it tougher to create a hit. While rates in a minor market like Ottumwa, Iowa, are about $150 for a half-hour in late night, it can cost $50,000 to get a half- hour on CNBC on a Sunday morning.But the two-step companies, those using infomercials to generate leads, are growing, mainly because larger companies like Bank of America and Sharp Electronics are discovering that the infomercial can cut through clutter. Mr. Hawthorne said he saw more financial services, insurance and car companies using infomercials, which can cost as much as $750,000 to produce, though most are less than half that. He tells these big companies that with an infomercial they ""can take some quality time to explain product benefits and features instead of using sex, humor, and flash to brand a product.""The biggest problem remains that people are suspicious of infomercials. ""Every time there is a bogus product out there, and it happens every year, a lot of us in the industry cringe,"" Mr. Hawthorne said. ""Buyer beware every time you see an infomercial.""'"
"'06-04-08,'0','With final decisions on schools expected on April 24, by yesterday evening, 12 of 14 schools on the closing list had met with Catholic officials to plead their case, along with two others that have been recommended to merge. One more endangered school will meet with officials next week.Only one school, St. Catherine of Genoa in Harlem, has chosen not to appeal.Other schools, like St. Martin of Tours in the Bronx and St. Paul in Staten Island, held rallies and prayer vigils this week.Mrs. George said she knew as soon as she got the news that she would fight for the sake of her students and her community. More than 90 percent of the school's students are Hispanic, she said, most of them residents of low-income housing projects in the neighborhood.""This school was built by immigrants,"" she said. ""And it's here for them.""This was also personal for Mrs. George. Her grandparents, immigrants from Italy, were married at Our Lady of Sorrows Church, as were her parents. Her mother attended the school. Mrs. George graduated from the school in 1969. She started teaching there a decade later, after college.""This is not only a school to me,"" she said. ""This is part of my life.""At a meeting at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers last week, archdiocesan officials distributed appeal forms to principals. They were told to detail their enrollment, budget, unpaid bills, five reasons the school should remain open and how the closing of the school would affect the parish and community.Mrs. George and the Rev. Ed Conway, a Capuchin priest who is the pastor of Our Lady of Sorrows, concluded that they needed to present hard facts to archdiocesan officials, not emotional pleas.""At this point, letters, petitions, they don't mean anything to anybody,"" Mrs. George said. ""They just want to see the numbers improve.""On the surface, after years of dwindling enrollment, the situation at Our Lady of Sorrows appears grim. The school managed to stay above 200 -- considered by many Catholic school officials to be the magic number for survival -- until the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.""After the World Trade Center hit, enrollment started to drop,"" Mrs. George said. ""People moved out of the city.""The school now needs more than $275,000 a year from the archdiocese to stay afloat. The problem, said Edison Martinez, a teacher and former student at the school, is that many in the neighborhood who want to send their children cannot afford the tuition, which is $2,800 a year for parish members and $3,250 a year for those who are not.""If we had 100 scholarships,"" he said, ""we'd have 100 more students.""After getting the news last week, Father Conway and Mrs. George called an emergency meeting for parents and community members and urged them to register their children for next year right away.In less than a week, they got almost all of their returning students to reregister and lined up 32 new students from the neighborhood. That should put them well on their way, they said, to getting more than 200 students next year.Since the archdiocese has put so much emphasis on changing demographics in its decisions, Mrs. George asked two teachers, Mr. Martinez and Justin Rivers, an English teacher, to research the makeup of the school neighborhood.Although there has been much talk of gentrification of the Lower East Side, they found that 60 percent of the neighborhood around the school was still populated by low-income Hispanics. Many of them are Catholic, they said, precisely the kind of people the church wants to reach.""What I'm saying is, the children are there,"" Mrs. George said.But, according to census data, the number of Hispanics in the area also declined by about 15 percent from 1990 to 2000.At a meeting in the church rectory on Wednesday, Mrs. George, Father Conway, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Rivers and Donna Kresel, a longtime teacher, plotted their strategy for the presentation.Mr. Rivers went over the five reasons the group would cite for staying open. They included positive trends in enrollment, the fact the school draws most of its students from the neighborhood, improvements in standardized test scores and the school's strong Catholic identity.Mrs. Kresel read from a page-long essay she had written on the school's role in the community that she proposed they use as a closing statement. Toward the end, however, she choked up and was unable to finish.Later, she asked the others if they thought the statement was too emotional. They decided Mrs. Kresel's statement should be stapled to the appeal form as an appendix.On Thursday, a small group met at 8:30 a.m. at the school to head to the meeting together.Father Conway started them out in their presentation by reading the school's mission statement as a prayer. He told the archdiocesan staff that this was a prayer his faculty lived every day.Then Mrs. George dove into their presentation, going over the graphs and charts they had distributed beforehand. Mr. Martinez explained a satellite map he had printed out from the Internet, highlighting the low-income housing projects around the school. Mrs. Kresel read her closing statement, choking up only a little, she said later.Afterward, they gathered at an Irish pub down the street to eat lunch. Laura Shanahan, a former principal at the school, wondered whether they had had sufficiently impressed upon the committee the passion of the parents. Still, she noted that the officials had said their presentation was compelling.In the end, they raised their glasses in a toast. ""To September,"" Father Conway said.'"
"'06-04-08,'0','Charleston, S.C. - HELL froze over this week as Apple Computer unveiled Boot Camp, a free program that will allow its new Macintosh computers with Intel microprocessors to run Microsoft's Windows XP operating system as an alternative to Apple's OS X. The news media were agog and Apple's stock price zoomed at the announcement. In my view, it was mildly interesting, but hardly the revolution Apple users want to see.Many Mac enthusiasts view Boot Camp as a huge coup for Apple that will eventually take the computer hardware leadership away from Dell and the software leadership away from Microsoft. The more skeptical warn that Boot Camp shows the final mastery of the Apple platform by Microsoft. Both positions are absurd.Boot Camp, itself, is unexciting. So now you can start your computer running Windows or OS X -- big deal. You can't run Windows and OS X simultaneously, so you can't cut and paste data between the two operating systems or even get access to the same data. For that you'd need a version of the program Virtual PC -- a Microsoft product -- redesigned to run on the Intel Mac platform. (Or, I guess, you could use a program called Parallel Workstation that allows users to run OS X, Windows the Linux operating system on the same Intel Mac at the same time, madly cutting and pasting between all three. Now that's exciting.)The real reason people are in a tizzy about this news is that Mac users love their computers and Windows users, for the most part, tolerate theirs. So the Mac people think that this Apple software will demonstrate the inherent superiority of the product they love and will result in lots of Mac hardware sales to people who want to continue to use Windows. I don't think so.It's just too darned hard, for one thing. A Windows PC user would have to buy a Mac, buy Windows XP, download Boot Camp, then load everything -- with the result that he had a Mac that costs a lot and doesn't run as well as it would using the traditional Apple software. The PC market is such that few people are likely to buy Macs just to run Windows, especially since it will cost $140 for a copy of Windows XP and Apple's machines are far more expensive than, say, Dell's.'"
"'06-04-08,'0','The seminary's longtime chancellor, Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, who was seen as reluctant to change Conservative Judaism's position on homosexuals, announced last June that he would step down at the end of the school year, but the search for his successor has dragged on for months. On Tuesday, the seminary's 18-member search committee voted to select Dr. Eisen as the new chancellor.Conservative Judaism, which was once the largest movement in American Judaism, has been in the throes of an identity crisis. Reform Jews have surpassed Conservatives as the largest Jewish movement in the country, religion experts say, and Conservative leaders have been striving to find a balance between those who advocate more rigorous observance and those who want to liberalize worship and permit, for example, more participation by women and homosexuals.Unlike some of the candidates who had been rumored to be under consideration, however, Dr. Eisen's views on social issues are largely unknown because he has not spoken out on them.""We don't know anything about his politics,"" said Daniel Stern, a rabbinical student at the seminary and a leader of Keshet, a gay rights group there.Rabbi Gordon Tucker of Temple Israel Center in White Plains, N.Y., who was widely believed to be another candidate for the position, has been outspoken on lifting prohibitions on homosexuality. Rabbi Tucker did not return calls yesterday to his home and office.J. J. Goldberg, the editor of The Forward, said that Dr. Eisen in his public speeches has advocated ""taking the social liberalism that's common in the Jewish community and tying it closer to the religious roots of Judaism and bringing the two threads together.""Jonathan D. Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, said Dr. Eisen's selection would be a bold stroke by the search committee.""The problem that the seminary faced was all of the known candidates, the ones spoken about broadly, were on one side or another,"" he said. Dr. Eisen's reputation as an intellectual and an expert on contemporary Judaism, Dr. Sarna said, would draw supporters across the theological spectrum and push the movement away from the infighting over Jewish law that has dogged it in recent years.""I would be willing to bet that his presidency will not be characterized by debates on these kinds of issues,"" he said, ""but to try and reshape the debate to larger issues about what it means to be a Jew in America and to be a Jew in a post-modern world.""Correction: April 13, 2006, Thursday An article on Saturday about the expected selection of Arnold Eisen, a Stanford University professor, as chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York misstated the surname of a leader of Keshet, a gay rights group at the seminary that has been pressing leaders of Conservative Judaism to become more accommodating to gay people. He is Daniel Klein, not Stern.'"
"'06-04-08,'0','The giant engineering companies that will be phased out of the work -- Shaw, Bechtel, CH2M Hill, and Fluor -- have made a considerable amount from hurricane-related work performed to date, ranging from $237 million for CH2M Hill to $875 million, for Fluor.Some of the companies appear to have experience in related fields. They include MLU Services of Athens, Ga., which does disaster cleanup work, and Crown Roofing of Kenner, La.. Both companies have already done government work related to last year's hurricanes. LEC-CMS of Plano, Tex., another bid winner, is an engineering and project management firm.""It is a big job, but not that big of a job,"" said Ray Palmer, an executives at Crown Roofing, which has about 150 employees.MLU Services is run by executives who have contributed to Republicans that include President Bush. The president of that company, which has about 100 employees and does disaster cleanup work, Marcia L. Ulm, and her relatives have donated a total of $165,371 to Republican committees and candidates across the country, campaign finance records show.Mr. Walker said that before each new contract was awarded, FEMA examined the finances and past work of each applicant. Of the 36 winning bidders, 28 are based in Gulf Coast states, the agency said.The companies will be given work in increments, allowing FEMA, if necessary, to terminate an agreement if a company cannot honor its commitments. What is clear for most of the winning bidders is that this is by far the biggest contract they have ever received, and in some cases, the first work they have ever landed with the federal government.In many cases, as with Davis Professional Accounting Services of New Orleans, a small financial services company, the winning bidders will hire subcontractors or work with partners to allow them to increase their staff quickly. Davis Professional, like several of the winning bidders, is run by a black woman. Others are run by Hispanics or American Indians, among other minorities.Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, who criticized FEMA's reliance on large out-of-state corporations for most of the initial work, praised the changes.""FEMA is finally doing the right thing, or is at least on the right track to doing the right thing,"" Mr. Thompson said. ""Cleaning up and rebuilding the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will take several more years and billions more dollars. It requires the vested interest and passion found in area businesses with an interest in recovery.""'"
"'06-04-08,'0','The shell game that political professionals play with the campaign laws has taken an encouraging hit in the House. Enough Democrats joined Republicans to pass a bill to plug the egregious soft money loophole used in 2004 to flood the presidential campaign with hundreds of millions of dollars in attack ads and voter drives. These were palmed off as independent advocacy under Section 527 of the tax code. In truth, they were shadow party schemes.In 2004, Democrats suffered the so-called 527 attack ads on Senator John Kerry by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Republicans, in turn, were stunned by George Soros's donation of $24 million to Democratic causes. The House measure would deprive these 527 operations of unlimited financing by treating them as what they are -- political action committees that must comply with campaign controls.In the vagaries of politics, voters were fortunate that Democrats have enjoyed such a lopsided 3-to-1 money edge in the 527 ploys that House Republicans felt alarmed enough to take action. Otherwise both parties might have been content to keep feeding at a soft-money trough that has already produced $425 million in unchecked campaign money.The bill, sponsored by Representatives Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, and Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, presents a rare step toward reform by this Congress. It deserves fast approval in the Senate.'"

"'06-04-08,'0','The details of Ms. Blue's case are complex. But from interviews with doctors, patients, drug makers and charitable foundations, it is evident that Part D has posed new complications for at least 10,000 Medicare patients who had been getting free cancer medicines directly from manufacturers, or, in some cases, through special programs run by insurance companies.The drugs include Gleevec, for stomach cancer; Thalomid, for multiple myeloma; and Tarceva. They are all taken orally in pill form, rather than given by injection like most cancer medicines. Medicare has always covered injectable drugs given in hospitals or doctors' officers, but it generally did not cover oral medicines until Part D began on Jan. 1.Because the oral cancer drugs cost up to $4,000 a month, more than most people without coverage can afford, many Medicare patients received them free through charity programs from the drugs' manufacturers. Or, like Ms. Blue, they received them through extended Medicare policies provided by private insurers that charged minimal co-payments.But now that the oral cancer drugs are covered by Part D, they are bound by rules requiring Medicare enrollees to pay $3,600 in out-of-pocket costs each year.As the year continues, that proviso could put financial pressure on millions of Medicare patients. But it is already hitting hard at patients who take cancer pills, among the most expensive of the medicines covered by the new program. Patients taking these drugs often must meet their entire annual co-payment requirement when they fill their first two prescriptions -- a daunting prospect for retirees with limited savings and incomes.And in many cases, added pressure is coming from drug makers that have begun restricting their charitable free-drug programs and encouraging -- or in some cases, forcing -- patients to enroll in Part D coverage.Last year, about 4,500 patients in the United States received Gleevec free from its maker, Novartis. Not all of those people are eligible for Medicare. But Debra Freire, the company's director of patient assistance programs, said Novartis wanted all patients eligible for Part D to switch to Medicare. Novartis has not set a deadline for the switch.Medicare Part D, Ms. Friere said, is ""a wonderful opportunity for patients to gain access to a program that might provide them with prescription coverage that they might not have had.""Steven Hahn, a spokesman for AARP, the lobbying group for older Americans, said that once patients work through the upfront co-payments, sometimes called the doughnut hole, Part D provides excellent coverage for cancer drugs. But the high initial cost can be frightening, he said.""AARP would like to see the elimination of the doughnut hole altogether,"" he said.Leslie V. Norwalk, a deputy administrator for Medicare, acknowledged that some cancer patients were struggling with the transition to Part D. But over all, she said, the program has worked well for millions of people, offering new benefits for patients who might not have qualified for drug-maker assistance programs.In addition, low- and middle-income people can get co-pay relief, Ms. Norwalk said. For patients making less than about $15,000 a year, the co-pay requirements are lower, and for those making less than $40,000 some charities offer co-payment assistance.""There are terrific options for every beneficiary,"" she said.No firm statistics exist for how many cancer patients are being moved from free drug programs to Part D. But the number appears to be between 10,000 and 20,000, according to the drug makers and the charities that run co-payment programs.Since Jan. 1, for example, more than 5,000 people have applied for help with co-payments from the HealthWell Foundation, a Maryland charity that provides co-pay assistance, according to Krista Zodet, the foundation's director. Most of these people are in Part D, she said.Some patients without co-pay relief feel compelled to decline Part D coverage so they can continue to participate in drug-maker charity programs.For example, Maye Navarre, a 79-year-old retiree in Hertford, N.C., said she had been receiving free Tarceva from Genentech, its maker, until she signed up for a Part D program through Blue Cross in February. When she visited her pharmacy in early March to fill her Tarceva prescription, she learned the drug would cost her $1,425, not the $25 her insurance agent had told her to expect.Ms. Navarre says her only income is $932 a month in Social Security, and her savings total $4,000 in a money market account.""I said, 'O.K., pull the plug on me right there,' "" Ms. Navarre said.Ms. Navarre's income is low enough that she should qualify for a federal subsidy that would essentially eliminate her co-pay requirement. It is not clear why she was told her co-pay was so high. The insurance agent who arranged her Blue Cross coverage, David Parker, did not return calls for comment.In any case, Ms. Navarre said she had canceled her Part D enrollment so that she could again get Tarceva free from Genentech. In mid-March, in response to her pleas, Genentech shipped her another month of Tarceva free, so she is not out of medicine, she said.But Genentech warned her that the shipment would be her final free prescription until Blue Cross and Medicare processed her cancellation, she said.""So there I am, in limbo,"" Ms. Navarre said. ""They did send me a free month's supply, but they said that would be all. I got it on the 14th, so I have until the 13th of next month.""Genentech provides free medicines to people who do not have insurance and earn less than $75,000 annually, according to Walter K. Moore, the company's vice president for government affairs. In 2005, the company provided $200 million in free medicines to 18,000 patients and donated $21 million to co-pay assistance programs, he said.Unlike many drug makers, Genentech has not required Medicare patients in its free-drugs program to enroll in Part D. But once patients join Part D, Genentech bars them from participating in the company-run program, because it does not want to run afoul of Medicare's complex rules that cover patients who are enrolled in Part D but are also getting free drugs from manufacturers.Genentech is aware that some cancer patients in Part D are having problems affording their co-payments or filling prescriptions, Mr. Moore said. ""We understand that our drug has a significant co-pay, and we're trying to do something about it,"" he said. ""It's incumbent upon all of us that are trying to serve these patients to be vigilant and try to seek out ways to be certain that nobody falls through the cracks.""Still, patients like Ms. Blue seem to be slipping.Ms. Blue, who lives in a tidy brick house in Yeadon, a suburb a few miles southwest of Philadelphia, was told she had cancer in her left lung five years ago. Doctors removed the tumor, but the disease returned to her right lung in 2002. Despite chemotherapy, the cancer continued to spread slowly through her lungs, leaving a grim prognosis.In May 2004, she began taking Iressa, a drug from AstraZeneca. Since then, her cancer has remained relatively in check. She received the drug without co-payments through a supplemental Medicare policy offered by Independence Blue Cross. Although she is under 65 -- age 59 -- she is eligible for Medicare because her cancer has left her unable to work.In December 2005, her oncologist, Dr. Stephen Shore, decided to switch her from Iressa to Tarceva. Two clinical trials had cast doubt on Iressa's effectiveness.""All the indications were showing that the Iressa wasn't working, that she wasn't getting any benefit from it,"" Dr. Shore said. But in January, Ms. Blue learned her first Tarceva prescription would cost $2,800 -- not because she had switched drugs, but because of Part D's rules requiring co-payments.While Ms. Blue's income is too high to qualify for co-payment assistance, she has almost no assets aside from her house. She also has substantial credit card debt and fears adding to it by spending $2,800 on Tarceva, she said.""Who expects to have to come up with a couple of thousand dollars?"" she said.Dr. Shore said he had expected Ms. Blue to be able to find a way to get Tarceva through Medicare. If he were certain Tarceva would benefit her, he would advise her to pay the $2,800, he said. But uncertain that the drug will help, he does not want to make her spend money for a drug that may not work.Dr. Shore said he and his staff found Ms. Blue's case very frustrating.""We're used to roadblocks,"" he said. ""We're not used to this.""'"
"'06-04-08,'0','Mr. Kempthorne has often articulated lofty goals about the environment and public lands, and by all accounts is an ardent user of the wide-open spaces himself, frequently seen tooling around the state in a recreational vehicle or on his motorcycle. But very often he has found compromise to be the way forward.""The middle ground is his forte,"" said Bruce Newcomb, a Republican farmer and rancher who is speaker of the Idaho House.After his nomination, Mr. Kempthorne himself told reporters here that Mr. Bush wanted a consensus builder. ""He wants me to find common ground,"" the governor said.Mr. Kempthorne, 54, made his first mark as a politician in the late 1980's and early 90's, when he was mayor of Boise. In that role, he backed a plan for parkland along the Boise River that later became an anchor of the city's renaissance as a Northwest-flavored center of bicyclists, runners and computer geeks.But as governor he remained mostly silent, legislators and political observers here say, when the state was recently in an uproar over a utility's proposal for a giant coal-fired power plant in a rural area. The Legislature took the lead on that issue, blocking the project with a two-year moratorium on power plant construction.The trail traveled by the plan to improve Idaho's parks offers a good example of Mr. Kempthorne's style, many people here say. The plan, put forward in his State of the State speech in January, before his nomination as interior secretary, called for a $34 million package of renovations and other improvements, and was cheered by conservation groups.The final product was cut back to $11 million by lawmakers of Mr. Kempthorne's own party, who also grafted on the gravel mining idea, with his endorsement. The gravel mine, sponsors say, could earn $15 million for the park, though it will need years of study and regulatory approval.""The rap on him is that he makes a great speech but then doesn't follow through,"" said James B. Weatherby, director of the Public Policy Center at Boise State University.If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Kempthorne will inherit an abundance of tangled and divisive issues from Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, who announced her resignation last month. Given matters like endangered species protection, the energy boom on public lands, which Ms. Norton favored, and the sale of public lands, which the administration has proposed as a way to increase education spending and reduce the federal deficit, the Interior Department is a cauldron of controversy, especially in the West.People like Dr. Weatherby, who has watched Mr. Kempthorne for many years, say that while he tends to be conservative and pro-business on most issues, the more telling trait throughout his career -- and perhaps the crucial variable in how he might handle issues in Washington -- has been his steadfast support for local control, especially the assertion of states' rights.In the Senate, where he served one term before winning the governorship, his main legislative mark was a bill that barred the federal government from imposing so-called unfunded mandates on local officials.He also fought the reintroduction of wolves into Idaho by federal wildlife officials, and has argued that endangered species protection in general would be better handled by the states. National environmental groups say his positions and votes in the Senate suggest that his agenda would differ little from Ms. Norton's. The League of Conservation Voters says he voted only 1 percent of the time in agreement with the league.But a strong states' rights position, some people here say, could also cut the other way, suggesting greater environmental protection, especially with regard to the administration's proposal to sell off large swaths of public land. Politicians in several Western states, including Idaho, vehemently oppose the idea. The Idaho Legislature condemned it in a resolution last month, and the state's senior senator, Larry E. Craig, a Republican who heads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, has vowed to fight it.An equally important aspect of Mr. Kempthorne's perspective is that he is very much a Westerner of the new urban stripe. Photos of him beating through the wilderness on horseback with a fly rod and a bedroll are not in the portfolio.Indeed, his close association with Boise, the state's largest city, has sometimes put him at odds with the more rurally centered Legislature. But it would also appear to have him pointed in the same direction as a broader Western trend: away from the old industries like logging, mining and grazing that once dominated the Interior Department's calendar, and more toward recreation and tourism.As to whether he would be a voice for preserving public lands or selling them, people who know him best are divided.Speaker Newcomb said he was confident that Mr. Kempthorne would oppose such sales. But a former Idaho governor, Cecil D. Andrus, a Democrat who served as interior secretary in the Carter administration, said he thought Mr. Kempthorne would follow the orders he was given.""Dirk understands how we feel in the state,"" Mr. Andrus said in an interview at his office in Boise. ""But will he go in and argue that this is a disastrous mistake and stop it? That will be the proof in the pudding.""'"

"'06-04-09,'0','""You're killing me here,"" Jon Stewart, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, said after introducing Mr. McCain as one of his favorite guests earlier this week. ""You're not freaking out on us — are you going into crazy-base world?""After the reference to his appeal to the party's conservative base, a laughing Mr. McCain responded, ""I'm afraid so.""In an interview at his Senate office, where he had urged a reporter to watch the Stewart interview on an office computer, Mr. McCain said that he had not changed any position for political reasons, and that he was more conservative than his occasional high-profile breaks with the right might lead casual observers to believe.But unbidden, he acknowledged the danger of the perception that he had become politically expedient. Mr. McCain said there was ""much increased sensitivity for me not to display traces of hypocrisy"" because of the way he had defined himself.""I would argue that I have not changed any of my positions, and if I did really change my positions on issues, that I would lose what is probably one of the greatest attractions that people have for me, and that is as a person who stands up for what he believes in,"" Mr. McCain said, appearing subdued during a break from the debate on his immigration bill. ""But you know, I understand why some people would say, 'Wow!' when they hear that I'm speaking at Liberty University.""""I've always been a conservative,"" he said. ""I think my voting record clearly indicates that on economic issues, national security issues, social issues — I'm pro-life — so I think I could make an argument I've had a pretty clear 20-some-year record basically being conservative.""Mr. McCain's associates said it would be nearly impossible to win the nomination without quelling concern among conservatives who, even before his immigration bill — over which he was attacked by Republicans at two town hall meetings he held during his 24 hours here — were concerned by his advocacy for campaign finance laws, a global warming treaty and gun control.A critical part of Mr. McCain's strategy to win the nomination is to persuade conservatives to swallow concerns about those views by presenting himself as the most electable Republican because of his appeal to moderates and independents. That distinction could fade should Mr. McCain emerge with a lasting reputation as conservative or hypocritical, his advisers said.If he has not changed his positions, as Mr. McCain repeatedly insisted in an interview, he has at the very least changed the coloring of how he has presented himself to the public.After denouncing Mr. Bush's tax cuts when they were first proposed, he voted in favor of making them permanent. He spoke approvingly of a South Dakota law that would prohibit virtually all abortions, part of an effort by abortion opponents to prod the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, though he said it should include an exemption for rape, incest and protecting the life of the mother.He said schools should be allowed to offer ""intelligent design"" courses as an alternative to evolution, a huge issue for many conservatives. And he accepted the invitation to speak at the Liberty University commencement by Mr. Falwell, saying he saw no difference between that and accepting an invitation from Bob Kerrey, the former senator from Nebraska, to speak at the New School, where Mr. Kerrey is president.""Rev. Falwell came to see me and said he wanted to put our issues behind us — and I did, too,"" Mr. McCain said. ""I believe the worst thing you can do in life, much less politics, is to hold grudges.""That explanation did not go over especially well with people who came to hear him speak this weekend.""This is a radical religious movement that Jerry Falwell is part of,"" Silas Bennett, 27, a student at Keene State College, said in challenging Mr. McCain's explanation Saturday morning. ""Don't you think that legitimizes the movement?""Mr. McCain responded: ""We have an honest difference of opinion of that, quote, movement. Christian conservatives are a part of the Republican Party.""But Mr. McCain's reconciliation campaign has had some success with conservative leaders. Mr. Falwell spoke warmly of Mr. McCain, saying he was as conservative on social issues as any Republican who might run for president.""I've felt since I first knew about him that he stood on the right side of the ball on social issues,"" Mr. Falwell said. ""I don't think he has changed his views. He is certainly pro-life. He clearly is an advocate of the husband-female family, he does not support same-sex marriage. I know of no reason I could not support him.""Other conservatives expressed reservations about his politics and sincerity.""His challenge is that having been a Reagan Republican on taxes, guns and Kyoto, and having left that, and now thinking about coming back — he's got to overcome the original sense of betrayal and the new sense of flip-flopping,"" said Grover Norquist, the head of Americans for Tax Reform. ""This is not easy. You can't be the straight-talk express with two positions on every given issue.""Marshall Wittmann, a senior fellow at the Democratic Leadership Council and a former adviser to Mr. McCain, disputed any suggestion that Mr. McCain was trying to repackage his political product.""Neither the right nor the left understands him,"" Mr. Wittmann said. ""He's always had unconventional alliances. It's just now the left doesn't like the alliances he's making when in the past they would have approved of them.""If John McCain had been elected in 2000,"" he continued, ""he would likely have been as conservative or more conservative than President Bush.""On a second front, after a famously rancorous primary battle with Mr. Bush in 2000, Mr. McCain has made a methodical effort to rebuild his standing with the Bush family. It started in 2004, when he latched himself to Mr. Bush's side, and has continued this year with his defense of an increasingly isolated Mr. Bush on the war in Iraq and the proposed Dubai ports deal.Last week, Mr. McCain went to Texas to speak at a program sponsored by the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation, where he offered effusive praise of the president's mother and father, who were beaming at his side.Two of Mr. Bush's senior campaign advisers — Mark McKinnon, his media consultant, and Terry Nelson, his political director — are now advising Mr. McCain. Tom Loeffler, a former Texas congressman and one of the prime fund-raisers for President Bush and his father, is now raising money for Mr. McCain.Over the past year, Mr. McCain has been getting advice from Mark Wallace, who was deputy campaign manager for Mr. Bush's campaign in 2004, and last week, he and his senior adviser, John Weaver, took Marc Racicot, who was chairman of the Bush 2004 campaign, to lunch as part of an effort to recruit him.As he campaigned through New Hampshire this weekend, Mr. McCain seemed almost to enjoy the complicated road he was following: defending his immigration bills against an angry challenge from a former Republican state representative from North Hampton one moment, and saying that Mr. Bush had not been given the credit he deserved for the roaring economy the next.""I think a lot of people don't exactly get where I'm at,"" he said.'"
"'06-04-09,'0','Is the marketplace perfectly efficient? If producer supply and shopper demand always synched up just right, then perhaps there would be no reason for a chain like Big Lots to exist. Big Lots has about 1,400 locations around the United States and revenue of $4.4 billion in its most recently concluded fiscal year. The chain specializes in ""closeouts."" There are many kinds of closeout merchandise, but what this often means in practice is that unlike a store that tries to figure out where the demand is and get the proper supply in stock to meet it, Big Lots starts with supply and seeks demand.Late last year, for example, Big Lots offered 20-inch Huffy Chopper bicycles for about $60 (or even $50, during holiday-season sales). When Huffy manufactured the bikes, the idea was that they would be sold at retailers like Wal-Mart and Kmart for a price closer to $100. But Huffy has had a very rough ride in recent years. (It re-emerged from bankruptcy in 2005.) ""They had large quantities of this product on hand,"" says John Martin, Big Lots' executive vice president for merchandising, ""but it was being discontinued by the retailers who had stocked it."" Big Lots had never offered bicycles in large quantities before but bought half the 35,000 bikes to see what would happen. They ""blew out"" the doors, Martin says. So the chain bought the rest of the bikes and put them on sale in March.About half of the typical Big Lots selling floor is given over to closeouts like those Huffy bikes, each one offering a particular narrative on the imperfections of the marketplace. Sometimes the chain cuts a deal with a middleman who has acquired, say, production overruns of Lee jeans. Or it buys up ""reconditioned"" products, like Dyson vacuum cleaners that have been returned to the manufacturer (""usually just buyer's remorse,"" Martin maintains). Sometimes merchandise has to be liquidated simply because of a packaging alteration (either a new design, or even, as when Procter & Gamble bought Gillette not long ago, changes to the Universal Product Code numbers). Another recent example involved a few hundred thousand lampshades, made by a firm called Alsy Lighting, and intended for sale at places like Target and Bed Bath & Beyond, at retail prices in the $9 to $20 range; those stores were shifting their mix of product styles, so the shades ended up at Big Lots, priced between $3 and $7.While this makes for an adventurous business model, it would seem to create a frustrating shopping experience. The chain advertises specific deals, but of course those deals are always short-term: the closeout offerings change constantly, and if you show up looking for a bike or a pair of jeans, you're unlikely to be satisfied with a lampshade, no matter what the price. But according to Martin, about 80 percent of Big Lots shoppers show up with no shopping list at all; they are just browsing for bargains. Many, he adds, consider themselves ""treasure hunters.""It makes sense, then, that Big Lots does not play down the notion that it specializes in merchandise that basically needs to be discarded for one reason or another. Signs in the store suggest that a ""closeout"" is an exciting thing to have access to. And a television ad for the chain shows a pair of ""bargain shoppers"" browsing, and one marvels: ""You know what? These are only 18 bucks, they're usually 32."" You can't see what ""these"" are, but it doesn't really matter. Big Lots doesn't sell products; it sells bargains.While the specific products coming into the stores vary, Martin says, Big Lots doesn't worry too much about always having something to sell -- whether the economy is booming or flailing. ""There are always misses,"" he observes. And presumably, there are always shoppers willing to believe that those misses might actually be treasures. If supply and demand are mismatched on the first try, it's inevitable that there will be another try, and then another, until a match is made. This is how the marketplace converts, say, a lampshade from a must-liquidate style in one context to a must-have bargain in another. All of which, of course, means that the existence of Big Lots is not evidence of the marketplace's failures but of its efficiency.'"
"'06-04-09,'0','It didn't take some Christian apologists long to discover that. In the second century, a bishop, Papias, was already relating a legend that Judas ended his days so bloated he could not see out of his swollen eyes and could not walk down a wide road. Papias wrote that Judas stank and urinated pus and worms, and was so immobile he was crushed by a chariot. By the Middle Ages, the ugly archetype of Judas as the personification of Judaism began to take hold: a hunched figure with a large nose and red hair who would do anything for money, including betray Christians. Dante cast Judas into the lowest ring of his ""Inferno,"" and the Passion plays that became part of the Holy Week traditions often showed Judas being tormented in hell by demons. (The Roman Catholic Church never officially pronounced on the eternal fate of Judas.)But scholars say it can be dangerous to overplay the role of Judas in the history of anti-Semitism because it might obscure the underlying causes of tensions between Christians and Jews. Even if Judas is erased from the Passion narratives, there are many more passages in the New Testament that foes of Judaism can seize on.Erasing Judas ""would change the iconography but it would not change the problem of anti-Judaism in a general sense,"" said Amy-Jill Levine, a professor of New Testament studies at Vanderbilt Divinity School and an adviser to National Geographic for its television account of the research it sponsored on the Judas papyrus. ""Even if you turn Judas into a hero he is still just one character,"" Ms. Levine said. ""The Passion narratives are much more complex.""Ms. Levine and others say that gospel passages like the famous ""blood cry"" of Matthew 27:25 were initially far more responsible for Christian animus against Jews than was the figure of Judas.Rabbi Lawrence Schiffman, a professor of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University and an expert on early Christianity, notes that in the canonical Gospel of John, Jesus urges Judas to carry out his betrayal without delay so that God's will might be done: ""What you are going to do, do quickly."" It is much the same message as that in the Judas gospel.If the account in John had been dominant through Christian history, rather than the gospel accounts that condemn Judas, Rabbi Schiffman said, ""then that would have led to interpretations in which one of the bigger Christian symbols of anti-Semitism would have been removed.""Still, scholars also suspect that if Judas as the great traitor hadn't existed, Christians would probably have invented someone like him to legitimate the messy process of their religious separation from Judaism. The likeliest candidate for an alternative Jewish bad guy, they say, would be Caiaphas, the high priest who handed Jesus over to Pontius Pilate and the Romans. ""You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish,"" Caiaphas says in John.In the end, whoever wound up shouldering the role of the Passion's villain, experts say that it would have had little effect on the course of history between these sibling religions. But those same experts also believe that the current debates provoked by the Judas gospel, while not undoing a painful history, could help Christian-Jewish relations now and in the future.""Maybe if Judas can be 'rehabilitated,' then perhaps some of those old issues could be set aside,"" said Marvin Meyer, a bible scholar at Chapman University and an expert on the Judas gospel who will appear on tonight's National Geographic program.""If you take away Judas as the bad guy, it is one step back from blaming all the Jews,"" Rabbi Schiffman said. ""It could have led to less anti-Semitism."" But, he emphasized, ""it would not have eliminated anti-Semitism.""David Gibson writes frequently about religion. His latest book, on Pope Benedict XVI, will be published in the fall.'"
"'06-04-09,'0','THE ""largest and wildest"" full-moon party, promised the yellow flier taped to a phone booth on Khaosan Road in Bangkok. Another installment of Thailand's girls-gone-wild bacchanal on the island of Ko Phangan? Or its bigger brother, Ko Samui? Or maybe it was the newcomer Ko Phi Phi, a remote island that is luring younger partygoers in the post-tsunami boom.Not quite. This particular moonlight spectacle, in fact, wouldn't even be in Thailand, but across the border, in Cambodia's budding seaside town, Sihanoukville. It is ""just nine-and-a-half hours from Bangkok,"" according to the flier, the work of Cambodian entrepreneurs hoping to turn Sihanoukville into the latest party hot spot.Like bohemians colonizing a sketchy up-and-coming neighborhood, European and Australian backpackers have been blazing trails through Cambodia steadily since the mid-1990's. Although the last of the Khmer Rouge traded their machetes for plowshares only eight years ago, this nation of 13 million is fast becoming a companion destination to Thailand -- that is, another seemingly safe haven of lush landscapes and warm embraces for Westerners.Nowhere is this more apparent than on the low-key but alluring beaches of Sihanoukville, where development is being modeled after Thailand's resorts. Along the touristy strip of sand known as Serendipity, several restaurants brazenly advertise ""happy"" pizza and ""happy"" pancakes, seasoned with a certain illicit herb. Nearby, Victory Hill is trying to become Cambodia's version of Soi Cowboy, one of Bangkok's more garish red-light districts.And, yes, every month there's a full-moon party, reminiscent of Ko Phangan's infamous drug-addled raves.'"
"'06-04-09,'0','Last Poems and an Essay.Robert Creeley died in March 2005, leaving a folder of poems now collected in ""On Earth"" along with a late essay. Few in number but various in approach, united by considerations of aging and memory, these poems are more than merely a biographical footnote. Creeley is so averse to discursive writing (he dislikes casting himself as an ""I"" considering a ""subject"") that reminiscence stretches him in interesting ways, and his recollections here are characterized by immediacy rather than removal. Warm elegies for friends and poems of baffled gratitude allow themselves a kind of sensuous cry (""Oh life, oh miracle of / Day to day existence, sun, food and others!"") you would not have caught him at 40 years ago.""On Earth"" carries on the emergence of rhyme and form in Creeley's later work, going so far as doggerel, and there is even an entire poem that scans. Creeley's aesthetics are often buffered by his aw-shucks affability, and it's easy to pass over how strange this emergence is. ""The Red Flower,"" the best poem in the book, evokes Robert Frost in its shuffling wise-man cadences -- the same Frost of whom Creeley once said, ""Colonel Sanders is far more authentic as human being."" Because they are so inflected by running antagonisms with (as Creeley saw them) facile, dandified figures like Karl Shapiro and W. H. Auden, these late poems make a difficult introduction to his work, even with some awareness of how he got here. The Harvard he attended in the 40's was unable to assimilate unpredictable figures like Ezra Pound and Walt Whitman, and left him with an abiding discontent with the idea of poetry as a shaped product, like an egg that you lay, as opposed to something like dance that you do rather than make. The flirtation with form in ""On Earth"" has the aspect of a rivalry turned chummy, as if the tradition Creeley fought to part from has grown unthreatening and even useful, but needing its nose tweaked no less for that.Creeley's essays, often embattled in tone, can hustle from point to point with little acknowledgment they've touched on something contentious -- like guerrillas, they keep moving. But ""Reflections on Whitman in Age"" relaxes in a way his prose usually doesn't. The essay is a defense of Whitman's late poetry, working from the metaphor ""age itself is a body"" -- that is, age is inseparable from any thoughts one can have about it, and there is no younger self one can retreat to to write about it. Whitman's late poems in this light show a masterly instinct of composition that ""cannot be a didactic 'intelligence' calling such sounds to order"" -- writing simply happens, like tying your shoes. I'm not convinced that Whitman's mind, or any writer's, ever disappears in this fashion, but the essay is not so much an act of persuasion as a way of remaining agonized.The desire to keep possibility open is plain in ""On Earth,"" and to be expected from a man who seemed to come from two directions at once -- there was Creeley the bohemian and the dyed-in-the-wool Yankee, the approachable and the avant-garde (his tag line, ""form is never more than an extension of content,"" carries a tone very foreign to his poems), the laconic writer and the blue-streak talker, the gentle pigeon-raiser and the high-strung Young Turk (who once got in a fistfight with Jackson Pollock). It is gratifying to see, in his last acts of writing, the intensity that kept these contradictions alive in his person.D. H.

"'06-04-09,'0','George, of course, verified his wife's story. George, of course, had a few good stories of his own, including that he was fairly sure his aunt had noticed this same black man several days earlier, just walking up and down the street near her house, loitering, in her words. George was also fairly sure he probably left a hammer on a windowsill in his aunt's master bedroom, having used it to help her hang a painting, he wasn't exactly sure when, but not long before it happened. A plausible theory evolved: Mrs. Finlay returned home from tennis or shopping or something and interrupted her assailant, who had gotten only so far as stealing a box of silver coins that supposedly was in plain view on a dresser in the master bedroom.In one of Barber's notes, he wrote that when the police arrived, there was water in the tub, a damp towel draped over the side of it and another larger damp towel on the bedroom floor not far from where the body was found. He speculated that when the killer heard Mrs. Finlay drive up, he may have hid himself and watched her undress to take a bath, which may have sexually excited him. At the point when she may have had nothing on but her ruffled blue tennis panties, he confronted her, and when she started screaming, he noticed the hammer on the windowsill and used it.What Barber didn't entertain, at least not in writing, was the possibility that Mrs. Finlay might have been in the tub when her assailant appeared, that in fact her assailant might have been someone she knew so well as to allow this person to come into the bedroom, perhaps even to talk to her while she was still in the tub or drying off, maybe a close female friend or relative, maybe someone who didn't always get along with her. It never seemed to occur to Barber that Mrs. Finlay might have been murdered by someone very close to her, the crime then staged to look like an attempted sexual assault that went as far as her tennis panties being pulled down to her knees before her enraged assailant beat her to death.According to the statement of one of Mrs. Finlay's tennis partners, Kim and Mrs. Finlay had gotten quite hostile toward each other over the summer, and Mrs. Finlay had begun saying things like, Chinese people should work in Laundromats, not marry people like her nephew. Sykes sure as hell would have been on high alert if she had been the detective and someone had told her that, would have zeroed in on all of it, would have connected the dots, decided Kim and Mrs. Finlay pretty much hated each other, and maybe when Kim dropped by the house after tennis that day -- after yet another shopping spree charged to Mrs. Finlay's country-club account -- they got into an argument that went no place good.""Still sounds mighty circumstantial to me,"" Rutherford the sheriff says from the showcase of pistols that is propping him up.""The DNA isn't circumstantial,"" Win replies, and he keeps looking at Sykes as if to remind the sheriff that the two of them are in this together.""Don't understand why they didn't get the DNA back then. You sure something didn't get contaminated after 20 years?""""They didn't do DNA testing back then,"" Win says, looking at Sykes, and she nods. ""Just standard serology, ABO typing, which certainly indicated that the blood on the tennis clothing was Mrs. Finlay's. But what they didn't test 20 years ago were areas of clothing that might yield other biological information.""""Like what areas?"" the sheriff asks, getting an impatient look on his face.""Areas that rub against your skin, areas that might have sweat or saliva, other body fluids. Get it from all sorts of things. The inside of collars, under the arms, the brims of hats, socks, the inside of shoes, chewing gum, cigarette butts. We need highly sensitive DNA technology for tests like that. P.C.R., S.T.R. And by the way, when DNA is contaminated, you don't get false positives.""Rutherford doesn't want to get into it, says: ""Well, George and Kim aren't going to give you any trouble. And like I told you, I know they're home. Had my secretary call them up, pretend she was collecting money for the F.O.P. hurricane fund. You ever seen anything like all these hurricanes? The Lord Almighty's unhappy with something, you ask me.""""Plenty to be unhappy about,"" Sykes says to him. ""Plenty of ambition, greed and hatred, the very same things that led to Mrs. Finlay's murder.""Sheriff Rutherford says nothing, won't look at her, has been addressing his every comment to Win. It's a man's world, probably explaining why there's all these hurricanes, punishment for women not staying home and doing what they're told.""Before y'all head out,"" the sheriff says to Win, ""I'd like to clear up the train part, because I'm still suspicious it was a homicide, like maybe there was some sort of organized crime involved, Dixie Mafia or something. And if that's so"" -- he slowly shakes his jowly head -- ""then maybe we should be approaching this different, bring in the F-B-I.""""No way it was a homicide,"" Sykes is adamant. ""Everything I've found out about Mark Holland's case indicates suicide.""""And what's everything?"" the sheriff asks Win, as if it were Win who just made that claim.""Like the fact that when he was married to Kim, she went through his money and was cheating on him, having an affair with Mark's best friend, another cop. Mark had plenty of reason to be depressed and angry,"" she says, looking right at the sheriff.""Might not have been enough for Barber to run with,"" Win adds, ""but it should have caused him to ask a few questions about Kim's character and morals. Which he clearly did, since he contacted the medical examiner's office in Chapel Hill, then stapled a Polaroid photograph of Holland's remains to the personal-effects inventory from Mrs. Finlay's autopsy.""""A personal-effects inventory that had tennis clothes in it? Because the tennis clothes were size 6, he made some Sherlock leap to a train fatality?"" Rutherford peels open a stick of spearmint gum, winks at Win, says, ""Guess I'll leave my DNA on it, huh?"" Then, ""Go on."" Chewing. ""Go on, then. I'm listening. Hook that up with the train fatality. Hope you can."" Chewing.""Ten,"" Sykes says. ""The tennis clothes were size 10.""""Well, not that I'm an expert on women's attire, but I can't see any connection between this poor cop being run over by a train and this dead old lady's tennis clothes. You implying Detective Barber figured those clothes was too big to fit Mrs. Finlay?"" he says all this to Win.""Don't think I would have,"" the sheriff says to Win. ""How 'bout you?"" He winks at him again, chewing.""Detective Garano's the one who did notice,"" Sykes says.""Possibly a simpler answer is the bloody tennis clothes were what Barber submitted to the T.B.I. labs for testing,"" Win suggests. ""He had a copy of it, stapled it to the morgue photo. Tucked them inside his September MasterCard bill, maybe because that's where the previous month's charges were listed for his trip to the M.E.'s office in Chapel Hill. People do things, don't think about them. Who knows.""""That sure is the truth,"" Sykes agrees, thinking of the case file Toby Huber stupidly stuck in the oven.""A lot of details never make sense,"" Win goes on. ""A lot of holes never get filled in. A lot of what is reconstructed probably looks very little like what really happens in those minutes, those split seconds, when a violent outburst ends someone's life.""""You some kind of philosopher or something?"" Rutherford narrows his eyes, chews his gum.Win gets up from his chair, looks at Sykes, gives her the signal.""We just need a little time to give them the happy news; then you can pick them up,"" Win says to the sheriff.At least he said we, Sykes thinks. He didn't have to include her. It's his case, she thinks, but no matter how often she reminds herself of that, she feels disappointed, depressed about it, resentful. After all those dark places and boxes and phone calls and missed academy classes and everything else, it certainly feels like her case, and it would feel pretty damn good to tell Kim and George Finlay that they didn't get away with it, that they're about to find themselves in handcuffs and end up in a very different Big House from what they're used to -- this one with razor wire.""They're nice enough folks,"" Rutherford says to Win as they walk out to the parking lot, takes a good, long disparaging look at Sykes's old VW Rabbit, same thing he did when she and Win first drove up. ""Well, call me when you're ready,"" he says to Win. ""A real shame locking them up."" Chewing gum. ""They've never caused any trouble around here.""""Doesn't look like they're going to get a chance to, either,"" Sykes says.A few miles away is Little River Road, where many of Flat Rock's wealthy residents have big homes and estates, many of them summer homes, many of their owners from the far reaches of New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago.Sykes pulls her car off the long unpaved driveway, parks to one side, in the weeds so she and Win can show up with no warning. They get out and start walking toward the house that Vivian Finlay's nephew, George, and his 93 percent East Asian wife, Kim, inherited from Mrs. Finlay after her murder. The well-off couple have been married 22 years, their wedding six months after Kim's first husband, Detective Mark Holland, committed suicide on lonely train tracks in a lonely part of North Carolina.""Well, I know I would have,"" Sykes remarks, carrying on a conversation they've been having for the past 10 minutes.""It's easy to say 20 years after the fact,"" Win reminds her. ""We weren't there.""""You mean you wouldn't have bothered checking out the tennis reservations?"" Sykes says as they walk along the unpaved drive, getting closer to the house where George and Kim enjoy their privileged lives in their lovely home. ""You know, just done the same damn thing I did?""She has to remind Win yet again of how hard she's worked, of what an amazingly thorough and smart investigation she's conducted.""If Barber had done that, he would have realized it wasn't Mrs. Finlay who used the ball machine that day,"" Sykes goes on, has made this point maybe four times now, ""not unless she signed in as a guest. All he had to do was ask questions.""""Maybe he felt about it a little bit the same way I do,"" Win suggests. ""He didn't like dealing with a club that would never have him as a member.""She walks close to him. He puts his arm around her.""So she going to jail?"" Sykes asks, and she isn't talking about Kim Finlay.""Personally, I think she's been punished plenty,"" Win says. ""But I'm not finished yet.""For a moment they are quiet as they walk in the sun, the driveway long and winding, trees everywhere. He can feel the heaviness in Sykes's heart, sense her pain and disappointment.""Yeah, you've got a lot of unfinished business up there, all right,"" she says. ""Guess you'll be leaving after you take care of these two."" She stares in the direction of the house.""We could use a few good C.S.I.'s in Massachusetts,"" he says.She walks with her arm around him, holding him tight.""You think the box of silver coins ever existed?"" she asks, maybe just to change the subject, maybe to get her mind off where Win lives and works, off where hehas his life, off how entwined his life is with Lamont's no matter how much he denies it.""Probably,"" he says. ""I'm guessing Kim grabbed it on her way out the first time, after she killed her, trying to figure out how to stage it to look like a burglary-sex crime, disguise what in truth was probably an impulse crime. Blame it on a suspicious-looking black man. Worked like a charm, especially back then. People used to call the police on my dad. Happened a lot. He's in his own yard and gets reported as a prowler.""The sun is hot on their heads, the air cool, the roof of the house visible now, peeking above trees. They remove their arms from each other, walking apart, like colleagues again, talking about the case, Sykes wondering why Jimmy Barber never questioned what happened to Vivian Finlay's shoes and socks, wondering what Kim found to wear when she made her getaway after stripping off her bloody tennis clothes, wondering a lot of things.Then the house is right there in front of them, George and Kim Finlay, now in their 60's, sitting in white chairs on the wide white porch, eating lunch.Win and Sykes stare at the couple on the porch staring at them.""They're all yours,"" he says quietly.Sykes looks at him. ""You sure?""They follow the slate walkway, head to the wooden steps that lead up to the porch, where George and Kim have stopped eating. Then Kim gets up from her chair, a stooped woman with graying hair pinned back, dark-tinted glasses, wrinkles that indicate she scowls a lot.""Are you lost?"" she asks loudly.""No, ma'am, we're definitely not lost,"" Sykes says, she and Win stepping onto the porch. ""I'm Special Agent Delma Sykes with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. This is Investigator Winston Garano, Massachusetts State Police. I talked to you on the phone the other day?"" she says to George.""Why, yes."" George clears his throat, a small man, white hair, looks uncertain, pulls his napkin out of the front of his Izod shirt, doesn't seem sure whether he should stand or sit.""The murder of Vivian Finlay has been reopened due to new evidence,"" Sykes says.""What evidence could there possibly be after all these years?"" Kim says, acts clueless, even tries to look distressed by the memory.Next week: The conclusion of ""At Risk.""#THE FUNNY PAGES: III: SUNDAY SERIAL Previous chapters are online at www.nytimes.com/funnypages.'"

"'06-04-09,'0','A fossil find in the frigid wastes of Arctic Canada is being hailed as a missing link documenting the transition from fish to land animals eons ago, and in some respects it is. But the gap it fills was already shrinking rapidly thanks to previous fossil discoveries by paleontologists seeking to determine how ancient fish developed the ability to leave the waters and adopt a terrestrial lifestyle.The latest find -- some well-preserved fossils of a fish that lived 375 million years ago -- adds to the accumulating evidence that evolutionary forces acting over long periods of time can incrementally shape one kind of animal into another that looks quite different. It puts the lie to creationist beliefs that each species was created separately with its distinctive features already intact.The newly discovered fish, described in scientific articles last week, was an ugly creature, four to nine feet long, with a flattish body, sharp teeth and a crocodile-like head, eyes perched on top. It was clearly a fish, with fins, scales, gills and a fishlike jaw. But it also had anatomical traits that anticipated the emergence of the earliest land animals: ribs strong enough to support a body no longer buoyed up by water, a neck that could move and limblike fins strong enough and flexible enough to allow it to haul itself out of the water.Scientists speculate that this fish lived primarily in shallow waters and may have used its fins to push through vegetation-choked waters, lift its snout above water, clamber over logs or flop about clumsily on land much as seals do today. Why these or any ancient fish might have wanted to walk on land is not certain. They may have been looking for food or waddling to a nearby body of water or trying to escape larger predatory fish that could not follow them ashore.Paleontology is sometimes denigrated as a backward-looking, historical science that cannot produce hypotheses that can be tested for truth or falsity. But the remarkable thing about this latest find is how predictable it was. Scientists knew what kind of creature they were looking for and where they would be apt to find it -- in geologic sediments of the right age that were once at the mouth of a tropical river but had subsequently been moved by tectonic forces to Ellesmere Island in Canada, north of the Arctic Circle. They started looking in 1999, in a climate that was so forbidding that they could work only in the summer, guns at the ready to repel polar bears, and persisted until they finally hit pay dirt in 2004.Scientists had previously found fossils of several other fish species that had attributes pointing toward land capabilities, as well as fossils of land animals that had residual features of fish, all suggesting the steps by which life forms moved from water to land. The latest fossils further round out the picture and provide compelling new evidence of how creatures that were mostly aquatic developed features that would later prove useful on land.'"
"'06-04-09,'0','Mr. Raymond already had a huge stake in Exxon's continued good fortune. Even before the 550,000-share grant, he owned 1.55 million restricted shares that would vest from 2007 to 2014. And then there are the 1.16 million restricted shares that vested when he retired, and the 4.15 million options to buy Exxon's stock. The shares would have been worth more than $70 million and the options about $90 million if Mr. Raymond still held them all last week, Mr. Foley said.But if certain one-time retirement items like his $80 million pension are excluded, then Mr. Raymond did not even have the biggest payday in the energy industry last year.Bonuses were up across the board, from those at big integrated energy companies to those at tiny oil services businesses. And some chief executives saw their pay rise substantially from 2004, another banner year for energy industry profits.Ray R. Irani, the chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, received about $63 million in total compensation last year, an increase of more than 50 percent from the year earlier. Over the last three years, Mr. Irani has reaped more than $135 million, mostly in options and restricted stock.""We've seen various energy C.E.O.'s dragged before Congress to explain the excessive price spikes in gasoline,"" said Patrick McGurn, special counsel for Institutional Shareholder Services, a corporate governance research group based in Rockville, Md. ""And now it appears that a lot of the excess profits were going into Ray Irani's pockets.""But Mr. Irani wasn't among the energy executives who testified before Congress recently. Occidental is much smaller than the companies represented there, with less than 5 percent of Exxon Mobil's revenue last year. ""When you get a disconnect even on size, then that shows that nothing is driving compensation,"" Mr. McGurn said.Executive pay in the energy industry might not be tethered to any one measuring stick, like the company's size, but there does appear to be one constant: energy executives are usually paid much more than their peers at similar companies in other industries.John P. Surma Jr., the chief executive of U.S. Steel, for example, received total compensation of $6.7 million last year; Alain J. P. Belda, the chief executive of Alcoa, the aluminum manufacturer, received $7.5 million. But John G. Drosdick, the chief executive of Sunoco -- an oil company that has revenue that is roughly in line with that of U.S. Steel and Alcoa -- was paid nearly $23 million.David Swinford, a senior managing director at Pearl Meyer & Partners, the compensation practice of Clark Consulting, said he would like to see pay packages in the oil patch reflect something more than the boom in industry profits.""They need to measure the achievement of long-term goals like improving operating margins and reducing the cost per gallon of a particular product,"" said Mr. Swinford, who advises several energy companies on executive pay. ""I don't think very many boards are good about going back after the fact to determine if they actually got premium performance for premium pay.""Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at the Corporate Library, an investment research firm in Portland, Me., that specializes in corporate governance, said he did not think that energy executives' pay should be based on annual operational results at all. ""The reason the C.E.O. got the job in the first place was to increase long-term revenue,"" he said. ""The daily operational results are affected by executives much further down the chain.""Mr. Hodgson added that energy companies often justify big pay and generous perks by saying that they could not possibly retain talented executives without them. But that's ""illogical,"" he said, because companies like Kinder Morgan do ""perfectly well"" without them.Richard D. Kinder, the chairman and chief executive at Kinder Morgan, an oil products and natural gas pipeline company based in Houston, receives a $1 annual salary, no bonus, no options and no restricted stock. His payout comes from dividends on the Kinder stock he has accumulated as a co-founder and investor. (He owns nearly 20 percent of the company.)Mr. Kinder said ironclad bonuses and flashy perks would not suit the culture at Kinder Morgan, where salaries are capped at $200,000 a year. ""Our senior executives could all walk across the street and get paid a lot more,"" he said. ""But I think what's important is that they recognize the system here is fair.""Kinder Morgan executives work without contracts. There is no separate retirement plan for senior executives. Every employee in the company, from the lowest paid on up, is eligible for a bonus.For the most part, commodity prices do not directly affect Kinder Morgan's profits. But even in the one unit that is affected by the market price of oil, Mr. Kinder said, he tries to keep bonuses commodity-price-neutral, because the executives have no control over the price.Yet there is no doubt that Kinder Morgan has enriched investors. Its shares have more than quadrupled in value since a merger in 1999 created the present company. Mr. McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services referred to Mr. Kinder as an ""enlightened founder,"" comparing him with Bill Gates, who has never accepted stock options from Microsoft.Mr. McGurn, however, was hard-pressed to come up with another example in the energy industry.'"
"'06-04-09,'0','But Robert F. Auwaerter, head of fixed-income portfolio management at the Vanguard Group in Malvern, Pa., voiced more restraint. ""The economy continues to be quite strong,"" Mr. Auwaerter said, calling a Fed move to raise the overnight lending rate to 5 percent from the current 4.75 percent a ""slam dunk"" in the next few months. He said he would not be surprised to see it reach 5.25 or even 5.5 percent.That could cause the yield curve -- of returns arrayed across the spectrum of maturities, from days to decades -- to invert again, with rates higher for short-term issues than for long-term ones. Normally, the longer until maturity, the greater the yield, because of the greater risk.Inversions, such as the mild one during the winter, tend to herald recessions, which are usually good for bonds. This time, however, the relatively low level of long-term rates may mainly reflect huge bond purchases by foreign buyers, particularly China and oil exporters, using dollars accumulated in trade with the United States.Bond investors, of course, face a perpetual conundrum: rising rates mean that the value of existing holdings declines -- whether owned directly or through a mutual fund -- but they also make returns on reinvested interest and fresh money more attractive.Is there a way to figure this trade-off? Specialists point to what is called duration, a refined measure of bond maturity that tells how sensitive an individual bond or entire portfolio is to a given change in interest rates.""If you have five years of duration, that means that if interest rates go up or down one percentage point, then the price of your bond goes up or down five percentage points,"" Mr. McCulley said. If such a bond yields close to 5 percent, he said, over the course of one year, even if rates rose by one percentage point, ""you more or less break even.""Duration failed those who relied on it during the rising rate environment of the last year or so, as short-term investments outperformed. ""It has not been a good indicator"" this time, said Scott Berry, a mutual fund analyst at Morningstar Inc.SO what's a fixed-income investor to do? Bearing in mind what the finance textbooks call the ""asymmetrical"" risk inherent in bonds as a class -- meaning that if you compromise on quality, you can lose more than you can gain -- it may make sense to be conservative.""A bond isn't going to double in price,"" said Mr. Auwaerter of Vanguard. ""If everything goes right, it's going to pay you 100 cents on the dollar at maturity plus all your coupons in between. But if a bond gets in trouble and defaults, you may be getting 30, 40 or 50 cents on the dollar.""Moreover, he added, today's flattish yield curve means ""an environment where you're not getting paid a lot of spread to take on credit risk.""The expert consensus these days, therefore, is to stick to high-quality borrowers. Don't commit to long maturities; avoid segments of the market that have had outsize price run-ups, such as emerging markets; and pay close attention to expenses, many bond professionals say.""High-quality fixed-income is in the value zone and should be bought"" with average durations of four to five years, Mr. McCulley said, pointing to Treasury bonds and those of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as especially attractive.Mr. Berry of Morningstar, who finds short-term bonds and bond funds most appealing now, said only a few basis points of yield now separated Fidelity's UltraShort Bond and Intermediate Bond funds. ""You're getting basically the same yield with much less risk"" for the ultrashort bonds, he said. The tricky part is deciding when it's time to switch.Specialists say municipal bonds, which foreigners are much less likely to buy, represent good value these days. And funds investing in low-quality issues are springing up to serve aggressive investors; last year, such funds averaged a total return of 6 percent, making them the best tax-exempt category by far.""It certainly makes sense to look at municipals right now,"" Mr. Berry said.Funds investing in bank loans, whose rates are reset upward every 90 days to limit possible loss of principal, are also attracting investors.Mr. Berry cautions against bonds in emerging markets, which produced double-digit returns last year.Experts generally agree that investors should be wary of corporate bonds, which now tend to be high priced, because of the default risk at a time of increasing monetary restraint. The new Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is expected to be no more likely than Mr. Greenspan to let inflation flare up.IT pays to shop for low-cost bond funds, especially in a climate of modest interest rates, but specialists also advise investors against buying individual bonds, rather than funds, unless they are investing for a specific purpose and can hold the bonds to maturity. ""Individual investors think that by buying the bond rather than the bond fund that somehow they're immune to the change in prices as rates go up,"" Mr. Auwaerter said. ""What they don't realize is when they go and sell the bond that they're going to take a hit. There's very limited circumstances where it makes sense to buy bonds directly.""Funds provide instant diversification and are can negotiate better prices in markets characterized by wide spreads between buying and selling prices, poor liquidity and, in the case of municipals, a huge number of issues. One drawback, other than the fact that they never mature, is they do not provide the means to customize one's taxes.Mr. McCulley of Pimco, though more optimistic than most about the prospects for bonds, is nonetheless somewhat nervous about the outlook.""There seems to be a little complacency right now, as reflected in low levels of volatility and tight risk premiums,"" he said. ""I don't see anything particularly daunting on the horizon, but there's very little cushion in asset prices now for shocks. This calls for a degree of circumspection.""This, of course, could prompt an investor to remain in money market funds, where returns are already well north of 4 percent and generally respond promptly to rate increases by the Fed. But such safety-at-all-costs investors risk missing profits from the next easing cycle, Mr. McCulley said. ""Money market funds,"" he said, ""always look best when they should be sold.""'"
"'06-04-09,'0','About a decade ago, the Russian grandmaster Mikhail Gurevich left his homeland and settled down in Belgium. It looked as if he would be operating from there forever, but he has recently turned up in Turkey as a citizen there. He won the Turkish championship, which was held in Istanbul from March 11 to 23, with a 10 1/2 score. Turkey's only native grandmaster, Suat Atalik, tallied 10 points to take second place in the 14-man field.It is not unusual for top players to change countries, mostly because they have been awarded more favorable contracts for training the local players, giving simultaneous exhibitions and the like. In some cases, like that of the American grandmaster Nick De Firmian, it was an affair of the heart that drew him to Copenhagen, but he retained his original allegiance. In the last International Team Tournament, the American team was entirely made up of former Russians.For the most part in Istanbul, Gurevich, 47, showed off his great skill in endgame play. His opponents were unable to read his intentions. Maybe that was the idea: to serve as advertisements for his coming lessons.The example of his play in the following game, however, shows him outplaying Hakan Erdogan decisively in Round 4.It was clear that when Erdogan pushed his f pawn on his 24th move, this could not succeed. He had to just hang on, without expectation of anything good. Sometimes when you cannot produce a positive plan, you must just pray for the opponent's error.'"

"'06-04-09,'0','The sun was already sinking, so we hurried down the mountain to the nearby Silver Lake neighborhood and the Sanborn Guest House, a renovated 1920's bungalow on a quiet street. We had stumbled across it online and were pleased with our neat and cozy room. The innkeepers were at once available and unobtrusive, giving the place a relaxing weekend-at-home feel that, for $89 a night, was unbeatable.But we couldn't linger. We would be starting our weekend with overt entertainment-industry tourism: a taping of ""The King of Queens"" at Sony Studios in Culver City. I had reserved free tickets from TVtickets.com and was anxious to be on time.I needn't have been. The first order of business was to stand in line for 90 minutes with 350 sitcom aficionados. Eventually, we took seats in a cavernous sound stage before the archetypal sitcom space: a living room, centered around a couch.An affable comedian named Roger was charged with working us into a frenzy of hair-trigger laughter between takes as well as before the taping. Each take took seconds, but interminable rearranging of cameras and props, and last-second script changes bloated the evening -- seven hours to tape a 30-minute show.As our blood sugar dropped, we became putty in Roger's hands, finding ourselves doubled over guffawing at the antics of the loutish protagonist. And while grueling, I still think the experience is worth considering -- once. The show's lack of sophistication belies the elaborate operation brought together to produce it, and breaking the frame of the small screen struck us as something every American should try.We mulled over the spectacle at Electric Lotus in Los Feliz, along the south side of Griffith Park, joining a mellow crowd for hearty pan-Indian food in a large, moodily lighted space. Sitting on pillows in a semi-enclosed pavilion, we inhaled a mild vegetable coconut curry and a satisfying baingan bertha (creamy roasted eggplant), a rib-sticking meal that came to $30.97.While we ordinarily would walk off a meal like that, this was L.A., so we drove back to Silver Lake. We were learning that terms like ""nearby"" have different meanings in Los Angeles. Distances change as the day progresses. At night, with little traffic, more things are nearby.Once in Silver Lake, we went to the 4100 Bar on Sunset Boulevard for a nightcap. The bar was dim, a cheerful cave packed tight with clean-cut hipsters. We got drinks ($15) and chatted with a couple from the area.They recommended Akbar, a few blocks away, so we went there for our next drink (free, since the bartender knew the couple, except for a $2 tip). The crowd was lively and mixed, with guy-next-door gay men jamming the dance floor. But bars close at 2 a.m. in Los Angeles, so we were soon back in the chill night air, ready to call it a night.We awoke to sun streaming into our room and parrots twittering socially in the big palm outside. A long stretch of Sunset Boulevard becomes a bruncher's paradise on weekends, and we slowly made our way to Eat Well, a Silver Lake institution.At a long wooden table on the sunny sidewalk, we started with well-brewed coffee and the sweet, fluffy coffee cake that is the restaurant's signature. That, with a sprawling plate of tofu scramble with vegetarian chorizo, and a side of home fries and delicate avocado set us back $20.In need of a walk again, we ambled along Sunset and found a tiny farmers' market at Edgecliff Avenue. We picked up a book on the history of Los Angeles for a $5 donation and a bottle of fresh-squeezed pomegranate juice for $4, then sat in the adjoining small park reading and enjoying the sun until, inevitably, it was time to hop in the car again.Passing a stretch of Fairfax Avenue known as Little Ethiopia, we spotted Rahel, which claims to be the city's only vegan Ethiopian restaurant. In spite of our incompletely-developed appetites, we sat down to a platter of vegan versions of classic Ethiopian wots, or stews, spread out on teff injera, the sourdough flat bread.We finished with the traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony, and under the influence of the coffee and incense I could see that Nina was warming to Los Angeles. With a glass of telba (a cool flax smoothie) lunch was $20.We proceeded to Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood. Judging from the flawless luxury cars prowling the street of extravagant boutiques, just setting foot on the sidewalk was going to cost us. But we figured a cafe would be safe -- even one with valet parking, which we pointedly declined in favor of a spot on a side street.Urth Caffé is an organic coffee shop bursting with Hollywood-perfect specimens in gigantic black sunglasses. We shared a double latte and a huge chocolate chip cookie, and grabbed a quarter pound of ground coffee -- all for $10.75. We returned to the diminutive Chevy to find a $39 parking ticket (other than lodging, our biggest single expense for the weekend).Distraught, we made our way east to a more affordable-looking stretch of Melrose, where thrift stores and designer outlets rubbed shoulders in an affordable but chic eclecticism. We outfitted ourselves: a brown brimmed cap, mirrored sunglasses and pink and orange wristbands totaled $17. With the cap at a slight angle, and the sunglasses sparkling as the streetlights came on, Nina wore a cool smile, as though she might finally be ready for her close-up.With the sun now down, we headed for Chung King Road, a pedestrian walk in Chinatown where a new wave of multimedia galleries holds regular openings. That night the main draw was the inaugural show at Fringe Exhibitions. We joined a crowd spilling out of a parking lot into the streets to watch a performance by the San Francisco-based machine-art outfit Survival Research Labs entitled ""The Fish Boy's Dream.""The Fish Boy, a wooden dummy covered in rows of small mackerel, sat slumped at a desk as though asleep. Above him, a 14-foot-tall skeletal Godzilla held in one Styrofoam hand a harpoon and in the other a large wok full of some burning substance. A roar rose from the crowd as the harpoon began haphazardly plucking fish. Finally, a flamethrower weighed in with a wall of fire igniting Godzilla's head and the structure crashed down, bringing an end the troubled dreams of Fish Boy.It seemed only appropriate to follow up this spectacle by joining friends for dinner at Full House, a lively Chinese seafood restaurant around the corner. Our share of a huge meal that included piquant curry-infused Singapore noodles and savory dry-fried string beans was $22.It was now midnight, and our next destination had become nearby. The week before, a few minutes on tribe.net had gotten us onto the guest list for Spundae -- a marquee D.J. club night at Circus Disco in Hollywood -- for $15 each ($10 off full price).The club is a nightlife superstore of 20,000 square feet. Giant inflatable snowflakes hung from the ceiling, bathed in laser light and disco fog, as a never-ending stream of D.J.'s laid down house-inflected breaks that kept the crowd -- beautiful people, gel-topped suburbanites and elfin techno-hippies -- on its feet.We stayed until almost 4. All we drank was plenty of (free) ice water -- the constant driving was limiting our alcohol intake, which proved to be critical in hewing to our budget. It also meant that just a few hours' sleep (and a powerful pot of Urth coffee) helped us pack and check out of the Sanborn before 10.From there, we made our way directly to the Third Street Farmers Market, a 72-year-old landmark, opting for freshly squeezed orange juice ($4.28 for two) and parathas, soft fried breads served on banana leaves with mild curry dipping sauce -- a typical breakfast on the Malay peninsula ($3.50).WE were so close to a unique Los Angeles curiosity that we had to drop by. La Brea Tar Pits consist of a pleasant park surrounding a flooded quarry secreting a petroleum seep. Gobs of tar float in the water, and eruptions of methane belch from its depths. From 10,000 to 40,000 years ago, saber-toothed cats, giant ground sloths and other beasts met their demise there, making the tar pits a paleontological goldmine.We sat on a bench and contemplated the pathos of a Flintstoneseque tableau: A baby mastodon at the edge of the pool stretches its trunk toward its trapped mother as she sinks into the blackness. The father stands by, helplessly stoic.A banjo player filled the park with incongruous picking. We put a dollar in his hat and left, too short on time to visit the museum displaying skeletons from the tar pits.Instead, we made our way to a conceptual museum of animals falling into the tar pit of modernity. ""Ashes and Snow,"" a collaboration between the architect Shigeru Ban and the photographer and filmmaker Gregory Colbert, is at the Santa Monica Pier until May 14 ($15 each) before moving to Tokyo.Mr. Ban's Nomadic Museum, a cathedral of shipping containers, cardboard tubes and tarps, houses Mr. Colbert's dreamtime films and luminous sepia prints. The spare imagery, all the more astounding for being unmanipulated, whispers of transcendent and breathtakingly intimate communication between people and animals -- cheetahs, eagles, elephants, whales -- beyond our means to comprehend.Surrounded by a parking lot, ""Ashes and Snow"" was the perfect end to our L.A. weekend: from the outside, it was a box resembling nothing more than a container port, yet the cool, hushed interior held a world of metaphor.The only thing left was to grab a soft pretzel and fries (with a Pepsi, $7.95) on the pier and plop down in the sand. The smallest of waves splashed in off the Pacific. Children dipped their toes in the cool water, laughing. In the distance, Malibu's green mountains shimmered beneath the sky of pale vaulted lapis.With gas ($11.71) and parking ($8.10) our traipse though Los Angeles had cost us $491.Where to Eat and DrinkFarmers' Market at Sunset Junction, 3700 Sunset Boulevard, 323-661-7771; 8 a.m to 1 p.m. on Saturday.Where to Move your LimbsWhat to See""Ashes and Snow"" is at the Nomadic Museum, Santa Monica Pier, 866-308-4203, www.ashesandsnow.org; $15.'"
"'06-04-09,'0','THE BASICS -- Guests might expect a hotel started by Benny Andersson to have at least one bit of Abba memorabilia in the lobby -- Bjorn's guitar or maybe Frida's orange jumpsuit. But sadly, other than an Abba CD in your room, there is little at the Hotel Rival to make visitors parade around in platforms or start whistling ""Waterloo."" Despite this, the city's newest boutique hotel is still a fitting tribute to Mr. Andersson, the Swedish rock star.Not only did he restore a 1930's Art Deco cinema, making it part of the hotel, he also provided the city with a lively new meeting complex. With two bars, a bistro, a cafe and bakery -- to say nothing of the cinema, now a cultural center for screenings, concerts and theater -- sleeping in one of the hotel's 99 sleek rooms seems secondary to hanging out in its many public spaces.THE LOCATION -- Situated on the beautiful tree-lined square of Mariatorget in the formerly working class, now artsy Sondermalm district on the southern island, the Hotel Rival is a great base for exploring the city by foot, subway or taxi. Gamla Stan, the heart of the old city and filled with small shops and intimate restaurants, is a 10-minute walk from the hotel.THE LOBBY -- By far the most eccentric furnishing in this hotel's lobby -- and that's saying a lot for a room that has pink chairs, orange ottomans, red leather sofas and polka-dot lampshades -- is the big double bed made up with white pillows and a fluffy duvet. It looks like the perfect place to snooze after one too many martinis in the bar. But with various doors and openings leading to the cafe, the cinema, the bakery and a bar, and a grand circular staircase leading up to the hotel restaurant, relaxing in this multifunctional space can be challenging with so many people entering and departing from all directions. People watching, however, takes the sting out of the cost of drinks: two vodka and tonics were 172 kronor ($22.55 at 7.9 kronor to the dollar) and this in the homeland of Absolut!THE ROOMS -- My husband and I had a standard room, the cheapest, with a view of a courtyard and various families' kitchens. Though small, the room was equipped with a 32-inch plasma screen TV; a DVD/CD player, on which we blasted Abba's ""Dancing Queen"" (though only one of us could dance at a time and only in one place); a desk with electrical connections, including for a Sony PlayStation (the hotel also has wireless Internet), and a closet with a minibar, a safe and an ironing board. That left little room for clothes.'"
"'06-04-09,'0','SOME smaller buildings that cannot afford doormen, or do not want them, are turning to a new breed of partly automated services that go by names like Cyberdoorman and Virtual Doorman.These are not your 1980's intercom systems. At a minimum, they involve interactive video monitoring of the door by someone at a different location who can admit guests and deliveries to the building. Packages can be deposited into a locked and camera-monitored room for retrieval by residents. Properly configured, these systems can even remotely unlock an extra set of keys if you lose yours.Depending on the bells and whistles, installation can range from $10,000 to $100,000 for a prewar 30-unit building, with annual charges at $4,000 and $30,000 per building. (A single town house can be wired and serviced for far less.) No holiday tipping is required, and residents who crave privacy can find the illusion of it, at least.""We're not standing there smiling at them when they walk in with the fifth girl or guy of the week,"" said Seth Barcus, a system designer at Best Monitoring, a Bronx-based alarm company whose Cyberdoorman service is used by seven buildings in Manhattan, and is being installed by 16 more in the New York area. ""It's not like we're actually paying attention to the soap opera of your life,"" Mr. Barcus said. ""You're not looking the guy in the eye the next morning. And there's no gossip between the doormen and the neighbors.""In its five years of operation, however, Cyberdoorman has observed its share of sexual shenanigans in the lobbies and elevators monitored by its cameras. While the images won't be turned over to your co-op board, the company will notify the board upon your second offense caught on video or if the building is somehow desecrated in the process, Mr. Barcus said.Other indiscretions picked up by Cyberdoorman include the occasional domestic dispute and an apparently endless stream of hygienic transgressions inside elevators.

"'06-04-09,'0','""There's a backlog of people waiting to buy -- they're the experts, they've seen what's out there,"" Mr. Higgins said. ""Once they pass on a house, it's obviously not worth as much.""The inventory of available houses in Fairfield County is up roughly 30 percent over last year, he said, though the amounts vary markedly from town to town. For example, Darien's inventory is up about 40 percent over a year ago, while Ridgefield's is up just 8 percent.In some towns, the swollen inventory is partly explained by a glut of higher-end homes. In Westport, for example, 115 of the roughly 300 homes on the market earlier this month were in the $2-million-and-up range.""That's huge -- that's like a year's worth of inventory,"" said Darcy Sledge, an agent with the Westport office of Prudential Connecticut Realty. ""There's a lot of new construction sitting. Buyers in that range are being very choosy, and those houses not on an ideal site are sitting a little bit longer.""At the same time, sales have slowed considerably relative to last year, although many agents said properties have begun to move more briskly in the past few weeks.A sampling of town statistics compiled by Ms. Sledge showed that as of March 30, sales of single-family homes were down about 40 percent for the year in Easton and Weston, 15 percent in Norwalk, 10 percent in Westport and Wilton, and 7 percent in Fairfield.The Greater Hartford Association of Realtors reported a 15 percent rise in inventory as of the end of February, with sales down about 17 percent for the year to date. New Haven County real estate agents are seeing similar numbers, according to Frank D'Ostilio, regional vice president for Coldwell Banker.Prices are still up over last year, however, and multiple offers are common on well-sited houses in excellent condition.Such properties are moving ""just as fast and just as pricey as they have in the past,"" said Carole Cousins, an agent with Century 21 Landmark Properties in Ridgefield. Just recently, a ""bread-and-butter colonial"" -- Ms. Cousin's term for a traditional center-hall colonial -- in an established subdivision in Ridgefield sold for the asking price after multiple offers because, she said, ""the house was pristine.""""The baths were done, the kitchen was renovated,"" she said. ""The house was immaculate.""Patty Hutchinson, an agent with Kelly Associates in Darien, tells a similar story about a fairly new colonial in ""perfect condition"" that listed at $3.5 million last month. The owners listed the house on a Thursday, received three offers during the weekend open house and sold it by Sunday.Several other Darien properties listed in the $3 million to $4 million range are languishing, she noted, because they are overpriced relative to the competition.Robert Grant, an agent with the Higgins Group, has had to lower his expectations since putting his own home in Easton on the market a little more than a month ago. ""I thought I would hit the spring market hard and there would be tons of buyers out there,"" he said. After an initial flurry of calls, however, interest has tapered off to barely a phone call a week.When Mr. Grant first listed his house -- a 4,000-square-foot colonial built in 1996 on three acres -- only two comparable properties were available in Easton. He set the price at $998,900. Since then, five more properties have been listed in that range, some of them larger or newer. Mr. Grant has lowered his price to $984,000, a level at which he believes there is a window in the market without competition.Listing a house at the high end of its price range is not necessarily the way to go right now, agents said, especially if the house does not show as well as others in the same range.Ms. Cousins recommends pricing a house at the point where it becomes the best house on the market at that price.Sellers are often blind to their own house's shortcomings, however, as was the case with the couple who recently asked Ms. Cousins to perform a market analysis of their home in Brookfield.As Ms. Cousins pulled in, she noted that the house was built down low at the base of a steep driveway. High-tension wires loomed behind the property.""Inside, they had totally redone the kitchen, and they were very proud of that,"" Ms. Cousins said. But in the living room, the view of the backyard was dominated by railroad tracks at the back of the property.When she later presented her analysis to the owners, she suggested that the house ought to be priced lower than other homes with the same number of bedrooms and square footage to make up for the low site, wires and railroad tracks. The owners ultimately rejected her analysis in favor of the higher price recommended by another agent.""If that house sits on the market for a year, people will say, 'Oh, it's a bad market,""' Ms. Cousins said. ""But no, the real problem is bad pricing.""'"
"'06-04-09,'0','Eminent domain, the ability of government to take private property for public use, is like any heavy-duty power tool: It can do a lot of damage if mishandled. But wielded cautiously and wisely, it can do much to advance the public interest.A compelling example of the latter approach is the recent decision by the Town of Brookhaven to use its eminent-domain powers to take 40 acres of land away from a housing developer to preserve it for farming.The action was a striking reversal of the old Long Island way of doing things. Typically it is sprawl and well-connected developers that win out over open space and farmers, and when the Democrats who control the town board prevailed in a 4-3 party-line vote, officials there rightly called it a historic moment. Their goal is to add the plot to the Manorville Farmland Protection Area, a 500-acre swath of undeveloped Brookhaven that has been protected from the relentless incursion of suburbia. The land will be leased to private farmers.The decision prompted a howl from at least one property-rights advocate, a newspaper columnist who went so far as to revive the old ""Crookhaven"" label to condemn what he called an act of thievery by the town's new Democratic administration and its supervisor, Brian Foley.But that recklessly applied smear is grossly unfair to Mr. Foley, who rightly points out that the eminent-domain decision was made only after careful consideration and after repeated efforts to reach an agreement on a sale price with the housing developer collapsed.'"

"'06-04-09,'0','It was an impulse buy; I didn't even know it was actually a kitchen faucet until I unpacked it at home and read the label. I didn't need a kitchen faucet, but several of the bathroom faucets were looking a little dated; those pyramidal ones by Grohe were starting to leak.Why couldn't I put this gutsy faucet in a bathroom? After all, the higher spout would make the pedestal sink look more substantial.I was in the process of having the job done -- a plumber had been called -- when, on Third Avenue near 70th Street in Manhattan, I saw a faucet through the glass door of Gracious Home, a high-end emporium of such things, along with myriad other home decorating and hardware needs.There it was, almost the identical faucet, mounted on a display. Of course, it wasn't exactly the same: it was made by Jado, and it was $719. Eager to examine the inner workings, I asked the salesman if I could buy it, and then, if it wasn't right, return it. He laughed. ""This isn't a box of shoes,"" he said. ""Once you buy it, it's sold.""So I was not able to compare the two faucets end to end, weight to weight. But I went to the Jado Web site and found what I think was the same faucet.It was part of the New Haven line, and it was also a spread set. That means separate ""hot"" and ""cold"" handles, with a separate spout in the middle. The style -- those streamlined taps and the grandly curving spout -- was definitely very much like the one from Home Depot, but this one was labeled a lavatory faucet.The Jado site does not give prices, but a spokeswoman for American Standard -- which owns Jado -- said the faucet, in chrome, is priced at $599. In nickel, she said, it is $719.Checking discount faucet sites on the Web, I found that it could be bought for $380 at homeannex.com and for $336 at faucetline.com. In nickel, the faucet is available at the two online sites for $456 and $403, respectively.The Home Depot faucet -- also available in nickel, for $10 more ($179) -- is made by Pegasus, which a spokeswoman said was a ""proprietary"" brand -- that is, a separate company that makes faucets exclusively for the chain.Home Depot fell in my estimation several years ago, when it discontinued several lines that were both inexpensive and good, like the little oval brass knobs for cabinets that were similar to those made and sold by Baldwin for about eight times as much. But the chain still has an excellent porcelain pedestal sink -- it would look great with the Pegasus faucet -- for only $119.And that's not the only excellent thing it introduced recently. Two years ago, Home Depot offered a huge oval light that is very plain -- showing just a thin silverish edge that sits flush with the ceiling and uses fluorescent bulbs. I have used these lights to line a dreadfully long hallway in a railroad apartment, in bathrooms and in a kitchen. They sell for about the same price as the faucet set, and offer at least as much style.This vast home improvement chain has had its ups and downs -- both on Wall Street and in product selection. But David B. Sandor, its chief spokesman, said last week that for several years, Home Depot has been ""adding more distinction and differentiation to our merchandise in areas like faucets, lighting, ceiling fans and outdoor grills.""In response to these upgrades, he said, the average purchase at the Home Depot has risen by more than $10 over the last five years, to $57.98.""Five years ago, we sold three kinds of ceiling fans -- and they were all white,"" he continued. ""Now we offer hundreds of them, at all different prices."" While he didn't have statistics for faucets, he said that five years ago, the best-selling fan cost $60. Now, the chain's best seller costs $200.So Home Depot has discovered that offering more variety brings people into the store. With the Pegasus faucet, the chain's designers have obviously found that fancy levers with fussy details are not the only things that sell, and that they can actually charge more for plainer, better-made things.For all those would-be millionaires out there, Home Depot's latest strategy provides another way to look expensive but stay cheap: buying the $169 faucet at Home Depot can save a very cool $400 over the competition's retail price.'"

"'06-04-09,'0','Because the country's aquariums often exchange animals and work closely together on breeding and research programs, officials at the Aquarium of the Americas said the support from the aquarium community is not that surprising.""But it is wonderfully heartwarming to see how our fellow institutions have come to our aid,"" said Melissa Lee, an aquarium spokeswoman.Aquarium and zoos have also provided technical support, money and even jobs for laid-off workers.Lance Ripley, the assistant curator of fish for the Aquarium of the Americas, said he could not have hoped for a better response.""Everyone we've asked for help has given us help, and loads of people we haven't asked have given us help,"" he said.The aquarium has come a long way since the days after the hurricane. With flood waters rising and looting on the increase, the police recommended that aquarium workers evacuate. The generator, which provided the power to clean the tanks, supply air and regulate tank temperatures, became clogged, and when employees returned several days later they found 10,000 dead fish. Most of the animals that survived could breathe air, like penguins, otters and turtles. They were temporarily sent to other institutions.Since then, aquarium staffers have cleaned and sterilized the exhibits and prepared the water for new fish and animals. Ms. Lee and Mr. Ripley say it may be some time before the aquarium can totally restore its collection. Some animals just can't be replaced, they said, including a rare 13-foot sawfish.In addition, it is expensive to transport and feed the larger animals, and the aquarium has not generated any revenue in six months. It takes $25,000 a year, for example, to feed the aquarium's two sea otters their normal diet of lobster, shrimp and crab.Sending animals to help replenish the ailing aquarium was one way for Mystic Aquarium employees to pay back their colleagues in New Orleans for their help four years ago when Mystic was opening a new exhibit on animals that live in the swamps of the southeastern United States. The Aquarium of the Americas sent shrimp and mosquito fish and offered suggestions about how to set up the exhibit, which resembled a science shack in the Louisiana bayou.""It's very nice to be able to return the favor,"" said Cathy Ellis, the curator for fishes and invertebrates at Mystic Aquarium.The aquarium ships the animals much the way people take fish home from a pet store. It puts them in large plastic bags full of water and oxygen. The bags are placed in Styrofoam coolers with hot or cold packs, depending on the type of fish, to regulate the temperature. The cooler is then set in a cardboard box and shipped by plane. The fish can survive for about 48 hours. Larger fish have to be transported by truck.Later this year Mystic Aquarium may ship a turtle, another pacu and a 10-pound lobster, depending on when their exhibits will be ready in New Orleans. Mystic may also offer dogfish, skates, sea stars and crabs.Dr. Gerard Burrow, the president and chief executive of the Mystic Aquarium, said that sending fish such as these to New Orleans was a chance to assist a fellow institution.""We've had success breeding animals and we had some surplus animals available, so it seemed like a perfect opportunity for us to help out,"" he said.At Norwalk, Mr. Lenzycki said he had offered the Aquarium of the Americas a 55-pound cubera snapper, an aggressive, fast-growing fish native to the Gulf of Mexico. This one, though, was caught off the Rhode Island coast last year by a commercial fisherman. The fish suffered minor injuries, but it is fully healed. He said he also planned to collect sand tiger sharks this spring and will offer these as well.""The best we can do is offer them what we have here,"" Mr. Lenzycki said, ""and tell them we will help anyway we can.""'"
"'06-04-09,'0','IT has become harder to make a buck in the news business, and some large newspaper publishers will announce this week just how many they managed to make in the first quarter.The Gannett Company, the publisher of USA Today, and Media General, a publisher and broadcaster with properties concentrated in the Southeast, will report on Wednesday.

"'06-04-09,'0','""On the Jungle Floor"" (Capitol) is full of swampy 1970's funk grooves, supreme sexual self-confidence, nutty metaphors, skewed come-ons and an occasional swerve into rock, and no, it's not Prince's second album released in the past month. It's by Van Hunt, a younger Princeling and studio whiz. For Mr. Hunt, neo-soul is more about eccentricity than about nostalgia; he wants an era when singers (and not just rappers) can free-associate lyrics and the music can be orchestral in one song and a raw groove in another. Unlike Prince, Mr. Hunt often writes with others, but in songs like ""The Thrill of This Love,"" ""Priest or Police"" and ""Being a Girl,"" he can be cosmically odd all on his own.On her album ""Let Your Ghost Go"" (Saki), Megan Reilly's best voice is small and breathy, as if she's not sure whether she has awakened yet from a dream. When she sings about late nights and hazy mornings, her musicians collude, playing sustained parts that tiptoe behind her or hover in the background. Occasionally she comes down to earth on the fringes of country-rock, but she's most at home in the half-light.Candi Staton's 1976 hit, ""Young Hearts Run Free,"" was a late-breaking piece of Southern soul at the dawn of the disco era. She turned to gospel in the 1980's and hasn't recorded new secular music until now, with ""His Hands"" (Honest Jons/Astralwerks), which returns to the bluesy, measured tempos and husky-voiced, slow-building dramas she inhabits completely. ""His Hands"" is virtually a concept album about a marriage that becomes a nightmare. The harrowing title song holds memories of abuse; elsewhere, she faces the sorrow of a marriage gone cold -- ""You can call me Mrs. Misery, that's all I am to you!"" -- and the uncertainty of being alone. And while faith gives her consolation now and then, she never shies away from the pain or the anger.The M's, from Chicago, flaunt a paradox. The catchy tracks on their second album, ""Future Women"" (Polyvinyl), are piled high with 1960's elements: fuzzed-out guitars, balky analog keyboards, vocal harmonies and stray glockenspiels or strings. But the more vintage sounds the M's add, the less the music sounds like the 1960's: its hyperactivity comes straight from the 21st century. In the album's title song, they sing, ""Build it up to fall apart"" -- a mission statement.Everything's in overdrive on Parts & Labor's album ""Stay Afraid"" (Jagjaguwar/Brah). Guitars and keyboards distort. Drums are walloped. There are constant buzzes and squeals of feedback. The music charges forward and then lurches sideways, while Dan Friel and BJ Warshaw hoist sustained vocal lines that might almost be Celtic folk tunes if they weren't taking place amid such a din. Parts & Labor is from Brooklyn, and its songs roar through the mental landscape of a post-9/11 New York; the attack is compounded of fury, paranoia, confusion and portents of disaster.The latest, post-punk resurgence of progressive rock maximizes the jolts. Jam bands generally prefer to cruise along on comfortable vamps. Umphrey's McGee tries to reconcile prog rock's angularity with jam-band reassurance, and for a few stretches of its album ""Safety in Numbers"" (Hanging Brains Music/Sci Fidelity), it does. Although the band lingers in Phish and Dave Matthews territories, the meter-shifting structures and existential musings of ""Believe the Lie"" and ""Ocean Billy"" give them some prog-rock backbone.'"

And when it announced its $14.6 billion purchase of North Fork Bancorp last month, Capital One Financial said the New York market would be its focus as it moved away from credit cards to become a retail and commercial bank.Bank of New York, which has not invested heavily in its branches, said that it wanted out.""When you look at the national banks competing in this marketplace and those who look to enter this marketplace,"" said Gerald L. Hassell, Bank of New York's president, ""we thought it was strategically important for us to focus"" on the trust and private banking businesses.He added: ""We were going to be at a competitive disadvantage long-term.""J. P. Morgan, which already has 836 Chase branches in the region, wanted to add more. ""Retail is a very important part of the business, and it just doesn't stand on its own,"" said Charles W. Scharf, the head of retail banking. ""This is a business where market share does help you grow.""About 50 of the banks' branches are too close together, so many of those will likely shut down, but J. P. Morgan executives said they expected minimal job cuts.The move comes as James Dimon, J. P. Morgan's chairman and chief executive, is still trying to integrate systems and overhaul its branches after a 2004 merger with Bank One. ""It's a little bit early,"" Mr. Scharf conceded. ""A couple of months later would have been preferable, but we think we can get it done.""The deal gives Bank of New York a bigger overseas presence, with 15 offices abroad. ""We get very good value for our retail franchise, and we pick up a very good business that replaces the earnings that we give up,"" said Bruce W. Van Saun, Bank of New York's chief financial officer.Bank of New York expects a gain of $1.3 billion from the sale, with transaction costs of about $120 million; the deal will hurt earnings until 2009. J.P. Morgan anticipates an after-tax gain of between $600 and $700 million.To orchestrate the swap, the banks assigned values of $2.3 billion to the Bank of New York unit and $2.15 billion to the J.P. Morgan unit. J.P. Morgan will pay another $150 million in cash to make up the difference, and potentially $50 million more based on customer retention levels.'"
"'06-04-09,'0','In ""The Sound of Music,"" when the young von Trapps weren't playing practical jokes on their governess, they were bicycling around Salzburg singing ""Do Re Mi"" and entertaining at fancy parties. Now a new generation-- the great-grandchildren of Baron and Maria von Trapp -- is running up and down scales for an audience. Sofia, 17; Melanie, 15; Amanda, 14; and Justin, 11; perform professionally together, sometimes going so far as to don lederhosen onstage.Indeed, it seems as if the von Trapp Children, as they are known, are leading 21st-century versions of their predecessors' careers. They may have their own Web site, (vontrappchildren.com), but just like their forebears, including their grandfather Werner (called Kurt in the musical), they travel extensively giving concerts and have recorded albums of folk melodies, Christmas classics and songs from the musical. They'll even play themselves in a movie next year. From a hotel in Arizona, one stop on a tour that includes their New York debut this month at the Lamb's Theater, the children spoke by phone about the von Trapp life. Herewith, excerpts from the conversation:QUESTION It has to be asked: What are a few of your favorite things?Melanie: Reading, my family, trying new things. And bungee jumping.Q Your great-grandparents and their children fled Austria for Italy. Have you ever wanted to escape Montana?Sofia: No, I love Montana. I lead two really different lifestyles. And I love to ski.Q When you performed in the stage version of ""The Sound of Music,"" how did other actors react to the real von Trapps?Melanie: I think at first they didn't really know what we'd be like, but we made so many friends. We made friends with the Nazis in the cast. They were really fun.Q What do you really think of ""The Lonely Goatherd""?Sofia: Its got a cool melody and I like to yodel.

"'06-04-09,'0','""Retention grants,"" ""sign-on bonuses"" and other forms of compensation intended to attract or retain executives over a number of years are included in their entirety in the year reported.Showing data on an ""as reported"" basis offers the truest picture of annual pay. Counting actual pay also highlights years in which companies grant unusually small or large numbers of shares.To calculate the value of options, Pearl Meyer & Partners used a pricing model recommended by accounting rule makers and is similar to the widely used Black-Scholes formula.It estimates the present value of options grants based on a number of grant-date assumptions, including the exercise price, dividend rate, historical volatility of the stock and the option expiration date.It also takes into account vesting restrictions imposed on option recipients and the likelihood that the options will be exercised before they expire.For chief executives who served only part of the fiscal year in that position, the study annualizes their salaries based on either disclosed employment contract information, or prorates their salaries based on their time as chief executive. Other compensation elements are not prorated.Where averages and medians are used, they take into account all 200 companies in the survey.Percentage changes, however, reflect only the 172 companies that had the same chief executive in both 2004 and 2005.Following are definitions for columns in the tables:BASE SALARY -- Annual pay that does not depend on the company's results. By law, any amount exceeding $1 million is not tax deductible by the company.BONUS -- An annual cash payment that depends on the company's performance or the board's discretion.RESTRICTED STOCK AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVES -- The value, as reported by the company, of restricted stock grants in addition to other cash or equity incentive payments that are tied to multiyear performance. Typically, an executive must remain employed to claim restricted shares.Long-term incentives are usually earned based on the company's results over a three- to five-year period. Restricted stock is generally reported in the year granted; long-term incentives are most often reported in the year paid because their vesting is contingent on meeting certain future performance targets.OTHER COMPENSATION -- The value of ""other compensation"" includes miscellaneous nonperformance pay like moving expenses and personal use of a corporate jet, and the value of assorted other benefits, including contributions to 401(k) plans and company-paid premiums for supplemental life insurance.TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION -- The sum of the four previous categories, and the percentage change from 2004 to 2005. This figure is calculated only for companies where the chief executive held the position for both years. When companies had new chief executives in 2005, they are designated as ""n/a.""OPTION GRANT VALUE -- The estimated value of stock option grants is based on a pricing model similar to the Black-Scholes formula.TOTAL COMPENSATION -- The sum of total direct compensation and the option grant value, and the percentage change from 2004 to 2005. This figure is calculated only for companies where the chief executive held the position for both years. Companies with new chief executives in 2005 are designated as ""n/a.""NET INCOME -- The percentage change in the net income from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. The symbol -/+ designates companies that reported a loss in 2004 and showed a profit in 2005, and +/- indicates companies that posted a profit in 2004 but reported a loss in 2005. A company with losses in both years is designated -/-.TOTAL RETURN -- The percentage change in shareholder value from the beginning to the end of fiscal 2005, assuming the reinvestment of all dividends.OPTION PROFITS -- The pretax gain received during fiscal 2005 by exercising vested options from previous years. This gain is the difference between the stock price on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option.TOTAL VALUE OF EQUITY HOLDINGS -- The value of shares held outright, based on the fiscal year-end stock price, plus the unrealized gains on all options held by the executive.ESTIMATED ANNUAL PENSION -- Where provided, this figure represents the estimated annual pension benefit, usually based on the pension benefit table disclosed in the company's public filings. This is calculated by using company-disclosed years of service and final average pay. Company-disclosed lump-sum amounts are converted to annual payments assuming a 20-year payout period and a 6 percent interest rate.Companies that have defined-benefit plans, but do not disclose the estimated value of the plan, are designated with ""no plan.""'"

"'06-04-10,'1','Dr. Krambeck said her team wanted to find an animal model to determine precisely how the shock waves caused diabetes and hypertension.For now, the Mayo researchers hypothesize that shock wave therapy for kidney stones increases the risk for diabetes by damaging the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, a gland through which the shock waves may pass. They also theorize that shock waves may increase the risk for hypertension by scarring the kidneys and affecting their secretion of hormones, like renin, that can influence blood pressure.The findings of the new study underscore the importance of following patients many years after they receive new therapies and how rarely studies do so because of costs and long-term research interest. Because the new findings were based on a follow-up of the first year that lithotripsy was used at the Mayo Clinic, in 1985, confirmatory studies from other medical centers are needed, Dr. Krambeck said.Lithotripsy still has an important role in treating kidney stones despite the risks her team found, Dr. Krambeck said in a telephone interview.About 10 percent of men and 5 percent of women aged 70 and younger develop a kidney stone, according to the National Institutes of Health, a federal agency in Bethesda, Md. Kidney stones can occur as an isolated medical event, but often are part of a systemic biochemical disorder.An estimated one million people in the United States have undergone lithotripsy treatment since the German-developed procedure was introduced in this country in 1984. Shock waves demolish up to 90 percent of kidney stones.Patients considering lithotripsy should be informed about the new findings, said Dr. Dean G. Assimos, vice chairman of the urology department at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C.""But based on this article, urologists can't say patients shouldn't have lithotripsy"" because ""overall, lithotripsy is a great technological advance that has helped thousands of patients,"" Dr. Assimos said in a telephone interview. He is also vice chairman of the American Urological Association's committee that issues guidelines on kidney stone therapy.Stones in the kidneys and urinary tract system can be treated by a variety of other techniques that have improved during the 25 years that lithotripsy has been used. One way is to insert an instrument through an incision in the patient's back to remove the stone. Another is to insert a tube into the urethral opening, into the bladder and into the ureter to break up a stone with ultrasound or laser energy.Unlike lithotripsy, these procedures are invasive, often require a longer hospital stay, and have their own risks like bleeding, infection and injury to the bladder or ureter.So kidney stone patients, like those with many other conditions, face a trade-off in evaluating the relative risks of available treatments.Lithotripters were a landmark advance when they were introduced in the early 1980's because they greatly lessened the need for what was then the main therapy — surgery — that often required general anesthesia and a lengthy recuperation. Shock wave treatment can be performed with quickly reversible intravenous sedation and avoids long convalescence. Although lithotripsy can cause acute problems like bleeding in and around the kidneys, doctors have considered it safe over the long run.Dr. Krambeck said that as a urologist-in-training she brought a fresh outlook on the long-term complications of lithotripsy. She and her colleagues decided that a new study would be worthwhile because of the limited number of studies, the longest seven years.One short-term study found a higher risk for hypertension but two did not, she said, and no study identified diabetes as a long-term risk.To scientists, the studies with greatest validity are those that are conducted prospectively — establishing a scientific blueprint before they begin to collect information and then following patients and analyzing the data later. But because there was no such continuing long-term study for lithotripsy, and starting one would take years and be costly, the Mayo researchers did the next best thing: a retrospective case control study, even though that study design limits interpretations of the findings.Dr. Krambeck's team sent questionnaires to the survivors among the first group treated with a lithotripter machine at the Mayo Clinic in 1985. For comparison, the researchers did the same for a group of patients who received different therapy at the clinic in the same year.In each group, 288 patients responded. Of these, 48, or 16.8 percent, in the lithotripsy group developed diabetes, compared with 19, or 6.7 percent, in the control group. High blood pressure developed in 103, or 36.4 percent, of the shock-treated group compared with 79, or 27.9 percent, in the control group.Dr. Krambeck's team did not analyze certain risk factors, like a family history, for diabetes, but Dr. Assimos, the Wake Forest expert, said that ""they did as good a job as they could do with a retrospective study.""The study took about one year to complete. In May, the Mayo team sent its paper to The Journal of the American Medical Association, which rejected it without sending it to independent experts for review, saying it was too specific a topic for its readers, Dr. Krambeck said.So her team then sent the paper to The Journal of Urology. In September, after the Mayo doctors made requested revisions, the journal accepted it, she said.Last August, the Mayo team presented its findings at an international meeting, Dr. Krambeck said, but for a number of reasons the clinic did not issue an alert for the thousands of people considering lithotripsy.Her team did not want to release the findings early because the Mayo Clinic is one of a very few medical centers that still uses the same model lithotripter, Dornier HM3, in use in 1985, she said. Over the years, manufacturers have developed newer model machines that narrow the range of shock waves but that break up fewer stones. Because most urologists use the newer models, Dr. Krambeck said, ""we can't say that every lithotripter causes"" the diabetes and hypertension complications.Another reason for not issuing an earlier alert is that many journals impose strict embargoes on releasing information in papers before publication. Journals have withdrawn papers because authors released information to the public beforehand.""The journal did not want us to discuss the paper until the embargo was lifted, of course,"" Dr. Krambeck said.Dr. Assimos of Wake Forest defended the delay as ""appropriate.""Mayo urologists discuss all alternatives for treating kidney stones with patients but use lithotripsy less than other procedures, Dr. Krambeck said. After learning the results of their study, the doctors began informing patients who were considering lithotripsy about ""correlations with possible side effects"" but without specifying which ones or the data, she said. Now they will provide that information.'"
"'06-04-10,'1','TEHRAN, April 9 —Iran on Sunday brushed off a report that the United States was accelerating military planning for possible attacks against it.A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamidreza Assefi, said the report was part of a psychological war by Americans ""because they feel angry and desperate regarding Iran's nuclear case,"" the ISNA news agency reported.""The Americans want to create a crisis over our nuclear program and do not wish for the case to be over,"" he was quoted as saying. ""They are not happy about any kind of agreement between us and Russia or any other country so they rely on creating psychological war.""The report, written by the journalist Seymour M. Hersh and published in the current issue of The New Yorker, asserts that the Pentagon presented the White House with an option of attacking Iran's underground nuclear facilities and says that it has not ruled out using tactical nuclear weapons.The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told BBC television in an interview on Sunday that there was ""no smoking gun"" to justify an attack on Iran and that any notion that the United States would carry out a nuclear strike against Iran was ""completely nuts.""'"
"'06-04-10,'1','Ballet Builders has a noble ambition: to give choreographers the chance to show their work in a professional setting. But the 16th installment of Ballet Builders, performed on Saturday at Florence Gould Hall, offered a program without investigation and, even more critically, without a palpable aesthetic to support it.New Choreographers on Point, led by Ruth Chester and Michael Kraus, is the organization behind Ballet Builders, which presented seven works, beginning with Salim Gauwloos's ""Two Steps Ahead,"" a trio set to music by Astor Piazzolla. The piece was a fairly routine trip through well-paved territory: two girls, a guy and partnering that wavered between a faux fierceness and tender meetings.In ""Passing Through,"" Debra Jo Hughes depicted a couple parted by death. Royce Zackery played the spirit to Natia Kezevadze's flesh; there were chimes (played by the musician Peter Lewis), but despite its New Age premise, the ballet enacted a poignant sliver of a dream. Ms. Kezevadze, all long legs and supple arms, was the most engaging dancer on the program.Helen Heineman's ""Badlands Suite,"" a work for eight set to music by David Chesworth, had moments of intriguing partnering but was muddled by the stiff performance quality of the men, who struggled to impart a feeling of romantic gaiety. ""Cupid Revealed,"" created by Joseph Jefferies, featured Crystal Brothers and Travis Bradley sticking pretty much to the title's theme. Ms. Brothers began and ended the ballet by shooting her imaginary arrow at her partner.Ted Thomas and Frances Ortiz's ""In the Arms of Three"" was a disquieting (mystifyingly so) portrayal of a woman seemingly close to assault by three menacing men. ""Where Is the Love?"" by Robert Sher-Machherndl, set to Arvo Pärt, was the most austere ballet. Tessa Victoria and Mr. Sher-Machherndl portrayed two detached figures -- they didn't touch until the end -- but the ballet, overlong, was derivative of Jiri Kylian.Ballet Builders took a breakneck turn with its final piece, Lonné Moretton's ""What Is Hip?"" The piece for six dancers, vaguely dressed as flower children complete with headbands, was likely an ironic statement about the elusive nature of what it takes to be hip. That lesson, along with the formulaic, bouncy ballet, was a stale one.'"
"'06-04-10,'1','Two initiatives of Jazz at Lincoln Center intersected over the weekend at Rose Theater. The first was As of Now, a series that has sponsored new music from a pair of jazz composers -- an accomplished veteran and an estimable younger talent -- for each of the last eight seasons. The second was Jazz From Coast to Coast, the title and mission of the current season.On Friday and Saturday nights, Barry Harris, a pianist and educator, and Regina Carter, the violinist, each presented newly commissioned work. Both are products of Detroit, though Mr. Harris had already left for New York by the time Ms. Carter was born. Their pairing seemed like an elegant way to meet Jazz at Lincoln Center's needs. Their music, however, fell short of elegance by a good deal.Ms. Carter's new piece was ""Black Bottom,"" a words-and-music tribute to the African-American neighborhood of the same name on the East Side of Detroit, which was demolished in the 1950's. She pieced the suite together out of family recollections and scraps of research, along with material by a poet friend, Leslie Reese.Ms. Reese's narration ran over and through the music of ""Black Bottom,"" which sounded at best like the soundtrack to a Ken Burns documentary. There was a motif blandly evocative of spirituals, hummed by everyone in the five-piece band; there were swing-flavored trifles for violin and clarinet. The script strained to be relevant (""You know, there are a lot of black things in this world""), descriptive (""bowling alleys, roller rinks -- you name it, they had it"") and poignant (""By the 1950's, Black Bottom was gone/ Gone in a phrase of air/ Just as if it had never been there"").Nostalgia is getting to be a habit for Ms. Carter, who began one of her solos in the suite with back-to-back quotations of ""I'm Beginning to See the Light"" and ""Chattanooga Choo Choo."" Before unveiling ""Black Bottom,"" she offered some chestnuts appearing on her next album, the accurately named ""I'll Be Seeing You: A Sentimental Journey"" (Verve).Mr. Harris began the concert's second half in a bebop mode, with Earl May on bass and Leroy Williams on drums. Then he summoned the NYC Jazz Chorus -- some 40 singers, by rough estimate -- to sing his vocal arrangements. The sound of the chorus on ""I'll Remember April"" and ""Bird Feathers"" suggested one of Charlie Parker's commercial sessions, minus Parker.'"
"'06-04-10,'1','The company, which has offices in Seattle and Santa Clara, Calif., as well as in New Delhi and Mumbai, India, says its servers scan the Internet and analyze Web pages in terms of quality, coverage and size.The Webaroo designers note that most Web searchers never make it farther than the first page or two of results from a typical query.""There is a lot of junk and a lot of redundancy on the Web,"" said Rakesh Mathur, the chief executive and a founder of Webaroo. Even so, the company said, its system would strive to deliver sites intact, including their ads, to avoid the frustration of dead ends.In addition to offering subsets of relatively permanent Internet information, the system will update itself when the laptop is connected to the Internet, so that the user can use Webaroo to capture recent information from a Web site that changes frequently, like a news site, for later viewing offline.The company said it was not concerned that Web sites might see the service as extracting their content without delivering measurable traffic. Web pages delivered to the database when a user updates it will register on a site's servers as viewed even if the pages are actually read offline later, if ever.The service will also offer slices of Web information on special subjects, like news, sports or about such major cities as New York, London and Mumbai. Webaroo refers to these as Web packs and plans to offer them as free downloadable content.Like many Internet start-up companies, Webaroo hopes to sell advertising. The idea is that the company will make it possible for advertisers to reach customers on their laptops and eventually on other mobile devices when they are not connected to the Internet.Later this year, the company plans to start offering even more customizable Web packs that can be automatically updated on each Internet connection.Webaroo said it hoped to strike further deals like the Acer agreement with computer and mobile-device manufacturers.'"

"'06-04-11,'0','As the investigation — now in its fourth month — enters its final days, the focus has turned to what the Australian government knew about the kickback scheme. If the government knew, then the potential criminal liability of AWB officers is diminished.Mr. Downer's appearance followed Monday's testimony by the trade minister, Mark Vaile, the first cabinet minister to appear before a commission of this nature in more than 20 years. Prime Minister Howard submitted a written statement today, which was not made public. It is still uncertain if he will be called to testify in person.Following the pattern set by Mr. Vaile, Mr. Downer's most frequent answer today was ""I do not have a specific recollection,"" or some variation thereof.Mr. Downer took every opportunity today to rebut earlier testimony to the official inquiry that he had limited the government's cooperation with the United Nations Commission that investigated the oil for food program. He said repeatedly that he had urged AWB to cooperate fully and ""to tell the truth.""In September 2005, Mr. Downer told Paul A. Volcker, who headed the United Nations investigation, that ""there was no evidence"" that AWB had been aware of the relationship between a trucking company and the Iraqi government, according to a summary of the meeting prepared by the Australian mission to the United Nations, and introduced into evidence before today at the hearing here.The trucking company, Alia, had been the conduit for the kickbacks to the Iraq regime, according to findings by the Volcker commission, and by evidence introduced here.Mr. Downer testified today that he had become aware of Alia in April 2005, and in a secret Foreign Ministry memo on June 2, 2005, he was advised that ""AWB's own investigations revealed that Alia was part-owned by the Iraqi Ministry of Transport.""On top of this memo, which has been submitted to the commission, Mr. Downer had scrawled, ""Have to take it as it comes, but I'm more relaxed than they are,"" referring to AWB.Lawyers for AWB officers were allowed to cross-examine Mr. Downer, but the chief of the commission, Terence Cole, severely limited what they could ask.One lawyer, Terry Forrest, sought to question Mr. Downer about an Australian intelligence report in 1998, which said that Alia was a front for the Iraqi government and was used to circumvent sanctions. Mr. Cole allowed him only 30 minutes of questioning.Mr. Downer said he did not recall seeing the intelligence report, and had only learned about it from the Cole inquiry.Mr. Downer was most dismissive of one of the most specific allegations that AWB had been paying kickbacks. In June, 2003, an American Army officer working at the Coalition Provisional Authority, Capt. Blake Puckett, had told governments that were part of the coalition, which included Australia, that ""every contract"" under the oil for food contract had a kickback provision of 10 to 19 percent.The Australian mission in Baghdad reported this back to Mr. Downer's Foreign Ministry.Mr. Downer said he did not have a ""specific recollection of having received or read this cable,"" and it was unlikely that anyone in his department would have brought it to his attention.Mr. Aquis, the commission's lawyer, asked him why he had not considered it important.""Because this was information provided by a captain,"" Mr. Downer replied.'"
"'06-04-11,'0','SYDNEY, Australia, April 10 — The high-profile hearings into accusations that an Australian wheat company, AWB Ltd., paid $200 million in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's government under the United Nations oil-for-food program became even more dramatic on Monday with the appearance of the deputy prime minister, Mark Vaile.Mr. Vaile, who is also minister of trade, was asked whether he knew about the kickbacks and about his harsh rejection three years ago of public suggestions by American wheat growers that AWB was paying kickbacks. He responded repeatedly to questions with the answer, ""I don't recollect.""Adding to the tension, Prime Minister John Howard announced that he had been asked to give a written statement to the commission. He is the first Australian leader since 1984 to have been asked to give testimony to a judicial inquiry.""I do not believe, on the information known to me, that any of my ministers have been guilty of dereliction of duty and I am very, very happy to provide a statement and, if asked, to appear,"" Mr. Howard said Monday morning.The lawyers involved in the case will review Mr. Howard's statement to decide whether to request that he be called as a witness. The decision will rest with Terence Cole, chief of the investigating commission.'"
"'06-04-11,'0','The exchange, which opened in June 2004, lists 94 companies, from hotels to date merchants to a maker of animal vaccines. It is perhaps Iraq's keenest expression of American-style capitalism: scores of investors and traders, some in pinstriped suits, others in ankle-length robes and head scarves, gather every Monday and Wednesday.Guards with Kalashnikov rifles stand outside next to razor wire and concrete blast walls. The ringing of a silver school bell at 10 a.m. announces a session's start. Shouting and hand-waving fill the room, and cups of thick Turkish coffee are passed around. Another clanging at noon signals the close.Analysts and investors rattle off an endless ticker tape of reasons for the downturn: the threat of full-scale civil war, the virulent insurgency, lack of a government, a shaky economy, a dearth of foreign money.""It went down because we don't have a government yet, we don't have a future,"" said Taha Ahmed Abdul Salam, the chief executive of the exchange, a private business completely different from the Baghdad Stock Exchange, which was run by Saddam Hussein's government.The market's free fall is also emblematic of the moribund economy. Though income per capita has risen, some estimates place the unemployment rate at 60 percent.The growth rate was mired at 2.6 percent last year, and the Bush administration's projection of 10 percent growth for 2006 seems overly optimistic, given the continuing sabotage of oil pipelines, which has shut down exports through Turkey.Perhaps the notion of an Iraqi stock market is a little premature, because arcane financial laws provide little protection for investors.Without a major policy overhaul, investors will shy away and growth will be stymied, said Daniel Speckhard, director of the Iraq Reconstruction Management Office at the American Embassy. Instability has also pushed wealthy Iraqis to send their money abroad.Yet a sliver of hope remains. More than 100 investors show up for each session.""We think that one day, the darkness in the market will show some light,"" said Rone Benham, 45, holding up a pair of binoculars to peer at the figures on the boards. ""The prices are so cheap now. With a piece of candy, you can buy 500 shares.""Fifty traders work the floor, plastic badges on their jackets and clipboards in hand. They rush between investors standing behind a wooden railing and the white boards lining a wall at the rear. The traders also juggle cellphones ringing with orders.But there are fewer and fewer big trades, they say.""It's all because of the security situation,"" said Muaiyad Fouad, 68, a trader with a silver mustache and a professorial bearing. ""The big investors won't come here. The ones who'd spend millions, they're all afraid. Their offices are closed. They won't go anywhere without three or four bodyguards.""The traders were all hired from the old exchange. Mr. Fouad started there in 1994. The top three traders last year each made more than $20,000, said Mr. Abdul Salam, the chief executive. The poorest made less than $7,000.The market has shown signs of growth, even if it is far from bullish, Mr. Abdul Salam said. Its capitalization is $2.17 billion, small compared to other Middle Eastern exchanges, but up from $1.15 billion at the end of 2004. The daily volume of trade is $2 million to $3 million.At the urging of Iraqi business executives, L. Paul Bremer III, the former American proconsul and a champion of free-market principles, signed the order forming the Iraq Stock Exchange.Its owners are the country's major banks, and it has a three-member board of governors. The Iraq Securities Commission was recently set up to monitor the exchange and rewrite financial laws to allow foreign investment.The exchange is also working to connect itself electronically to markets around the world.""Now we have two challenges — building an electronic system and creating regulations for foreign investors,"" Mr. Abdul Salam said. ""If we have these two in place, and we establish a new government, stock prices will be 10 or 20 times higher by the end of the year.""About half the listed companies are actively traded, and Baghdad Soft Drinks is the most active, with 112 transactions in a recent session. Also popular are the banks.The overall market is not usually shaken by mayhem on the streets, so inured are investors to the war. Attacks, though, can send individual share prices reeling. The stock price of the Basra International Bank plummeted 30 percent right after the bank's chairman and his son were abducted from their Baghdad home on Feb. 16. Mr. Benham, the binocular-toting investor, said his favorite company was a date processor. One day, it will export around the world, he said. ""I've put half of my money into it.""He had bought at 6 dinars a share; it is now worth 2.Mr. Benham once worked as a video store clerk in Detroit and lost a lot of money in the Internet bust. But he cannot pull himself away from the market. ""I'm addicted to it,"" he said. ""I feel rich when I have shares.""Mr. Ogaidy, the sewing machine importer, sauntered over and offered a cup of coffee to a foreign visitor. He had just made $1,700 by selling shares of Bank of Baghdad. ""I'm buying now,"" he said, and raced off.'"
"'06-04-11,'0','Under Mr. Lukashenko, often referred to as Europe's last dictator, Belarus has virtually no independent news media. Its three state-controlled television stations endlessly flatter the president and criticize his perceived foes.Mr. Lukashenko, who was sworn in for a third term as president on Saturday, has shown little public concern about the prospect of sanctions.Immediately after the travel ban was imposed on Monday, his government labeled the action ""short sighted"" and said sanctions would only aggravate relations between Belarus and the West.Mr. Lukashenko appeared at his inauguration ceremony wearing a military uniform, and bluntly scolded the West for what he described as its efforts to encourage revolutions patterned after those that have changed post-Soviet governments in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan since 2003.""Get busy with restoring order in your own countries,"" he said, in remarks aimed at the West, according to a transcript prepared by the BBC. ""Belarus has a robust immune system. Your clumsy attempts to plant the virus of revolution have produced the reverse effect and have become an antidote for this color disease,"" a reference to the democracy movement in Ukraine, which used the color orange as its badge of unity.The list of officials banned from travel to Europe include senior members of the presidential administration, as well as the two top officials of the K.G.B., the state security agency, which retains its Soviet name. The list also includes election supervisors, judges and a prosecutor involved in processing cases against opposition members.It substantially reflected a proposed list of 47 officials created and circulated by Western diplomats last month in Minsk, except that it did not include state journalists the previous list recommended for sanctions.Their omission reflects a divergence in opinion among diplomats about how to classify the state journalists, who are regarded by some Western countries, including the United States, as K.G.B. agents. But some diplomats worry that sanctions against the state journalists could lead to retaliatory restrictions against Western newsgathering.No matter Mr. Lukashenko's public displays of confidence, the European Union's decision puts him in rare company.Other public officials barred from entering the union include security officers responsible for the bloody crackdown in 2005 in Andijon, Uzbekistan, and those indicted for war crimes and their close circles. The only other heads of state banned from the European nations are President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the leaders of the military junta now controlling Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.""You can see the company in which these guys are,"" Cristina Gallach, spokeswoman for the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said in a telephone interview. She said the list would continue to be reviewed and might grow.The response from the government of Belarus came in the form of a statement by Andrei Popov, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. ""We have repeatedly stated to our European partners that restrictive policy toward Belarus is groundless, far-fetched and useless,"" he said. ""Real understanding and constructive cooperation are obviously reached through dialogue, but not imposed with sanctions.""Nikolai I. Lozovik, the deputy chairman of the Central Election Commission and one of the Belarussian officials whose travel was restricted, said he was proud to be included.He said the sanctions were a case of European political pressure and double standards.""Good is called bad, and bad is called good,"" he said. ""I would be offended if in this situation I was considered a person who was corresponding with European standards.""'"
"'06-04-11,'0','But Jeanette was actually one of my most agreeable patients. She dutifully took all of her medications and carefully watched her diet. I could not remember an instance in almost 12 years when she had questioned me.What Jeanette was doing was making a personalized decision based on her own assessment of the various options. Over the last several years, researchers have begun to study how patients balance the risks and benefits of proposed interventions.Syncope, the scientific term for a brief loss of consciousness, was potentially dangerous, especially for someone like Jeanette, who had never before passed out. Most worrisome was the possibility that her syncope had been caused by an arrhythmia, an abnormal heartbeat that can cause temporary loss of blood flow to the brain. Some arrhythmias, if not immediately identified and treated, are life threatening.I explained this possibility to Jeanette over the phone. But I also told her that most elderly patients with syncope leave the hospital without a definitive diagnosis. That is, they would have done just fine at home.This was clearly what Jeanette wanted to hear. She told me how she had exerted herself all day, helping to prepare the Thanksgiving meal. She had gotten sweaty and lightheaded during dinner and then passed out. ""I just overdid it,"" she explained. ""I'll be just fine.""I reminded her once more that the safest thing was to go the hospital. There was even a chance she could die, I warned. But Jeanette had made up her mind. She thanked me for my concern and told me she would see me at her next appointment, in roughly three weeks.I told the paramedics they could leave, and reminded Jeanette or her daughter to call again immediately if there were problems.After I hung up the phone, I reflected on other patients who had chosen a potentially risky course of action.One was a woman who had suffered a heart attack and had additional heart muscle at risk. The cardiologists wanted to perform a catheterization to visualize her anatomy. This test might have revealed a blockage that could have been opened by angioplasty or surgery.My patient wanted no part of this. She declined and went home. Once she got there, she discontinued many of the medications she had been given to prevent future heart attacks. They had too many side effects, she said.Although this woman has continued to decline my recommendations, she remains well.Another patient, however, was not so lucky. This woman had fallen after leaving my office, landing on her wrist. She was quite ill with multiple medical problems, one of them mandating that she take blood thinners.I was called to the hospital lobby to see her. Her wrist was sore but not swollen. I told her she needed to go to the emergency room for an X-ray to make sure that her wrist was not broken. A fracture could cause serious bleeding in her case, I explained.But the patient begged me to let her go home, saying she was simply exhausted and could not bear the thought of waiting for hours to be evaluated. Efforts to persuade her failed.When she left, I extracted my usual promise: she would let me know if her wrist worsened. When her family and I called later that night, she said she was fine.But she was not. Sometime over the next couple of days, she died. No autopsy was done, but it is likely that the death was related to the accident. Both the family and I felt guilty, but we agreed she had made a clear choice.And what about Jeanette? When I surveyed the waiting room on the morning of her scheduled appointment, there she was, looking as well as ever.In my office, she told me that she had been absolutely fine since Thanksgiving. When the appointment ended, she gave me a hug and wished me happy holidays.Jeanette — and I — had guessed right.'"
"'06-04-11,'0','THE FACTS Up until about 1970, millions of glow-in-the-dark watches sold in the United States were made with radium, a radioactive substance that was painted on watch dials to give them their characteristic luminosity.Radium was eventually banned after scores of dial painters died from cancer and various ghastly ailments. But many of the so-called radium watches are still around today, considered antiques and even prized as collectibles. The watches are likely to emit as much radiation today as they did when they were first manufactured, but experts say that in reality, the risk to wearers is probably low.One study by the Public Health Service many years ago found that a person who wears a radium watch for 24 hours a day over the course of a year could conceivably be exposed to 65 to 130 millirems of radiation.By way of comparison, the average person is exposed to about 300 millirems of background radiation in a typical year, and a single chest X-ray exposes a patient to about 5 to 10 millirems of radiation.That means a person who owns a radium watch (and presumably isn't wearing it 24 hours a day), has little to worry about, said Dr. M. Donald Blaufox, the chairman of the department of nuclear medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. A radium watch becomes hazardous only when someone opens one and tinkers with the dials, inhaling radioactive dust particles.THE BOTTOM LINE Watches and clocks made with radium are considered safe so long as they remain intact.'"
"'06-04-11,'0','Through 2003, the money recovered from Medicaid abuse cases brought by Mr. Spitzer's office was about average or well below average compared with other states, depending on the measuring stick used. But those figures were far higher than what was collected under Mr. Spitzer's predecessor, and collections by his Medicaid enforcement team have soared since 2003.Mr. Suozzi said in an interview that Mr. Spitzer had focused more on prosecuting fraud in places like Wall Street, which are not the traditional terrain of a state attorney general. Medicaid ""was never made the cause célèbre that the attorney general made other causes,"" Mr. Suozzi said, adding, ""I think it was a bad choice.""The Spitzer camp says it took over an office that did not previously attempt to bring ambitious fraud cases, which take years to build. ""We planted all these seeds years ago, and now we're reaping the harvest,"" said Peter Pope, deputy attorney general in charge of the criminal division. ""We've reconceived the way things are done, and we've been successful.""Experts around the country praise New York's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, part of Mr. Spitzer's office, and they caution that state-by-state comparisons can be misleading. They also cite factors, like the laws available in each state, that appear to put Mr. Spitzer at a disadvantage.""New York's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit does very well. They do very good work,"" said Barbara Zelner, counsel for the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units. ""They are a national leader.""Still, Mr. Spitzer often seems sensitive to any criticism of the state's Medicaid program, insisting on making the distinctions between criminal fraud, abuses that are not criminal, and mere waste.On Saturday, he said of efforts to restrain the growth of Medicaid spending, ""Anyone who tells you that antifraud efforts alone are enough just isn't leveling with you.""Earlier last week, he told a group in Manhattan that in Medicaid, ""98 percent of that money, I would venture to say, is spent where it's supposed to be."" He added: ""The notion that 10 percent is fraud I think is probably overstated.""Mr. Suozzi pounced on that statement, saying Mr. Spitzer was not admitting that Medicaid fraud was a problem. He scoffed at the suggestion that just 2 percent is lost to fraud, insisting that the real figure is at least 10 percent. Even 2 percent, he noted, would be almost $900 million a year -- several times the amount Mr. Spitzer's office recovers.New York has the nation's most expensive Medicaid program, at $44.5 billion a year. Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia have Medicaid Fraud Control Units, which receive federal funds, and again, New York's is the largest. It prosecutes people for criminal frauds and for abuse of nursing home residents, and sues for repayment of Medicaid money.Before Mr. Spitzer took office in 1999, New York's Medicaid fraud unit collected less money than the units of most states, relative to the size of their Medicaid programs and their fraud units, according to annual reports from the federal Department of Health and Human Services.In the last two full fiscal years under Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco, a Republican who was Mr. Spitzer's predecessor, and the 1999 federal fiscal year, which was split between Mr. Vacco and Mr. Spitzer, New York's Medicaid fraud unit recovered about $10.6 million a year.From 2000 to 2003, New York averaged about $35.5 million a year. Compared with the size of New York's Medicaid budget, that was a slightly better percentage of recovery than the national average; compared with the size of New York's Medicaid fraud unit, it was worse than average, but not near the bottom.Mr. Suozzi said that through 2003, the performance of that unit under Mr. Spitzer was ""the worst in the country,"" though when that claim was questioned, he amended it to ""the worst of any large state."" But the data do not appear to support him.New York's collections jumped to $85.5 million and then $219.1 million in the 2004 and 2005 fiscal years, according to Mr. Spitzer's office. The federal government has not yet published reports for those years, but officials in other states who have seen preliminary numbers say New York's recoveries were the largest.New York's figures for the 2006 fiscal year will break last year's record, thanks to a settlement with Serono Inc., the maker of an AIDS drug, which will pay the state $171 million. That was a case in which the federal government and the states worked together, and it resulted in payments to every state.Mr. Suozzi said that New York should not claim credit for such multistate cases, because the federal government takes the lead role.But such settlements accounted for only about one-quarter of New York's collections in the last fiscal year; even without them, the state would have collected far more than any other state. In the Serono case, ""the attorney who led the team for the states was from New York's attorney general's office,"" said Ms. Zelner, the counsel for the national association.Officials around the country say that Mr. Spitzer's numbers would look much better if he did not lack a crucial weapon: a law that allows individuals to sue for Medicaid fraud.Fifteen states, including California, Texas and Florida, and the federal government have such laws, which allow prosecutors to join the whistle-blower suits, bring many more cases to their attention and give them greater powers to subpoena records.""I would be crippled without it,"" said Mark Thomas, chief deputy attorney general in Florida. Officials in Texas say that more than 90 percent of their Medicaid fraud cases originate with whistle-blower suits. Mr. Spitzer has asked New York's Legislature since 2001 to pass such a law.He may be at another disadvantage in that many Medicaid fraud cases originate in state health departments. Federal regulations prohibit prosecutors from looking through Medicaid billing databases without some prior indication of wrongdoing; only the health agencies are allowed to do so. Mr. Spitzer has asked that the rule be changed.An investigation last year by The New York Times found that New York's Department of Health had cut back sharply on Medicaid fraud investigations.'"
"'06-04-11,'0','AT 37, Fritz Galette, a psychologist in New York City, is well versed in the fine points of estate planning and protecting assets, topics that his parents, who immigrated to the United States from Haiti about 40 years ago and now live in Brooklyn, know little about.""One of the things I have observed with immigrant parents,"" he said, ""is that their main goal was getting a house and getting us through college so that we would be in a better place than they were. They didn't have a plan beyond that.""Dr. Galette's plans, on the other hand, go well beyond his parents' goals. While he and his wife, Helen, a lawyer who is also 37, are saving assiduously for the education of their two children, ages 1 and 3, they also have a retirement plan. The couple, who live on Staten Island, have a strategy that involves real estate investment (""By the time of retirement I intend to have a number of properties that could be used as leverage in the long term,"" he said) and a steady increase in the amount of money they are putting into their retirement accounts. The $250 a week they now set aside should grow, he said, to 10 percent to 15 percent of their combined income, which currently ranges from $170,000 to $250,000 a year. Dr. Galette hopes to have saved more than $1 million by the time he retires, which he suspects will be when he is between 55 and 65, he said.Not that retirement doesn't mean work. ""In retirement,"" he said, ""I would not have to work for survival, but would volunteer for pleasure.""But he has another concern: his parents, who are in their 70's. While his mother still works as a nurse, his father, a former machinist for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has retired.""We're starting to have to take care of them,"" he said. ""We change light bulbs, help with the upkeep of their house.""'"
"'06-04-11,'0','Which is why she jumped at the chance to portray such a hillbilly Off Broadway in the Culture Project's production of ""Guardians,"" a deliberately provocative two-character play by Peter Morris. In alternating, bizarrely colliding monologues, it explores the Abu Ghraib prison scandal from the perspectives of an opportunistic British tabloid journalist (the Golden Globe nominee Lee Pace), who fakes torture photos to advance his career, and a disgraced yet defiant American soldier (Ms. Moennig) facing a court-martial for posing in torture photos at the Iraq prison where she was stationed. Any resemblance to Private Lynndie R. England is purely intentional.""That was the tricky part,"" said Ms. Moennig, who said she studied television clips of Ms. England and read her recent comments from prison. ""Not necessarily to imitate her. I knew the character wasn't solely based on her. We don't look alike, and I can't say Lynndie England has the most vivacious personality. When I first heard about the scandal, I thought, 'How could a girl do something like this?' ""Since taking on the play, Ms. Moennig has revised those thoughts. ""It's all about power, and how desperate people do desperate things,"" she said. ""The message is so clear: that power can be completely misplaced, and, because of that, a lot of things go wrong. I fell in love with this character: she doesn't play the victim, and she's unapologetic.""She is, from the start, similar to what Ms. Moennig said her ""L Word"" character is becoming in the show's third season: ""an open wound.""The play's director, Jason Moore, better known for his lighter side as the Tony-nominated director of ""Avenue Q,"" said, ""Kate got the part because she possesses, among other great things, the thing I value most in an actor: fearlessness. And this part demands it.""In ""Guardians,"" Ms. Moennig's primary wardrobe consists of a voluminous orange prison jumpsuit. She wears no makeup, and her hair is scraped into an unflattering ponytail. She calls it ""exciting"" to play a part ""where I could get my hair off my face, and let my eyebrows grow in.""""I can't even put acting on television and acting in this play in the same category,"" she continued. ""This is taking me out of my comfort zone.""Pleading privacy, Ms. Moennig makes it a personal policy to keep her own sexual orientation under wraps.""It's not for the sake of being mysterious; it's really that I believe it's nobody's business,"" she said. ""I've seen up close what can happen when actors talk publicly about their relationships: their personal life gets dismantled. It's a show business game, and it's one game I won't play."" The same goes for talking about her relationships with a couple of A-list relatives in the business, Gwyneth Paltrow (her cousin) and Blythe Danner (her aunt). Ms. Moennig makes it clear that her career has not been fast-forwarded by nepotism.""Thus far, I've never been in a position to pick and choose my roles,"" she said. ""I have to eat, and I have bills to pay."" She found herself in the final rounds of auditions for the role in ""Boys Don't Cry"" that won Hilary Swank an Oscar. But she understands why she did not get the role. ""I was green as grass,"" she said. ""Besides, the bitter pill is a waste of time. All it does is make you want to take a nap.""When she got her ""L Word"" role, she hadn't worked in a year. ""I liked the risk that was behind it, but I thought, 'This can either fly or flop,' "" she observed.It flew. And, she said, the ensemble cast behaves like an ensemble even when off-camera: ""I look at them as my sisters.""In ""Guardians,"" she is on her own. It is a risky venture of a different sort: darkly satiric, intermittently shocking, caustic to the core. ""Just the amount of dialogue I had to learn was a challenge, and then everything behind the dialogue is a challenge unto itself,"" Ms. Moennig explained. ""It's not like there's the chance to pull the wool over anybody's eyes with this character. It's bare bones. I was terrified to take the part -- which is exactly why I knew I had to do it.""'"
"'06-04-11,'0','Mr. Thompson has criticized the deal from the start because it was not competitively bid, and he sued unsuccessfully to block it -- although a judge agreed with him that the city had failed to ""follow proper procedures"" and that deals involving intellectual property, like the Snapple arrangement, were subject to the committee's oversight.Last month, the marketing corporation told the panel that it had fallen far short of its target of selling a million cases a year. Only 50,000 cases were sold in the first year, and 70,000 cases are estimated for the second year, ending this month.The corporation was created in July 2003 and given a $1.2 million start-up loan from the city's Economic Development Corporation. By the end of last June, according to the audit, it had raised about $8.4 million and spent about $8.3 million.The audit found that the marketing corporation had reported its revenues and expenses accurately and had not misspent its money. But it found that the agency had a cash surplus of $1.6 million at the end of last June and argued that most, if not all, of that money should have been turned over to the city. The agency replied that it needed the money to help pay $1.7 million in bills.By the end of June, the marketing agency had earned $507,171 in sales commissions under the Snapple deal. After a 7 percent commission paid to Octagon, a sports and entertainment marketing company, the agency split the rest evenly between itself and the city. The audit called that decision ""arbitrary and self-serving,"" but the marketing commission maintained that the 50-50 split ""strictly adheres"" to an agreement with the city.The audit also argued that there was ""a lack of effective oversight that would provide proper accountability of city funds."" The mayor's Office of Management and Budget replied that it used ""commonly practiced methods for financial analysis, including human interaction.""The marketing commission released a chart asserting that since 2003, it had generated $1.2 million from the Snapple deal; $900,000 from a partnership with the History Channel; $2.7 million from the Country Music Association Awards and $950,000 through licensing arrangements, like permits for T-shirts and paraphernalia with Fire Department and Police Department emblems. Mr. Thompson maintained that the agency was improperly taking credit for activities that predated it.The marketing commission is opening a competition today for an ""official express and ground-delivery"" carrier. The winner will ""provide exclusive shipping services"" for many city agencies and, in exchange, give discounts to companies registered with the Department of Small Business Services. Responses are due in May, and the winner will be selected in December.""It's good to see the city pursuing competitive bidding instead of another ambitious blunder,"" Mr. Thompson said.'"

"'06-04-11,'0','Since last fall (with the exception of a few weeks around Thanksgiving and Christmas), business travelers have practically had the roads to themselves. No matter where they ventured, they found they were either among native drivers who knew their way around town or among other frequent travelers who knew how to behave on the road.But now, these experienced motorists must contend with out-of-town drivers who are often distracted, lost or in a hurry.Business travelers, determined to gain the upper hand, are turning to a new weapon in the battle for asphalt supremacy: the defensive driving class. Not the kind of course drivers take when they get a speeding ticket, mind you, but an intense, hands-on driving experience that shows them how to stay safe -- and to steer clear of the bad drivers.""When do I pass? How do I brake?"" said Kjell Kallman, the vice president and general manager of the Jim Russell Racing Schools in Sonoma, Calif., which offers a defensive driving class that attracts many business travelers. ""Those are the kinds of skills we teach. How do you prevent an accident? How do you avoid a collision?""Interest in the school's defensive driving seminars has steadily increased, Mr. Kallman said, because business travelers are worried about the motorists around them.Ronnie Meneses, a pilot for the California Highway Patrol in Sonoma, who completed the school's defensive driving course, said he regularly saw out-of-town motorists engaging in reckless behavior. Sonoma, in California's wine country, is a year-round tourist destination, so there is less of a seasonal influx of visitors. ""You see them dialing and talking,"" he said. ""They're on the phone; they can't maintain their lane position; they're driving too slow or too fast. Just being on the same road with these drivers can be dangerous.""Mr. Dylewski, the videotape editor who also publishes a Web site about road trips called the American Roadside (theamericanroadside.com), said he did not believe that vacationers were entirely to blame. Often, the street signs are unclear, he said. Pittsburgh's roads, for example, are confusing even to native drivers. ""I really feel their pain,"" he said. ""When I see someone driving erratically, my first thought is, 'They're lost.' Then I look down and I see a Michigan, New York or Massachusetts license plate.""Not everyone is as understanding. When I lived in the Florida Keys, one of the most popular bumper stickers asked the question, ""If it's tourist season, why can't we shoot them?""A driving course is unable to protect a business traveler in every situation, of course. Ted J. Johnson, a consultant who lives in Brooklyn, recalled the motorist who made a wrong turn into the Holland Tunnel in rush hour last summer. When the driver realized he was heading in the wrong direction, he stopped and tried to undo the mistake.""He was backing up out of the tunnel,"" recalled Mr. Johnson, who was on foot at the time. ""It was a concert of horns."" Then, Mr. Johnson said, ""I looked down and saw the Pennsylvania plates.""'"

"'06-04-11,'0','The newly named chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary, the heart of Conservative Judaism in America, said yesterday that he felt it was time for the movement to lift its ban on gay rabbis.The seminary yesterday appointed Arnold M. Eisen, a Stanford University professor who is not a rabbi but is considered one of the country's leading scholars of modern Judaism, to be its next leader. The decision comes at a time when the movement is grappling with a range of difficult issues, including dwindling membership and whether to sanction same-sex unions or to allow gay people to become rabbis.Conservative Judaism is defined by its commitment to traditional observance of Jewish law, while also adapting to modernity and contemporary changes in religious practice. But it has been beset by questions of what might happen if it moved to liberalize its stance on homosexuality, with some arguing that Conservative Judaism is becoming too similar to Reform Judaism and too accommodating to the prevailing culture. Others argue that the change is long overdue, and that the movement will continue to lose people if it does not alter its position on the issues.The seminary's chancellor has traditionally exerted enormous influence on the movement's direction, and Dr. Eisen's predecessor, Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, had long opposed any change in the movement's stance on gay rabbis and same-sex unions.Yesterday, during a half-hour interview at the seminary, in Morningside Heights, Dr. Eisen outlined some of his priorities, including reinvigorating synagogue life and strengthening the connection of American Jews to Israel. He did not hedge when asked what he thought about gay rabbis.'"
"'06-04-11,'0','Mrs. Clinton was cheered early in the four-hour rally when she thanked the rallying immigrants for their everyday work. ""Your faces are the faces of those who give us a fair day's work -- and often not for a fair day's pay,"" she said.Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat and New York's senior senator, extended the thanks back in history to ""the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have made New York City the great city that it is.""""The reason America is different from other countries is that we take new immigrants and turn them into Americans in one generation,"" he said. ""Every immigrant has had the guts, the gumption, the fortitude to say, 'I'm going to make a better life for my family in America.' ""Sarah Jones, an African-American actress who portrays more than a dozen immigrants, including a Pakistani accountant, in her one-woman Broadway show, ""Bridge & Tunnel,"" said some people were always trying to pit blacks and immigrants against each other.""But I'm with you,"" she declared, her image projected on a giant screen behind the speaker's stand, her words broadcast live on Spanish-language radio. ""I'm glad to represent immigrants on the Great White Way of Broadway.""At its height, the rally stretched along Broadway from City Hall for a dozen blocks, beyond Canal Street, as thousands converged from Chatham Square in Chinatown, Washington Square Park and over the Brooklyn Bridge from Cadman Plaza. A spokesman for Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, one of many organized labor groups that joined with grass-roots immigrant groups in planning the rally, estimated that 125,000 people participated. Other observers put it at more like 70,000.Certainly it fell well short of rallies in cities where the population of illegal immigrants is overwhelmingly from Mexico. In contrast, New York demographers like to point out, no one ethnic group predominates in the city's immigrant population of more than three million, even among Hispanics, who make up about a third. Moreover, 80 percent of the city's immigrants are in the United States legally, compared with about 50 percent in many other states.""I've been here like 15 years and I'm still a resident, not a citizen, because it takes longer and it's more expensive,"" said Priscilla Molina, a hotel housekeeper from El Salvador who applied for a ""floating day"" of vacation just to attend the rally with other members of her union, Unite Here. ""We work hard, we pay taxes every year. We want all the immigrants to get to be citizens.""Nearby, between a woman from Guinea with a red, white and blue headdress and a man chanting ""education, not deportation,"" Birima Mboop, 54, who left Senegal 22 years ago, explained why he had left his stall in Harlem selling T-shirts and sunglasses to join the protest.""I don't have my green card,"" he said. ""I tried in 2001, but they tell me to wait. I want to bring my family here.""May Chen, a vice president of Unite Here who uses her Harvard education to organize immigrant workers in factories and hotels, told the crowd that ""a temporary guest-worker program that simply provides a cheap labor source for employers"" was unacceptable.""The road ahead is complex and dangerous,"" she said. ""Any major change in our immigration laws will surely impact all of us for the next generation.""For some, just showing up took courage. One man who marched on the Brooklyn Bridge, Manuel Gomez, 32, a carpenter, acknowledged that as an illegal immigrant, he was nervous about showing his face. ""But we have no choice,"" he said.Mr. Gomez said that he had not been home to Cuenca, Ecuador, since 1990. He talked of when his father died two months ago, and how he could not go back for the funeral. ""I haven't seen my mother in 16 years,"" he said. ""It hurts on my heart.""One of those waiting for him at City Hall Park was a burly asbestos-removal worker, Alheen Plummer, 40, who was carrying signs from his union as well as his sign suggesting that the Pilgrims lacked immigration papers.""I'm American myself,"" he said. ""I'm just here in support of the immigrants in our union, because they're hard workers, they're good people. They deserve a chance to stay here in America.""'"

And they plan on saving vigorously for an early retirement, she said, which ideally will begin in their late 40's or early 50's, giving them plenty of time to play golf, travel and enjoy the teenage years of their daughter, who is now 11 months old. In general, they intend to lead ""a similar lifestyle as we have now, but with not as much pressure.""

"'06-04-12,'1','NEW ORLEANS, April 12 — Federal officials issued unexpectedly lenient guidelines today for rebuilding the flood-damaged homes of New Orleans, potentially allowing tens of thousands of homeowners to return to their neighborhoods at costs far less than they had feared.Under the government recommendations issued here today, huge swaths of homes may still have to be raised at least three feet off the ground, or risk getting no federal building money or insurance. But the announcement, anxiously anticipated here for months as a critical step in rebuilding this still-ravaged area, was nonetheless greeted with some relief by local officials and residents. They had feared that, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic flooding, the government would demand that some houses be raised as much as 10 feet, at enormous expense.The lesser requirement assumes that the area's damaged and faulty levee system will be solidly reconstructed, and to that end federal officials also announced today that most of the flood walls here — the walls that sit on top of levees, in places where massive earthen structures are not practical — would be torn down, some 36 miles of them, and replaced. The cost for that and other levee improvements is $2.5 billion, which the Bush administration will now actively seek from Congress.Mostly, officials here were relieved that homeowners can finally get on with rebuilding, now that the federal house-raising requirement is known.""I would view it as good news, and I would view it as information that we can use to get on with planning our lives,"" said Sean Reilly, of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, the agency that will be in charge of federal rebuilding money once it reaches the state.He agreed with Donald Powell, the top federal official in charge of Gulf Coast rebuilding, who said while making the announcement here, ""The good news is, it's not a dramatic-type elevation.""'"
"'06-04-12,'1','LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) — Four British animal rights protesters have admitted to plotting to blackmail the owners of a farm that bred guinea pigs for medical research during a fierce six-year campaign, the police said Tuesday.David Hall and Partners, which ran the family business at the Darley Oaks Farm in central England, endured abuse, death threats and firebomb attacks during one of Britain's most sustained harassment campaigns by animal rights groups.In the worst episode, in October 2004, the grave of Gladys Hammond, mother-in-law of one of the co-owners who had died in 1997 at the age of 82, was dug up and her remains were stolen. They have never been found.The campaign, from 1999 to 2005, led the Hall family to announce last year that it would give up breeding guinea pigs at their farm in Newchurch, Staffordshire, and return to traditional farming.The Staffordshire police said Tuesday that Jon Ablewhite, 36, Kerry Whitburn, 36, John Smith, 39, and Josephine Mayo, 38, had admitted to conspiracy charges at hearings at Nottingham Crown Court.They will be sentenced at hearings on May 11 and 12.""These people orchestrated a long-running and unpleasant campaign to cause fear and suffering to anyone connected with Darley Oaks Farm,"" said Harry Ireland, the chief crown prosecutor of Staffordshire. ""Although the prosecution could not prove they actually physically stole the body of Gladys Hammond, they have admitted using that theft as part of their campaign.""'"
"'06-04-12,'1','CHICAGO, April 11 — At least 21 Mexican immigrants have been fired from their jobs at a meatpacking company in Detroit for missing work to attend an immigration rights march last month, advocates said Tuesday.""This to me sends a very strong message that if you try to defend your rights, there are going to be sanctions against you,"" said Elena Herrada, one of several advocates trying to organize a meeting with officials of the company, Wolverine Packing, in an effort to get some of the workers rehired.The 21 workers were fired on March 28, a day after they attended a rally that the police said drew more than 20,000 people. It was one of at least five marches and rallies in major cities that day.The Detroit affiliate of the Spanish-language television network Univision reported the firings last week.In a statement, the general manager of Wolverine Packing, Jay Bonahoom, said a ""small number"" of the more than 350 employees at three plants in the Detroit area had requested permission to attend the march and had been allowed to miss work. Employees had been notified orally and by letters posted in the plants that they would be fired if they missed work without authorization, the statement said.""Many of these issues are near and dear to our hearts and can have serious effects on our lives, but Wolverine cannot allow these issues to stop our business,"" Mr. Bonahoom said. ""When a large number of employees leave on a particular day, we cannot service our customers, and this puts all of our jobs in jeopardy.""'"
"'06-04-12,'1','ROME, April 12 — Italy's justice minister said he would not seek the extradition of 22 American C.I.A. agents accused of kidnapping a Muslim cleric, Abu Omar, from the streets of Milan and flying him to Egypt for interrogation. However, the Milan prosecutor heading up the investigation pledged to resubmit the extradition request once Italy's new government is in place.After months of deliberation, Justice Minister Roberto Castelli alerted prosecutors today that he refused to forward their request to Washington asking for the extradition of the 22 C.I.A. agents to face trial in Italy.Italian prosecutors accused 22 Americans of involvement in the February 2003 kidnapping of the cleric — Moustafa Osama Nasr, a terrorist suspect who is also known as Abu Omar. Prosecutors believe that Abu Omar was taken first to German, then to Egypt, and that he had been tortured during the interrogations.Mr. Castelli did not give the rationale for his decision, which comes just days after a general election which saw the ruling conservative government lose its re-election bid to the center-left opposition.As minister of justice under the administration of Silvio Berlusconi — one of the Bush administration's most loyal supporters in Europe —Mr. Castelli's refusal to move forward with the extradition of the agents comes as no surprise.'"

Whatever the case may be, Mr. Greifeld's $780 million bet is that exchanges globally will continue to consolidate and that Nasdaq will be a central actor in this process.""This move guarantees Nasdaq a seat at the table,"" said Douglas Atkin, the chief executive of Majestic Research, an independent research outfit. ""But I don't think John Thain has shown his hand. I would not be surprised if he comes in and makes a competing bid.""Nasdaq said yesterday that it had paid $782 million for its stake, with the bulk of the position coming from Threadneedle Asset Management, one of London's larger shareholders. A spokeswoman for the exchange described the deal as a ""strategic"" step and declined to comment further, citing British regulatory restrictions.The London Stock Exchange, under its chief executive, Clara Furse, has tried to keep its independence, but its comparatively low valuation and its robust cash flows have made it a compelling target for exchanges looking to expand overseas. With an increasing number of companies reluctant to submit to stiff United States regulatory requirements since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, London has become a popular listing alternative.""The London Stock Exchange is an all-electronic stock exchange that gives Nasdaq a global presence,"" said Richard H. Repetto, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ""There would be cost savings, too.""Having Nasdaq as its largest shareholder could well put a crimp in London's plans to link up with smaller European exchanges. Until now, London has kept its distance from Nasdaq, but will now find it increasingly difficult to do so.Nasdaq paid £11.75 a share for its 15 percent stake, 24 percent higher than its original preliminary offer of £9.50 a share that was disclosed on March 10. The price for the stake represented a 13 percent premium to the £10.385 closing price of the London Stock Exchange yesterday.In New York, shares of Nasdaq rose as much as 9 percent before closing down 1 percent, at $40.85.While some have suggested that such a price may approach if not exceed fair value for London, the broad consensus among analysts is that given the strong nature of London's business and its near monopoly status, the Nasdaq offer was a reflection of its attractive valuation compared with its European peers.In addition to Nasdaq, other exchanges in Europe made bids for London, including Deutsche Börse and Euronext. While Mr. Thain has made it known that he is interested in using the stock exchange's newly listed stock as a currency for future deals, he has yet to show his hand publicly with regard to any interest in the London exchange. Since going public on March 8, shares of the NYSE Group have risen 9 percent.'"
"'06-04-12,'1','The brittle midfielder John O'Brien got 23 recuperative minutes of playing time as he tries to regain his form after a chronic string of hamstring and groin injuries. Arena called his performance encouraging.With the European-based Americans overseas with their clubs, Tuesday's American roster was composed of players based domestically in Major League Soccer. Even though the domestic players are not yet fully fit, their season only having begun, this was essentially the last chance to impress Arena, who said that, in his mind, two to five spots remain available for the final 23-man World Cup roster.Arena will name his final roster on May 2. The United States opens play in the World Cup, to be held in Germany, against the Czech Republic on June 12.Arena opened on Tuesday with Taylor Twellman and Josh Wolff at forward. As usual, particularly as the dominant team in the North American, Central American and Caribbean region, Arena wanted his squad to pressure the Jamaicans from the beginning and unnerve the visitors with a vigorous counterattack.But the American defense suffered a breakdown after a corner kick in the fourth minute. ""Obviously, it was a very poor start on our part,"" Arena said.Defender Eddie Pope headed a corner kick to the Jamaican goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts, who tossed the ball ahead to midfielder Jermaine Hue on a swift counterattack. Hue played a splendid pass through a somnolent American midfield to the sprinting forward Teafore Bennett.Running past Frankie Hejduk, who, Arena said, did not communicate well with Pablo Mastroeni in defense, Bennett drew Meola out of the American goal and nestled a shot inside the right post from 10 yards.But the Americans kept playing aggressively. In the 25th minute, after midfielder Pat Noonan was fouled, Donovan caught Jamaica off-guard with a quick restart. He nudged a free kick to Olsen, whose low shot from 12 yards bounced off the hands of Ricketts and trickled into the goal to level the score at 1-1. The assist gave Donovan 23 for his young career, a national-team record.The Americans dominated the final 65 minutes, but still could not put the game away. Wolff had a goal nullified by an offside call in the 41st minute. Arena lamented that none of the domestic forwards have shown the scoring and possession skills of Brian McBride, who is based in England.""We haven't gotten consistent enough performances and goals out of our front-runners in 2006,"" Arena said.'"

"'06-04-12,'1','""Happy are they who don't doubt themselves and whose pens fly across the page,"" Gustave Flaubert wrote in 1847, when he was 25. ""I myself hesitate, I falter, I become angry and fearful, my drive diminishes as my taste improves, and I brood more over an ill-suited word than I rejoice over a well-proportioned paragraph.""The Flaubert who wrote those words to his mistress, Louise Colet, was a work in progress with very uncertain prospects. ""Madame Bovary"" lay more than a decade ahead. Behind stretched a miserable trail of false starts. He had a sense of mission but no real plan. One of the virtues of Frederick Brown's quietly persuasive biography is its careful documentation of Flaubert's always agonized search for a literary idea to match his aesthetic ideals. Another is its sensitivity to the complexities of his artistic personality. Flaubert was both defiant and desperate, contemptuous of fame and eager to attain it, supremely certain on questions of art yet tormented by self-doubt, an aesthetic hermit and a fixture in the Paris salons, a realist who described himself to the critic Sainte-Beuve as ""an old romantic mad dog.""Mr. Brown, the author of well-received biographies of Jean Cocteau and Émile Zola, has no overarching thesis to offer in ""Flaubert."" There are no surprises. In his own sweeping biography of Flaubert, ""The Family Idiot,"" Sartre proposed that Flaubert's epilepsy was hysterical, an unconscious strategy to free him from his impending career as a lawyer. Mr. Brown, examining the medical evidence, concludes that Flaubert was, in fact, epileptic. He is content with the data, and, accordingly, has put together a judicious work that sticks to the record and relies on expertly chosen passages from Flaubert's brilliant letters and the works of his contemporaries to develop a convincing portrait, brushstroke by brushstroke.The Flaubert who emerges is much less isolated than the aloof ascetic of popular imagination, the cool disciple of absolute form, drawn, as he once put it, ""to the pure line, the prominent curve, the loud color, the ringing note."" Flaubert did an excellent job of advertising his distaste for modern life, contemporary politics and the thousand and one vulgarities that he captured in his fiction with scientific precision.Yet, as Mr. Brown shows, Flaubert was an effective operator when it came to pulling strings and working the government for favors, usually on behalf of deserving friends. He was capable of pulling off a business deal. And he cut an impressive figure in the Parisian social world populated by writers, artists, powerful courtesans and government officials. ""Action has always revolted me,"" he once wrote. ""But when I have had to, or chosen to, I have acted decisively, quickly and well.""'"

"'06-04-13,'1','In an interview posted on the State Department's Web site, which features a picture of Ali in an amateur match, he was quoted as saying: ""I didn't judge the American people while in Iraq. I waited until I came here to judge them, and the American people have been the best people out of any I have met.""Ali has since learned that what was good enough to be promoted by the State Department during the Olympics is not necessarily good enough to qualify for a student visa. Since he lost in the second round at the Olympics, Ali, who holds a bachelor's degree in computer science from Alrafdean University in Baghdad, has been denied a student visa on four occasions, the first time in Athens.Iraqis other than diplomatic or government officials and international civil servants, or those on exchanges financed by Washington, must file visa applications at a United States Embassy or Consulate outside the country. Three times since the Olympics, Ali said, he made the dangerous 500-mile trek by bus from Baghdad to the embassy in Amman, Jordan. Each time, after an interview with a consular official and paying a $100 application fee and about $400 in travel expenses, Ali said, his application was denied.""It makes me really sad,"" he said this week in a telephone interview from Baghdad. ""It makes me think, you know, what is wrong with me?""Ali was accepted to an intensive English program at the University of Houston and hoped to obtain a master's degree in computer science there. IBM has expressed interest in employing him at its offices in Egypt.""He's as well-qualified as any we've seen,"" Dave Burns, an international student counselor at the Language and Culture Center at the University of Houston, said of Ali. They met for an interview at the university while Ali was training for the Olympics, and Burns found him to be smart, polite and driven.""It's really a shame we can't have him here,"" Burns said.Ali's sponsor for his student visa was his Olympic boxing trainer, Maurice Watkins, a former 140-pound title contender from Houston who goes by the name Termite and who first went to Iraq as a pest controller. Watkins, who said he recently sold the film rights to a book he had written about his experiences in Iraq and the Olympics, described his relationship to Ali as ""like father and son."" He has vowed to pay for Ali's tuition and housing while he studies.Training together, Watkins and Ali traveled to Pakistan, Britain, Houston and ultimately to the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, where Ali and other Iraqis prepared alongside American athletes. Watkins said it was hypocritical and unfair that State Department officials had rejected Ali's application for a student visa after the agency sought to promote him during the Games.""This kid put himself in danger, his family in danger, and went on the line by going to bat for this country when it needed him,"" Watkins said by telephone. ""Now, when he needs them, where are they? They're nowhere, man. Nowhere.""Officials at the State Department said Watkins's criticism was misguided. Nina Bishop, director of the International Sports Initiative, the branch of the State Department that worked with the United States Olympic Committee to finance training for Ali and other Iraqis before the Athens Games, said that linking Ali's interviews surrounding the Olympics with his failed student visa applications was like comparing apples and oranges.Student visa applications should be decided on the merits alone, she said. Most applicants also receive them. In 2005, more than 75 percent of about 530,000 student visa applications were granted, according to the State Department.Nicole Deaner, a spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Cultural and Educational Affairs, said it was standard practice for the agency to coordinate news media interviews for exchange participants like Ali, as long as they are willing.According to e-mail correspondence among Watkins, Bishop and Olympic officials, United States Embassy officials in Athens sought to ""inspire some coverage"" of the Iraqis and ""get some media interest in stories about these athletes.""In an e-mail message to Pamela Durham, an embassy official in Athens, dated Aug. 10, 2004, Bishop provided contact information for Watkins and said that Ali ""speaks great English, does a great interview.""Citing confidentiality laws, officials said they could not disclose reasons for Ali's rejections. Elizabeth Corwin, press officer for the embassy in Athens, where Ali first applied for a student visa, said in an e-mail message that Ali ""did not convince the interviewing officer that he was a qualified student who would depart the U.S. once his studies were complete.""In another e-mail message sent to colleagues and obtained by The New York Times, Kathryn Berck, a consular official in Athens, said that Ali contended during his visa interview that he feared returning to Iraq because his highly publicized Olympic bid had put his life in danger. Ali could not articulate his educational goals and ""does not appear to be a serious student,"" Berck wrote.Watkins, who accompanied Ali to the embassy in Athens for his visa interview, said that officials' accounts of what transpired there were inaccurate. Although State Department officials said Ali was given a formal interview, Watkins said he and Ali waited four hours, then got to speak for only 5 to 10 minutes with someone behind a glass partition.""Everyone else was getting a sit-down interview in a private room -- everyone except us,"" Watkins said. ""How could Najah prove he was a serious student? He never had the chance.""Watkins also said that he, not Ali, had told the consular official that Ali's life was in danger in Iraq.In an e-mail message, Ali wrote that he did not intend to emigrate: ""i will go back to iraq. i am from a good family.""In his travels to Amman, Ali wrote, interviews with consular officials went well. He added that life in Iraq was dangerous for him because he could speak English. Ali's vocal support of the United States had made him and his family targets, Watkins said.After making three trips to Jordan -- the last time in March -- and spending about $2,000, Ali said in a recent e-mail message that he was no longer sure he wanted to study in Houston. He took a job at a small computer company in Baghdad and said he wanted to start building a steady life there. He stays in e-mail contact with Watkins, who has vowed to bring him to the United States to perfect his English, obtain his master's degree and perhaps play himself in Watkins's movie.If the visa process fails when he is eligible to reapply in the fall, Watkins said, he would find Ali an American woman to marry. He has also scouted mosques around Houston, so Ali would have a place to pray when he moves. Ali seems dejected.As he wrote, ""i dont knwo what we will do but what i know its going harder on me day by day.""'"

"'06-04-13,'1','The most ambitious initiative involves showing art from the Louvre at the High Museum over a three-year period, starting in October, with nine temporary exhibitions built around three themes: the royal collections from François I to Louis XVI; the treasures of ancient civilizations; and ""The Louvre Today and Tomorrow,"" focusing on the museum's new openness to the world.The Louvre will send the real stuff. Among masterpieces traveling to Atlanta are Raphael's ""Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione,"" Rembrandt's ""St. Matthew and Angel,"" Velázquez's ""Infanta María Margarita,"" Murillo's ""Young Beggar"" and Poussin's ""Et in Arcadia Ego."" To these can be added Greek statues, Roman sculptures, exquisite drawings and more.The Louvre will share its permanent collection, while the High Museum has found private and commercial sponsors to cover the $18 million cost of the program. And to sweeten the deal, American sponsors will contribute $6.4 million toward the refurbishment of the Louvre's 18th-century French furniture galleries.Many in France's cultural establishment have what might be called an ideological distaste for linking public art and private money. While in practice French museums routinely seek corporate sponsorship for exhibitions, anything approaching the American model of privately financed culture sets off alarm bells.Thus, when details of the Louvre's agreement with the High Museum were released first in the United States, suspicions were raised here that something odd was afoot. ""In France, it is a state secret,"" an art critic, Didier Rykner, proclaimed on his Web site in January. One newspaper, La Croix, went further, saying the Louvre was preparing to ""rent out"" its art.For Mr. Loyrette, who announced the program on April 4, this is much ado about nothing.""It's a very French polemic,"" he said, ""the difficulty we have in discussing money, the difficulty we have in recognizing that culture has a price. The American sponsors find it totally normal to make a contribution.""Money was hardly his motivation. Rather, he said, when he arrived at the Louvre in 2001, he set out to increase the Louvre's ties with the United States. (In 2003, for example, he supported creation of the American Friends of the Louvre.) In this case, he went on, the aim was to expand relations with American museums to include those of major regional cities, like Atlanta.""Our exchanges are usually linked to temporary shows, one-offs, where there is hard work and little follow-up,"" he said. ""Here we will have time to reflect, to share experiences in education and research. It has also given the Louvre's departments the new experience of working together.""It is no less a novelty, though, for the Louvre to open its doors to American art.Until now, the relationship has been asymmetrical. Not only did droves of American artists study in France in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but American museums are also full of French art. In contrast, the Louvre has only three American paintings in its collection, something that Mr. Loyrette considers ""scandalous.""So, from June 14 through Sept. 18, working with the Terra Foundation, the Louvre will display 30 paintings by American artists who were inspired by the Louvre. These will include works by Benjamin West and George Catlin in a 1760-1860 section and by James McNeill Whistler, Thomas Eakins and Edward Hopper for the period through 1940.Outside the Louvre, these artists are more visible. The National Museum of Franco-American Cooperation at Blérancourt is currently under renovation, but the Terra Foundation also runs the Musée d'Art Américain in Giverny, a stone's throw from Monet's last studio. And there, this summer's show will be ""Winslow Homer: Poet of the Sea.""But the Louvre has more up its sleeve. Coinciding with ""American Artists at the Louvre,"" the museum has invited the American artist Mike Kelley to create a work for its gallery Salle de la Maquette. Then, in November, the American writer Toni Morrison will offer a personal interpretation of the history and art of the Louvre around the theme ""A Stranger in His Home.""For Mr. Loyrette, then, the message is clear. He welcomes visitors who want to track ""The Da Vinci Code"" through the Grande Galerie, but he also believes that in cultural terms France and the United States can do more for each other. At least, that is what he wants to demonstrate this year. ""What is easy is if you never do anything new,"" he noted. ""No one will hold it against you.""'"
"'06-04-13,'1','In all, Mr. Ghosn estimates carmakers are spending $60 billion a year on incentives -- enough to develop 120 new vehicles, at a cost of $500 million apiece.Such rebates and other plans are depressing the resale value of automakers' products, ruining their brand images and eroding the attraction that automobiles have traditionally had for buyers, Mr. Ghosn said. Because of that, he said, the car buying process has become ""less involving, less personal and less emotional.""Consumers, he said, are in danger of being more in love with their Blackberrys, TiVo devices and high- definition television sets than they are with their cars. ""The auto industry is in competition for the attention and affection in the minds of consumers,"" he said.To fix that, Mr. Ghosn said, it was critical that car companies reinstill passion in developing new cars and trucks, which in turn will lead troubled automakers back to profitability.He said Nissan adopted that strategy in its turnaround, which helped the company rebound from a $3 billion loss in 1999 to an expected profit of $4.5 billion for the 2005 fiscal year, which ended March 31.Nissan is now in the planning stages of its next strategy, which it expects to unveil one year from now, he said.Mr. Ghosn said the plan would require the company to stretch even more than it has since it nearly went bankrupt in 1999. Mr. Ghosn, however, said he did not need a crisis to motivate Nissan's troops.""Obviously, you need to systematically stretch your organization and stretch your people in order to be able to accomplish more,"" he said. ""But frankly, I would prefer to be in this situation, which is a solid financial base, a solid product plan, a solid management experience for the past six years, a solid recovery story which gives you confidence.""A critical part of Nissan's next phase will be an overhaul of its lineup, which was completely restyled during the first years of its turnaround efforts, lifting its worldwide sales.On Wednesday, Nissan showed new versions of the Infiniti G35, a luxury sedan, and the midsize Nissan Altima, which competes against the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord family cars. The Altima will be available in a hybrid-electric version, Nissan's first.Critics have said it may be more difficult for the second group of vehicles to be successful, given the stiff pace of industry competition. Moreover, the automaker is facing the disruption of relocating its American headquarters from Southern California to Nashville, a move that has prompted a number of senior leaders to leave the company.But Mr. Ghosn remained confident that Nissan can keep moving forward. ""You're going to be able to judge,"" he said.""If you consider that these cars are faint copies, or faint copies or faint improvement, you can say that we have become complacent,"" he said. But ""if you see another big step forward with these products, you will know that we are still very hungry.""Mr. Ghosn's ability to articulate and carry out bold strategies has won praise from Jerome B. York, the newest director at General Motors, which lost $10.8 billion in 2005 when its market share fell to the lowest level since the Depression.Mr. Ghosn has repeatedly been mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed G.M.'s embattled chief executive, Rick Wagoner, who recently won the backing of the G.M. board. Although maintaining he is not interested in the job, Mr. Ghosn said he thought an outsider could lead G.M.""I think that there is no penalty for any carmaker who is faced with that situation to have someone from the outside to fix their problem,"" he said.The most important thing, he said, was to work closely with a company's employees. ""Then, together, you can find solutions,"" Mr. Ghosn said.Nor does Mr. Ghosn see the need for the top executive to be schooled in finance, like Mr. Wagoner, who has an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.""The background doesn't matter.""

As soon as the curtain rose at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night, the stage, awash in vivid blue, was a veritable explosion of frenetic hips and pulsating drums. It was euphoric.The haunting paradox is found in the biographies of the performers, nearly all orphaned by the devastating AIDS epidemic and civil war in the region. The baby of the troupe, Miriam Namala, 6, lost her father to AIDS when she was an infant; her mother is H.I.V.-positive, but in her rendition of ""Titi Katitila,"" she commanded the stage with an uncanny maturity. Her sweet voice and slyly silky movement, executed while balancing a pot on her head, seemed to emanate from a profound inner vibration. The song she sang was about how one sleeps better after seeing a friend.Simply but beautifully lighted by Darren W. McCroom and featuring 16 scenes, the show is produced by the Uganda Children's Charity Foundation and directed by Peter Kasule, a founding member of the group, which began in 1996. Serving as an elegant tour guide, Mr. Kasule discussed the origins of dances while extolling the virtues of Uganda.The second act, which had a tendency to drag, included audience participation: Mr. Kasule choreographed a dance heavy on arm-waving for an enthusiastic crowd of seated participants. But the show was revived in the finale, ""Bakisimba,"" a traditional court dance that featured the entire company, hips quivering as the performers, low to the floor, shifted weight from side to side, invigorating the scene with that elusive thing called joy.There may be charming children in the group; the girls in particular exuded a liberating power that wasn't lost on a pair of young blondes in the audience who wildly practiced some steps during intermission. But above all, this is a professional company. In none of Mr. Kasule's speeches was there a mention of AIDS. Along with art, Children of Uganda is a celebration of dignity.Performances continue through Sunday at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 242-0800.'"
"'06-04-13,'1','But it was as the outspoken chaplain at Yale in the tumultuous years when the Vietnam War was escalating that Dr. Coffin's name became known across America. While he questioned the wisdom of the war almost from the start, he came only slowly to a decision to apply to this cause the same tactics of civil disobedience he had already engaged in on behalf of the struggle for integration in the South.Yet when he did, the spectacle he created -- the chaplain of an Ivy League university counseling students that they were right to resist the draft, and accepting their draft cards to be turned in to the Justice Department -- so infuriated the Johnson administration that Attorney General Ramsey Clark, himself a prominent liberal, sought to imprison him.In one of the most celebrated trials of the day, Dr. Coffin, Dr. Benjamin Spock and three others were accused of conspiracy to encourage draft evasion. Dr. Coffin, Dr. Spock and two others were convicted, but the verdicts were overturned on appeal. The case became a cause célèbre for the antiwar left and civil libertarians, who considered the prosecution's eventual failure an incomplete vindication of the right of free speech.Dr. Coffin had a distinctive view of his own role as a dissenter. His argument with American social practices and political policies, he said, was that of a partner engaged in a ""lovers' quarrel."" It was a position he could claim almost as a birthright, considering his lineage and the patrician positions he held.His forebears traced to the Pilgrims, and his father, also named William Sloane Coffin, was a vice president of W. & J. Sloane, the furniture manufacturers, and president of the board of trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His uncle, the Rev. Henry Sloane Coffin, was president of Union Theological Seminary and the principal influence on his entry into the ministry.And for almost all of Dr. Coffin's adult life, his service was performed in one or another institution near the heart of power and prestige: the Central Intelligence Agency, Andover, Williams College, Yale, and then Riverside Church, which had been built as an interdenominational house of worship with financing from John D. Rockefeller Jr.So if Dr. Coffin preached on behalf of the poor and the downtrodden, he did so to the most prominent and talented of parishioners.His enthusiastic ministry to the Vietnam generation at Yale prompted a Yale alumnus of those years, the cartoonist Garry Trudeau, to gently lampoon him as the offbeat Rev. Scot Sloan (""the thoroughly modern minister/enabler"") in ""Doonesbury.""Another Yale man of the time, President Bush, has spoken of a less affectionate memory: After Mr. Bush's father lost a Senate race in 1964 to Senator Ralph Yarborough, Dr. Coffin told the young man, then a freshman, student that he knew his father and that the better man had won. (Dr. Coffin disputed the anecdote.)After Dr. Coffin left Yale, disgust on the part of alumni with his political activities was often blamed for a decline in alumni contributions. But Yale was not the only university to deal with that problem in the 1970's.Moreover, Dr. Coffin made the case that by addressing the anger, fears and frustrated idealism of the students, the Yale administration may have helped the university avoid the kind of fractures that left far deeper scars at Columbia and other universities.William Sloane Coffin Jr. was born on June 1, 1924, in Manhattan. His father and his mother, Catherine Butterfield Coffin, were rearing him, a brother and a sister in a penthouse that occupied the 15th and 16th floors of a building on East 68th Street when the father died of a heart attack in December 1933. He had slipped and fallen on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.With money less plentiful, Mrs. Coffin took the three children to Carmel-by-the-Sea in California. She also took them to Paris, where young William studied harmony in hopes of becoming a classical pianist. The interest in music continued at Phillips Academy at Andover, from which he graduated in 1942, and for a year at Yale's music school. Then he entered the Army and was sent to Europe as an infantry officer.Because of his facility with languages, he was made a liaison to the French and, later, the Russian Army. In 1946, he took part in operations to forcibly repatriate Soviet citizens who had been taken prisoner and who, once repatriated, were never heard from again. The deceptions in which he took part to gain the prisoners' trust before handing them over, he wrote in his memoir, ""Once to Every Man"" (Atheneum, 1977), ""left me a burden of guilt I am sure to carry the rest of my life.""""Certainly,"" he added, ""it influenced my decision in 1950 to spend three years in the C.I.A. opposing Stalin's regime.""His reference was to the years of the Korean War, which he spent in the C.I.A. after being recruited by a brother-in-law who was a top agency official. In Germany, he helped send anti-Soviet Russians back into Russia; they would parachute in by night and work against the Soviet regime in paramilitary teams.""I had seen that Stalin could occasionally make look Hitler look like a Boy Scout,"" Dr. Coffin explained last year to a reporter for The New York Times, Tim Weiner, who was preparing a history of the C.I.A. ""I was very anti-Soviet but very pro-Russian."" But Soviet intelligence detected nearly all of the efforts, and Dr. Coffin said the missions nearly always ended in disaster. ""It didn't work,"" he said. ""It was a fundamentally bad idea. We were quite naïve about the use of American power.""The years in the spy agency, it turned out, were only an interlude. Before joining it in 1950, he had left the Army as a captain in 1947, returned to Yale and earned a degree in government. In 1949, he was captivated by the possibilities of a religious vocation when, at the urging of his Uncle Henry, he attended a conference at Union Theological Seminary and heard Reinhold Niebuhr and prominent ministers from Harlem speak.So when he returned to the United States in 1953, it was to study for the ministry at Yale Divinity School. When he graduated in 1956, he returned to Andover as the school's acting chaplain.That year he also married Eva Anna Rubenstein, an actor and dancer who was the daughter of the pianist Artur Rubenstein. The couple had three children before the marriage ended in divorce in 1968.After spending a year at Williams College as chaplain, Dr. Coffin was named to the chaplain's post at Yale in 1958. The civil rights struggle was heating up, and he was arrested three times when he went south to join it. The arrests came in 1961, while taking part in a Freedom Ride in Montgomery, Ala.; in 1963, while protesting segregation at an amusement park near Baltimore; and in 1964, at a St. Augustine, Fla., lunch counter that he and others were trying to integrate.Dr. Coffin said aides to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy had tried to dissuade the Freedom Riders from making their trip in 1961. That first arrest caused some surprise at Yale. But Dr. Coffin said he was only setting a moral example.""Every minister is given two roles, the priestly and the prophetic,""' he said later that year. ""The prophetic role is the disturber of the peace, to bring the minister himself, the congregation and entire moral order some judgment.""The athletic and voluble Dr. Coffin became a familiar figure on Yale's campus, riding his motor scooter, joking with students and challenging them to stand up for what they thought. But by 1967, the campus that had largely welcomed him back from Montgomery as a man of courage was convulsed with the passion surrounding the Vietnam War.Much of the turmoil was over the draft, from which young men in college were exempt but which was waiting for them as soon as they left academia. Dr. Coffin, a critic of the country's war policy since 1965, had been a founder of a group called Clergy and Laity Concerned About Vietnam. But he had concluded that letter-writing and seeking out policy makers and members of Congress were having no effect.In 1967, he chose a course of civil disobedience. First, he offered the chapel at Yale as a sanctuary for those who were refusing to serve in Vietnam.Then, on Oct. 16 of that year, as a major demonstration at the Pentagon itself was being planned, Dr. Coffin helped preside at a service at the Arlington Street Church in Boston at which young men who were resisting the draft turned over their draft cards to him for delivery to the Justice Department. Dr. Coffin and three others left about 185 draft cards and 175 classification notices at the Justice Department in Washington on Oct. 20, a Friday, even as the capital braced for a weekend of demonstrations.Dr. Coffin told James Reston, a Times columnist, that his effort was intended to mount a ""fair and dignified"" legal challenge to the draft, and his statement to the Justice Department made it clear that the protesters were courting arrest as a symbolic act -- a position in accord with his statements that civil disobedience required confronting the draft and accepting the legal consequences.There was no immediate arrest, however, as the capital focused on the confrontations in the streets between radical protesters and helmeted troops outside the Pentagon. But on Jan. 5, 1968, the Justice Department came back with a far more serious charge than the defendants had expected. It indicted Dr. Coffin, Dr. Spock and the three others on charges that they had engaged in a conspiracy to counsel draft evasion.Dr. Coffin said he had not pushed the thought of draft evasion on anyone who did not already have it, but the government argued that this defied common sense, given the persuasive power that someone of his standing would have when he took a position or set an example.Dr. Coffin, Dr. Spock and two of the other three were convicted of conspiracy, but the verdicts were overturned on appeal, largely because of errors made by the judge. Dr. Coffin could have been retried, but the government chose not to do so.The case left him a national figure of protest -- lionized by the left, vilified by the right, and puzzled over by his superiors at Yale.Kingman Brewster Jr., an expert on constitutional law who would himself fall afoul of the Nixon administration, was Yale's president, and his reactions said a great deal about the difficulties Dr. Coffin's brand of conscience could present.Eight days after Dr. Coffin turned in the draft cards in Washington, Mr. Brewster gave a speech to parents of Yale students and said, ""I disagree with the chaplain's position on draft resistance, and in this instance deplore his style.""Two years later, after Dr. Coffin's conviction was overturned but before the government dropped the case, Mr. Brewster stood before entering freshmen and held up Dr. Coffin and Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York as two men who were ""wholly unashamed of their high purpose.""He drew applause when he criticized the draft as ""a system of conscription which makes the campus a draft haven and distorts career choices in an effort to avoid service in a war nobody wants to fight.""If the draft issue proved a political minefield for those seeking to hold Yale together, the pattern became only more complex as the war dragged on into the Nixon administration and another incendiary issue came to the forefront: the prosecution of Black Panthers in New Haven on kidnapping and murder charges.In the spring of 1970, a constellation of spokesmen for the radical left -- among them Tom Hayden of Students for a Democratic Society, David Dellinger of the antiwar movement, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin of the Yippies, the poet Allen Ginsberg and Black Panther leaders -- convened a giant rally just outside the Yale campus to protest both the prosecution of the Panthers and the conduct of the war. Officials throughout the Northeast feared an explosion of violence at Yale's doorstep. National Guard troops were sent into New Haven.Among Yale's students and faculty, political sympathy for the left ran high, but so did a concern to prevent violence. Students organized a group of marshals to keep tempers cool.Dr. Coffin met with rally organizers, who chose to put the most fiery speakers on in the morning and the more boring ones on as night, with its potential for disruption, was about to fall. He served on a committee of monitors. And on the one night when events threatened to get out of hand, he helped persuade a National Guard commander to keep his troops inconspicuous.In the end, the gathering proceeded largely peacefully, and when it was over many at Yale basked briefly in self-congratulation that the threat of serious violence had been averted.Then came news that four young protesters had been killed when troops opened fire at Kent State University in Ohio, where a remarkably similar stage had been set that week -- tense national guardsmen facing angry students -- but with less success at controlling tempers and fears.In September 1972, Dr. Coffin was a member of group of clergy and peace activists who went to Hanoi to accompany three released prisoners of war on their return to the United States.He remained chaplain of Yale until 1976, when he stepped down to work with world hunger programs and write his memoir. A few months later, he separated from his second wife, Harriet Gibney, whom he had married in 1969. That marriage, like his first, ended in divorce and he remarried once more, to Virginia Randolph Wilson, who survives him.Besides his daughter, by his first marriage, Amy, of Oakland, Calif., Dr. Coffin is survived by a son by his first marriage, David Coffin, of Gloucester, Mass.; his brother, NedCoffin, of Strafford; his sister, Margot Lindsay, of Newton, Mass.; three grandchildren; two stepchildren, Jessica Tidman, of Strafford, and Wil Tidman, of San Francisco; and four stepgrandchildren. Another son by his first marriage, Alexander, died in 1983.Dr. Coffin was appointed to the ministry at Riverside Church in 1978. There, he promoted international arms control and mobilized congregants to work on local issues like unemployment and juvenile delinquency.In 1979, he was one of three American clergymen who, along with a fourth from Algeria, went to Tehran at their own expense to help the American hostages held there celebrate Christmas. In the 1980's, after leaving Riverside, he was a leader of Sane/Freeze, an organization that campaigned for disarmament and a freeze on nuclear testing.Dr. Coffin's activities slowed considerably in the 1990's, and in 1999 he suffered a stroke. But he continued to write and speak out from his home in Strafford. In the spring and fall of 2003, he spoke out repeatedly in criticism of the war President Bush was leading in Iraq. Last October, he founded an organization of religious leaders calling for the elimination of nuclear arms.In the fall of 2003, he preached at Riverside Church again, on World Communion Sunday, after being introduced by Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations. His voice resonant, even though his speech was slow and somewhat slurred, Dr. Coffin told the congregants that there was ""a huge difference between patriotism and nationalism.""""Patriotism at the expense of another nation is as wicked as racism at the expense of another race,"" he declared, adding: ""Let us resolve to be patriots always, nationalists never. Let us love our country, but pledge allegiance to the earth and to the flora and fauna and human life that it supports -- one planet indivisible, with clean air, soil and water; with liberty, justice and peace for all.""Correction: April 15, 2006, Saturday An obituary on Thursday about about the Rev. Dr. William Sloane Coffin, the civil rights and antiwar campaigner, misspelled the name of his first wife and the surname of her father.

"'06-04-13,'1','But Mr. Elias, a television news anchor in western Massachusetts, and Mr. Bloom, the owner of a volleyball league in New York City, both self-described amateurs at creating a digital service and company, spawned Zunafish, a singularly simple-to-use media trading site.""We have no background in technology,"" said Mr. Elias, a 45-year-old native New Yorker who now lives in Northampton, Mass. ""I think we always thought from the start that it was a big idea. There are hundreds of billions of dollars of idle media materials sitting in people's homes.""Mr. Bloom, 47, said of the company's humble origins, ""If we lived in the country, it would have literally been created in one of our garages.""The site, which looks remarkably similar to a prototype Mr. Bloom sketched on notebook paper four years ago with Mr. Elias, trades only one-for-one items within the same category -- CD's, DVD's, VHS tapes, video games, audio books or paperback books. No item (for example, a seven-disc DVD set of the first season of the television series ""24"") is worth more than any another (say, a DVD of Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"").Traders using the site determine the relative value of an item by choosing to swap or not. No one is ever forced to make a trade, Mr. Elias noted.Each trader pays Zunafish $1 through credit or debit card for each trade. The site then calculates the postage costs and creates addressed mailing labels that can be downloaded and printed out. Each trader, Mr. Bloom said, is responsible for paying the postage and mailing the item promptly.Like buyers and sellers on eBay, the traders on Zunafish rate each other, providing a confidence index for future transactions.""We take extremely limited involvement in the transaction,"" Mr. Elias said. ""It is mediated by a user-rating system. Not by us.""Zunafish started on Jan. 1, with no fanfare or publicity. Mr. Bloom and Mr. Elias said that the circle of traders had been limited so far -- they did not disclose figures -- but that they felt strongly that throngs of prospective users would discover the site.""It is only as strong as the community that comes to it,"" Mr. Elias said of Zunafish. ""It takes a few minutes to sit down and post all of your stuff. But once you do, you've made an investment that pays off week by week as people come to inquire about things that you own.""Unlocking new value in practically discarded household items is a growing phenomenon. Michael J. Silverstein, a senior vice president of the Boston Consulting Group and co-author of ""Treasure Hunt: Inside the Mind of the New Consumer"" (Portfolio Hardcover, 2006), says middle-class consumers are becoming more comfortable economizing in some areas so they have more capital to buy premium items in other areas.He said that if consumers were asked to place all of their CD's and DVD's, for example, in three piles -- those they love, those they like well enough to keep and those they would be happy to have taken away -- the piles would most likely be equal.Any system that helps people easily trade away what they do not want for what they do want is ""a beautiful synchronicity,"" Mr. Silverstein said in an interview.Further, he notes in his book that online companies like eBay owe much of their success to their enormous appeal to the ""consumer value calculus.""Mr. Elias said Zunafish played to the same calculus. That is hardly an accident. ""We often found ourselves asking, 'How does eBay do it?' given the breadth of its success.""One notable feature is how easy it is to post items on Zunafish to be traded.Mr. Bloom said Zunafish used a database that was updated weekly. Type in the name of an item or its universal product code (usually found near an item's bar code) -- or the I.S.B.N. number for books -- and the database pulls up a full description of the item and a digital photograph of its cover. If the match is correct, the user clicks O.K. and the item is posted.There are other online trading sites, including Peerflix and BarterBee, which started last summer, that offer trading in similar categories. But other sites tend to offer a more limited range of items, or they use more complicated systems, requiring points and memberships to execute trades.Todd Chanko, an analyst with Jupiter-Research, said he saw limits to the appeal of online trading.""There's a lot of ways to do this in the real world,"" he said. ""There are flea markets, thrift shops and street corners where people just dump things."" As a result, ""the real value proposition here is for those who don't have those opportunities, who live in areas far too remote.""And for many of those consumers, he said, Internet access and use tends to be relatively low.But Zunafish investors, mostly the friends and relatives of Mr. Elias and Mr. Bloom, disagreed. In a matter of weeks, they had investments from 19 of the 21 people they approached. Ultimately they raised $485,000 in capital in two rounds and valued the company at $3.5 million. But the journey from idea to start date took almost four years, including the services of a corporate lawyer, a patent lawyer and a trademark lawyer. Just debugging the Web site itself seemed never-ending, the men said.So far, they are keeping their day jobs. ""None of us has thought about leaving our positions at all,"" Mr. Bloom said. ""In the distant future that this should generate sufficient income to support itself and support us. ""He never finished the sentence. But Mr. Bloom pondered the question for a few moments, then borrowed from a ""Star Wars"" movie to sound a philosophical note. ""Always in motion,"" he said in his best impression of the Jedi sage, Yoda, ""is the future.""'"

"'06-04-13,'1','Under the deal he has been negotiating, Mr. Jackson would agree to provide Sony -- which is co-owner of the Sony/ATV Music catalog with him -- with an option to buy half his stake, or about 25 percent of the catalog, at a set price, according to the people briefed on the deal.Should Sony execute its option on the music catalog, it would ensure that Mr. Jackson was able to pay his debts, these people said.Executives involved in the deal cautioned last night that some details had yet to completed and that the agreement could still collapse.Representatives for Sony and Fortress declined to comment last night. A representative for Mr. Jackson did not return a call.But executives involved in the deal said it came after months of talks that spanned the globe, with meetings from Los Angeles to New York to London to Bahrain, where Mr. Jackson has been living at the hospitality of Sheik Abdullah, the ruler's son.The deal also comes after years of efforts by an eclectic parade of financial advisers including the California billionaire Ronald W. Burkle and the Florida entrepreneur Alvin Malnik to offer Mr. Jackson guidance for extricating himself from his woes. Mr. Jackson's financial managers had been pressing him to shed a part of his stake in the Sony/ATV venture since before he stood trial last year on charges of child molestation. He was acquitted last summer.Many people close to Mr. Jackson have maintained that he could raise money to repay his loans -- or at least stay afloat -- by touring internationally or working out a series of television and book deals. But the consensus among his advisers was that he would face bankruptcy if he did not refinance.Sony has a longstanding interest in keeping Mr. Jackson solvent. If Fortress had moved to foreclose on Mr. Jackson, he might have been forced into bankruptcy protection, where his stake in the publishing company could be put up for auction.In negotiating the deal, Sony seeks to avoid the prospect that another bidder could gain ownership of the stake, which the company has long hoped to control.Sony has been trying to organize financial partners that could prop up Mr. Jackson's wobbly finances. In the fall, a Sony representative flew to Dubai to meet with Mr. Jackson and an adviser, Gaynell Lenoir, daughter of the late Gerald Lenoir, a lawyer who was a mentor to the lawyer Johnnie Cochran.Originally, they had tried to hammer out a deal in which Citigroup would acquire the loans, and offer Mr. Jackson a more favorable interest rate, around 6 percent, these executives said. Mr. Jackson had been paying more than 20 percent in monthly interest payments.Rather than sell the loans to Citigroup, Fortress agreed to match the bank's terms, the executives said.The various parties had agreed to the deal in principle a few weeks ago, the executives said, but the final pact was held up while the companies involved tried to address questions about potential exposure linked to Mr. Jackson's remaining legal problems.Prescient Capital, a New Jersey company that said it helped Mr. Jackson secure the original financing from Fortress, has sued him for breach of contract, accusing him of failing to pay millions of dollars in fees for providing financial advice.As a result, Mr. Jackson has finally been forced to loosen his grip on one of the richest of song catalogs.He paid $47.5 million in 1985 to acquire the ATV catalog, which had roughly 4,000 songs -- among them more than 200 tunes written by members of the Beatles. After 10 months of negotiations with ATV's owner, the Australian tycoon Robert Holmes à Court, Mr. Jackson bested other suitors including the music executives Charles Koppelman and Martin Bandier, the London-based Virgin Records and the real estate entrepreneur Samuel J. Lefrak.In 1995, as he confronted early financial woes, Mr. Jackson struck a deal to merge ATV with Sony's publishing arm. The arrangement also provided Mr. Jackson with a stake in new songs acquired by the venture, like ""No Such Thing"" by John Mayer.Aside from the Beatles songs, the venture has a vast archive including ""Blowin' in the Wind"" by Bob Dylan, ""Sweet Caroline"" by Neil Diamond and ""E-Pro"" by BeckThe catalog also includes the works of songwriters including Stevie Nicks, Sarah McLachlan, Destiny's Child, Garth Brooks and Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi. The venture is also a big force in country music, having acquired the catalog of Roy Acuff and Fred Rose for $157 million in 2002. An archive of songs from the likes of Hank Williams and Roy Orbison is also included.'"

"'06-04-14,'0','Even so, some legal reformers in China believe that advancing the notion of constitutional law is critical in establishing the rule of law. So, increasingly, reformers are pushing ideas like creating a new and assertive constitutional court. Liberal reformers believe that expanding the reach of the Constitution could ultimately provide a greater check on the Communist Party.""There is a movement to make the Constitution mean something,"" said Stanley Lubman, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, and an expert on Chinese law. But for now, Mr. Lubman added, ""the Chinese Constitution is an aspirational document.""The debate is hardly an abstract one for the Chinese government. Top leaders have made reducing the urban-rural income gap a domestic priority and have taken some steps to help migrant workers. They have also stressed the need for a fair and modern legal system to regulate Chinese society and safeguard individual rights.The Constitution has been rewritten or amended several times over the past half century, most recently in 2004, to include protections for private property rights. Such constitutional amendments are considered guidelines when the government drafts laws or regulations. But the Constitution does not stand above the Communist Party and ultimately, expanding the power of the Constitution or increasing the power of the courts could mean introducing changes in the political system, a move the Communist Party has resisted.Here in the mountains of the vast Chongqing Municipality, Mr. He's family had been a migrant success story before his daughter's death.Mr. He grew up in a farming village in the hills surrounding the Yangtze but left in 1991 to take a job in the wholesale meat business. He bought and slaughtered pigs in different villages for a butcher who sold the meat at a shop in Guojiatuo, which has about 29,000 people. Mr. He and his wife, Zhan Denglan, moved into the butcher shop, and Yuan was born that year at a nearby hospital.By 2000, Mr. He had opened his own meat stand at a nearby market, and his daughter had enrolled in a local school. He still has the temporary residency cards that he updated annually in order to live as a migrant worker. He said he had paid local taxes since opening his stand, and his family also has a small red booklet in recognition of their compliance with the one-child policy.Last year, on the morning of Dec. 15, Yuan, 14, went by the meat stand early in the morning to get money for school materials. Ten minutes after she left, someone told Mr. He that Yuan had been in an accident. At the scene, he discovered that a truck overloaded with bricks had smashed into the small motorized pedicab carrying Yuan and her two friends to school. The truck had toppled and crushed the three girls beneath several tons of bricks.""I was so grief-stricken that I could hardly stand,"" Mr. He said.Within hours, the families of the three dead girls were taken to a local hotel to meet with an ad hoc compensation board: an official from the local street committee; one from the police station; a local education official and two officials from the middle school; the owner of the truck; and three representatives from the transportation company that had hired the truck to transport the bricks.Mr. He said the meeting soon seemed like house arrest. He and his wife were kept at the hotel for two days as they argued about the value of their daughter's life. A representative for the transportation company, which was liable for payment, said Chinese law dictated that Mr. He and his wife were entitled to only 50,000 yuan, or about $6,170. But he said the company would give them 70,000 yuan, about $8,640, as an expression of sympathy and to help pay for the funeral. The other families received about 200,000 yuan, or roughly $25,000.""They said, 'You are a rural resident, and you either take the 70,000 or leave it,' "" Mr. He recalled. ""They said that if I thought it was too little, I could sell the broken truck.""Finally, he signed the compensation agreement. He received an extra 20,000 yuan from the transportation company and the truck owner, but the payout was still less than half of what was given to the other families.Western legal systems also place different values on people's lives, depending on the person's earnings history and other factors. But in this case, the families involved lived in the same neighborhood, and Mr. He had established himself as a small merchant, with an income roughly comparable to those of the other families. The main thing that distinguished him was his rural residency status.Zhou Wei, the family's lawyer, said the compensation disparity illustrated the pervasive discrimination created by China's household registration, or hukou, system, which often still ties individuals and their access to government services to the place where they are registered. The central government has steadily loosened hukou restrictions, but migrant workers still receive far fewer government services.""It is hard for people to realize that such discrimination and unfairness exists in society against farmers,"" Mr. Zhou said.For several years, Mr. Zhou has tested the extent of constitutional rights in China. He has filed cases claiming that government agencies illegally discriminated in hiring policies on the basis of height and gender, as well as against people with hepatitis B. In both the height and hepatitis B cases, the agencies ended up changing their policies. But in none of his cases has he won a judgment on constitutional grounds.Indeed, China's legal system almost seems designed to avoid such judgments. The authority to make constitutional judgments lies not with the court system but with the leadership of the National People's Congress, the party-run national legislature. And the congress has never publicly issued an opinion clarifying a constitutional dispute.Mr. He is still pushing for equitable compensation. He has petitioned local officials, courted the Chinese media and written a letter to the National People's Congress and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. There are tentative positive signs, Mr. Zhou said, which helps explain why he has not yet filed a lawsuit.Two other provincial high courts have recently ruled for equitable compensation in similar cases. Mr. Zhou said he expected the Supreme People's Court in Beijing to review the compensation issue in June. Even if Mr. He eventually gets more money, it is unlikely he will get any validation of his constitutional rights. Still, Mr. Zhou holds out hope for the long term.""The development of Chinese culture should empower the Constitution to act as a restriction on the government and as a safeguard on citizen rights,"" he said.The loss of Yuan has been devastating for Mr. He and his wife. Mr. He said his fight was as much about his child's dignity as about the compensation money. His wife suffered a breakdown and has tried to commit suicide. Because of health problems, she can no longer have children, and the couple are worried about their future. Without social security benefits, the couple have no nest egg and now no child to care for them in their old age.""She wanted to settle in the city and buy a big house for us when she was older,"" Mr. He said of his daughter. ""She wanted to be a doctor, a teacher or a flight attendant.""'"
"'06-04-14,'0','He never wanted a party, but that's what he got yesterday morning. He never wanted the recognition. He was only doing what he loved. And the 49 years, well it just happened.""For the last 10 years I kept saying I was going to retire, and then everyone would say, just one more year,"" said Mr. Loughran, who had to pull the handkerchief from his gray uniform several times.As the morning went on it was clear that despite his protests, Mr. Loughran was enjoying being the center of affection, hugging some of the women and even kissing a few.""He definitely likes the women,"" said Charles Haigh, who has lived in the building since 1992. ""The door always gets opened just a little faster when there's a woman around.""Even though he knows it's time, Mr. Loughran, who prefers not to divulge his age, is a little reluctant about retiring on Monday. Some of the residents in the 186-unit co-op refer to him as a second father, the younger ones as another grandfather.""Tom has been my better half since 1961,"" said Chris Meier, 77. ""He has helped me in all kinds of ways, physically and at times emotionally. I had hoped he'd stick around until I left this world.""Rita Langman, whom other residents refer to as ""Tom's favorite,"" said Mr Loughran has been like ""a father replacement.""""He took care of my mother when she needed the help of aides,"" she said. ""He always let me know who was doing a good job and who wasn't. He even got the key to the park and made sure she went every day.""Mr. Loughran started his job a few months after the 18-story building was completed, and has outlasted nearly every original tenant. But in a city with so many doormen, it is impossible to say if his half-century tenure is the longest of all.By putting away his uniform for the last time on Monday, Mr. Loughran will avoid having to do something he surely would not want to do: abandon his post because of a labor dispute. The union that represents 25,000 doormen, elevator operators and handymen at 3,500 apartment buildings in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens has set a strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. next Friday if it cannot resolve a contract dispute.He lives in Yonkers, in a neighborhood very different from the one where he works. He gets up at 4 a.m. to make sure he is at the building by 7:15.On August 19, 1989, a steam pipe blew up in front of the building, killing a 28-year-old resident and two Consolidated Edison workers and sending a geyser of steam and mud 18 stories high. Because it was a Saturday, Mr. Loughran was not there, but he never missed a day of work, even though the building was emptied for more than five months because inspectors discovered that asbestos had been spread through the interior by the blast.So Mr. Loughran moved with some of the residents to the Gramercy Park Hotel, where he kept track of messages, helped residents with their needs and handled mail and deliveries.""We surely needed help then,"" Ms. Meier said. ""We were separated from our apartments and couldn't get in.""Dr. Phyllis Kaplan said that having Mr. Loughran continue to take care of things at the time gave residents the feeling that ""we're dislocated for now, but we're going home.""""He was always there to support us,"" she said. ""He didn't have to be there, but he offered us a feeling of constancy and routine.""Correction: April 15, 2006, Saturday An article yesterday about Thomas Loughran, a New York City doorman who is retiring after 49 years on the job, misstated the address of the building where he worked. It was 32 Gramercy Park South, not Gramercy Park West.'"
"'06-04-14,'0','Najah Ali, an Iraqi flyweight boxer, has every right to feel aggrieved. When he was in the spotlight during the 2004 Olympics, the State Department was only too happy to exploit him for propaganda purposes. But when he applied four times for a student visa to study in this country, that same State Department found reasons to turn him down. It's enough to make any fair-minded observer cry foul.What made Mr. Ali useful to American diplomacy at the Olympics in Athens was his ability to speak English and his willingness to praise the United States. He didn't do all that well in the ring, where he lost in the second round. But he stood tall as a symbol of his struggling country's efforts to right itself. As chronicled by Geoffrey Gray in yesterday's Times, he offered to give interviews, routinely praised the United States' invasion of Iraq and declared Americans the best people he met in Athens.None of that cut much ice when he applied for a student visa, at considerable expense and danger. American officials who interviewed him questioned whether Mr. Ali was really a serious student and expressed concern that he might not leave the United States once his studies were completed. Never mind that the University of Houston had already interviewed him and was eager to get him. Never mind that I.B.M. expressed interest in employing him in Egypt should he choose not to return to Iraq. There was just too much risk that Mr. Ali might actually like the country he had been praising and might choose to stay here.We'd be inclined to say, welcome aboard. But short of that, surely a visa is warranted. Authorities aren't concerned that Mr. Ali is a terrorist, and his high profile would make it hard for him to stay here illegally.If this motivated and ambitious young man applies yet again, the visa should be granted.'"

"'06-04-14,'0','Back then, the Big Three, which had their headquarters in Detroit, were the national auto industry. Today the industry includes the American manufacturing plants of Japanese and Korean companies, which are doing just fine at providing popular vehicles and have created tens of thousands of good jobs for Americans.And it is less obvious what Washington could do to help.""In the current climate, the government would be very reluctant to step in and protect one company in a much larger industry,"" said Stewart J. Schwab, an expert in labor law and dean of Cornell Law School. ""They would have to wonder whether they are just helping the inefficient; that's not a good long-term strategy.""As Chrysler was tottering in 1979, President Jimmy Carter and the Democratic-controlled Congress cobbled together a rescue plan that included $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees and a package of concessions worth several billion dollars more from others interested in Chrysler's survival, including its union, its bankers and its dealers.The Carter administration also made a 25 percent tariff on imports of Japanese light trucks unavoidable -- building a protective wall around what were to become Detroit's hottest products: sport utility vehicles and minivans.The effort was bipartisan and it continued into the 1980's. One of the first things the Reagan administration did upon taking office in 1981 was to press Japan to agree to so-called voluntary export restraints by its carmakers.Today, the automakers' troubles are arguably on an even greater scale. General Motors lost more than $10 billion last year as the high cost of gasoline made consumers shun its large S.U.V.'s., further eroding its market share. This only added to G.M.'s structural problems, associated with the cost of providing pensions and health care to its army of retired workers.G.M. said last year that it would cut 30,000 jobs and close all or parts of 12 plants by 2008. Last month, it offered a buyout program to all 113,000 unionized workers. The company's debt has been downgraded to junk bond status. Ford is facing similar troubles. Delphi, the nation's largest auto parts maker, is in bankruptcy and wants to shed about two-thirds of its work force in the United States.Yet despite the long list of woes, neither the White House nor Congress is rushing to the rescue.""We might be coming to a crisis faster than we thought,"" said Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, who with Paul E. Tsongas, then a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, hammered out the Senate version of the bill that led to Chrysler's rescue. ""It's not that people are dismissive but they just haven't given it that much thought.""At a news conference in 1980, Mr. Carter justified the government's involvement in the Chrysler bailout as necessary ""to avoid the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs among automobile workers and to keep a highly competitive automobile industry in our country.""In January, President Bush suggested that carmakers solve their own problems by making cars that are ""relevant."" Referring to President Carter's decision to help Chrysler, he noted, ""I would hope I wouldn't be asked to make that decision.""Washington's change of tune is, perhaps, understandable: in the 1970's, not only was the economy sliding into a recession, the United States still understood itself as a strong manufacturing nation -- and cars represented one of its most important industries.""It's a much smaller part of the U.S. economy than it was then,"" said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist of ITG/Hoenig, who as an economist on the staff of Senator Tsongas helped devise the Chrysler bailout in 1979. ""Today 9 out of 10 jobs in the United States are not in manufacturing.""The share of gross domestic product from motor vehicle output is down by about a third since the late 1970's, to 3.2 percent. In 1978, makers of cars and auto parts employed 1.4 percent of all private sector workers; the figure today is less than 1 percent.Even in Michigan, the automotive sector's share of employment has fallen by about half, to some 6 percent of all nonfarm jobs.Members of Congress who voted for the Chrysler bill ""worried that thousands of people would lose their jobs needlessly,"" said James J. Blanchard, a former Michigan governor who led negotiations for the Chrysler bill as a House representative from the state. ""The cost in welfare and pension guarantees would be astronomical. It would have been a serious blow to a precarious national economy.""Today, General Motors is insistent that it does not want a direct government bailout. ""One thing we haven't done is go to the federal government and enlist their aid in respect to our current situation,"" said Christopher Preuss, a G.M. spokesman.Yet Detroit is certainly interested in other forms of help from Washington. The Big Three, with their older, heavily unionized work forces, are competing against imports and transplants built without the burden of ""legacy costs"" accumulated through decades of increasingly elaborate contracts. They would love a hand from the government to remove the health care expenses of retirees from their books.Moreover, they complain bitterly that Japan keeps the value of the yen artificially low, lowering the cost of Japanese carmakers' imports of cars and parts from Japan.But these days Detroit no longer has a near monopoly on domestic production. Having started building plants in the United States in the early 1980's, foreign carmakers like Toyota and Honda now account for over a quarter of the output of vehicles built for consumers. They employ about a fifth of workers engaged in making cars and trucks. Many more Americans are involved in designing, marketing and repairing foreign brands.And the cars are selling well: the United States market share of brands from Asia jumped to 37 percent last year from 35 percent in 2004, according to Thomas W. LaSorda, chief executive of the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler.Other factors are also staying the government's hand. More than a quarter of a century since the Chrysler bailout, there is a much firmer belief in the ability of market forces to deal with the problems facing the big car companies.Indeed, Chrysler is today much healthier than General Motors and Ford, in part because it was bought by Daimler-Benz of Germany, creating DaimlerChrysler. And bankruptcy, which would allow G.M. to rewrite union contracts, is not necessarily regarded as a death sentence.Even if Washington were willing to step up to bat for Detroit, it is not clear that it has the necessary firepower. The total Chrysler rescue package of 1979 was worth less than $5 billion -- somewhat less than $15 billion in today's money -- and the government ended up guaranteeing only $1.2 billion worth of loans.At the end of last year, General Motors estimated that its overall unfunded liabilities to cover retiree health care and life insurance amounted to $62 billion. Ford's added up to about $33 billion.More far-reaching legislation -- to create a national health care system, for example -- might pull the car companies out of their hole. But nobody is counting on that kind of help.""While spiraling health care costs are a monumental issue for the entire economy,"" Mr. Preuss of G.M. said, ""we're not counting on any immediate legislative relief that would change the current situation.""In some areas, the politics are going against Detroit's interests. California and a number of other states, mostly in the Northeast (where foreign cars are often more popular than domestic vehicles), are pressing the industry for drastic reductions in the level of greenhouse gases coming out of car and truck tailpipes.To reverse the industry's decline, even Detroit's most ardent supporters in Congress have come up with only modest ideas.Representative John D. Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, introduced a bill in the House last year that would force the administration to seek redress at the World Trade Organization over currency manipulation by Japan and other countries. It has little chance in Congress.Bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to give tax breaks for car companies' investments in alternative fuel technologies and other energy-saving initiatives. Their prospects are somewhat brighter.The Bush administration has also tried to help via regulation. The new fuel efficiency rules issued last month, which set relatively modest targets for large sport utility vehicles, were seen as a victory for the Big Three, which have the heaviest S.U.V. fleets.""There's no grand solution,"" said Dennis Fitzgibbons, director for public policy at DaimlerChrysler in Washington. ""But there are a number of smaller things that could be done.""It is still possible, of course, that Washington might be moved to respond. In 1980, Chrysler was only weeks from filing for bankruptcy by the time the government acted. If G.M. were to be pulled even further into trouble by a strike at Delphi, its biggest supplier, that shut G.M.'s own assembly lines and if it were truly tottering on the brink, the urge to keep it from tipping over might prove too great to resist.""This type of event could really galvanize people,"" Mr. Fitzgibbons said. ""But do I know which way they would go? No.""'"
"'06-04-14,'0','Italian artists used allegory in decorative cycles for palaces, churches, institutional and even private buildings, and Veronese did his share of those. But he went a step further, suggests Xavier F. Salomon, an Andrew W. Mellon curatorial fellow at the Frick who put together this show and its catalog. He brought allegory into single large-scale paintings, until then rarely if ever seen in such contexts.The other Frick-owned work in the show, ""Wisdom and Strength,"" depicts these two desirable attributes in the form of Hercules, looking meek but noirish, next to a nameless but saintly woman, with a divine light above her head and one breast exposed. Seemingly based on a celestial figure, she stands on a small globe that symbolizes the world as she casts her eyes (somewhat coyly) up to the heavens.The painting is packed with worldly stuff: crowns, jewels, ornate hangings, even a little Cupid who seems to have his hand on a scepter. A biblical inscription on an ancient column next to Wisdom says, ""All Is Vanity."" The idea seems to be that earthly goods are nothing compared with things celestial, as personified by the divine gift of Wisdom.In ""Venus and Mars United by Love,"" the most erotic canvas on view, Venus in her nakedness is unmistakably Venus, goddess of love, and Mars in his armor is Mars, the god of war. Seated, he leans his head against her breast; she, standing, puts one hand on the nape of his neck.With the other, she squeezes milk from her right breast as he draws her robe concealingly across her loins. Cupid ties a pink ribbon around their two left legs. At the right of the picture stands Mars's plump, sexy and nosy horse, restrained from the goings-on by another putto, who holds a sword against the animal's legs.The picture represents the triumph of love over war, although its allegorical message carries an erotic charge that would certainly appeal to those less interested in high ideals than in the suggestive scenarios Veronese was adept at devising. This Venus is an excellent example of the sensual-spiritual nudes he painted that appealed to secular as well as religious tastes.The other two paintings, allegories of navigation, from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, are quite different in spirit and appearance. They seem far more likely than the others to have been part of a set, whose number is not yet known. Each is painted on a long vertical canvas, each depicts a single monumental figure in ancient or Oriental garb holding a nautical instrument, against a background of classical ruins.In ""Allegory of Navigation With a Cross-Staff,"" a youngish, bearded man in a rather awkward standing position displays what is thought to be a cross-staff, an instrument, now obsolete, for taking the altitude of the sun and other stars (but it could also be a Byzantine cross). In ""Allegory of Navigation With an Astrolabe,"" a much older, more Michelangelo-style personage, wearing a turban, clutches an astrolabe, also once used to find stars' altitude but later replaced by the sextant.It had long been held that both figures represent aspects of navigation, a subject particularly germane to Venice's seafaring tradition. But, although their attributes suggest a nautical interpretation, scholarly speculation has also given the figure with the cross-staff religious significance, making a juxtaposition of Christian faith with science.Much remains to be nailed down about these pictures. The provenance of some is still unclear. And what or who, for example, does the white-clad young man in ""The Choice Between Virtue and Vice"" represent? Who is the female figure in ""Wisdom and Strength""? Does ""Venus and Mars United by Love"" have a deeper allegorical meaning than its rather straightforward imagery suggests? And so on and on. But never mind. Scholarly concerns shouldn't keep you from enjoying these marvelous pictures, still alive and fresh nearly half a millennium after they were painted.""Veronese's Allegories: Virtue, Love and Exploration in Renaissance Venice"" is at the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, through July 16.'"
"'06-04-14,'0','After the American Stock Exchange, described by one Wall Street blog as being on a deathwatch, announced it planned to go public, its seat prices, the closest gauge of equity value, soared 45 percent. When the Philadelphia Stock Exchange sold equity, investors, including the Chicago-based hedge fund, Citadel, and firms like Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse, snapped up stakes.If Mr. Putnam is right, then fees --the money that exchanges make from trading -- are unlikely to rise, although increased volume may compensate for any decline. Exchanges also have listing businesses, where companies pay to list and be traded. Many listings are going abroad because of the stricter regulatory oversight in the United States since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. And equity exchanges do not own their clearing businesses, where trades are settled, which is the only other line of revenue where great growth can be found.To be sure, it is nothing like eyeball views and quick clicks. Exchanges have real buyers and sellers and real value. But the valuations of United States exchanges are creeping -- if not racing -- into bubble territory.The impetus underlying the enthusiasm seems to be twofold: industry consolidation and the recent stock price performance of a handful of exchanges.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange went public in December 2002 for $35 and now trades for $490. The International Securities Exchange went public for $18 in March 2005 and is trading around $40; the Chicago Board of Trade went public in October 2005 for $54 and is now around $115.Not only is past performance no indicator of future returns, but all exchanges are not the same. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange trades highly lucrative futures contracts, whose fees have gone up. The exchange is not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is its regulator) and it has a nifty monopoly deal in which it controls all of its clearing. If you buy a contract at the C.M.E. you have to sell that contract on the C.M.E. The same holds for the Chicago Board of Trade and the Intercontinental Exchange, a global futures and over-the-counter marketplace for trading an array of energy products.Unlike equities, which have grown in the low double digits for the past decade, futures and options businesses have expanded at 15 percent to 20 percent a year for the last decade, according to Richard H. Repetto, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners.Stock markets like the NYSE Group, Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange, on the other hand, are highly competitive, highly regulated, fee-pressurized businesses.So why does Nasdaq feel more like Yahoo than AmeriTrade? Because equities exchanges are scrambling to grow and diversify through acquisition. The most recent move was Nasdaq's acquisition of a 15 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange. Robert Greifeld, the chief executive of Nasdaq, is seen as playing a masterly game to own the London exchange, or prevent someone else from owning it. Investors see him gamble, and buy into it.But equities is a tough business. Even London is regulated. Global consolidation is untested. Combining two huge technological platforms could work. Or not. The business of clearing will be a sticky issue on both sides of the Atlantic. And yet no such uncertainty seems to be reflected in the prices. With bubbles, it never is.'"
"'06-04-14,'0','Michael Jackson, who has been burdened with hundreds of millions of dollars of debt, said yesterday that he had revamped his finances, an arrangement that would probably force him to sell part of his stake in a song catalog that includes hits by the Beatles.As part of a $300 million refinancing, Mr. Jackson agreed to sell half of his 50 percent stake in Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the company that controls the song catalog, to its co-owner, the Sony Corporation, at some point in the future, according to people involved in the transaction.Mr. Jackson had used his stake in Sony/ATV as part of the collateral for more than $270 million in loans used to underwrite his lavish lifestyle, which at one point included the operation of an amusement park at his California ranch.When Mr. Jackson sells the share in Sony/ATV, he is expected to use the money to pay the loans held by the Fortress Investment Group, a New York investment company that bought Mr. Jackson's debt from Bank of America last year. Fortress also agreed to restructure Mr. Jackson's loans and reduce his interest payments, these people said.Mr. Jackson said in a statement that he had completed the refinancing ""with the assistance"" of Sony, and that the transaction was structured by Citigroup. The statement was issued from Manama, Bahrain, where Mr. Jackson has been living most of the time since his acquittal on charges of child molestation last year.It is unclear whether yesterday's transaction will end Mr. Jackson's financial troubles. Prosecutors at his trial last year claimed that in addition to his outstanding loans, Mr. Jackson faced tax liabilities of as much as $150 million. He is also facing several lawsuits.'"
"'06-04-14,'0','The mountains that rise from the Tibetan plateau make a suitably dramatic backdrop for this story about the murderous cost we humans exact on the natural world. Based on depressingly true events, ""Mountain Patrol: Kekexili"" tracks the heroic efforts of a small group of Tibetans struggling to keep the Tibetan antelope, or chiru, from extinction. Although hunting the antelope was made illegal in the 1970's -- you need to kill the animal to harvest its wool, which is turned into a rare commodity called shahtoosh -- the population dwindled precariously, beginning in the late 1980's and early 90's, because enough wealthy consumers had no qualms about hitting the boldface scene with shahtoosh on their shoulders and blood on their hands.If that sounds like a recipe for piety and sob stories about cute critters, think again. Written and directed by Lu Chuan, whose first feature was the well-received ""Missing Gun,"" ""Mountain Patrol"" is as tough and unsparing as its backdrop, a blood-boiling environmental thriller with a dash of Sergio Leone. Although the traffic in endangered wildlife gives the film its headline hook -- you need to kill three to five antelopes to make one shahtoosh shawl -- the story that briskly unfolds has as much to do with man's inhumanity to man as to his fellow creatures. Which is why, given China's historic and violent aggression against the Tibetan people, it's hard not to read the film on several levels at once.The way into this unlikely nail-biter is through a young Beijing photojournalist, Ga Yu (Zhang Lei), who lands in this otherworldly region in 1996, armed with a camera and a well of idealism. His quarry is a mountain patrol, led by a former soldier, Ri Tai (Duo Bujie), that tracks poachers who, with their automatic weapons and hired skinners, leave thousands of antelope carcasses across the plateau. More action-oriented than expository-minded, Mr. Lu never explains why a Chinese journalist would find this story especially newsworthy. Ga Yu simply shows up, slips into his new environs (it helps that he is part Tibetan) and proves himself a quick study, whether learning the proper way to cut meat -- draw the knife toward your body, away from your companions -- or hopping a ride with the patrol.Mr. Lu has an appreciable sense of narrative economy, and it isn't long before the photographer is on the desolate road with the patrol in Kekexili, a region in the northwestern part of the plateau. Filled with astonishing vistas and a minimum of chatter, this is the kind of film that invites you in with beauty, only to surprise and even shock you with a sudden burst of violence. The images of the men driving their trucks and dwarfed against the mountains recall, however fleetingly, the sweeping sight of pioneers framed against a different range in John Ford's ""Wagon Master."" Mr. Lu, a graduate of the Beijing Film Academy, has clearly watched his share of westerns, which is why still other scenes evoke Leone and, when two men, gasping for oxygen and spitting blood, chase each other until they drop, even Erich von Stroheim.Despite the sporadic film-school allusions, ""Mountain Patrol"" has its own very specific take on things. Films about environmental catastrophes tend to wax preachy, putting pedagogy and scolding above art. This one, for all its sorrow and the throb of righteous anger it provokes (only about 50,000 antelopes remain), is more than anything a work of creative imagination. Filled with strange and horrible visions, it draws you in again and again, not with characters, who all remain at a psychological remove, but with set pieces that distill the story's life-and-death struggle to its essence. The extraordinary scene of one man sinking into quicksand is characteristically potent, a reminder of the fragility of human life and the unblinking power of the world we dominate, to our peril.Mountain Patrol: Kekexili Opens today in New York and Los AngelesWritten (in Mandarin and Tibetan, with English subtitles) and directed by Lu Chuan; director of photography, Cao Yu; edited by Teng Yun; music by Lao Zai; production designers, Lu Dong and Han Chunlin; produced by Wang Zhongjun; released by National Geographic World Films, Samuel Goldwyn Films and Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia.

"'06-04-14,'0','The findings do not suggest that any of those companies' pension funds are in trouble. Rather, they reflect how poorly the current accounting rules depict a pension fund's need for cash versus a company's ability to provide that cash.Over all, Milliman found, adopting the proposed accounting change would wipe away about 8 percent of corporate America's net worth, revealing hidden weaknesses all across corporate America.The new rule, proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, would eliminate the pension numbers that now appear on corporate balance sheets, which incorporate a good deal of historical activity, going back as much as 20 years. It would replace those figures with current, market-based numbers.The effect of the change would vary for different companies. A small number, including Berkshire Hathaway and the FPL Group, would actually see their balance sheets improve as a result of the new method.But for companies with weak finances and worrisome pension funds, the new rule would emphasize how hard it might be to make good on all their promises.The typical company would see its balance sheet weaken by about $1.7 billion on a pretax basis, the study found. In the most extreme cases, adopting the new rule would wipe out the companies' net worth. Milliman's calculations showed that was likely at General Motors, Lucent and Goodyear Tire & Rubber.And for companies that already have zero or negative net worths, like AMR, Qwest, Unisys and Crown Holdings, adopting the new pension rule would further weaken their reported financial state. Qwest, for instance, currently reports a pension surplus.John W. Ehrhardt, a principal and consulting actuary with the Milliman firm, said he believed that the credit rating firms were already aware of the coming changes and had incorporated them into their ratings for the companies they cover.Still, weaker balance sheets make it harder for companies to borrow, and Mr. Ehrhardt said he expected the hardest-hit companies to sell assets and take other measures to try to shore up their balance sheets. He cited the recent announcement by General Motors that it was selling its 7.9 percent stake in the Japanese truck company Isuzu Motors for about $300 million as an example.A G.M. spokesman said that the sale of its Isuzu stake was, in fact, intended to raise cash to finance the buyout program it recently announced and for other strategic initiatives being planned.The new accounting rule is scheduled to take effect at the end of this year. The accounting board recently issued it for public comment.The new rule is the first part of a two-stage overhaul of the rules for pension accounting, which has come under sharp criticism in the last few years. The first part deals with the way pension funds are reported on corporate balance sheets. The second part will tackle the way pension investments affect reported corporate profits.The accounting board is also writing new rules for reporting retiree medical plans, which could compound the effects of the pension accounting changes. In its study, Milliman measured only the pension effect.To show how the new rule would work, Milliman's analysts recalculated the 2005 balance sheets of the 100 companies, plugging in the reported data as if the new accounting rule had already been in effect.That meant removing the pension numbers the companies now report on their balance sheets. One problem with those numbers is that, in many cases, they reflect years of overly optimistic assumptions about how much the pension fund investments would earn. Over time, the accumulated effect of such assumptions was that companies were carrying assets that did not really exist. The new rule would make companies replace those numbers with market-based pension values.At the moment, market-based pension information can only be found in the footnotes to a company's annual report. But even sophisticated investors complain that it is next to impossible to reconcile the numbers in the footnotes with those shown on the balance sheet.The footnotes of I.B.M.'s annual report, for instance, show a $3 billion total deficit for the company's American and international pension plans. But changing the accounting is not a simple matter of taking that number out of the footnotes and putting it on I.B.M.'s balance sheet. I.B.M. is also carrying a $20 billion ""prepaid pension asset"" on its books, which the new accounting rule would eliminate because it does not correspond to actual assets in the pension fund.Taking away the $20 billion asset and adding $3 billion of new obligations would weaken I.B.M.'s balance sheet by $23 billion. But because of other reconciliations, Milliman found that in the end, I.B.M.'s balance sheet would weaken by $17 billion.The analysts cautioned that many things could happen before the new rule becomes effective. Fluctuations in the financial markets could improve the pension funds' soundness, and the new accounting rule might be revised as a result of public comments.Correction: April 22, 2006, Saturday A chart in Business Day on April 14 with an article about the effect of a proposed change in pension accounting procedures on businesses misstated the value of General Electric's shareholder equity. It is $109.4 billion, not $11.7 billion.'"
"'06-04-15,'0','In at least one instance, nearly 200 fired workers in Wisconsin were reinstated, demonstration leaders said, after the leaders met with employers, discussed the significance of the protests and threatened to identify the companies publicly.""I have no problem with the demonstration, but this is a business,"" said Charley Bohley, an owner of Rodes restaurant and fishmarket in Bonita Springs, who fired the 10 workers there after posting a note warning employees that they could not miss work for a rally on Monday. ""Couldn't they have protested in the morning before work? Couldn't they have protested in their hearts?""Though the number of workers who have lost their jobs across the country, estimated in the hundreds, is small compared with the numbers marching in the streets, some protest organizers say word of the firings spread rapidly and might have a chilling effect on many more workers and on students, some of whom also say they have faced discipline for missing school for rallies.The firings have also forced some organizers to rethink how best to plan future demonstrations, and some are considering opting out of events now in the works.In Washington, Jaime Contreras, the president of the National Capital Immigration Coalition, said his coalition voted on Thursday night not to take part in a proposed national boycott or strike set for May 1. Jose I. Sanchez, an organizer in Texas, said his group was considering holding a rally on the Sunday before May 1 instead, just to avoid such strains.""We shouldn't put our progress in jeopardy,"" Mr. Contreras said. ""That is a tool you use when you have to, but you have to be completely prepared for backlash and repercussions.""In many cities, rally organizers said, plenty of businesses, many of which have pushed for efforts to give legal status to immigrants, cooperated with the demonstrations and allowed workers time off. In Indianapolis, one company went so far as to let 2,000 people leave their jobs for Monday's demonstration downtown, said Ken Moran, an organizer.""The firings we've seen were an anomaly,"" Mr. Moran said, ""but it's a sad situation.""In complaints filed with the government in one case, Mark A. Sweet, a lawyer for two fired restaurant workers in Milwaukee, said the restaurant had violated the National Labor Relations Act by firing the workers for what he considered legally protected activities: efforts to assist in the mutual aid and protection of themselves and other immigrant workers.Other legal experts, however, questioned whether such a provision would apply to a public rally, and suggested that the workers had few remedies. For the most part, ""at-will"" employees may be fired at any time, for any reason, said Charles B. Craver, a professor at The George Washington University Law School.""For private employers, there is normally no special First Amendment right to get out of work to engage in a protest,"" said Rodney A. Smolla, the dean of the University of Richmond School of Law. ""A company might decide that it's good for morale to accommodate the exercise of freedom of speech on an issue that is very important to people, but that's an employment judgment not law.""In Tyler, Tex., Maria Rodriguez described on Friday how she and others had lost their jobs putting together equipment for air-conditioners for Benchmark Manufacturing Inc. Ms. Rodriguez, 32, who said she had made $6.75 an hour after several years with the company, said she had always been given time off in the past for personal appointments. This time, though, she was fired, she said.""To me it seemed unfair,"" Ms. Rodriguez said. Even as she was being fired, she said, she saw applicants arriving at the company to replace her.Benchmark Manufacturing issued a statement outlining the company's absence policy, and adding, ""This issue is not about going to the rally, it is about following the company policies that govern every employee.""Against the backdrop of the broader immigration debate, the firings raised another tangled issue for some of the companies and for the workers: the legal status of those employees removed. Ms. Rodriguez, a native of Mexico, said she moved to the United States 14 years ago and did not have legal status. Some other advocates for those fired in other states said they did not know the legal status of the workers.Elsewhere, after advocates intervened, some workers were rehired this week. At Wolverine Packing in Detroit, company officials said they invited 21 fired workers — 20 of whom were considered temporary workers — to return to their jobs, with back pay, on Monday. The company, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it planned to recheck employment documentation ""due to reports that some of the temporary staffers may have been illegal.""Elena Herrada, who met with the company on behalf of the workers, said she did not know if any of them were in the United States illegally. The employees were already unhappy with their working conditions, Ms. Herrada said, and none were planning to return.'"
"'06-04-15,'0','The court, in striking down the convictions of six people charged under the ordinance, called it ""one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States"" and cited the example of other cities, like Portland, Ore.; Tucson; and Las Vegas, that have enacted similar ordinances but limited enforcement to certain times of day or designated places.The Eighth Amendment, barring cruel and unusual punishment, prohibits Los Angeles ""from punishing involuntary sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks that is an unavoidable consequence of being human and homeless without shelter,"" Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw wrote.The Los Angeles police responded by releasing a statement that said: ""The condition of being homeless in and of itself is not a crime and should not be treated as such. But the criminal element that preys upon the homeless and mentally ill will be targeted, arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""It added, ""The department will continue to work with the city's political leadership and the courts to find solutions to help keep the homeless safe and off the streets.""A spokeswoman for the city attorney's office, Contessa Mankiewicz, said, ""We are disappointed, and we are reviewing our options."" She said that the ordinance was not often prosecuted but that statistics were not immediately available.The police in Los Angeles, which has been wrestling with how to reduce a homeless population that by some counts is the largest in the country, have used the ordinance in an effort to clean up Skid Row, a 50-block area east of downtown that has long been home to the down and out.There, some 10,000 to 12,000 homeless people live near new condominiums and apartment buildings that have arisen in an explosion of gentrification. The ruling said there was shelter for 9,000 to 10,000 homeless people in that area, leaving about 1,000 people or more without a roof over their heads.""So long as there are a greater number of homeless individuals in Los Angeles than the number of available beds, the city may not enforce"" the ordinance, the judges said.The case was filed in February 2003 by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and the National Lawyers Guild on behalf of six homeless people who had been ticketed in Skid Row and in some cases jailed briefly or ordered to pay fines. The appeals court's ruling on Friday overturns a district court ruling in favor of the city.The court sent the case back to the district court to write an injunction barring enforcement of the law.In a dissent, Judge Pamela Ann Rymer said the ordinance ""does not punish people simply because they are homeless,"" and added, ""It targets conduct — sitting, lying or sleeping on city sidewalks — that can be committed by those with homes as well as those without.""She added, ""We do not — and should not — immunize from criminal liability those who commit an act as a result of a condition that the government's failure to provide a benefit has left them in.""Legal experts said it was unusual to win a case based on the Eighth Amendment, and even more so because it was directed at regulating the homeless.Gary Blasi, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles law school who has studied legal issues involving the homeless, called the ruling significant. ""This is one of the very few cases, certainly for this level of the judicial system, that says to government that you can't criminalize the mere fact of being homeless,"" Mr. Blasi said. ""The city can regulate times and places, but you can't forbid people from occupying the face of the earth.""Advocates for the homeless cheered the ruling. ""The fact this court has ruled on this law in this way has a message, and our hope is cities will get the point that you can't respond to homelessness by trying to eliminate homeless people,"" said Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, a legal advocacy group in Washington.'"
"'06-04-15,'0','The expansive pro-immigrant rallies nationwide in recent weeks have buoyed positions staked out by business, with some officials also noting the softening of stances by lawmakers like Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, both of whom backed strong border security measures but have since indicated they were willing to seek some compromise.The United States Chamber of Commerce, with three million members, has kept close tabs on the House and Senate leadership, while other groups watch for inroads among those House members who are rethinking their support of a tougher border security bill that passed in December and that has galvanized protesters and energized anti-immigrant groups.Some trade groups have taken notice by deciding not to donate to politicians who oppose their positions. Craig J. Regelbrugge, senior director of government relations for the American Nursery and Landscape Association, which represents one of the fastest-growing segments in the agricultural industry, said: ""Some Republican lawmakers who have been supportive of a business agenda are supporting legislation that will severely harm or destroy the industry. Our own leadership has basically said that this issue is so fundamental that we need to be supporting people who are at least showing an openness toward a comprehensive approach.""Others have not crossed that bridge. Sharon M. Hughes, executive vice president of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, said she was arranging for various growers to attend sessions in places like Citrus and Pascoe Counties in Florida, where Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, planned to be, and meet with key senators like John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho.""As much lobbying as I can do here in D.C,"" Ms. Hughes said, ""one visit's worth a hundred of mine.""In Arizona, the state's Chamber of Commerce sponsored a breakfast earlier this week with a Republican congressman, Jeff Flake, in Phoenix, and immigration was one of the hottest topics. Mr. Flake voted for the tough border security bill in the House, although he has long favored a guest worker program and was stymied in his efforts to offer an amendment along those lines.Businesses in Arizona have long felt the acute tensions between border security and some type of temporary worker program. Farrell Quinlan, a chamber vice president, boasted that his state's delegation in Congress, led by Republican Senators John McCain and Jon Kyl, needed little prodding.""There's a pretty broad consensus that this is the year we should tackle the issue,"" Mr. Quinlan said. ""Do we want to see a wall or a fence go up on the border? I don't know. If that's what it takes to get a guest worker program right now, then that might be the price to pay.""To the national Chamber of Commerce, the Senate has no choice but to resume negotiations over immigration once it returns to Washington on April 24, said Randel K. Johnson, vice president for labor, immigration and employee benefits.Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has indicated he might hold hearings this month.""I do think they'll resurrect it,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""I think just to have it hanging out there unresolved, the way that it was unresolved, it makes the Senate look poorly in general.""In addition to guest worker proposals, business groups worry about proposals that require employers to verify a worker's legal status, because they would face sanctions for noncompliance.Citing government estimates of high error rates in a pilot program that checks workers' documents, the chamber issued an internal document estimating that if some current plans were adopted, such a program could cost $11.7 billion for government, employees and workers. It urged that money from the Department of Homeland Security be spent to overhaul those trouble-ridden databases that check driver's licenses and Social Security numbers.""The employer community is not the document-forgery experts in the country, nor should they be asked to be,"" said R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce.Because the databases are fraught with errors, Mr. Josten said employers should not be penalized until the system is fixed. ""I don't know how you hold the business community responsible for that,"" he said. ""The government's got the responsibility to fix that problem.""From database checks to tighter border security, lawmakers have repeatedly invoked national security to support positions for more restrictive immigration measures. To Ms. Hughes of the council of agricultural employers, the issue of national security also plays out on the lettuce and produce fields.If restrictive immigration laws force production over the border, she said, ""we will be importing all of our food,"" adding, ""If you care about national security, you should care about a domestic food supply.""'"
"'06-04-15,'0','WASHINGTON, April 14 - Representative Alan B. Mollohan of West Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the House ethics committee, defended on Thursday a sharp increase in his assets and income from rental properties and said his financial disclosure forms ""provide an accurate picture"" of his investments, income and liabilities.A conservative group has contended that Mr. Mollohan's financial disclosure forms included more than 250 instances of omitted or undervalued assets from 1996 to 2004.The group, the National Legal and Policy Center in Falls Church, Va., filed a 500-page complaint with the United States attorney for the District of Columbia in February challenging the accuracy of Mr. Mollohan's financial disclosure forms. The forms showed that his real estate holdings and other assets increased to more than $6 million in 2004, from about $500,000 in 2000.""I would never be so bold as to say that there are no errors whatsoever in the 24 annual financial disclosure statements I have filed as a member of Congress,"" Mr. Mollohan, first elected in 1982, said in a statement. ""If there are any errors in those forms, they were inadvertent, and I am convinced that they are not material -- that is, those forms provide an accurate picture of the investments, income and liabilities of my wife and me in the manner prescribed by the financial disclosure law.""Mr. Mollohan did not address the group's contentions that he profited from investments made with people associated with nonprofit groups that received federal money that he had earmarked as a member of the House Appropriations Committee.Mr. Mollohan said he and his wife, Barbara Whiting Mollohan, had ""benefited from the surge in real estate values in recent years, particularly in the District of Columbia,"" where they own rental properties.Mr. Mollohan also said that any surge in their assets should be weighed against their debt.""The value of our holdings has increased in recent years, but it is highly deceptive to look at the value of our holdings without also looking at our liabilities,"" he said, adding, ""Each of the major investment properties we own is heavily mortgaged.""'"

"'06-04-15,'0','In 1988, on his first attempt on the 29,035-foot Everest, Viesturs turned around 300 feet from the crest. On the 26,289-foot Shishapangma, he stopped 20 feet from the top. He is nothing if not courageous, and sometimes the greatest courage is to turn around from a fight you may not win.In my own career as a wild-river rafter, I participated in the first descents of some 35 rivers, including many classics, like the upper reaches of the Euphrates, the Yangtze, the Indus, the Bio-Bio and the Zambezi.The rapids on these rivers were not the only threats -- there were crocodiles and other predators, exotic diseases, poisonous snakes, political instabilities and extreme weather. I am still standing, though some who rafted with me are not, including my original partner, Lew Greenwald, who drowned on the Blue Nile in 1975.Why do some adventurers make it and others do not? Certainly there are objective dangers, ones that come with the territory and cannot be controlled. But personality is a factor as well. Some adventurers are embodiments of a duality, attracted to the flame of risk but at the same time cautious and attentive to detail, a jazz artist fused with the traits of an accountant.The intoxicating cult of boldness rewards those who take risks, and in my years as an adventure guide I have met many who were drawn into this activity for the wrong reasons or who possessed the wrong temperament for durability. Some, who are undistinguished academically, athletically and socially in an urban environment, have drifted into the adventure business and discovered that they are seen as heroes for doing things that others shun, from running high-risk rapids to climbing dodgy walls. If they survived, they became like rock stars of the outdoors. It is a heady dynamic and, like a drug, it is hard to give up There is motivation to keep doing one greater to get that fix of attention, adulation or financial reward.Viesturs's quest was always a personal one, and he said in many lectures that he climbed ""to come home."" He never succumbed to outside pressures to climb something he judged too perilous.I also pursued my run of first descents as a personal passion and had no interest in abandoning a sensible approach even in the wildest settings. I found no ignominy in portaging, or running down the side of big rapids even as colleagues went with gusto down the middle. But after Greenwald drowned on the Blue Nile, I almost quit taking risks.Greenwald was pursuing adventure for all the right reasons, and he was careful. But his luck ran out with a freak capsizing, and with his drowning I saw the dark side of adventure.How could anything be celebrated that snatched away lives so full of promise, charity and happiness? Suddenly the thought of rafting seemed like a kind of wickedness, a frivolous exercise that had such an insidious downside that I could not imagine why people would risk it.In time, I came to realize that though Greenwald's death was a sacrifice, the supreme sacrifice, it was one made in search of life, not sitting in stagnant, polluted waters behind a dam or a desk. If only for a moment, he lived life to its fullest, rode along the keen edge between water and sky, and was sparked with life and light, blood racing with the passion of existence. He lost, but so do we all, eventually.The trick, I realized, was to traverse the line of risk, but with eyes wide open, seat belts tight, and with no compunction to turn back if conditions are not optimal. If luck holds, then life might be long and rich, rewarded with the innate value of endeavors wisely pursued.OUTDOORS Richard Bangs is co-founder of Mountain Travel Sobek, one of the first modern adventure companies.Correction: April 17, 2006, Monday A picture caption on Saturday with a sports article about the risks of mountain climbing referred incorrectly to Ed Viesturs's attempt to become the first American to climb the world's 14 tallest peaks. He completed the quest last spring, as the article said; he is not still trying.'"
"'06-04-15,'0','IN THE MOOD -- Retail sales rebounded in March, the Commerce Department reported, bolstering economists' conclusions that the economy is basically sound and will continue to expand for the rest of the year.Over all, sales rose by 0.6 percent in March, recovering from a decline in February. Excluding a slump in gasoline sales caused by rising prices, overall sales rose 0.7 percent. Auto dealers, building centers, and bookstores reported sales gains, while sales slowed at electronics and appliances stores.Confident shoppers may reflect a solid job market. The Labor Department said 313,000 applied for first-time unemployment benefits last month; that was a gain of 12,000 over February, a higher-than-expected rise, but economists said it nonetheless suggested a robust jobs market.The government is scheduled to release its estimate of total economic growth in the first quarter at the end of this month. Some economists are forecasting an annual pace of 4.5 percent, which is relatively brisk.SCALING BACK -- Some corners of the economy, of course, remain weak, particularly domestic automakers. The Ford Motor Company identified two more factories -- pickup-making plants, in St. Paul and in Norfolk, Va. -- it plans to close by 2008 as it tries to deal with falling sales and large losses on its North American auto operations.General Motors also continued to retrench, agreeing to sell its remaining stake in the Japanese truck maker Isuzu for about $300 million, which it needs for expenses to close plants, shed workers and introduce new models in North America.More cutbacks are likely at both companies. Ford, for example, has said it will soon identify two more plants that it intends to shut as it tries to match its production capacity to its diminished share of the American market.TV ON THE PC -- Seeking to come to grips with digital technology that is revolutionizing its industry, the Walt Disney Company said it would make some of its programming available over the Internet free, but in a format that makes it impossible to skip commercials.For Disney, the approach may bolster revenue by allowing it to sell two sets of advertising -- traditional television commercials one day and online ads the next, when shows are posted on the Internet. For advertisers, the approach could let them reach a younger, Web-oriented audience and would prevent viewers from fast-forwarding through ads as they can on a digital video recorder.Starting next month, Disney will make four shows from its ABC network -- ""Desperate Housewives,"" ""Lost,"" ""Commander in Chief"" and ""Alias"" -- available online.KEEPING ENRON'S SECRETS -- As part of a settlement with Enron on charges of market manipulation, federal regulators want to keep secret most of the audiotapes, e-mail messages and other documents that show how Enron reaped billions of dollars by gaming the system, according to Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington.The actions came during the California energy crisis that caused widespread power shortages and utility bankruptcy filings. On partial transcripts released during the government's investigation, Enron traders boasted of cheating some unsuspecting customers who would not understand that their pockets were being picked by the company, which deliberately withheld power supplies to the state to inflate prices.Harlan Loeb, a spokesman for what he calls ""the new team"" that is running Enron, described the proposed settlement as ""the best deal for creditors.""WORLD OF PAIN -- A week after awarding a 77-year-old New Jersey man and his wife $4.5 million in compensatory damages from the painkiller Vioxx, a jury concluded that the drug's manufacturer, Merck, owed the couple $9 million more in punitive damages because it deliberately misled regulators about risks associated with Vioxx.The painkiller is associated with increased risk of heart attack in patients who take it for at least 18 months. The plaintiff in this case, John McDarby, had done so and suffered a heart attack, which led him to break his hip. He now uses a wheelchair.Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., has said it will appeal the decision, the first time that a jury in New Jersey -- home of many of the country's biggest drug makers -- has awarded punitive damages against a pharmaceutical company.The company faces thousands of other lawsuits over Vioxx, an arthritis medication taken by 20 million Americans from 1999 to 2004.MOST POPULAR -- Following are the most-popular business articles on nytimes.com from April 8 through April 14:2.

KBR is a global engineering, construction and services company supporting the energy, petrochemicals, government services and civil infrastructure sectors. Halliburton, which is based in Houston, plans to sell just under 20 percent of its stake in KBR, which has diluted the company's financial results and drawn criticism for its multibillion-dollar contracts in Iraq. Analysts have said spinning off the unit will let Halliburton concentrate on its oil field business. Halliburton shares rose 5 percent when it announced plans for the offer in January. KBR did not say how many shares it would sell, nor did it give an expected price range. It disclosed the offer in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

"'06-04-15,'0','""As an adviser, that gives me huge concern,"" Mr. Cordaro said. ""If the market takes a turn down, they could lose a lot of money."" The new futures and options provide ""an easy and low-cost way to hedge out the excess real estate costs they don't need.""This couple could sell futures contracts with a lifespan of three months on the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index for New York. Each contract is worth $250 times the index level, which recently was around 210. To hedge against a $1 million home, the couple would need to sell about 20 contracts.If home prices declined in the region during the three months, the couple would receive $5,000 for every point that the index fell, an amount that should offset a drop in the value of their home. If prices rose, they would have to pay $5,000 for every point of increase in the index, but their house should be appreciating by a similar amount. The other regions covered are Boston, Miami, San Diego, Washington, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Los Angeles.What if you have no home but intend to buy one? Mr. Cordaro recalled Silicon Valley's heyday.""You get really hot markets like San Francisco in the late 1990's,"" he said. ""For folks who were looking to move out there and couldn't find a place, it would have been a good move to go long a San Francisco contract to preserve your space in the market. If prices go up, you're not going to get hurt. You can still get a decent house.""In theory, anyway. When derivative contracts are listed, they are not necessarily traded -- at least not in adequate quantity to make them effective hedging tools. Glenn Mueller, a real estate strategist at the Dividend Capital Group in Denver, is skeptical and is waiting to see how those markets develop.THE idea underlying the contracts ""obviously makes sense,"" Mr. Mueller said. ""When you're trying to hedge risk and you can get someone to take the other side, you do it.""But he wonders who will take the other side, speculating on home prices to rise. One answer is portfolio managers looking to diversify into real estate without having to come around every month to collect rent checks and fix plumbing.Many more constituencies would have reason to bet on a decline, however: mortgage lenders guarding against defaults and the prospect of holding foreclosed properties, builders concerned that their homes may fetch lower prices once they are on the market, as well as individual owners. Such lopsided interest could distort pricing, he warned, and furnish windfalls to professionals.Mr. Mueller advised homeowners to hold off ""until there has been at least a year of trading and you can see there's liquidity."" Otherwise, ""you've bought an option, you want to get out and no one's buying today, or all week, for that matter.""Mr. Cordaro is hoping that institutional investors will take to the new vehicles and then ""individuals can piggyback on it."" But he counseled against using them to gamble.""I wouldn't speculate,"" he said. ""I really hope folks will stay away from that. You can lose a lot of money speculating. Leave that to the pros.""'"

""And he didn't want to embarrass the bureau.""Mr. Clements said last week that he recalled in detail his meetings 30 years ago with Mr. Giuliani, as well as his frustration that the case was dismissed as unimportant.Mr. Giuliani, who built a reputation in part by prosecuting corrupt police officers, said through a spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, that he had no recollection of the DeVecchio case.Whatever the level, if any, of Mr. Giuliani's role, the case stands as a long-buried piece of law enforcement history, a fork in the road that, if traversed differently, may have led to an entirely different set of consequences. Indeed, from the vantage point of 1976, the gun case may have seemed a minor matter. There was no way to know that seven years later, according to the state indictment filed last month in Brooklyn, Mr. DeVecchio would step across the line, helping a Mafia informant kill at least four people.But if Mr. DeVecchio had been pursued in 1976, would he have risen to lead the F.B.I. squad that hunted the Colombo crime family? Would he have had a role in some of the government's watershed cases against the mob? Would he now stand accused of second-degree murder?His lawyer, Douglas E. Grover, said federal officials were right to never charge his client in the gun case because they were merely antiques that were peddled at a gun show. But he acknowledged that had that case been successfully pursued Mr. DeVecchio would probably have lost his job. ""It also means that they may made not have made the Commission Case,"" he said, referring to a 1986 trial at which top organized crime leaders in New York City were convicted.The gun case began in early 1976 when Mr. DeVecchio traveled from New York to King of Prussia, Pa., to sell a Nazi-era Luger at the Valley Forge Gun Show, which promotes itself as ""a gun show in the truest American tradition.""He was looking, according to his testimony in a later case, to sell the weapons ""for the benefit of the widow"" to whom they belonged.Without a license, he moved through the stalls of the firearms bazaar, and was soon approached by Michael Flax, an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Mr. Flax said. Mr. Flax's job was to troll the show in plainclothes looking for such illicit deals. That year alone, he said, several people he caught similarly selling guns without paperwork went to prison. ""I was usually like, 'Gee I'd like to get this gun,' "" he said in an interview from his retirement home in San Diego. ' ""Do we have to go through all the paperwork?' ""Mr. Flax recalled that he bought the Luger in a parking lot outside the show. Over several weeks, he said, he pursued an investigation of Mr. DeVecchio in which a second agent secretly recorded the F.B.I. man selling another gun. He said that Mr. DeVecchio, at one point, gave him a phone number at which he might be reached. It was, he said, an office of the New York F.B.I.A few weeks later, Mr. Flax brought the case to Mr. Clements, then a young federal prosecutor in Baltimore. Mr. Clements is now in private practice and active in the Democratic Party, having given money to candidates like John Kerry and Al Gore.""Flax comes to me saying, 'You're not going to believe this,' "" Mr. Clements said last week. "" 'I have an F.B.I. agent selling guns illegally.' ""A few months later, Mr. Clements said he told the F.B.I. as a courtesy that he was investigating one of its agents. A few weeks passed, he said, with discussions back and forth with F.B.I. officials in Maryland and in Washington. ""The next person I heard from,"" he went on, ""was Rudolph Giuliani.""Mr. Giuliani was, at that point, an aide to Harold Tyler, the deputy attorney general, who reviewed such cases. Mr. Giuliani had joined his staff in 1975 after serving in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan where he had helped direct the prosecution in the Prince of the City police corruption case.Over several weeks, Mr. Clements said, Mr. Giuliani asked him to write a pair of memoranda on the case in which he noted that Mr. DeVecchio had sold the guns without the proper paperwork, a crime, Mr. Clements said, for which he thought there was sufficient evidence to prosecute. Mr. Clements said he attended a pair of meetings about the case with Mr. Giuliani, including one in Mr. Giuliani's office also attended by Mr. Tyler and Jervis Finney, the United States attorney in Maryland who was then Mr. Clements's boss.Mr. Finney, now the chief lawyer for the governor of Maryland, said last week he has no recollection of the meeting. But Mr. Clements produced a datebook he said he had saved that listed a meeting with Mr. Giuliani in June 1976.At that meeting and a subsequent meeting in October, Mr. Clements said Mr. Giuliani repeated his desire not to prosecute the case, saying the guns were old and the sale of them without paperwork did not warrant prosecution.Judge Tyler, who Mr. Clements said was at the second meeting, died last year. The bottom line, after both meetings, Mr. Clements said, was that the case would be dropped.In the ensuing years, Mr. DeVecchio rose to lead the F.B.I.'s special unit that investigates the Colombo crime family, a position in which he had success in part because of his relationship with a captain in the family, Gregory Scarpa Sr., who became his informant.The closeness of that relationship ultimately led to a two-year inquiry of Mr. DeVecchio by the F.B.I. that ended in 1996 with the decision to bring no charges against him. But Mr. DeVecchio soon retired.In 1997, the old gun case briefly resurfaced. At a federal appeals hearing in Brooklyn. Mr. DeVecchio was called as a witness by a gangster, Victor J. Orena, who was trying to win his freedom by suggesting that Mr. DeVecchio was a corrupt agent who had lied about the facts in his case. Under questioning by Gerald Shargel, Mr. Orena's lawyer, Mr. DeVecchio acknowledged selling the guns to the federal agents.Mr. Shargel then went on to ask him: ""Do you remember agents of the A.T.F. reporting to the F.B.I. and Rudolph Giuliani -- not yet the mayor -- that you had lied to those agents who questioned you, that when confronted with the crimes that you committed, you gave them false exculpatory statements?""Mr. DeVecchio said that he did not.In the new indictment, announced last month by Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, Mr. DeVecchio is accused of helping Mr. Scarpa commit at least four murders in the 1980's and early 1990's in exchange for weekly payments. Most of the victims had been talking to the authorities, prosecutors said, and thus were a threat to Mr. Scarpa.When Mr. Clements read of the indictment, he said he was surprised. At the same time, he recalled the words that he and Mr. Flax had swapped, years ago, when the gun case, as he put it, ""went away.""It was an old-time adage on those who break the law, a general theory of recidivist crime. ""If someone's a bad actor, we'll get him again,"" he remembered telling Mr. Flax.'"

"'06-04-16,'0','In recent weeks, rival factions within the Shiite bloc, which holds 130 seats in Parliament, have been jockeying for the prime minister post. As the largest bloc in Parliament, they have the right to nominate the prime minister. Mr. Jaafari, considered by many to be an ineffectual leader, won the nomination in February by a single vote in a secret ballot among the Shiites. He had been backed by the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr.But in late February, the main Sunni Arab, Kurdish and secular blocs in Parliament said they would not accept Mr. Jaafari. Since a two-thirds vote of Parliament is essentially needed to install the executive branch, the process is at a standstill.The Shiites have been trying to come up with another nominee for nearly two months. The candidate who lost to Mr. Jaafari in the secret ballot, Adel Abdul Mahdi, was considered a front-runner. But Mr. Sadr despises Mr. Abdul Mahdi's party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.It appeared today that Mr. Abdul Mahdi would take a vice president position rather than continue fighting for the nomination, said Khalid al-Attiyah, an independent member of the Shiite bloc.""He's no longer running for the premiership,"" said Mr. Pachachi, the speaker.Mr. Attiyah and Mr. Pachachi said the Shiite leaders agreed that Mr. Jaafari's political group, the Islamic Dawa Party, could nominate a candidate if it withdrew Mr. Jaafari, but it was unclear whether Dawa officials would be able to persuade Mr. Jaafari, the party's leader, to step down. Shiite politicians mention two party deputies inside Dawa — Jawad al-Maliki and Ali al-Adeeb — as possible replacements.Some Shiite officials see those men as weak, like Mr. Jaafari. ""The options are limited for the Dawa Party,"" Mr. Attiyah said.The Shiites have come under increasing pressure from the clerical leadership in Najaf and the American government to resolve the dispute. American officials have made it clear to the Shiites they would prefer a replacement for Mr. Jaafari because of his close ties to Mr. Sadr, who oversees an unpredictable militia, and his relationship with Iran, where he lived for many years in exile.Mr. Jaafari's party is the most respected Shiite political group in Iraq. It was heavily persecuted by Saddam Hussein and came to represent the Shiites' sense of victimhood under the old government. Shiite officials have considered nominating some politicians outside the Dawa Party. These include Hussein al-Shahristani, the former nuclear physicist; Kassim Daoud, national security adviser under the government that preceded Mr. Jaafari's; and Ali Allawi, the finance minister and a nephew of Ahmad Chalabi, a secular Shiite politician and former Pentagon favorite.Iraqi politicians are also fighting over the post of speaker of Parliament. The main Sunni Arab bloc is pushing the other blocs to support its leader, Tariq al-Hashemi, for the job. But some Shiites oppose Mr. Hashemi, saying he is too hard-line and sectarian in nature, said Sami al-Askari, a member of the Shiite bloc.American and Iraqi officials say they hope the formation of a unified government will help stanch the sectarian bloodletting that has gripped Iraq. In the power vacuum, the rate of killings has soared, especially in the aftermath of the bombing of a sacred Shiite shrine on Feb. 22. This afternoon, a suicide car bomb detonated outside the Al Shemal restaurant in the town of Mahmudiya, killing at least 10 and injuring at least 25, police officials said.Guerrillas in Anbar Province, to the west, carried out assaults that killed four marines in two separate incidents on Saturday, the American military said today. At least 48 American troops have died so far this month, many in Anbar.A British soldier was killed and three injured in a bomb explosion on Saturday, the British Defense Ministry said.Early today, American-led forces raided a home in the town of Yusufiyah, the American military said in a written statement. During an ensuing battle, five insurgents and a woman were killed, and three women and a child were injured, the military said, while declining to give details on who was responsible. It said the raid was to search for a suspected Al Qaeda member, whom troops found.In eastern Baghdad, a bomb planted in a minibus killed at least four people and wounded six others, an Interior Ministry official said. Gunmen killed a policeman in northern Baghdad and injured four others. Policemen found three bodies in the Tigris River, all shot in the head.In Kirkuk, men dressed in Iraqi Army uniforms opened fire on civilians stopped by a road, killing two and injuring two others, said Col. Yadgar Abdullah of the Kirkuk police.Dozens of policemen who were missing after an insurgent ambush on a police convoy north of Baghdad on Thursday have been accounted for, said Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a spokesman for the American military. He added that he did not know their condition. At least nine other policemen were killed and seven wounded in the nighttime attack.The police chief of Najaf, where the policemen work, said Friday that the convoy had been forced to drive back to Najaf in the dark because the Americans had refused to let the policemen stay at an American base in Taji, where the policemen had been picking up new vehicles. Colonel Johnson said today that the Americans had actually tried to prevent the police from leaving the base for safety reasons, but the convoy had driven out a side gate.'"
"'06-04-16,'0','MILWAUKEE, April 15 (AP) — Two boys missing for almost a month apparently drowned in an icy park lagoon near where they were last seen, and the authorities said Saturday that foul play was not suspected.Purvis Virginia Parker, 11, and Quadrevion Henning, 12, disappeared the afternoon of March 19 after asking Quadrevion's grandfather whether they could play basketball at the nearby park. The bodies were found in the lagoon on Friday.The police said Saturday that the boys had accidentally drowned. They peculated that Purvis, who could not swim, fell in first, and that Quadrevion, who was a strong swimmer, jumped in to try to save him.""It's believed that the boys' bodies have been in the water since the day they were reported missing,"" Police Chief Nan Hegerty said in closing the investigation. ""They were probably in the water before we were even notified that they were missing.""Jeffrey Jentzen, the Milwaukee County medical examiner, said the water was so cold at the time that the boys could have lost consciousness immediately and died within 15 minutes.'"
"'06-04-16,'0','It is this lightness, and a contrived detachment toward her characters, that became the target of the harshest criticism of her work, which at her death included more than 20 novels, several collections of short stories, poetry, criticism, biography, plays and a handful of children's books.Some accused her of coolness and even cruelty toward the characters she invented and then sent — sometimes quite merrily — to terrible deaths.""People say my novels are cruel because cruel things happen and I keep this even tone,"" she said in an interview in The New Yorker. ""I'm often very deadpan, but there's a moral statement too, and what it's saying is that there's a life beyond this, and these events are not the most important things. They're not important in the long run.""She was born Muriel Sarah Camberg in Edinburgh on Feb. 1, 1918, the daughter of Bernard Camberg, an engineer whose Jewish family had settled earlier in Scotland, and his wife, the former Sarah Elizabeth Maud Uezzell, a Protestant from a country village near London.When she was 5 she began attending James Gillespie's High School for Girls, where she became one of the crème de la crème of students selected for a specialized and somewhat unorthodox curriculum by Christina Kay, the teacher who would become the model for the protagonist in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" (1961), which was later adapted for the stage and film.Muriel Camberg acquired her Spark from her brief, and as she had put it, ""disastrous,"" marriage at the age of 19 to Sydney Oswald Spark, 13 years her senior, who was about to leave Scotland to teach in Africa.He was known as S. O. S., a fitting nickname, it turned out, when his mental instability and violence led her to end the marriage after seven miserable years. ""He became a borderline case, and I didn't like what I found on either side of the border,"" she wrote in her 1992 autobiography, ""Curriculum Vitae.""They lived in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and their union produced her only child, a son, Robin.She kept the name Spark, partly for her son's sake and partly because she thought it had ""some ingredient of life and of fun.""She longed to return to Britain, but she was trapped in Rhodesia for most of World War II because of wartime restrictions on travel. She finally succeeded in returning aboard a troopship in 1944, leaving her son, then 6, in the care of convent nuns in Central Africa until the war was over.Once home, she went to London in search of work, taking up residence at the Helena Club, which later became the model for the May of Teck Club, the setting for her 1963 novel, ""The Girls of Slender Means.""In London she landed a job with the Foreign Office in a secret division that disseminated black propaganda, a brand of disinformation she described as ""detailed truth with believable lies."" The reports, broadcast on what masqueraded as a German radio station, used real names and addresses to lend veracity to invented stories, and the announcers were German prisoners of war. Although the fabricated news items were aimed at undermining the Nazis, there were times when they worked too well and surfaced as news in the British press.After the war she worked at a jewelry trade publication, Argentor, in London, joined the Poetry Society and later became editor of its Poetry Review, a job that lasted for two tempestuous years before she was dismissed. Her innovations there included paying for worthy submissions and ending the practice of accepting payments from poets, a change that drastically altered the content of the review and outraged its establishment.She founded a short-lived literary magazine, then went to work for a publishing house, devoting the remainder of her time to writing poetry, doing book reviews and writing and editing scholarly works, including the letters of John Henry Cardinal Newman.Ms. Spark said she discovered through the writings of Cardinal Newman that the foundations of the Roman Catholic church corresponded with her personal convictions. She described her conversion to Catholicism as a natural step in her life. ""There was no blinding revelation in my case,"" she wrote in her autobiography.Her first novel, ""The Comforters"" (1957), was born of religion and delusions. Newly converted and living in London in 1954, during the period of postwar food rationing, Ms. Spark ate little and chased away her hunger with Dexedrine, a combination that led to a period of hallucinations. The words she had once manipulated turned on her, trapping her in a fog of anagrams and crosswords and convincing her that a code ran through the literature she read.After a few months, she sought medical help and stopped taking the amphetamines, but remained weak and ill. It was at this troubled time in Ms. Spark's life that Graham Greene stepped in, and for a while she was sustained by the money he sent, along with bottles of red wine, which, she wrote, ""took the edge off cold charity.""In ""The Comforters,"" a young woman recovering from a breakdown finds that she is a character in a novel that is being written on a phantom typewriter that only she can hear.Religion is present in Ms. Spark's work in a variety of guises, from the unseen and unforgiving hand in ""Memento Mori"" (1959) to the hypocrisy of self-righteously pious characters like the couple in the short story ""The Black Madonna."" Later in her life, the issue of her religious heritage became a persistent irritant.She traced the seeds of ""Memento Mori,"" her third novel, to her childhood, when she learned about old age and human frailty at close range, caring for her dying grandmother. Although the novel is steeped in death and deception it is at times unabashedly hilarious. In the book, one elderly person after another in a close circle gets a mysterious phone call with a simple message: ""Remember, you must die."" This slim novel about confronting mortality, packed with sex, blackmail and mystery, was adapted for the stage.While Ms. Spark's books cover a broad territory of plot and character, some central similarities can be found in many of the novels and short stories.Michiko Kakutani, in a review of Ms. Spark's novel ""Reality and Dreams"" in The New York Times in 1997, described the author's approach as a recipe: ""Take a self-enclosed community (of writers, schoolgirls, nuns, rich people, etc.) that is full of incestuous liaisons and fraternal intrigue; toss in a bombshell (like murder, suicide or betrayal) that will ricochet dangerously around this little world; and add some allusions to the supernatural to ground these melodramatics in an old-fashioned context of good and evil. Serve up with crisp, authoritative prose and present with 'a light and heartless hand.' ""This recipe appears with variations in novels including ""The Ballad of Peckham Rye"" (1960) , in which a truly devilish young man who calls himself an industrial analyst insinuates himself into the life of a community and goes about creating suspicion among neighbors, delving into personal secrets and destroying lives.It reappears in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,"" which provides a memorable example of a small and controlled community — a girls school in Edinburgh in the 1930's — in which the imperious teacher molds lives in a way few educators can.""Give me a girl at an impressionable age and she will be mine for life,"" intones the elegant Miss Brodie, who does not care whether her charges know their history or arithmetic as long as they have an appreciation of the finer things: art, Mussolini, proper care of the complexion, Franco.She captivates her students and enriches their lives while exerting unnatural control, grooming them to serve her will, whether in the bed of one of her lovers, as her personal spy or as a martyr to one of her political causes. Her single-mindedness in devoting her ""prime"" to her students has consequences for every life she touches, from the men who love her to the student who is the author of her undoing.Jay Presson Allen's adaptation for the stage became a vehicle in London in 1964 for Vanessa Redgrave, on Broadway in 1968 for Zoe Caldwell, who won a Tony for her performance, and in Hollywood in 1969 for Maggie Smith, who won an Oscar for best actress in the role.No other book by Ms. Spark has received the widespread popular acclaim and exposure of ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,"" but in subsequent interviews, the author expressed a firm preference for dwelling on the future rather than the past.In 1965 she published ""The Mandelbaum Gate,"" a heftier book and one that seems overstuffed by her standards. Set in Jerusalem against the backdrop of the war-crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann, ""The Mandelbaum Gate"" tackles questions of religion, memory and history superimposed on a torturous plot. The book won the James Tait Black Memorial prize.In ""The Driver's Seat,"" published in 1970, a woman embarks on a wild search through Europe for the man who will kill her. With ""Hothouse on the East River"" in 1973, she moved the locale to New York, and the next year she responded to the Watergate scandal with ""The Abbess of Crewe,"" her own tale of burglars and stolen secrets set in yet another type of institution — a convent. ""The Only Problem,"" in 1984, returns to the book of Job for inspiration.Divine retribution of a sort neatly ties up her book ""Aiding and Abetting"" (2000), a fictional tale of a real man, Lord Lucan, known as Lucky, who killed his children's nanny, whom he apparently mistook for his wife in the dark, severely battered his wife, then disappeared, with the help of his friends. In the novel, two men claim to be the aging Lord Lucan, and both present themselves to a very high-priced Paris therapist who is fleeing her own past — that of a fraudulent stigmatic.Her last book, ""The Finishing School"" (2004), revisits the themes of boarding schools and envy.Ms. Spark was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1967, became a Dame of the British Empire in 1993 and in 1997 won the David Cohen Literature Prize for lifetime achievement.She took issue, however, with the label ""British writer."" She told one interviewer, ""I am Scottish by formation."" She pointed out repeatedly that the bulk of her life had been spent in other countries. After London, she lived briefly in New York in the 1960's, then abandoned the crush of the literary world for Rome, where she had a rich social life and entertained lavishly.In Rome, she met the painter and sculptor Penelope Jardine, who became her secretary and later her companion. The two women traveled together, lived together, and over the years their lives grew deeply intertwined.Interviewers repeatedly asked about the nature of the relationship of the two women who spent so many years together. Ms. Spark brushed aside the idea that their involvement was romantic; it was characterized as an ""old-fashioned friendship.""Ms. Jardine purchased a sprawling medieval church compound in Tuscany, and they ultimately settled there. There Ms. Spark settled into her routine of writing in her favorite composition books, in longhand, using only pens untouched by other human hands, and rarely rewriting or revising what flowed from those pens. Ms. Jardine handled the business of everyday life, down to the typing of Ms. Spark's work.When asked in an interview what she contributed to the household, Ms. Spark said she made her own bed, took morning tea to Ms. Jardine and took her out to meals. ""I think I pull my weight somehow or other,"" she said.She saw her craft, she said in a 2004 interview, as driven by inspiration from an ""outside force"" unlocking memory in a manner derived from her reading of Marcel Proust.""It inspired me more than anything,"" she said at the time. ""I wouldn't have wanted to write like Proust, but I could see what you could do with memory. I could see what you could do with incidents. It was after reading Proust that I found I rather liked writing prose.""In her later years it became clear that she and her son, Robin, a painter who lives in Edinburgh, were irreconcilably estranged over various issues, including what he referred to as her abandonment of him, as well as her opinions about his ability as an artist and his public statements about their heritage.Ms. Spark was harsh in her public criticism of his work and open about their estrangement. She told a newspaper: ""He can't sell his lousy paintings, and I have had a lot of success. He keeps sending them to me and I don't know what to do with them. I can't put them on my wall. He's never done anything for me, except for being one big bore.""Their public feud extended to their religions and spilled into letters to newspapers and became a part of Ms. Spark's literary history when she donated letters from her son to the National Library of Scotland. Mr. Spark, who embraced Judaism about the same time his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, insisted that her mother had been Jewish, which by matrilineal inheritance would make him Jewish by birth; Ms. Spark, who considered herself only half-Jewish, maintained that though her father was Jewish, her mother was not.Critics have disagreed on how to classify her work, which is alternately bleak and side-splitting. John Updike spoke of ""fun-house plots, full of trapdoors, abrupt apparitions and smartly clicking secret panels."" Barbara Grizzuti Harrison called her a ""profoundly serious comic writer whose wit advances, never undermines or diminishes, her ideas.""Taking the opposite view, Robert Maurer questioned the emotional underpinnings of her fiction, writing, ""One wonders how vast a reserve of sympathy lies beneath the iceberg of her consciousness, and how far beyond trickery her work would go if she let it show through.""Ms. Spark said in several interviews that she would rather not fit neatly into any literary category. ""I have a comic strain, but my novels are serious,"" she said in 1993. ""Sometimes one makes one's own category, you know.""'"

"'06-04-16,'0','When New York State lawmakers finished the state budget on time, sort of, for the second year in a row, you could hear the backslapping from Buffalo to Bridgehampton. Certainly the Legislature and Gov. George Pataki deserve some congratulations for meeting the budget deadline of April 1 -- that's far better than not meeting the deadline. But it was still an undisciplined budgeting process with an undisciplined $112 billion-plus budget as a result. These self-congratulating lawmakers have to start reforming a process that is so outdated it should be gathering dust over in the state archives.Most thoughtful politicians in Albany recognize that we have a problem here, but the wrong solution would be worse than nothing at all. Voters wisely rejected one such effort last year. As they look for a substitute, one of the best comprehensive proposals is from Alan Hevesi, the state comptroller. Mr. Hevesi was formerly the comptroller in New York City, where the financial crisis of the 1970's forced politicians to adopt a budgeting process that is much better than Albany's.What the state needs is more information, transparency and accountability. The key points of any acceptable reform include:Shift the calendar. All but three other states start their new year's budget on July 1. New York's begins April 1 -- too soon to know what tax season will bring in terms of revenues.Real revenue estimates. The first step in any budget -- yours or the state's -- is a legitimate estimate of how much money there is to spend. In Albany, that revenue estimate is always a matter of debate. The Legislature and the governor came close to agreeing that the comptroller should establish that estimate. The best option would be to create an Independent Budget Office much like the Congressional Budget Office. But if that proves too politically difficult, the state's chief elected fiscal officer -- that is, the comptroller -- should do it.More data. There should be a true spending plan made public in a timely fashion for each appropriation. The governor's office should be required to provide more detailed and up-to-date data throughout the budget year -- to the Legislature, to the public and especially to the comptroller's office.Thinking about the future. New York requires only limited midterm or long-term planning. Fiscal monitors, the public and the comptroller deserve to have a better, more coherent idea of how the state will deal with the projected gaps in future budgets.Visible debt. New York's borrowing is so difficult to tally that it came as a shock a few weeks ago when the Citizens Budget Commission estimated that the state is a stunning $227 billion in debt. Of that, $45 billion is to be paid off directly by the state, $86 billion by local governments and the rest through authorities that are part public, part private. The first step to bringing state debt under control is the easiest: Make it public.'"
"'06-04-16,'0','First responders never looked so much like action heroes as in these images by Paul Shambroom. That wasn't his goal when he was taking the photographs, at training facilities financed by the Department of Homeland Security. Instead he was interested in the simulated terrorist attacks these emergency workers were participating in, and how the exercises blurred the line between fantasy and reality. Sometimes they involved elaborate environments, like an abandoned town -- with a bowling alley, bank and convenience store -- bought whole to serve as a testing ground. In exercises where volunteers were exposed to pathogens, he was struck, he said in a talk at Bard College, by the theme-park atmosphere, where ""moonsuit-clad students go through their paces sniffing the air with exotic instruments."" The images, on view at Julie Saul Gallery in Chelsea, were inspired by the grand portraiture of the 18th and 19th centuries: subjects painted against stylized landscapes, in light at odds with the setting. ""I've tried to suggest a similar quality in my portraits, although my subjects are actually photographed in the natural settings,"" Mr. Shambroom said. Another important difference in the setting: the painterly quality is a result of a decidedly 21st-century effect -- digital manipulation.'"
"'06-04-16,'0','Mr. Jillette, for example, managed to satisfy a number of interests and objectives when he and his wife, Emily, gave their daughter her highly individual name.""You're likely to be the only one in any normal-size group with that name,"" Mr. Jillette said by e-mail, adding, "" 'Moxie' is a name that was created by an American for the first national soft drink and then went on to mean 'chutzpah,' and that's nice.""Besides, Moxie CrimeFighter fits right into the creative world.""Everyone I know with an unusual name loves it,"" he wrote. ""It's only the losers named Dave that think having an unusual name is bad, and who cares what they think. They're named Dave.""Not all performers present their decisions in such terms.""Apples are so sweet, and they're wholesome, and it's biblical,"" Ms. Paltrow said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2004. ""And I just thought it sounded so lovely and clean."" (""Moses"" meanwhile is a song that Mr. Martin wrote for Ms. Paltrow in 2003.)But while middle-class parents increasingly trade in standard names like Karen and Joseph for fancier ones like Madison and Caleb, movie stars seem compelled to push the baby naming further. The names may be merely distinctive (say, Maddox, Angelina Jolie's Cambodian-born adopted son) or bizarre, like Makena'lei Gordon, Helen Hunt's daughter, inspired by a place name in Hawaii. Celebrities may not so subtly be saying that for them ordinary rules need not apply.If celebrities are the new American aristocracy, the exotic baby name can sometimes function as the equivalent of a royal title, a way for a privileged caste to bestow the power of its legacy on future generations.""There's a sense of 'I'm special, I'm different, and therefore my child is special and different,' "" said Jenn Berman, a clinical psychologist in Beverly Hills, who has worked with actors. ""It's unconscious, but they think, 'We're a creative family, you have the potential to be creative, so here, I bestow you with the name 'Joaquin,' "" Dr. Berman said.As artists, actors often consider it their duty to shake up assumptions, defy conventions and push the frontiers of the possible. To settle for a tedious name for the child would almost be a form of spiritual surrender, said Stuart Fischoff, a psychologist, who has also worked with Hollywood clients.""They're expressing their creativity, and they're also expressing their fear,"" Dr. Fischoff said. ""It would be very embarrassing for people to think of them as normal.""The unusual celebrity baby name is not new. Decades ago, Anthony Perkins named his sons Osgood and Elvis, and Marlon Brando named his daughter Cheyenne. And Ms. Paltrow, the daughter of the actress Blythe Danner and the director and producer Bruce Paltrow, is named Gwyneth, after all.But those who track the popularity of baby names say that the pressure for stars to come up with creative names for their children has grown in recent years, particularly as Hollywood members of Generations X and Y have moved into their peak years of child rearing, carrying with them their generation's taste for obscure pop cultural references, iconoclasm and smirky irony.Just as Frank Zappa proved himself the classic hippie prankster by naming his children Moon Unit and Dweezil in the 1960's, the actress Shannyn Sossamon, 26, established herself as a proud product of her times by naming her son, born in 2003, Audio Science.""A name is free, it is something that everyone has, so if you are a celebrity, you are going to have to work that much harder to set yourself apart as a person with a specialized knowledge or a rarefied taste,"" said Pamela Redmond Satran, who has written baby-name books with Linda Rosenkrantz, including ""Beyond Jennifer and Jason"" (St. Martin's). She said a competitive impulse among stars seems to account for the recent bonanza of unlikely baby names.""In a weird way, it's like anorexia"" in Hollywood, Ms. Satran said. ""Anyone can be thin. The famous have to be thinner.""They also have a traditional role as tastemakers. It's hardly a coincidence that the name Ryder, which was the 901st most popular boy's name in the country in 2001, according to Social Security Administration statistics, jumped to 341 in 2004, the year Kate Hudson and Chris Robinson chose it for their newborn son.But as regular people -- the sort who wait in line at restaurants and pay for their own clothing -- try to catch up, the stars are pushed further into the realms of obscure names, in an effort to stay ahead of this particular fashion curve. So stars troll deeper into the Old Testament for name ideas (both Bono and Wynonna Judd have an Elijah, and Cynthia Nixon has a Charles Ezekiel), into world geography (David and Victoria Beckham have a Brooklyn, and Summer Phoenix and Casey Affleck have an Indiana) or even into Grandmother's attic. (Jude Law dusted off the name Iris for his daughter, and Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams exhumed the name Matilda for their first child last fall.)Some therapists said the celebrity impulse to foist odd names on their children amounts to simple narcissism by the parents, and the resulting status comes at the child's expense. The children, after all, are the ones who will have to raise their hands every time a teacher calls out ""Coco"" or ""Eulala.""""It's like having a mini me,"" said Robert R. Butterworth, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles, who has had actors on his patient roster. ""The child is a part of them, not an individual. It's an appendage.""The burden of celebrity falls even on the unborn. The child Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are expecting has already been a cover subject for magazines.Other psychologists, however, believe fears for the child's well-being are overblown. If, for example, Harvey Keitel's son, born in 2004, feels a bit conspicuous being named Roman, he will at least have company. Both Cate Blanchett and Debra Messing named sons Roman that year.Besides, the offspring of the Hollywood elite have other matters to discuss in therapy, said Dr. Berman, who said she has counseled several: ""With kids of celebrities, in all honesty, the other issues are so big this one pales in comparison.""'"
"'06-04-16,'0','The apartment was in need of complete renovation, and Mr. Koch and his wife, Julia, hired the interior designer Alberto Pinto to gut it, fix it up and furnish it, a process that Mr. Koch estimated cost $5 million to $10 million. They changed the layout, replaced the wiring and the plumbing and installed central air-conditioning in a project that lasted four years. They lived in the apartment for six years, raising their two small children there.But Mr. Koch said that his wife is now expecting their third child in June, and Ms. Onassis' former apartment will be too small for their expanded family. ""There's just no way we could fit another child in that apartment,"" he said.The Fifth Avenue apartment has four bedrooms, two dressing rooms, a staff room, a library, living room, dining room, conservatory, two terraces, three fireplaces, five and a half bathrooms and a wine room, according to a floor plan provided by the broker who will be selling it, Leighton Candler, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group.In contrast, Mr. Koch said the apartment at 740 Park, which is a duplex, has about double the space. He paid $18 million for it and had the architect Peter Marino redesign the interior. He sounded reluctant but resigned to the move -- a man who was deeply fond of his former apartment. ""It's time to move to a bigger space to accommodate the larger family,"" he said.Mr. Koch said that he remained keenly aware of Mrs. Onassis' former presence at 1040 Fifth. ""For a while there, we sort of felt her spirit in the apartment,"" he said.""The way she had it decorated, the arrangement of the rooms. It was hers, and it gave me a feeling about her. I met so many people after I bought the apartment who told me they had been there for dinner and told me what it was like to be entertained in the apartment, and I almost had a sense of history about it. Her two children grew up in the apartment. We had our son in Caroline's old room and our daughter in John Jr.'s room. I was always aware of that. There was sort of a force that is hard to describe that kind of affected me.""He said that after buying the apartment, he had numerous requests from the media to photograph or film Mrs. Onassis' former home, and that he refused. ""I thought I would have been dishonoring her memory to have done that, and I never let any press in there at all,"" he said. ""I would hope anybody I sell it to would feel the same way.""Ms. Candler, the broker, was asked to what degree the price of the apartment today reflected a premium for its connection to Mrs. Onassis. ""It's the first thing that everyone notes about this apartment,"" she said. ""But provenance isn't accidental. You have people who have the choice of the best apartments in New York. There's no accident they both purchased this apartment.""WHEN Harold and Helen Lerner of Rutherford, N.J., emerged last September as the winners of a lottery jackpot worth $258 million, Mr. Lerner said he planned to buy a vintage Checker cab because it would remind him of his boyhood in Brooklyn.Now, Mr. Lerner, 60, and his wife, 52, have gone a step further and have bought a piece of Brooklyn itself, paying $2.25 million last month for a four-story town house on a 20-foot-wide lot on 10th Street in Park Slope, a short distance from Prospect Park.Nina Philips, the Corcoran Group broker who sold the house, said it was built at the end of the 19th century by William B. Tubby, an architect who designed several notable Brooklyn buildings, including the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture meeting house on Prospect Park West. She said the house retains many of its original details, including fireplaces with carved wooden mantels.Ms. Philips said the Lerners do not plan to occupy the house, but she refused to say who would live there. ""They would like to be private about it,"" she said.Sherman Pheiffer, a psychoanalyst and social worker who sold the house, along with his ex-wife, said that he had heard it mentioned in the course of arranging the deal that the Lerners were lottery winners but that he didn't give it much credence. ""At closing I thought that rumor couldn't have been true because they seemed very comfortable in their wealth,"" Mr. Pheiffer said. ""They didn't seem like newly rich people.""The Lerners' windfall in the Mega Millions game was said to be the biggest jackpot in New Jersey history and the fifth largest jackpot in the United States. The couple opted to take a one-time payout of $156 million, instead of receiving the full amount in installments over 26 years. They also had to pay 25 percent in federal income taxes on their winnings.At the time of their windfall, Mr. Lerner was a self-employed kitchenware salesman, and Mrs. Lerner was a pharmaceutical sales representative. They both said they would quit their jobs.The couple said they planned to donate money to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and to Seton Hall University, which Mrs. Lerner attended. They also vowed to spread the wealth among family and friends.Paul Michels, a lawyer for the Lerners, did not respond to requests for comment.TYLER PERRY, who wrote, directed and starred in the film ""Madea's Family Reunion,"" has signed a contract to buy a 1,600-square-foot condo in the East Fifties.The apartment is on a high floor of a 30-story glass tower that is being built by Macklowe Properties. It has two bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a large living room and a dining room with 11-foot ceilings, and a small terrace. The building is expected to be finished this summer.Mr. Perry began his career as a playwright and actor in the mid-1990's with the play ""I Know I've Been Changed."" Since then, his plays have grossed tens of millions of dollars on the urban theater circuit, which caters to black audiences. ""Madea"" was adapted from one of Mr. Perry's plays, as was ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" last year.Mr. Perry's book ""Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings"" (Riverhead) was released last Tuesday and was among the top sellers on Amazon.A spokesman for Mr. Perry said he would not discuss his real estate purchase.'"
"'06-04-16,'0','""There are many people today who call themselves evangelical whom no person would call an evangelical 40 years ago,"" said Donald A. Carson, research professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Ill.John C. Green, a senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, used polling data to separate evangelicals into three camps, traditionalist, centrist and modernist. The traditionalists, characterized by high affinity for orthodox religious beliefs and little inclination to adapt them to a changing world, bear the closest resemblance to what has been labeled the Christian right, whose most visible spokesmen have been figures like the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the television evangelist Pat Robertson, Dr. Green said.Centrists, he said, might be represented by the Rev. Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church in Orange County, Calif., and author of the best-selling book, ""The Purpose Driven Life."" Mr. Warren is theologically and socially conservative, but has mostly avoided politics and recently turned much of his focus to fighting poverty and AIDS in Africa.According to Dr. Green's findings from a survey taken in 2004, the traditionalist and centrist segments are roughly the same size within evangelicalism, each accounting for approximately 40 to 50 percent of the movement's adherents. Modernist evangelicals, who have much more diversity in their beliefs and lower levels of church attendance, are a small minority. Fissures between the traditionalist and centrist camps of evangelicalism have begun to emerge much more prominently in recent months in the political realm.Earlier this year, more than 80 evangelical leaders, many of them pastors who would likely be classified as centrists, including Mr. Warren and the Rev. Leith Anderson, pastor of a megachurch outside of Minneapolis and a former president of the National Association of Evangelicals, signed an evangelical call to action on global warming.Meanwhile many of the more conservative leaders in the movement, including Dr. James Dobson, the head of Focus on the Family, Mr. Falwell and Mr. Robertson, were conspicuously absent.""It's a tension that exists between the traditionalists and the centrists,"" said the Rev. Richard Cizik, vice president for governmental affairs for the National Association of Evangelicals, which did not sign the statement after pressure from Dr. Dobson, Mr. Falwell and others. ""The centrists want to deal with these issues. The traditionalists are saying, 'Hey now, I thought we understood the issues.' ""In its public statements, Focus on the Family said Dr. Dobson chose not to sign on because the group questioned the validity of the theory and believed that it put plants and animals above humans. ""For us, we have to focus on some core issues that are connected to our principles,"" said Paul L. Hetrick, a spokesman for the group. ""One of our core principles is the value or sanctity of human life.""Mr. Hetrick criticized other evangelicals like Mr. Cizik and the Rev. Jim Wallis, a prominent, politically liberal evangelical, who have been active on climate change and, more recently, immigration issues, for neglecting core concerns like abortion and gay marriage.""What's interesting is many times these folks can't get worked up in a lather about 45 million babies killed,"" he said.There is also a growing conflict over theology, or specifically the orthodoxy of the ""emerging church"" movement.ALTHOUGH much of the attention on the emerging church movement has been on changes that its leaders have made in worship -- bringing back liturgy and ancient practices like meditation and chanting -- the movement has also sought to introduce theological innovations.It emphasizes reading the Bible as a narrative, perfect in its purposes but not necessarily inerrant; de-emphasizing individual salvation in favor of a more holistic mission in serving the world; even making evangelicals less absolutist on whether people from other religions might find their way to heaven.All of this has made many evangelical leaders nervous. They worry that the ""emerging church"" will water down the theology.""It's over the question of the nature of truth,"" said R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., whose appointment in 1993 helped seal what many critics saw as a conservative takeover of the Southern Baptist Convention, evangelicalism's largest denomination.But Brian D. McLaren, founding pastor of Cedar Ridge Community Church outside of Baltimore and a chief apostle of the emerging church, argues that he is not promoting relativism; rather, he believes the evangelical movement has been hijacked theologically, as well as politically, by its more fundamentalist elements, something he is trying to correct.""In many, many areas, I'm looking at polarization, "" he said, ""and I'm looking at a third way.""These disputes are nothing new for evangelicalism. The evangelical movement as it is known today emerged in the 1940's and 50's as a middle way between what many Christian leaders perceived as theological liberalism in the mainline Protestant denominations and the cultural separatism of the fundamentalist movement.Today, with the term, ""evangelical,"" often equated with ""fundamentalist,"" many in the movement are even discussing whether the label evangelical should be jettisoned completely, said David Neff, editor of Christianity Today, an evangelical magazine.""I did sit in a room with a number of key leaders, some Christian college presidents, some representatives of major college ministries,"" he said. ""They were seriously discussing whether the word evangelical should be used anymore, or should we call ourselves classic Christians or historic orthodox Christians.""'"
"'06-04-16,'0','ATLANTIC CITY, April 15 - At the Irish Pub, a bar washed in the neon glow of the city's casinos, all was well with the world late Friday night as people smoked and laughed, pints and shots were poured and consumed. Then came the announcement smokers in New Jersey had been dreading.""If you are going to smoke, please go outside,"" the disc jockey said just after midnight.At 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, New Jersey became the 11th state to ban smoking in many indoor places, including bars, restaurants and office buildings. The ban does not include private homes, cars, tobacco shops and, following strong lobbying, the gambling floors of the state's 12 casinos here in Atlantic City, though smoking is forbidden in the casinos' common areas.The exemption for casino floors, while good for smokers who come to the city to gamble, is particularly harsh for bars and restaurants in Atlantic City, owners say, because while it has been tough to compete against the casinos -- with their free drinks, flashy entertainment and artificial daylight -- local businesses have been able to eke out an existence.""We have to be competitive to stay alive,"" said Cathy Burke, the owner of the Irish Pub. ""The casinos can give food, rooms and drinks away, but we can't. Now, you can only smoke at the casinos -- this is going to be devastating to business."" Ms. Burke, along with others, sought a last-minute reprieve from the ban before a federal judge on Thursday, but the appeal was denied.Her bar, at least, has outdoor seating where smoking is permitted. Other bars have nothing but the sidewalk outside.'"

"'06-04-16,'0','Crazy witch! he yelled at her.Go take a look in your yard, look at all those shiny new pennies everywhere, she said, and maybe time has embellished history, but as Win recalls it, the moment she mentioned the pennies and the man went to the window to look, a fierce wind kicked up from nowhere, and a tree branch slammed against that very window and shattered it.Nana and Win drove off with a carload of dogs, pitiful mangled creatures, while he cried uncontrollably, tried to pet them, do something to make them not hurt and shake so much, and after they left them at the animal hospital, they drove home, and it had gotten very cold, and the heat had been turned on inside the house, and Win's mother and father and Pencil were dead.""A goofy mixed-breed yellow Lab, Pencil. Because as a puppy he was always chewing up my pencils,"" Win replies.""That's awful."" It sounds so empty when Lamont says it.""I felt it was my fault,"" he tells her. ""Maybe the same way you feel about what happened to you, that it's somehow your fault. Victims of rape often feel that. And you know that. You've seen it enough in your office, in court.""""You were raped. You were almost murdered. But you're right. You're not a victim. You were one.""""As were you.""""In a different way, but true.""""How old?"" she asks.""Geronimo,"" she says. ""I've always wondered why Geronimo. Courage? Determination? Revenge for the deaths of his family? The great Apache warrior.""She is her old self in a handsome black suit, sun lighting up every piece of glass in her office. Win feels as if he's in the middle of a rainbow, a rainbow that is hers. If she tells the truth, the whole truth, there is hope.""Because you had to become the hero?"" she is asking, trying to show warmth and hide her fear. ""You had to become the warrior because you were the only one left?""""Because I felt useless,"" he says. ""Didn't want to do sports, compete, be on teams, do much of anything that might somehow measure me and show how useless I really was. So I kind of kept to myself, reading, drawing, writing, all sorts of solitary things. Nana started calling me Geronimo.""""Because you felt useless?"" Lamont reaches for her sparkling water, a blank expression on her striking face.Nana always reminding him: You're Geronimo, my darling. Don't ever forget, my darling.And Win is saying to Lamont: ""One of the many things Geronimo said is: 'I cannot think that we are useless or God would not have created us.. . .And the sun, the darkness, the winds are all listening to what we have to say.' So there you have it, what I have to say about myself. The truth, Monique,"" he adds. ""Now it's your turn. I'm here to listen, but only if you plan on telling me everything.""She sips water, looks at him, deliberating, then: ""Why would you give a damn, Win? Why really?""""Fairness. The worst things that have happened aren't your fault.""""You'd really care if I went to prison?""""You don't belong in prison. It wouldn't be fair to the other inmates.""Surprised, she laughs. But her mirth fades quickly. She drinks more water, her hands nervous.Win says, ""This isn't just about your running for governor, is it?""""Apparently not,"" she says, keeping her eyes on him. ""No, of course not. It was a twofold plan. My losing the Finlay homicide file and then its showing up on my property would have turned At Risk into a farce, turned me and my office into one, ingratiated Huber with the governor, the two of them in on that one together, I have no doubt. Either I'm murdered or I'm ruined or both, really. No one saying nice things at my funeral. Useless. I know that word, too, Geronimo."" She pauses, looking at him. ""Useless and foolish.""""The governor want you murdered?""She shakes her head. ""No. He just didn't want me to win the election. Jessie wanted the governor to be grateful to him -- how the hell do you think he's gotten where he is in life? Favors. Manipulations. He wanted me dead, and oh, well, that certainly would have made life easier for Crawley too, but no. Our dear governor wouldn't have the stomach for that. Jessie always wants everything in a big way. Especially money.""""Insider trading, Monique? Maybe buying shares in a high-tech DNA lab that's about to get a lot of attention?""She reaches for her water bottle. It's empty. She pulls out the straw, drops it in the glass trash basket under her desk.""Prohemogen,"" Win then says. ""DNA technology that genetically matches patients with drugs. The lab you picked for your media extravaganza may do ancestral profiles in criminal cases, but that's not where the money is.""She listens. She has that familiar look on her face when she is putting the case together.""The money's in using genomics to help with the development of these next-generation superdrugs. Huge money, huge,"" Win says.""The lab in California,"" he keeps going. ""All the national attention you, the governor, will bring it because of this murdered old woman in Tennessee. Well, that's extremely helpful, now isn't it? You draw big attention to them and their lucrative biotechnology -- give them that kind of free marketing, and guess what? Maybe their stock goes up. How much stock do you own?""""That makes at least one thing obvious,"" she says. ""Make it look as if I took the case home, was hiding it. But make sure it's found.""He looks at her for a long moment, says: ""Pretty shrewd. Ruin you but save the day. The case file's found eventually. Publicity and more publicity. At your expense. Maybe the case is solved, maybe not, but a lot of publicity for that lab in California.""""It will get it anyway. Already is. The case is solved.""""The lab didn't do anything wrong. In fact, it did everything right. Helped solved the case.""""Sad truth is, that murdered old woman didn't matter at all in any of this,"" Win says. ""The powers that be didn't care.""Lamont is thinking, probably trying to move things along in a direction that suits her, says: ""I know you probably don't believe me, but I did care. I wanted her case solved.""""How much stock do you own?"" Win asks again.""That idea never would have entered my mind. I knew nothing about the company, but in Jessie's position, he's privy to all sorts of biotechnology, all sorts of private labs springing up all over the world. I didn't know about this, about the California lab and its biotechnology. I just thought we were working a 20-year-old murder case that turned into a very public crime initiative I called At Risk. Really.""""Huber the one you were with the night before you were attacked? Probably when your keys disappeared? You said you were out, went to work straight from wherever it was you were staying.""Win has a minidisc recorder running on top of her glass desk. He is taking notes.""We had dinner. I can't. . .I can believe a lot of things about him.. . .""""Motive."" Win's not going to let her avoid the answer.She takes her time, then: ""Jessie and I are friends. Just as Jessie and you are friends.""""I seriously doubt it's quite the same.""""Earlier this year, he gave me some advice about my portfolio."" She clears her throat, tries to steady her voice. ""I made some money, realized what was going on a week later when I read in the paper that U.S. regulators had cleared the sale of a particular drug being developed at some lab, not the one in the Finlay case. Another one.""""Enough of a motive for him to set up your murder?""""He's been getting insider tips in exchange for subcontracting out thousands of DNA kits to be analyzed for our database, for databases in other states based upon his recommendations. Major purchases of instruments for his labs, recommendations for other crime labs to buy the same things. It's been going on for years.""""He admitted all this to you?""""After his stock advice, a lot of things began to add up."" She glances at the recorder. ""The more he told me, the more he implicated me. I'm guilty of insider trading. Next I'm guilty of conspiracy, of knowing what the director of the state crime labs is doing, and I don't say a word. Not to mention.. . .""""He loves me,"" she says with nothing in her voice as she stares at the recorder.""Amazing way to show it.""""I ended it months ago, after he gave me the advice about the stock and I realized what he was into, what he had just gotten me into. What he is. I told him I didn't love him anymore, not that way.""""I told him I wanted nothing more to do with his illegal activities, that they had to stop. And if they didn't, there would be consequences.""""You told him this when?""""Last spring. Probably wasn't a smart thing to say,"" she mutters, staring hard at the recorder.""You could have had a lawyer present,"" Win reminds her. ""You said all this willingly. I didn't force you.""""Nice suit, by the way."" She looks at his light gray suit, swallows, tries to smile.""Emporio Armani, about three seasons out of date, 70 bucks. I didn't force you,"" he repeats.""No, you didn't,"" she says. ""And I'll take what comes.""""It will be a pleasure.""Win picks up the recorder, pops out the disc, says, ""Ever enter your mind you got enough glass in here to burn down your entire building?""He selects a crystal paperweight, holds it up to the sun streaming through a window, focuses a white-hot dot on the disc. Lamont watches in amazement as a thin stream of smoke rises.""What are you doing?"" she says.""You're living inside a tinderbox, Monique. Could burst into flames any minute. Maybe you should be more careful, take the heat off yourself, direct it elsewhere. Focus it very intensely where it belongs.""He hands her the ruined disc, their fingers lightly touching, says: ""In case you get cold feet. Just pull this out and remember what I said.""She nods, tucks the ruined disc in a pocket.""Another bit of advice. When someone else interviews you, like a grand jury, for example,"" he adds, ""I suggest you leave out unnecessary details. The way I see it, most people are going to assume Huber was setting you up, conspiring with the governor, jealous, vindictive because you spurned him, greedy. On and on. I wrote down most of it. The relevant information."" He holds up his note pad. ""Just left out the misleading information. And you know what that information is. Such as any stocks Huber recommended, anything illegal he admitted to you that you never passed on. No proof. You could have chosen to make any investment you wanted, doesn't mean you got inside information, right? His word against yours.""She watches him, studies him, as he hits ""send"" on his cellphone.""Sammy?"" he says. ""I want Huber brought in for questioning. Yup. The time has come. Get the warrant, we're going to search every place he owns. And our little buddy, Toby. Bring him in, too.""""With pleasure. Lay it on me,"" Sammy's voice says.""Attempted murder, conspiracy to murder, arson. And let's see.. . ."" Win looks at Lamont, some of that old steely glint back in her eyes. ""I'm sure the feds will be delighted to hear all about his S.E.C. violations.""""And then what? What about me?"" Lamont asks Win as he ends the call. ""You really think I'll be all right?""""Funny how nothing changes,"" he says, getting up from his chair, smiling at her. ""Funny how it's always about you, Monique.""Next week: The debut of ""Limitations,"" by Scott Turow.THE FUNNY PAGES: III: SUNDAY SERIAL Previous chapters are online at www.nytimes.com/funnypages.'"

Built in 1922, the Art Deco structure holds a riot of Oriental carpets, urns, mounted rifles, statues of Nubian princesses and other riches. Doubles from 840 dirhams.WHERE TO EAT -- When the French pulled out of Morocco in 1956, they left behind an appreciation for fine food and drink that persists to this day. Paris-style bistros are entrenched in Casablanca's culinary landscape, and French ingredients infuse top restaurants that are not ostensibly Gallic. Prices below are based on a three-course meal for two, without wine.Despite its gimmicky name, Rick's Café (248, boulevard Sour Jdid, Old Medina; 212-22-27-42-07) has become one of the city's chicest restaurants and bars since its 2004 debut. Inspired by ""Casablanca,"" the exquisite mini-palace evokes the glamour and exoticism of the city's cinematic glory. By night, bartenders in white jackets and red fezes pour cocktails for an international crowd dining on parfait de foie gras, roast duck in mango sauce and other French-tinged specialties. About 500 dirhams.Fancy a fillet of ostrich? Join local foodies at A Ma Bretagne (Boulevard de l'Ocean Atlantique, Sidi Abderrahmane; 212-22-39-79-79). Operated by one of the nation's most decorated chefs, André Halbert, a Frenchman, this modern, oceanfront restaurant was designed by Brigitte Martinez, a Philippe Starck student with more restraint than her teacher. Within the airy glass and wood space, bourgeois Moroccan and French couples sip selections from the extensive international wine list and dine on a seasonal menu based on market availability. Recent specials included sea bass tartare, duck a l'orange, king prawns in flaky pastry, John Dory fish in lobster sauce and ostrich. A selection of classic desserts (like chocolate soufflé and poached pears) and petit fours winds up the evening. About 800 dirhams.The humble pigeon becomes culinary art at Al Mounia (95, rue du Prince Moulay Abdellah; 212-22-22-26-69). Diced, stuffed into puff pastry and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon, the bird forms the core of the excellent pastilla at this ornate shrine to traditional Moroccan fare. Also on the menu are very good sweet-savory tajine stews, grilled kebabs and spiced couscous piled with judiciously tender meats and vegetables. Dazzling Moorish décor creates a dramatic dining atmosphere. Around 600 dirhams.For dessert, tote your vintage Hermès bag to the intersection of Boulevard Moulay Rachid and Boulevard d'Anfa, where you'll find the Villa Zevaco (212-22-36-60-00). A sleek, modernist 1949 house, seemingly airlifted from Palm Springs, it has recently become an outpost of Paul, the upscale French patisserie chain. The hangout serves sorbets, chocolate croissants, hot chocolate and an extensive brunch (for 99 dirhams) to Casablanca's air-kissing socialites.WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- Imbibe Casablanca's distinctive architectural cocktail. Though run-down, the Art Nouveau buildings along the Boulevard de Paris, Boulevard Mohammed V and Avenue Lalla Yacout are teeming with wrought-iron balconies, sinewy curves, tendril-like ornamentation and other details that suggest the 16th arrondissement in Paris. Morocco's version of prehip Miami is the Gauthier district, which radiates with Art Deco buildings. And in the city's downtown, the Rialto theater remains a singular landmark. Seemingly carved from lemon and strawberry sherbet, the Rialto (35, rue Mohammed Qorri) in 1943 was host to Josephine Baker, who was living in Casablanca at the time.Gothic and Art Deco merge at the abandoned Sacré Coeur cathedral, a huge sepulchral presence on Boulevard Rachidi. In Place Mohammed V, the large central post office and other administrative buildings embody the Neo-Moorish style, a fusion of centuries-old Arabo-Andalusian details and modern Le Corbusier-esque functionalism.The icon of the Casablanca skyline is the towering 656-foot minaret of the Hassan II Mosque (Boulevard Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah; 212-22-48-28-86). The third-largest mosque in the world (after those in Mecca and Medina), Hassan II was finished in 1993 after six years of round-the-clock labor by some 10,000 artisans. Tours (120 dirhams) daily except Friday.WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- Come weekends, Casablanca goes cosmopolitan. French expatriate businessmen loosen their ties, staff members of international embassies from the nearby capital, Rabat, arrive in party mode, and Moroccan professionals and socialites don their best European fashions. Conveniently, the city's nocturnal scene is concentrated along the seaside corniche in the Aïn Diab district, another haven of Art Deco edifices. Like an all-night buffet, this coastal strip is lined with D.J. lounges, live music sites and Arab-themed discos full of smoldering chicha pipes.One of the most stylish spots is the very sleek and very pink Candy Bar lounge in the Hotel Riad Salam (Boulevard de la Corniche Aïn Diab; 212-22-79-84-40). At Armstrong (41, boulevard de la Corniche Aïn Diab; 212-22-79-76-56), the band is so loud that you can barely think. Still, the place attracts dense throngs of 20- and 30-somethings, and the festive vibe is contagious. For a mellower scene, head to the minimalist-chic Mystic Garden (33, boulevard de la Corniche Aïn Diab; 212-22-79-88-77), a restaurant-bar that offers a counterdose of Scandinavian design and mellow music.WHERE TO SHOP -- For one-stop shopping, the nearby Twin Center (191, boulevard Zerktouni) houses a high-end mall below its dual towers. Walk into the cool white marble atrium and walk out with Fendi sunglasses, an armful of Swatches, sacks of Agatha jewelry and a closet full of Italian footwear.For chic Moorish-modern home décor, hit Thema Maison (27, rue Houssine Ben Ali; 212-22-22-03-60). The Art Deco town house is stocked with tufted cushions, psychedelic blankets, eggplant-colored drapes, tangerine-hued table runners and other ethno-chic concoctions. Moorish antiques can be found, at a price, at Amazonite (15, rue du Prince Moulay Abdellah; 212-22-29-50-19). Buyers scour Morocco for Fez pottery, Berber jewelry, inlaid woodwork and more.HOW TO STAY WIRED -- Just off the Prince Moulay Abdellah pedestrian shopping street is G@.Net (29, rue Abdelkader Al Moftaker; 212-22-22-95-23). High-speed Internet access costs 10 dirhams (about $1) an hour.YOUR FIRST TIME OR YOUR 10TH -- The mazelike passages of the Old Medina -- Casablanca's 18th-century town -- are a welcome antidote to the busy modern city. Amid the echoing calls to prayer and the shouts of hawkers working the souk, an ancient world unfolds: men in djelleba robes praying in small mosques; fully veiled women toting groceries; pushcarts laden with fish rumbling over the stones. The New Medina, a post-World War I creation, is another Neo-Moorish masterwork by French colonial architects. Visit the colorful olive market and handicraft stalls.HOW TO GET THERE -- Morocco's national airline, Royal Air Maroc (800-344-6726; www.royalairmaroc.com), offers several nonstop flights a week from Kennedy Airport. Round-trip fares for April begin at $768, taxes included. From May 17 to June 12, the airline's Web site is offering a special promotional fare starting at $499, taxes not included.HOW TO GET AROUND -- Casablanca's red ""petit taxis"" are cheap and abundant. On the meter, most trips around the central neighborhoods will cost 10 to 20 dirhams. A trip to the Aïn Diab night-life district runs closer to 30 or 35. The minimum charge is 7 dirhams. After 8 p.m., the meters increase by 50 percent. GOING TO'"

"'06-04-16,'0','Jeff Fluhr, StubHub's chief executive, said his site was ""the embodiment of supply-and-demand economics."" Mr. Fluhr said it provides ""choice and availability that primary ticketing channels don't.""All of that comes at a price, though. While tickets can sell for less than face value for an event with little appeal, prices can also go through the roof (though Mr. Fluhr said that extremely high-priced tickets almost never sell until the price is reduced, and that the site has better deals than brokerages).But in an age when the rich are getting richer, many people are willing and able to pay a steep price. ""You have to expect with all the wealth people have, that you're going to have tremendous demand for Yankees tickets,"" Professor Happel said.More than just supply and demand is at work. ""You have a lot of people with a lot of money,"" said John Allen Paulos, a professor of mathematics at Temple University. ""It's not surprising that they are going to take advantage of being able to easily buy tickets online.""For those people, there is an ""opportunity cost"" of doing business the old way. ""It's one of the most profound ideas of economics,"" he said. ""If you make a ton of money, an hour or two saved more than makes up for the money you are paying.""That doesn't mean that those with less money won't be mad. ""The general puzzle is why people believe in just prices -- why certain prices are right and certain are wrong,"" said David D. Friedman, a professor of economics and law at Santa Clara University, who doesn't see any justification for the outrage. ""People have this intuition they are entitled to this price.""Part of that may be that people remember the days when ticket prices did not fluctuate. But for Professor Friedman the reason goes back further, perhaps to the days of the hunter-gatherers, when bartering was the norm and people knew the ""usual"" value of things.Professor Happel said that brokerages and sites like StubHub offered a service to the risk-averse. They guarantee that the tickets are genuine and will arrive in time. ""But the best way to protect fans and get the lowest-priced tickets over all,"" he said, ""is to have a designated area where on game day you allow open trading.""Arizona allows for such reselling zones outside venues, where sellers and buyers can meet. In the zones, Professor Happel said, prices can drop as the starting time approaches. In the 2001 World Series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Yankees, he said, tickets for Game 6 could be had for half the face value.Professor Happel can't fathom why New York, for one, doesn't have a similar law. ""Isn't this the home of Wall Street?"" he said. ""Don't they understand that free markets are the best way to protect the consumer?""'"

"'06-04-16,'0','The convoy was attacked while it was passing through a predominantly Sunni Arab area just north of Baghdad, where Iraqi security forces have conducted numerous raids on suspected insurgent strongholds and come under frequent attack.The Iraqi police, accompanied by an American military police unit for protection, had gone to Taji to retrieve 10 vehicles from the Americans, the authorities said.According to Maj. Gen. Abbas Maadal, chief of police in Najaf, the Iraqis had requested permission to stay overnight on the base because of the hazards of traveling at night. They were denied, General Maadal said, and were sent back to Najaf. The American military police escort also left the base, though ahead of the Iraqis, officials said.Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, an American military spokesman in Baghdad, disputed General Maadal's account, telling The Associated Press that the police had never asked to stay on the base.Clarifying an earlier report, Maj. Steven Stover, another military spokesman in Baghdad, said Saturday that the American escorts had planned to rest overnight in Rustamiya, south of Baghdad, not Taji. He added that he had no knowledge of the Iraqis' plans and could not speak for the Iraqi police force.Ann Bertucci, a spokeswoman for the American military's police training program, said the Iraqis never planned to stay the night at Taji. ""It was always planned as a day trip,"" she said. ""They arrived, fueled up and left.""The American command referred all further inquiries to the Iraqi authorities. General Maadal declined to comment further on Saturday. The governor of Najaf, Asad Abu Goulal, also declined to reveal further details of the case.Iraq's political leaders continued their scrum over a new government, as members of the leading Shiite bloc met to debate whether Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari should remain the government's top official.An independent member of the bloc said Saturday that the revered Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani sent a communiqué to the Shiites on Friday. Though the contents of the letter were not made public, another senior member of the bloc, Ridha Rawad Taki, seemed to be referring to the document when he said in an interview on Al Iraqiya television that the bloc had received ""instructions"" from Mr. Sistani ""that everybody should submit concessions to solve this issue.""Iraq's political leaders are under extraordinary pressure to resolve the impasse. Parliament is scheduled to convene Monday. In addition, Iraqi and American political leaders assert that lawlessness has thrived and government bureaucracies have slowed to a crawl in the absence of a permanent government.""There will be a change soon, and the crisis will be solved,"" said Jalal Edeen al-Sagheer, a senior member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a Shiite party that has opposed Mr. Jaafari's nomination. ""If things move as they are right now, we will reach a solution in 24 hours.""The American military command said Saturday that a marine died in a vehicle accident in Anbar Province on Saturday.In Basra, gunmen killed Lt.

""It began to occur to me that I did not want to be in the ground covered with weeds and whatnot and totally forgotten,"" he said. ""I don't like the idea of dirt being dumped on me.""Six feet up and not six feet under is increasingly the direction in which people want their remains stored when they die, representatives of the funeral industry say. In addition to custom single-family mausoleums, community mausoleums for both coffins and cremated remains are also gaining popularity; in classical or contemporary styles, these often have room to hold hundreds of niches for coffins or urns.The Cold Spring Granite Company, among the country's largest makers of cemetery monuments, sold 2,000 private mausoleums last year, up from about 65 during a good year in the 1980's. Prices range from $250,000 to ""well into the millions,"" said Michael T. Baklarz, a vice president of the company.The development is perhaps logically to be expected of those at the leading edge of the baby boom generation, which forms the bulk of the market. The progression seems natural for the folks who gave the world blocklong, gas-hogging sport utility vehicles and lot-hogging 40,000-square-foot suburban homes.""It's in keeping with the McMansion mentality of boomers,"" said Thomas Lynch, an author and funeral director in Michigan. ""Real estate is an extension of personhood.""The market for the custom structures is greatest on the coasts, although exclusive estate sections have recently been set aside for private mausoleums at cemeteries in Atlanta, Cleveland and Minneapolis.Some mausoleums echo the temple of the goddess Fortuna Virilis in Rome. Some are hefty, rusticated stone barns. Some have more square footage than a good-size Manhattan studio apartment, their interiors fitted out with hand-knotted carpets, upholstered benches and nooks for the display of memorabilia. In late 2004, a Southern California family ordered a mausoleum with room for 12 coffins, 20 cremation niches and a patterned marble vestibule.Commonplace in the 19th century, when both newly prosperous immigrants and robber barons vied to stake claims on American soil by investing in the only real estate that is ""permanently valuable,"" as Mark Twain famously remarked, the mausoleum seemed to have lost favor in recent years.More people were choosing to be cremated — industry experts say that more than a quarter of the 2.3 million people who died in 2004 were cremated — and some opted for new forms of interment like the ""green burials"" that flickered onto the cultural radar after a character from the HBO series ""Six Feet Under"" was buried unembalmed and without a coffin, in an unmarked grave protected by a nature preserve.Yet the brief buzz about eco-burial, executives from America's nearly $15 billion funeral industry say, may obscure the larger reality that, as in seemingly every other facet of contemporary life, the taste for personalization has touched the funeral industry in time to provide an otherwise static business with an opportunity for growth.""Nobody wants a cookie-cutter burial anymore,"" said Robert M. Fells, the external operating officer of the International Cemetery and Funeral Association, the industry's leading trade group. At the group's annual convention in March in Las Vegas, the resurgent interest in building private mausoleums was striking, Mr. Fells said.""The private family mausoleum used to be considered a high-ticket, upscale item that only the wealthy could afford,"" Mr. Fells said, and there is no reason to amend that impression given that $250,000 is the average base price to build a private family tomb. ""The pendulum is swinging back to people being willing to spend money for things that are meaningful to them,"" he said.The need to create ""new concepts in the death care industry,"" said Christine Toson Hentges, vice president of a company that owns three cemeteries in Wisconsin, has helped increase the appeal of private estate sections.""We've reversed the traditional way of selling,"" Ms. Hentges added. Traditionally, funeral directors or cemetery owners began their post-mortem pitch to families by quoting the most affordable options. ""But now we're going top-down and starting with private buildings,"" she said, ""because there is this influx of people who are financially successful and who are thinking about these issues and how to have a structure that tells the story of their lives.""At the historic Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, a spokesman said that there had been no marked increase in private mausoleums lately, but last year the cemetery completed a five-story, $16 million crypt mausoleum for 2,500, replete with skylights and waterfalls.""All of this is recent,"" said Herbert B. Klapper, president of Cedar Park Cemetery, a 300-acre site in Paramus, N.J., that offers burials in mausoleums where crypt space is priced the way urban real estate often is, by neighborhood and floor. (From the ground or ""prayer"" level, crypt prices ascend to the ""heart"" level and then to ""eye"" and are reduced again for the harder-to-reach berths at a tier called ""touch."")Yet the most grandiose niche in Paramus is humble compared with the granite extravaganza erected at Daytona Memorial Park to house the mortal remains of L. Gale Lemerand, a Florida philanthropist who founded a residential insulation company that he sold in 1995 for an estimated $150 million.Two $4,000 Medjool date palms shade Mr. Lemerand's red granite mausoleum, which cost $650,000 and has ample space, as the cemetery co-owner Lowell Lohman explained, to accommodate Mr. Lemerand, 71, along with his family.A granite balustrade flanks the doorway and from it one can stand and gaze across a palm-fringed lake, where two swans named Ed and Hilda glide, adding to the pastoral landscape an almost inevitable touch of Evelyn Waugh. On the far shore is Ed Peck's family tomb.""People who are going to be buried here can well afford it, so money is obviously not an issue,"" Mr. Peck said on an afternoon of blustery winds that propelled an armada of fleecy postcard clouds across the Florida sky. ""It's a very pleasant place to be. As pleasant as it could be, considering.""'"
"'06-04-17,'0','Brown has not been on the Knicks' sideline since late in the third quarter of a loss at Cleveland on Thursday. He left the arena on a gurney, looking ashen, after a bout of acid reflux. Brown has not been with the team since, and Knicks officials have given no update on his health.While Brown rested at home, the Knicks locked up a spot as one of the bottom three teams in the league. At 22-58, they are one game ahead of Portland, which is in last place, and two games behind Charlotte. They can no longer catch Atlanta, which is fourth from the bottom at 25-55.Based on the N.B.A.'s lottery system, the Knicks' first-round draft pick is now guaranteed to be no lower than sixth. That pick will be used by Chicago, which acquired it in the Eddy Curry trade in October.The Knicks are a defeat shy of the team record for losses in a season. Williams, placed in the uncomfortable position of presiding over the past three losses, said he and Brown ""really didn't talk about"" Brown's plans.""At this point, there's no use to rush him back,"" Williams said. ""He has to take care of himself.""At the Palace of Auburn Hills, where Brown's health concerns and penchant for personal drama dogged the Pistons last season, there were knowing smiles and shakes of the head. A young fan even held a sign that read, ""Where is next-town Brown?""They have seen it here before, and players and staff members seemed quietly relieved that such mysteries were no longer their burden. Publicly, however, there was only sympathy. ""You wish everybody would get healthy and be where they want to be and do their job,"" Pistons center Ben Wallace said.Uncertainty over Brown's health -- he missed 17 games because of hip and bladder problems last season -- played a major role in the divorce between Brown and the Pistons in July. Detroit officials were also annoyed by Brown's reported interest in jobs with the Knicks and the Cavaliers.Brown has alienated most of his roster and has threatened radical changes this summer. But salary-cap rules will make a shake-up difficult, leading to speculation about Brown's future. The health concerns provide a logical out for all parties, just as they did in Detroit last summer. ""Nobody knows,"" Pistons guard Lindsey Hunter said. ""It's just theories.""But Hunter seemed sure that Brown would return. He said that after hip-replacement surgery last season, Brown ordered a tall chair that allowed him to coach without sitting normally.""He is so driven by coaching, he's not going to stop,"" Hunter said.If the Knicks, who tuned out Brown, wanted to prove a point in his absence -- by playing harder without him -- they botched the opportunity badly. Since Brown left the bench against the Cavaliers, the Knicks have been outscored, 239-202, by Cleveland, Milwaukee and Detroit.The Pistons, who had already secured home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, set a franchise record for victories, with 64. The previous mark was held by the champion 1988-89 Pistons.Brown's old team embarrassed his current one. The Pistons scored the first 15 points of the game and had a 27-point lead late in the first quarter.Despite his absence, Brown is not being spared the scars to his résumé. Under the league's record-keeping rules, these losses count for Brown, who will finish the season with the worst winning percentage in Knicks history. Eddie Donovan had a .302 mark from 1961-65; Brown will finish the season between .268 and .293.And if he walks away this summer, Brown's place in the Knicks record books could be secure for a very long time.'"

The clips were meant to highlight OLN, a Comcast-owned channel with a focus on hockey, and to welcome Phil Esposito, the Hall of Fame hockey player who would soon arrive to sign autographs.Like Mr. Esposito in his heyday, what Mr. Roberts wants, Mr. Roberts gets. He told his underlings to turn on the Masters because it would draw a big crowd. Soon enough, the big screen was tuned into CBS's coverage of Phil Mickelson and Fred Couples going head-to-head. Mr. Esposito set up shop a few feet to the side in front of a smaller screen showing highlights of his days with the Boston Bruins and the New York Rangers. After 90 minutes, Mr. Esposito was gone -- but the golf broadcast rolled on.Mr. Roberts's interest in the Masters is not surprising, considering that Comcast owns the Golf Channel.

When the wrap-around is removed, you see the real front page, with news.Last week, The Daily News in New York ran full-page ads in some copies that were, in effect, the front page. On Wednesday, it ran front and back full-page ads for Mazda and on Friday for Toyota, and there was no second, or ""real,"" front page inside.The Daily News said that on Wednesday, it printed about 40,000 newspapers with the Mazda front page and distributed them free throughout New York. The words ""sponsored copy"" appeared in tiny type at the top.These copies were printed in addition to The Daily News's full run of 688,600 papers, which carried the front-page news that the death of a police officer had been linked to noxious air at the World Trade Center cleanup site. A spokesman for The Daily News declined to say how much Mazda or Toyota paid for the ads. Advertising experts suggested they cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.Newspapers have long sold their back pages to advertisers. But the front page, a paper's most valuable real estate, generally has been considered sacred.The Daily News has sold its front page before, as has its crosstown rival, The New York Post. The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones & Company, now regularly prints quarter-page ads on the front of some of its news sections.

"'06-04-17,'0','Analysts and others in the industry agree it is a promising turn for LucasArts and, in particular, Mr. Ward. But his most challenging days may be ahead. The video game industry has been in the doldrums for months; video game sales are lagging as consumers wait to buy the next generation of consoles, including the PlayStation 3.And perhaps most important, Mr. Lucas has no plans to make any more ""Star Wars"" movies. That means LucasArts will have to work that much harder to come up with ideas of its own. ""We are not the 'Star Wars' game company,"" said Micheline Chau, president of Lucasfilm. ""And Jim knows what he has to do.""While the games division makes up about 25 percent of overall revenue for Lucasfilm, Ms. Chau said, it accounts for only 10 percent of the company's operating profit. This is why one of Mr. Ward's main goals is to create original franchises.""The 'Star Wars' brand is a massive advantage, but they are going to have to market new innovation,"" said John Riccitiello, a partner at the video game investor Elevation Partners, who has known Mr. Ward for several years. ""It's early. It may take another five years for their story to develop, but it is going to be interesting.""Sitting in his office overlooking the San Francisco Bay one recent morning, Mr. Ward reflected on what he and his team had done so far. It was at a town hall meeting in August 2004, the month before he met with Mr. Lucas, that he outlined his strategy in an auditorium filled with staff members. It seemed simple: LucasArts would make high-quality games, and deliver them on time and on budget.""I learned this from George,"" said Mr. Ward. ""There are these countless meetings where he is rational, laid back. But then he sets the bar so high you begin to think, like, this guy is out of his mind.""To illustrate the point, Mr. Ward raised his right arm in the air, higher than the left. ""I said, 'Gang, this is what we are doing,' "" said Mr. Ward, slowly raising his left arm to meet the right. ""Now they've learned that if they come remotely close to this, they can do amazing things.""Before joining Lucasfilm in 1997, Mr. Ward had distinguished himself for 13 years as an aggressive advertising executive working with the likes of Apple Computer, Nike and Microsoft. While working at the advertising firm of Wieden & Kennedy, he was involved in the introduction of Windows 95 for Microsoft. He and his colleagues recommended that Microsoft use the Rolling Stone's hit ""Start Me Up"" in its now famous campaign.Later, he was Wieden's global account director for Nike and part of the team that introduced Tiger Woods as a brand. Mr. Ward was recruited to Lucasfilm in 1997 to oversee the worldwide marketing of the last three movies in the ""Star Wars"" series, as well as all of Lucasfilm's DVD library. But by November 2003, Mr. Ward wanted more responsibility. Mr. Lucas and Ms. Chau agreed to let Mr. Ward ""try out"" at LucasArts even though he had no experience making video games.""When he talked to us we were thinking maybe, maybe not,"" said Ms. Chau. ""But if he surrounded himself with people who knew the business, and he listened, this could be great."" Mr. Ward was named president at LucasArts in May 2004.Robbie Bach, president of the entertainment and devices division at Microsoft, who has known Mr. Ward since the start of Windows 95, said Mr. Ward sought advice from others on how best to revive LucasArts. ""He did listen to a lot of people, but once he made a decision, he didn't waste time getting it done,"" said Mr. Bach.Along the way, he also developed a reputation for directness that could be a little rough. Mr. Riccitiello said that Mr. Ward ""can run certain people over"" with his big voice and strong point of view.""My sense is if you took the average executive with a 50- to 80-hour workweek, they spend about 50 percent of their time just being nice,"" said Mr. Riccitiello. ""Jim doesn't deal with that. He picks up half a week right there.""In 2004, about one-quarter of nearly 400 employees at LucasArts lost their jobs, said several former employees. (Mr. Ward declined to discuss the layoffs. Currently there are 252 employees in the division.)He quickly sought to shake up the culture. ""I needed to free them up and get rid of the politics so I could institute a team,"" said Mr. Ward. ""I told them they either get on board or they don't.""He began weekly meetings to encourage department heads to talk. He said he separated the quality-control department from product development to create ""healthy tension,"" giving staff members more freedom to express their views.Mr. Ward took a different approach to video game advertising. For example, he participated last November in ""The Apprentice"" to promote not only the DVD release of ""Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith"" but the Star Wars Battlefront II game as well.And he is openly critical of Electronic Arts, a competitor, for not being able to deliver its Godfather video game to consumers on time. ""It is absolutely a sin,"" he proclaimed.Still, Mr. Ward is willing to change his opinion if an opportunity presents itself. In 1981, when he was a graduate student in Arizona, he said he spurned a classmate, Dawne Cotton, because she was late for their first French class. Three years later, he married her.Mr. Ward said he had successfully worked with creative people his entire career, and former LucasArts employees said he sought to inspire. But even Mr. Ward conceded that LucasArts developers were suspicious at first. ""You've never run a video game company before,"" he said many of them told him. As a result he knew he needed someone to help who knew how to make games. So he promoted Peter Hirschmann, 34, to be vice president of product development. ""The linchpin was to find a creative partner,"" Mr. Ward said.A former production assistant who worked with Steven Spielberg, Mr. Hirschmann was involved in developing that director's widely acclaimed Medal of Honor video games before joining LucasArts in 2002 as a producer. Mr. Ward got to know Mr. Hirschmann in early 2004, when he would pad down the hall to his office late at night to check on the progress of Star Wars: Battlefront, which Mr. Hirschmann was overseeing.Both men said late-night conversations about ""Star Wars"" turned to personal interests: World War II and Disneyland. Born in 1959, the youngest of three siblings, and brought up in Rockford, Ill., Mr. Ward said he used to watch ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" every Sunday night. (The Pirates of the Caribbean is his favorite ride at Disneyland.) Mr. Hirschmann keeps a model of the monorail from Disneyland in his office.While Mr. Ward can be forceful, Mr. Hirschmann is more relaxed. He once hired an ice cream truck to deliver gelato to the staff. ""Peter is a perfect counter to me,"" said Mr. Ward.At first Mr. Hirschmann was not interested in the job. ""I saw a lot of baggage with it,"" said Mr. Hirschmann. ""But Jim said, 'We are going to hit the reset button. We are going to reboot.' Then I thought, maybe this was doable.""Their excitement was palpable on a recent afternoon, when Mr. Ward, Mr. Hirschmann and Haden Blackman, the project leader of a forthcoming ""Star Wars"" game, reviewed all of the company's recent projects. Mr. Blackman outlined a new storyline that delved deeper into Darth Vader's history.Mr. Hirschmann later demonstrated a test game, shouting and jumping each time a storm trooper tumbled onscreen, the character barely catching his fingers on the pixel ledge. And he gleefully explained how researchers had tracked down images of San Francisco buildings from 1915 for the future Indiana Jones game.Soon it was back to work.""There's a lot of pressure,"" said Mr. Ward. ""I mean we're taking $20 million out of George's pocket,"" he said, tapping Mr. Hirschmann on the shoulder while referring to the potential cost of a video game for the next generation of consoles.Mr. Hirschmann and Mr. Blackman shot each other a knowing glance. ""We feel the pressure, all right,"" Mr. Hirschmann said, laughing.'"
"'06-04-17,'0','It also comes on the threshold of a major media campaign by a rival travel search engine, Kayak.com.""This is a very smart move for Yahoo,"" said Heather Dougherty, an analyst with Nielsen/NetRatings, an Internet measurement company. ""It's the first time any of the big search engines have tried to integrate this type of searching into their results. And FareChase finally isn't going to be off sitting on its own.""Rather, it is central to a Yahoo user's experience, or at least close to it. Last week, for instance, typing in a search for ""flights New York to San Francisco"" returned the lowest price for that flight over the next few months -- $279 for a trip from May 5 to May 9 -- and a box offering the chance to search other dates.If a user's location has been indicated in previous Yahoo searches -- on the site's Local or Maps sections, for instance -- simply typing in ""flights to San Francisco"" will produce the same result.""This is definitely a step for Yahoo, and a step for the industry,"" Jasper Malcolmson, director of Yahoo travel services, said in speaking about the integration of meta-search with general search results.The integration of FareChase highlights a series of upgrades to Yahoo's travel offering, including the introduction of a satellite map service showing hotel locations and a feature allowing users to share travel experiences.Yahoo's new functionality could significantly increase user exposure to this type of service, which has until now struggled to attract attention. Just 12 percent of Internet travel shoppers now visit such meta-search sites, according to a recent survey by Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm. But that figure is twice what it was just a year ago, despite the fact that none of these services has done much advertising at all.Roughly 4.4 million people visited such sites in March, according to Nielsen/NetRatings -- a tiny number compared with Expedia, the leading travel commerce site, which attracted 16.4 million people.But FareChase and its two biggest competitors, Kayak.com and SideStep.com, offer a significantly different experience from other travel sites. SideStep, for instance, scans the inventories of 100 airline sites, as well as that of the online travel agency Orbitz.com, and lists the best fares on a single page.Travel agencies can perform a similar service by scanning for the lowest prices from a vast database of published fares and fares they have negotiated separately with carriers.But airlines sometimes do not distribute all of their fares through that database -- or any, in the case of JetBlue -- so consumers could miss some fares they might otherwise prefer.Travel agencies argue that the meta-search sites miss fares that they list, and analysts support that assertion. But since meta-search sites typically shuttle consumers to the supplier sites directly for booking, customers can avail themselves of benefits like loyalty programs and other perks that are not always available on travel agency sites.In terms of revenue, travel search sites have much ground to make up to challenge the general travel sites. SideStep and Kayak are privately held, and Yahoo does not break out revenue figures for its FareChase division, but analysts said these sites earned only a fraction of what the big travel agencies did, because they handle far fewer bookings and have fewer sources of revenue.FareChase often does not even charge suppliers for delivering customers to them. Rather, it lets airlines like JetBlue and United, among others, list their fares free. It does, however, charge companies for ads that appear near the listings, just as Yahoo does with its main search results.Kayak and SideStep earn undisclosed commissions for customers they refer to suppliers, but as Rob Solomon, SideStep's chief executive, said: ""The challenge for all of us is scale -- how to go from 3 to 5 million users to 7 to 10 million.""To that end, Mr. Solomon struck a deal earlier this year with Amazon to gain a prominent position in Amazon's travel section, where it offers travel books and supplies and allows people to search for fares. And Kayak's chief executive, Steven Hafner, said his company would embark next month on a multimillion-dollar television advertising campaign -- the first for a travel meta-search site.The battle poses intriguing questions about whether users will expect the big search engines to deliver extremely refined results across all categories, or use those search companies merely to find a good specialty search company.Google, for one, began offering last year some travel-specific search results where users who type in a travel route and dates are given a search box with some information already filled in, along with links to online travel agencies to find prices and book the flights. But analysts say Google's offering is far less sophisticated than Yahoo's or that of meta-search competitors. (Google declined to comment for this article.)Other analysts say they believe that Google and MSN may simply follow Yahoo's lead and buy the niche search players. ""I've always thought pretty much all of them are ripe for acquisition,"" said Ms. Dougherty, of Nielsen/NetRatings. ""If someone wants to play catch-up fast, that's the way to go.""In the meantime, don't expect Yahoo to turn away advertising dollars from other travel search engines, or to undermine their businesses in other ways. ""We have a lot of great content, so we'll always be in the free sections of those search engines, and we'll always purchase ads from them,"" said Mr. Solomon of SideStep, who until recently was a Yahoo executive. ""So we'll be very reliant on Yahoo and Google -- and vice versa -- for at least the next three to five years.""'"

"'06-04-17,'0','""My determination is to reform the public school system, but I will never oppose programs that help children,"" Mr. Booker said in a recent interview in his 21st-story law office downtown. ""And if it doesn't hurt my main goal, my principal goal of empowering public schools, I support that.""The education dispute in Newark underscores the continuing debate among poor, mostly minority residents in troubled urban school districts over the role of vouchers. Some parents and educators see them as a backhanded attempt to divert resources to private institutions. Others, especially the poor, seem more willing to accept them as an opportunity to escape dysfunctional schools.Many in Newark now seem open to giving vouchers a shot. Rosa R. Langston, 82, the director of the Office of Children in the city's Department of Health, for example, said that she had been skeptical of vouchers until her granddaughter received a scholarship to a private school, and went on to the University of Pennsylvania.""If vouchers save our children, for God's sake give it to them,"" she said. ""I'm tired of our children failing.""For Mr. Booker and his supporters, Newark is a perfect illustration of why vouchers are necessary.More than 10 years after the State Department of Education took control of the district -- New Jersey's largest, with nearly 43,000 students -- its overall performance has barely improved. State figures show that more than 70 percent of Newark's 11th graders failed the state math test in 2004, while only 30 percent failed statewide. Eighth graders in Newark did not do much better: 65 percent failed state math tests in 2004 and 56 percent failed the language test.Violence in schools here has also increased by about 35 percent since 2002, as gangs have attracted children as young as 10 and 11, according to the police. The mix of guns, gangs and hot tempers turned fatal last summer, when a school security officer was shot and killed at Weequahic High School after breaking up a fight.Despite improvements with younger students -- a majority of fourth graders passed the state's math tests in 2004, up from 36 percent in 2002 -- Newark's schools are still some of the New Jersey's worst, said Paul Tractenberg, the director of the Institute on Education Law and Policy at the Newark campus of Rutgers University.He said that the state, which oversees schools in Newark, Jersey City and Paterson, passed legislation last year that seeks to return the state-run districts to local control as early as next year.""The state would love to get these albatrosses off its neck,"" Mr. Tractenberg said. ""It doesn't have nearly as much to show for the school takeovers as I know the state expected.""Mr. Booker's proposed reforms focus on safety first. He says he plans to send dozens of additional police officers and recreation workers to schools if he is elected in the nonpartisan election on May 9. He also said he would expand after-school programs and work with local unions to teach students skilled trades.Vouchers, he said, are less vital to his plan than Mr. Rice and other opponents have suggested. He labeled their criticism ""demagoguery"" intended to distract voters from debates over policy. He said he supported only voucher programs -- such as those funded with private donations solicited through tax incentives -- that would not directly reduce the $16,506 that Newark now spends on each public school student. That is about $3,000 above the state average because of extra state aid.""A majority of children in Newark will always be educated in public schools,"" Mr. Booker said. He added that his goal as mayor would be ""for every Newark child who's attending public schools to be in a public school of excellence, period.""Mr. Booker insists that his position on vouchers has not changed, but the vision he articulates today seems to have become more limited. In a 2000 speech he told the conservative Manhattan Institute that vouchers should be used to redefine public education, even if it meant using money from taxes. ""Public education is the use of public dollars to educate our children at the schools that are best equipped to do so,"" he said, ""public schools, magnet schools, charter schools, Baptist schools, Jewish schools, or other innovations in education. That is where public dollars should go.""Now, when Mr. Booker talks about education, he either does not mention vouchers, minimizes their importance or takes pains to note that if he became mayor, it would be politically and logistically impossible for him to institute them in Newark on any large scale.The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers' Council of New Jersey, who is a supporter of vouchers, said that he found Mr. Booker's caution on the issue understandable.""I've not heard him discuss it much during the campaign, and there may be some reasons for that,"" Mr. Jackson said. ""There may have been some concerns that the mayor and now Senator Rice would use his support for that position to exploit it during the campaign.""Indeed, Mr. Booker's earlier speeches about vouchers -- along with the significant financial backing he has received from prominent conservative proponents of vouchers -- drew harsh rebukes from Mr. James in 2002. And now Mr. Rice is continuing the criticism, calling Mr. Booker the ""New Jersey point-person of the far-right Christian wing of the Republican Party.""""What happened is he talked more about it in 2002 because he thought it was something that would catch on,"" Mr. Rice said recently. ""Initially, he didn't want people to recognize that he was representing the voucher people. When he recognized that public education is a constitutional thing and we're not going to pour taxpayer money into private schools, he stopped talking about it.""Mr. Rice has struck a nerve with some. The city's teachers union endorsed him largely because of its opposition to Mr. Booker's stance.Veteran educators like Beverly Lynn, director of the Newark Preschool Council, which runs a pre-kindergarten program for 2,500 children, said they feared that vouchers promised more than they could give -- especially since there are only a handful of private schools in Newark to accept a potential rush of new students. And, with scores among elementary school students inching upward since the recent introduction of free preschool programs, some teachers have asked whether now is the time to look outside the public system for help.""Before we throw the baby out with the bath water, let's look at how we can fix what we have,"" Ms. Lynn said.And yet, those who oppose vouchers in Newark may be swimming against an increasingly strong political tide. In other black communities throughout the country -- including those in Washington, D.C., Dayton, Ohio, Houston and Oakland, Calif. -- parents and educators have started encouraging growth of voucher programs.Support may also be building in other New Jersey cities, like Camden and Trenton. A poll conducted by the Eagleton Institute of Politics, and commissioned in 2003 by a pro-voucher group that counts Mr. Booker and Mr. Jackson among its board members , concluded that a majority of New Jersey residents favored ""giving parents the option"" of vouchers. It also found that support for vouchers was strongest among minorities and people living in poorly performing school districts.Mr. Jackson said that it would be beneficial for Mr. Booker, substantively and politically, to push through the ambitious ideas he once expressed on overhauling Newark's school system.""Mr. Booker has enough ammunition to defend himself on that position,"" he said. ""In fact, I think a majority of citizens in Newark want school change by any means necessary.""'"
"'06-04-17,'0','Two sets of fine performances are on display in the New Federal Theater/Black Spectrum Theater's bill of new plays, ""Champion"" by David Paladino and ""The Stuttering Preacher"" by Levy Lee Simon, at the Abrons Arts Center of the Henry Street Settlement. Both Mr. Paladino and Mr. Simon appear in their own plays; as actors they are memorable, as playwrights they are generous to their fellow cast members and to their audiences.""Champion,"" directed by Tommy Redmond Hicks in an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink set designed by Anthony Davidson, is a twist on the old story of father and son reunited. Mr. Paladino plays an actor, a light-skinned black man who has passed for ""dark Italian"" all his life. With time off from a film shoot in Florida, he visits his black biological father in Memphis for the first time. Mr. Paladino brings a spare but powerful passion to his role, meeting his match in his dissolute and fading father, played in an engaging and textured performance by Ski (Cutty) Carr.The evening opens with Mr. Simon's brash and ribald romantic comedy ""The Stuttering Preacher,"" though here Mr. Simon leaves the plum role to Joyce Sylvester as Efay, a single woman in the early summer of her life.Quite unexpectedly, Efay finds herself the target of the affections of a popular but lascivious preacher who stutters (everywhere but from the pulpit, that is, where he is inspired by his love of God). Efay spends most of the hourlong play talking to the audience, sharing hard-won and sarcastic wisdom derived from her history of failed relationships.Ms. Sylvester's performance is so winning and charming that from the first few minutes she has the audience happy to be in the palm of her hand. Mr. Simon plays the preacher with considerable wit, style and physical presence, and when he stops stuttering as he is inspired by his love of Efay at the end of the play, it's a resolution well founded.The New Federal Theater's founder Woodie King Jr. directs ""The Stuttering Preacher"" with an easy leisure born of confidence in the play and performances.'"

"'06-04-18,'1','State secrets are involved in a lawsuit against the Central Intelligence Agency brought by the wife of a former covert operative, lawyers for the agency said yesterday in a New York federal court, arguing that national security will be at risk if the case is allowed to proceed.At a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the lawyers asked Judge Laura Taylor Swain to dismiss the case, saying that all of the vital information in the suit was highly classified and could not be disclosed to the woman or her lawyers.The agency has already combed the documents presented to date in the suit, which was filed last September. Among the information the C.I.A. classified and blacked out were the names of the woman bringing the suit and of her husband, most of the events in dispute, and the name of a second government agency that the woman is suing.In a declaration presented in court, the director of the C.I.A., Porter J. Goss, said he had determined that classified information about the woman and her husband was ""so integral"" to the suit that any further court action would require secrets to be disclosed. Publishing any details of the case would cause ""serious damage"" to national security, Mr. Goss said.Invoking an unusual state secrets privilege, lawyers for the agency asked Judge Swain to dismiss the case immediately.'"
"'06-04-18,'1','A drug already in widespread use to prevent bone thinning in women past menopause can also reduce their risk of invasive breast cancer, researchers reported yesterday.The drug is raloxifene, sold as Evista, which half a million American women take for osteoporosis. It is the second drug found to reduce the risk of breast cancer. The first was tamoxifen, whose brand name is Nolvadex, which is approved to treat breast cancer and also prevent it in women at high risk for the disease.A study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute has found that raloxifene works as well as tamoxifen in women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, and it may have fewer side effects. In those cases, each drug halves the risk.""We feel raloxifene is the winner of this trial,"" said Dr. D. Lawrence Wickerham, associate chairman of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, which coordinated the experiment.Other experts said it was not clear whether raloxifene had significant advantages over tamoxifen. Although raloxifene reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer, it does not reduce the risk of an earlier form of the disease that can become invasive if it is not caught in time. Tamoxifen cuts that risk in half.'"
"'06-04-18,'1','Adding to the complexity, the variant stretch of DNA that DeCode linked to schizophrenia does not lie in the neuregulin gene itself but just upstream of it, meaning that it presumably affects not the actual proteins produced by the gene but the way the gene is controlled.The activity of genes is governed by transcription factors, which bind to specific sequences of DNA units that lie close to the gene. Alteration of these sequences may cause the transcription factors to bind incorrectly and thus impair the proper expression of the gene.Dr. Weinberger has tested this idea by analyzing the activity of the gene in a large collection of brain samples from schizophrenic patients. The tissue was frozen shortly after the patients died.Recently he showed that one protein is produced in larger amounts in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients. But there were reasons for thinking that this protein, the first of neuregulin's six types, might be an effect of schizophrenia rather than its cause.Dr. Weinberger and Dr. Law have now studied the hippocampus, the region of the brain where initial memories of faces and places are formed and which, like the prefrontal cortex, is affected in schizophrenia. In contrast to their previous analyses, this time they concentrated on Type 4 proteins, which were discovered by DeCode two years ago and seem more likely to play a causative role.The reason is that the first component of the transcript that makes the Type 4 proteins lies at the very beginning of the neuregulin gene and closest to the upstream genetic segment that is statistically linked to schizophrenia.The researchers found that people who inherited two versions of the variant segment, one from each parent, were producing 50 percent more of neuregulin's Type 4 protein than those who inherited one or no copies.This suggests, though does not prove, that the production rate of Type 4 proteins is the mechanism through which the neuregulin gene contributes to schizophrenia.""This is a wonderful insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of this gene,"" Dr. Law said. ""The field will now move to trying to understand the biology of this change on brain and behavior."" She and her colleagues report their findings in today's issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The role of neuregulin's Type 4 proteins is unknown, but they may be involved in making neurons migrate, a property of great importance when the brain is being constructed.Dr. Law said that the variant segment linked to schizophrenia had a single DNA unit change at the center of one of the binding sites recognized by the transcription factors that control the gene. Loss of the binding site presumably upsets the regulation of the gene, causing too much of the Type 4 protein to be generated, she said.Having slightly more than usual of a single protein may seem a very subtle derangement for so devastating a disease, but subtlety is to be expected, Dr. Weinberger said. ""We know that all mental illnesses are about very subtle aspects of the wiring biases. They are about how you process complicated environmental stimuli, not about how you walk down the street.""Dr. Kari Stefansson, a neurologist and DeCode's chief executive, noted it was extremely hard to get enough schizophrenic brain samples for good statistical analysis but, given that constraint, the new finding was promising and ""remarkable if true.""'"
"'06-04-18,'1','In a study that may offer new evidence of the hazards of secondhand tobacco smoke, researchers have found that people who are exposed to it may be more likely to develop diabetes.Previous studies offered mixed results about whether smokers are more prone to the disease. But the current report, in the online edition of the journal BMJ, found that smokers and people who are regularly exposed to smoke are at risk.The researchers, led by Dr. Thomas K. Houston of the Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Alabama, reached their findings after tracking the health of more than 4,500 people over 15 years. Some were smokers, some were nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke, and some were people who had no exposure at all.Over the years, the researchers kept in touch with the volunteers by telephone and with periodic physical examinations. Among other things, the researchers were looking for signs of glucose intolerance, a condition that can lead to diabetes.About a fifth of the smokers became glucose intolerant, compared with only 12 percent of those not exposed to smoke.For nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke, the figure was about 17 percent.The researchers cited several possible explanations. Smoking, they said, can redistribute body weight in a way that makes diabetes more likely.'"
"'06-04-18,'1','THE FACTS Are most older siblings smarter than their younger brothers and sisters? The scientific literature is rife with studies claiming that I.Q. scores and other measures of intelligence dwindle among siblings with decreasing age, a phenomenon scientists have attributed to strains on parents' time and resources as their families expand.But in the past few years, a handful of studies have found that the so-called birth order effect might be more myth than reality.A study this year by scientists at Ohio State University analyzed data on siblings from 3,000 families collected over 12 years. The researchers found that whether siblings were born first or last in their family generally had no effect on intelligence scores.But children in large families, primarily those in which the mother had her first child at a young age, had lower scores than those in smaller ones. Children in large families generally had high scores only when their mothers were older.The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Personality and Social Psychology, speculated that the reasons behind this were socioeconomic. Younger mothers were more likely to have lower incomes and less education — factors that could negatively affect their children's test scores, said Aaron L. Wichman, the lead author of the study.""A mother's age is associated with many variables that can affect the child-rearing environment,"" Dr. Wichman said. ""It's not your birth order that's important; it's your family environment and your genetics that really matter.""'"
"'06-04-18,'1','Getting too little sleep may be a significant risk factor for high blood pressure.In a study of more than 4,800 men and women, people ages 32 to 59 who got five hours of sleep a night or less were about 60 percent more likely to develop hypertension than those who slept six to eight hours.The trend was the same even after controlling for depression, alcohol consumption, smoking, pulse rate, obesity, diabetes and other variables.The study appeared this month in the Online-First issue of the journal Hypertension.Researchers used data from a large epidemiological study, following subjects over a 10-year period. The participants had standardized medical examinations and answered questions about their health habits, including sleep patterns. The scientists excluded from the analysis anyone who already had hypertension, and over the next 8 to 10 years, they recorded the incidence of newly diagnosed cases of high blood pressure, or in a few cases, the cause of death.""It's been known for a long time that sleep disorders are associated with hypertension,"" said James E. Gangwisch, the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, ""but that could be for reasons besides not getting enough sleep. This is the first study that shows a relationship between short sleep duration itself and high blood pressure.""The researchers did not find the connection between sleep deprivation and hypertension in the older group of subjects, those 60 to 86. The authors suggest that this may be because people with hypertension, obesity and diabetes are less likely to survive into their later years, or because lack of sleep in younger people is more closely associated with obesity than it is in those over 60.'"

"'06-04-18,'1','The Cendant Corporation is expected to announce today that it has named Jeff Clark, the former chief operating officer of CA Inc., as the chief executive of its online travel business, which includes Orbitz and Cheaptickets.com.The appointment comes as Cendant, the real estate and travel conglomerate, is preparing to break itself up by spinning off its four major units into publicly traded companies.As part of the spinoff, Cendant is planning to change the name of the travel unit, now Travel Distribution Services, to Travelport.The hiring of Mr. Clark, a longtime technology executive who started his career at the Digital Equipment Corporation in 1985 and later became the chief financial officer of Hewlett-Packard, comes as Cendant's travel business has had a string of disappointing earnings. CA, formerly Computer Associates, is a computer management software company.Indeed, the travel unit's prospects seemed so dire that Henry R. Silverman, the architect of Cendant who had planned to become the travel unit's chief executive after the spinoff, abandoned that idea, opting to head the company's real estate unit, which includes Century 21 and Coldwell Banker.'"
"'06-04-18,'1','Analysts warn that oil prices -- which have doubled over the last two years -- are unlikely to fall soon. For one thing, the diplomatic showdown over Iran's nuclear ambitions is escalating, raising the prospect of sanctions against the nation, the second-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Analysts and traders fear that international penalties against Iran might crimp its oil industry, slow energy investments or remove sorely needed barrels from the market.Another source of concern is Nigeria, also an OPEC producer, where armed rebels have threatened more attacks against the country's energy sector -- protesting, among other things, President Olusegun Obasanjo's plan to seek a third term in next year's elections. Since the beginning of 2006, attacks by militants in the Niger Delta have forced oil companies to cut production by about 500,000 barrels a day, or more than 20 percent of the country's output.""Without question, this is the worst political-risk year we've seen for energy supplies since 1973,"" said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy in New York, referring to the year of the first Arab oil embargo.""The likelihood of escalation from the two biggest threats out there -- Iran and Nigeria -- remains very strong. In both cases, the worst is still ahead of us.""While there was no single reason for the surge in oil prices on Monday, traders have been responding to small, incremental developments from producers: with very little slack left in global oil supplies, small disruptions can have a large impact on the market.The chief concern is Iran, which holds 10 percent of the world's reserves and has been making oil markets very nervous recently. Over the weekend, Iranian officials pressed harder in statements about the country's plans to develop a nuclear project. Officials from the United States and Europe say they suspect Iran harbors plans for a military program, which the Iranians deny.While officials in the Iranian oil ministry have said they will not use oil exports as a bargaining chip, other senior officials have said they may use their country's ""oil weapon"" in a confrontation with the West.""The concern,"" Mr. Bremmer said, ""is that we'll move from simple diplomacy to coercive diplomacy against Iran, and Iran will actually play the oil card instead of just mentioning it.""Meanwhile, with most OPEC members producing at full capacity, these producing nations say they are effectively powerless to bring prices down. The group is meeting informally this weekend in Doha, Qatar, on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, which includes representatives of both producing and consuming countries, including the United States, often at the ministerial level.""On production, there is nothing we can do,"" Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, Qatar's oil minister, was quoted by Reuters as saying. ""There is no shortage in supply.""Katherine B. Spector, the head of global energy strategy at J. P. Morgan Chase in New York, said that commodity markets remained good investments for institutional investors -- something that has contributed to a huge inflow of capital into oil futures markets in recent years.""The level of investments we're seeing in energy continues to be quite striking,"" she said. ""It's a very important driving force in the market. Geopolitical noise continues to make energy seem like a good investment.""'"
"'06-04-18,'1','""There's no question he was a man who created debate, in a healthy sense,"" Mr. Stern said. ""He was sufficiently independent that he did not need other people's approval before he would take a position. Yet one of the dangers of being an independent thinker is you develop the habit of being counter-cultural.""Rabbi Hertzberg even tweaked those whose programs for fortifying Jewish identity were grounded in Israel and the Holocaust. He called the Holocaust Museum in Washington ""the national cathedral of American Jewry's Jewishness."" As someone whose European relatives had died at the Nazis' hands, he said he was trying to make the point that Jewish leaders needed to find more cerebral and spiritual programs for retaining the allegiance of believers. He urged Jews not to become reclusive and insular in the aftermath of the Holocaust but to open themselves to the pain of others.His approach to any issue was consistently liberal, said Mr. Epstein, a businessman, adding, ""But he came at it from his deep Jewishness and from his obsession with the Holocaust.""The rabbi was also an early advocate of full equality for American blacks and an ally in the civil rights movement. He was among the prominent participants in the March on Washington in 1963, during which the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech at the Lincoln Memorial.Rabbi Hertzberg was the author of a dozen books, several of which are regarded as important contributions to Jewish thought and history. In one, ""The French Enlightenment and the Jews: The Origins of Modern Anti-Semitism"" (1968), he argued that the works of Voltaire and other 18th-century philosophers betrayed a pervasive antagonism to Jews and to their existence as a distinct people.Rabbi Hertzberg was a compactly built man who spoke in stately sentences but who also flashed an impish, sometimes self-deprecating wit. He was unusual in combining a quiet life of scholarship with an outspoken advocacy of the causes he held dear, finding platforms in the American and World Jewish Congresses of the 70's and 80's. But Mr. Stern said that Rabbi Hertzberg would probably not have succeeded in the organizational world of the 21st century, which requires the leaders of these groups to show more political finesse in what they say. Rabbi Hertzberg could not resist the arena of combat. He once said, ""A rabbi should be where the real issues of society are, not where the safe platitudes are to be preached.""He followed that maxim throughout his career. In the early 1960's he promoted and participated in a Catholic-Jewish dialogue established during the papacy of John XXIII. Among other issues, he later took on the response of the Roman Catholic Church to the Nazi genocide against Europe's Jews. In 1971, Rabbi Hertzberg was chairman of the first Jewish delegation to meet formally on the issue with the Vatican. He was described as tenacious in pressing the church to acknowledge that it had remained silent while Jews were murdered and to release documents that might help clear up the accountability of Pope Pius XII.Rabbi Hertzberg was a congregational rabbi for most of his career, leading Temple Emanu-El, a Conservative synagogue in Englewood, until he became its rabbi emeritus in 1985. There, too, he could not avoid goading his flock, accusing congregants in the synagogue bulletin in 1971 of letting the synagogue become peripheral in their lives or using it as a ""personal decoration that is convenient.""Arthur Hertzberg was born on June 9, 1921, in southeastern Poland, the first of five children of an Orthodox rabbinic scholar. The family came to the United States when he was 5, living in Youngstown, Pa., and then Baltimore, where the elder Hertzberg took over a congregation.In his youth, Rabbi Hertzberg, whose ancestors were prominent rabbis within the Belz Hasidim, prepared himself for a life as an Orthodox rabbi, devoting himself to Talmudic studies. But by his teenage years he was also immersing himself in secular knowledge. At Johns Hopkins University, he majored in history and Oriental languages. By then, as he wrote in Midstream, a journal devoted to Jewish affairs, he had decided to ""locate myself"" within ""Jewish modernity.""He studied at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, the fountainhead of the Conservative movement, and was influenced by Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, who stressed that Judaism was an evolving civilization in which notions of God, too, could evolve with the expansion of human knowledge. The seminary ordained him in 1943. It was a time when the Jews of Europe were being slaughtered, and he harbored thoughts of returning to Poland to study. But as he wrote in his Midstream essay, ""I could never go home again"" because ""home would at best be a semi-habitable ruin."" So he devoted himself intellectually to the creation of a Jewish state.He started out as a Hillel chapter director at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, then took pulpits in Philadelphia and Nashville. In the early 1950's he had a two-year tour as a United States Air Force chaplain based in Britain, where he met his wife, the former Phyllis Cannon, a British bibliographer. After his return to the United States, he was appointed to Temple Emanu-El in 1956. But he continued to pursue his scholarship, completing a doctorate in history at Columbia University and teaching there and eventually at Rutgers, Princeton, Dartmouth and Hebrew University in Jerusalem. After 1991, he was Bronfman Visiting Professor of the Humanities at New York University.His scholarly reputation was built on a steady outpouring of books and articles for Commentary, Commonweal, The National Catholic Reporter, The New York Times and other publications. As editor of a 1959 collection of essays titled ""The Zionist Idea: A Historical Analysis and Reader,"" he contributed a much-admired introduction on the intellectual history of the Zionist movement. Yet despite his strong Zionist views, he stood out as a habitual and often idiosyncratic critic of Israeli policies. In an op-ed article in The Times in 2003, he urged the Bush administration to deduct the cost of maintaining Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza from the annual pot of American aid.All his writing seemed to strike a bold, gadfly note, and he was more than willing to take on his fellow rabbis. In 1996, in Midstream, he lamented that Jews were praying in synagogues in such sparse numbers that the congregational rabbi was becoming more an ""institutional executive"" and ""entertainer"" than a spiritual leader.In addition to his wife, Rabbi Hertzberg is survived by two daughters, Dr. Linda Beth and Susan Riva; two brothers, Rabbi Isaiah and Rabbi Joshua; and a sister, Eve Rosenfeld.Correction: April 20, 2006, Thursday An obituary yesterday and in late editions on Tuesday about Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a religion scholar and civil rights advocate, gave an erroneous identification in some copies for the town where he and his family first lived when they moved to the United States from Poland. It was Youngstown, Ohio, not Youngstown, Pa.'"
"'06-04-18,'1','Kurt Koester, a 24-year-old graduate student in engineering at Berkeley, is eager to take part. Yet engineering alone, he observes, can often be outsourced to lower-cost economies overseas.Mr. Koester's special interest is biomedical engineering, which combines engineering and biology. He is also taking the services science course at the Haas School of Business at Berkeley. He figures it will someday help him manage teams of technologists, spot innovations and new markets, and blend products and services.""I love engineering, but I want a much broader and more diverse background,"" he said. ""Hopefully, that will be my competitive advantage.""His personal strategy, according to economists, is the best way to prepare for an increasingly global labor market.""This is how you address the global challenge,"" said Jerry Sheehan, a senior economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. ""You have to move up to do more complex, higher-value work.""Representatives from several technology companies, including I.B.M., Accenture, Electronic Data Systems and Hewlett-Packard, and a few universities and government agencies met in Washington in December to discuss how to raise interest in services science.A further step is a conference on education in services science being held at the National Academy of Sciences today.Whether services science will ever become a full-fledged academic discipline with departments of its own is uncertain. So far it mainly consists of graduate-level courses and research by professors, though Berkeley will begin a certificate program in the field this fall for graduate students in the schools of engineering, business and information and management systems.The melding of fields in services science is sure to be tricky. Scientists and engineers tend to regard what is taught in business schools as a mushy combination of anecdotes, success stories and platitudes, wrapped in jargon. Put a few success stories together, and they become a ""best practice.""Yet a similar skepticism greeted computing decades ago. When some advocates started promoting the idea of ""computer science,"" traditionalists sneered that any course of study that had to add the term ""science"" to its name was not a science.Eventually, computing won over the skeptics. And today, computer science departments are academic fixtures.I.B.M. was an early champion of computer science, and it is now a leading corporate proponent of services science, sponsoring workshops, awarding research grants and helping develop course materials.I.B.M. itself is a striking example of the shift toward services over the last decade or two. Once known as a computer maker, the company now gets half its revenue from services. And increasingly, I.B.M. is moving into sophisticated technology services, by working with corporate customers to automate and streamline business tasks like purchasing, human relations and customer relations programs.In recent years, I.B.M. has shopped the global labor market, expanding significantly in India, especially for software programming work. But it has also reoriented and retrained its existing work force to support the swing to services.The researchers in its laboratories were dubious at first. ""The response here was there is no science in services,"" recalled Paul M. Horn, the senior vice president in charge of the I.B.M. labs. ""But as people got into it, they got excited by working on the fascinating problems in services.""Baruch Schieber, 48, is one of the converts. After joining I.B.M. in 1987, Mr. Schieber did basic research and published articles in scholarly journals, mostly on algorithms that optimize computing calculations. Yet the math techniques used to make work flow efficiently through a computer -- a complex system -- can be applied to other complex systems in business. That is what Mr. Schieber did, first in manufacturing and later in services.One recent assignment had Mr. Schieber studying drivers and dispatchers at Boston Coach, a limousine service that operates in 10 cities. His job was to create a computerized optimization system to make sure the company's vehicles and drivers in Boston and New York, where the company handles more than 1,000 rides a day, were used as much as possible.The system gathered real-time data on car locations, reservations, travel times, traffic patterns, airport conditions and flight times, and it generated recommendations to the dispatchers about which car and driver to send for each ride. As a result, the amount of time the cars had passengers rose 20 percent, and revenue increased 10 percent.Today, Mr. Schieber is working on a project for the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, a team with representatives from five federal agencies including the Forest Service. His task is to use computer models to help determine where to station limited manpower and equipment around the country to minimize the destruction from forest fires. His models use data on terrain, vegetation, wind, rainfall, public records of fires, and other variables.Across the spectrum of services, Mr. Schieber sees plenty of opportunity to apply his skills. ""There's just so much room for optimization,"" he observed.The service sector, to be sure, is huge and diverse. There are lots of service workers in low-wage jobs, from fast-food servers to janitors. Services science will have scant effect on them. Their incomes are limited by their lack of marketable skills, not by global competition. Those kinds of local service jobs are not migrating offshore.An accumulation of technological advances is behind the growing interest in services science. High-speed Internet access, low-cost computing, wireless networks, electronic sensors and ever-smarter software are the tools for building a ""globalized services economy,"" said Anatole Gershman, director of research at Accenture Technology Labs. ""That's what is new here.""The current wave of technology, according to Mr. Gershman, is the digital equivalent of national railways and electric motors in the 19th century. They paved the way for new companies, among them national retailers like Sears, and new kinds of industrial organization, like assembly-line mass production.He points to projects his company is doing as examples of services made possible by new technology. In transportation, networked sensors and analytic software are being used to diagnose the condition of engines. The goal is to make the mechanical upkeep of vehicles like jets and municipal buses more intelligent, shifting from regimented maintenance schedules to as-needed maintenance, which can reduce repair and maintenance costs by 50 percent, he said.In health care, Mr. Gershman said, it should be possible to use tiny implants to monitor a person's biological functions, whisk reports wirelessly to personalized databases, automatically analyze the results and send alerts and updates to patients and doctors.""Just what will be done with this technology we don't know,"" Mr. Gershman said. ""But the significant thing is that we now have the underpinnings for the construction of new services.""Traditional service functions like marketing and customer service are also being transformed by information technology. The rapid growth of the Web and e-commerce has brought an explosion in the quantity of customer and market data, and a computerized means for tracking consumer behavior.Today, marketing researchers routinely use analytic and modeling software tools to test hypotheses against statistics from customer databases, polling, economics and sociological studies. ""It's really made the field much more scientific,"" said Mary Jo Bitner, academic director of the Center for Services Leadership at Arizona State University.Even in manufacturing, the competitive edge of many American companies lies in the intangible realm of service work. Look at the iPod. Apple Computer farms out the manufacturing of its popular music player to subcontractors in Asia. But Apple designed the iPod and wrote the software for easily finding, storing and playing music. It built the iPod brand, and guided its advertising and marketing. In short, Apple keeps for itself the most intellectually challenging, creative work, which adds the most value and pays the highest wages.The high-end work, experts say, typically taps several disciplines and requires conceptual thinking and pattern recognition. Such work cannot be easily reduced to a simple step-by-step recipe. ""Those are the jobs that are very hard to automate or ship to India,"" said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Services science is an attempt to give university students a broader set of skills and adopt a broader research agenda for the economy of the future. ""We in academia have to find ways to contribute research to improving our economic performance in services and to help students succeed in this knowledge-based services economy,"" said Henry Chesbrough, who is teaching the services science course at Berkeley.'"

"'06-04-18,'1','If the announcement sent a strong signal to restless party members that real change was coming, it also set off a round of what White House officials routinely deride as an inside-Washington game of personnel speculation.In this case, the speculation extends to the senior levels of Mr. Bush's cabinet, including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who in the face of mounting criticism has received a ringing vote of confidence from Mr. Bush, and Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, who has not.As chief of staff, Mr. Bolten would conceivably have a say in their fates, as well as those of the 13 other cabinet secretaries and the 30 or so members of the president's leadership team.Republican allies said they welcomed the signal from the administration, not only the sentiment Mr. Bolten conveyed but also the way the White House shared it publicly. Mr. McClellan described the meeting, without prompting, speaking with reporters Monday.""It's a smart, savvy move,"" said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a Republican lobbyist. ""It's the symbolism and it's the message and it's the reality: they're serious about a revitalized, re-energized team.""Mr. Duberstein was part of another White House reorganization, in 1987, when President Ronald Reagan tapped him and several other seasoned Washington hands to revitalize his White House, then listing under low approval ratings, looming scandal and Congressional unrest. He went on to become chief of staff to Reagan.The Bush White House has had unusually low staff turnover and notably few public squabbles. One of the few messy personnel moves of his presidency, the firing of Paul H. O'Neill as Treasury secretary in 2002, was handled by Vice President Dick Cheney. But Mr. Bush is no stranger to the hatchet; he played a pivotal role in the forced resignation of his father's chief of staff John H. Sununu late in his father's term.But Mr. Sununu's successor, Samuel K. Skinner, moved deliberately -- afraid to be too abrupt as Mr. Bush prepared for his re-election campaign -- and complaints continued into the last year of his term that the White House was beset by internal rivalries, squabbling and poor communications.Mr. Bolten has indicated he is not about to make the same mistake, though he is unlikely to be able to move with complete impunity. Unlike President Bill Clinton, whose inner circle changed continually given his political needs of the moment, Mr. Bush is known for loyalty and has kept his circle nearly intact since his days as Texas governor.Still, Mr. Bolten's message Monday seemed certain to heighten the anxiety within the White House among some staff members worried about their own positions. Mr. McClellan said the president had given Mr. Bolten wide latitude to pursue staff changes as he saw fit.Asked if Mr. Bolten had leeway to make decisions affecting cabinet posts, Mr. McClellan said, ""The president has given him the full authority to do what he needs to do, and what he believes is in the best interest of this White House and this president.""Beyond changes to the composition and structure of the West Wing staff, Mr. Bolten, along with other members of Mr. Bush's inner circle including Vice President Dick Cheney, will have to decide what to do about the two senior cabinet members most in the line of public fire right now, Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Snow.Mr. Snow has expressed an interest in stepping aside this year, and Republicans with ties to the White House have been floating the names of possible successors. Mr. Bush has strongly defended Mr. Rumsfeld against criticism from some former generals and a few Congressional Republicans that he mismanaged the war in Iraq.Mr. McClellan said there were obvious places for Mr. Bolten to get started, like suggesting a successor to himself at the Office of Management and Budget.Several Republican officials close to the White House, who were granted anonymity to speak freely about personnel decisions, said Mr. Bolten would also quickly turn his attention to two areas that are widely considered to be pressing problems: the White House's frayed relationships with Republicans on Capitol Hill and the troubles it has had communicating its message to the public and the news media.Mr. Bolten has some other jobs to fill, including that of domestic policy adviser, which was vacated last month by Claude A. Allen after he was arrested on charges of stealing from retailers. Filling that position could give him an opportunity to rethink the White House's domestic and economic policy operations, which have had trouble pushing Mr. Bush's agenda forward and have been criticized by some Congressional Republicans as not putting forward enough new initiatives.Mr. McClellan was asked during two news briefings on Monday whether he would resign.""Are you trying to tempt me here?"" he replied jokingly at his afternoon briefing.After saying that his general policy of avoiding comment on what he terms ""personnel matters"" held for himself, as well, Mr. McClellan added, ""Two years in this position is a long time; I'm very mindful of that.""'"
"'06-04-18,'1','Citigroup's first-quarter results were driven largely by its investment banking group, which earned more than $1.9 billion on the strong performances of its fixed-income and equities groups, including those focused on investments overseas.Revenue surged 15 percent from the same quarter last year, and Citigroup's investment bankers made more money than any other Wall Street firm except Goldman Sachs, according to Bloomberg News.Citigroup's international consumer banking profit rose 21 percent, to $1.1 billion, from the year-earlier period, with strong results in Asia. Still, profit from consumer banking operations in the United States declined 4 percent, to $2 billion.Rising interest rates and a flat yield curve continued to put pressure on profit margins. At the same time, Citigroup chose to concentrate on areas like home mortgages rather than on the riskier credit card loans.Meanwhile, Citigroup's credit card customers paid their debts faster. Sallie L. Krawcheck, chief financial officer, said earnings were down 10 percent for all consumer lending in the United States.Mr. Prince said, ""We saw good customer interaction, lower credit costs, but we also saw our revenue growth was not where we wanted it to be.""He continued, ""Last year, we made changes in people and strategy. While I don't expect a quick turn, I do expect better results.""The results were announced just a few weeks after the Federal Reserve lifted a yearlong order discouraging Citigroup from pursuing major acquisitions and a day before Mr. Prince is to take over as chairman from Sanford I. Weill after the company's annual shareholder meeting.Mr. Prince said he remained committed to expanding Citigroup's presence in faster-growing markets overseas while focusing on increasing sales in the United States.""I've said very publicly that 2006 is our year to perform without any excuses,"" he said. ""I feel we did that in the first quarter, and I'm confident we're going to do that over the balance of the year.""Citigroup also said its board had approved a $10 billion share repurchase program for this year; it laid out plans last year to buy back about $15 billion of company stock.'"
"'06-04-18,'1','Saks Fifth Avenue, the luxury goods retailer, is expected to announce today that it will open a store in Shanghai, becoming one of the first American department stores to venture into the world's most populous country, according to people briefed on the matter.The move, if successful, could open the door for rival department stores, which have struggled for growth in the United States, to finally leap into the Chinese market.For Saks, which has failed to keep pace with its more profitable rival, Neiman Marcus, entry into China could provide a much-needed avenue for growth.Saks executives will gather at the retailer's flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York today to announce plans for the Chinese store.China has proved a fertile market for American luxury retailers like Hermès and Cartier, and Shanghai has become a particularly hot market for foreign retailers.Saks has already shown interest in far-flung international markets. Saks stores have recently opened in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Dubai. Both stores are licensed to use the Saks name but are not operated by the company.""All the luxury guys are running to China,"" said Gilbert W. Harrison, the chairman of Financo, a New York investment bank that specializes in retail. ""It's natural for one of the department stores to want to open there, too.""'"
"'06-04-18,'1','But when natural gas was selling for $2 per million cubic feet, and oil was $10 a barrel, using gasified coal, which costs about $4 per million cubic feet, made no sense. Now, with gas prices still above $7 per million cubic feet and oil prices at more than $70 a barrel, it does.According to the American Chemistry Council, the industry's cost for feedstocks hit $40.12 billion last year, up from $34 billion in 2004, $25.1 billion in 2003 -- and triple the $12.8 billion in 1999.Feedstocks amounted to nearly 19 percent of the cost of the $213.75 billion in products the chemical industry shipped last year -- up from 17.5 percent in 2004, 14.5 percent in 2003 and just 8 percent in 1999. For companies that make feedstock-intensive products like ethylene or propylene, two building blocks for plastics, the percentage could be double that.""It may take three or four years to fine-tune the processes and build the plants, but coal could possibly be the primary feedstock down the road,"" said William R. Young, an analyst at Credit Suisse.In fact, it already is in countries like South Africa, where coal is plentiful and oil and gas are scarce. Sasol, based in Johannesburg, has been making and selling coal-based feedstocks for many years.Several Chinese companies already use coal to make vinyl chloride monomer, a precursor to the polyvinyl chloride used to make construction products like pipes. Andrew Wood, the editor of Chemical Week magazine, said that numerous American and European companies would open plants in China to make other chemicals from coal, too. ""No one's made real commitments yet, but it is clear that this is very much the beginning of a wave,"" he said.Manufacturers are preparing themselves for an onslaught of orders for coal gasification equipment. General Electric, which bought ChevronTexaco's coal gasification business in July 2004, expects to get most of its profits from projects that use coal gas for generating electricity. ""But in the near term, turning coal to chemicals offers the most significant opportunities,"" said Edward C. Lowe, general manager of gasification for GE Energy.Mr. Lowe said G.E. had licensed its gasification technology to five large Chinese companies, and was getting ""considerable interest"" from American companies. G.E.'s involvement is in itself drumming up interest, said Owen A. Kean of the American Chemistry Council.""When G.E. embraces a technology, it provides yet another form of credibility,"" he said.Coal is certainly available. According to the World Energy Council, the United States had recoverable reserves in 2004 of about 254.4 billion tons; China has 114.5 billion tons. ""Coal and renewables like corn are probably the only natural resources we won't run out of,"" said Edward S. Glatzer of Nexant, a chemical industry consulting firm.Miners, meanwhile, are taking a fresh look at old mines. International Coal owns a large stock of low-grade coal reserves in Indiana and Illinois that had not previously been economical to mine. Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the company's chairman, said he was exploring whether to gasify those reserves for use as feedstock.""We've got a whole bunch of pipelines within 30 miles of the mines in each direction, and as long as natural gas stays above $6.50, the math works very well,"" he said.Even in the unlikely event that natural gas prices drop, gas shortages may still work in coal's favor. Agrium, the Canadian fertilizer company, has a huge ammonia plant in Kenai, Alaska, that is operating at half capacity because of gas shortages. Agrium will decide by this summer whether to invest close to $1 billion to install equipment to convert coal to feedstock and fuel, as well as capturing carbon dioxide that it could sell.""There's enough coal nearby to operate this complex for more than 50 years,"" said Lisa Parker, a specialist in government and community relations for Agrium US.But coal is catching on even in areas where gas is plentiful. Eastman Chemical, once a part of Eastman Kodak, already derives 20 percent of its raw materials from coal in the United States, and in September, Gregory O. Nelson, its executive vice president, told analysts, ""We're asking ourselves, 'What if we could bring 30 percent to 40 percent of our raw material base from coal?' ""David N. Weidman, chief executive of Celanese, a chemical company based in Dallas, is asking similar questions. ""Coal is easy to access, it's in politically stable regions, and the technologies exist to eradicate environmental impacts,"" he said. ""It's been an underappreciated feedstock for much too long.""It is more expensive to turn coal into a substitute for oil than for gas, but companies that use oil as feedstock are taking a closer look at coal.""Crude oil still seems the most practical raw material for us, but we certainly are staying abreast of any technologies that could change the economics of our products,"" said Barry A. Phillips of Bayer Material Science, which makes plastics.BASF, the world's largest chemical company, has committed $121 million over the next two years to research alternative raw materials, ""and yes, coal is on the list,"" said John Maurer, a BASF spokesman.For now, though, most chemical companies are piggybacking experiments with coal on their strategies for penetrating emerging markets.Dow Chemical and Shenhua, China's largest state-run coal producer, are discussing whether to jointly build a plant that would use coal to make ethylene and polypropylene. Celanese is building plants in Nanjing, just north of Shanghai, that will use coal-derived feedstocks to make acetic acid, used in such products as cigarette filters. James S. Alder Jr., vice president for operations, does not rule out the idea of eventually converting the company's American plants to coal, too.""Coal is a viable long-term feedstock,"" he said. ""That's true for China, for the U.S., for any place with an abundant coal supply.""Correction: April 29, 2006, Saturday An article in Business Day on April 18 about chemical companies that use coal as a substitute for oil or natural gas misstated the pricing for gas and gasified coal. Natural gas, which used to sell for $2 per million B.T.U.'s, now sells for more than $7 per million B.T.U.'s, not per million cubic feet. Gasified coal costs about $4 per million B.T.U.'s, not $4 per million cubic feet.'"

"'06-04-19,'1','The sexual abuse scandal in Boston broke into public view in 2002 and shook this heavily Catholic city, resulting in a drop in financial support for the archdiocese and fierce debate inside and outside the church over how the scandal was being handled. While similar problems were playing out in other dioceses around the country, the scandal stood out in Boston, with two high-profile convictions of priests — one of whom was later murdered in prison — and the eventual resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law, who had been criticized as lax in handling the abuse accusations.Settlements with plaintiffs claiming sexual abuse, though criticized by many as too low, helped drain more resources from the archdiocese.In a first round of settlements in 2003, 554 plaintiffs received awards of $80,000 to $300,000, with an average settlement of $159,000. A second group of plaintiffs reached a settlement with the archdiocese last month, agreeing to allow an arbitrator to determine the monetary award they will receive.The archdiocese said then that 88 plaintiffs who were offered the settlement would be awarded $5,000 to $200,000 in arbitration hearings.Early this month, a report by an independent panel found that efforts to change the archdiocese after the abuse crisis had been hampered by its diminished resources.""The greatest challenge presented to the archdiocese in 2005-6 is the slow pace of organizational and cultural change in the face of diminished human and financial resources,"" the report said. ""This challenge is ignored at the peril of the church.""The board reviewed 71 cases of alleged misconduct by priests and deacons from July 2003 to December 2005. It found probable cause of sexual abuse in 38 cases. Sixteen of those priests have been defrocked or barred from ministry, 13 are awaiting further processing and 9 cases are still pending. Of the remaining cases, 23 clergy members were cleared, and 9 were barred from ministry for other reasons, including mental illness and substance abuse. One case remained unresolved.The cardinal said today that a key to instilling confidence in parishioners was the release of information about the costs of the sexual abuse crisis and sources of the money used to pay for it. While archdiocesan officials have repeatedly said that parish collections and other donations would not be used to pay for legal settlements to abuse victims, some parishioners have remained skeptical.They have also distrusted assurances that the money generated by the church's recent controversial shuttering of 62 of the archdiocese's 357 parishes would not finance the abuse settlements.The information released today sought to put those rumors to rest. It reported that through June 30, 2005, $150.8 million was spent on the abuse crisis, including $127.4 million in legal settlements, $8.8 million in counseling and prevention programs, and $8.3 million in legal and professional costs related to the settlements.Of that money, $68.8 million came from selling the archbishop's mansion and other administrative buildings, with the rest coming from insurance and the sale of other properties not related to the parish closings.""There's been so much talk about the finances of the archdiocese and so much mystery and questions raised,"" Cardinal O'Malley said, adding, ""We're not trying to keep secrets from people, we're not trying to deceive them. We are trying to use the limited resources that we have for the mission of the church and we want people to be on board about that.""'"
"'06-04-19,'1','EVERETT, Wash., April 19 — China's president, Hu Jintao, started his second day in the United States at an enormous Boeing plant here where he endorsed increased trade and Boeing airplanes to a cheering crowd of 5,000 employees.Speaking at the Boeing Everett Plant — larger in volume than the Pentagon — Mr. Hu said, ""I hope that our economic trade and relations will prosper further and fly higher, just like a Boeing plane. ""Prior to his presentation, Mr. Hu toured the plant in a golf cart. He later met privately with Boeing executives and visited a mock-up of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, a next-generation airplane. But behind the high spirits and kind words were multibillion-dollar business deals.Boeing is the largest supplier of planes to China and wants to sell even more. Currently, more than 60 percent of the commercial plans operating in China — a total of 542 — are Boeing planes. In the two decades ahead, Boeing forecasts that China is expected to buy up to 2,600 planes, valued at $213 billion, as the country expands its air transportation systems.""Boeing has a very close partnership with China,"" President Hu said though a translator.

"'06-04-19,'1','While that may have helped many low-income customers save money, there could be a heavy health cost. McDonald's has marketed the Dollar Menu to teenagers, young adults and minorities who are already plagued with an especially high incidence of obesity and related health problems like diabetes.Many nutritionists say fast food is one of the worst things in the American diet, because of its calories, trans fats, lack of fiber and added sugars and processed carbohydrates. ""If you're looking at the Dollar Menu in terms of how much food you get it really appears as a good bargain,"" said Connie Schneider, a nutrition adviser for Fresno County in California. ""But if you're looking at it as how many nutrients are you getting for a dollar, it's the least economical.""McDonald's says it seeks to provide options for its customers, at both low and higher prices. ""We're proud of the choices we offer customers,"" said Bill Lamar, chief marketing officer for McDonald's United States business. ""You can come in and order Apple Dippers, salads with low-fat dressing, yogurt, or you can order an Egg McMuffin, which is a very nutritious sandwich. People can make the decisions about how to eat for themselves.""True, McDonald's has persuaded millions of mostly female customers to buy its healthier, higher-priced salads. ""We are improving our relevance with products like salads, which cast a favorable glow over our brand and the rest of our menu,"" boasted McDonald's chief financial officer, Matthew Paul, in a conference call with analysts in July 2004.In 2005, salad sales totaled 173 million units, about even with salad sales in 2004. Per month, however, sales have slipped from 14.7 million salads in 2003 to 9.6 million in 2006.And every day, McDonald's moves a lot more double cheeseburgers than either salads or the new Premium Chicken Sandwich — most versions of the sandwich have more calories and more sodium than a double cheeseburger. Richard Adams, a former McDonald's executive who now works as a consultant for franchisees, says the average store sells roughly 50 salads a day and 50 to 60 Premium Chicken Sandwiches, compared with 300 to 400 double cheeseburgers from the Dollar Menu.Reacting to the success of McDonald's Dollar Menu, Wendy's and Burger King both started promoting their versions of low-priced deals. Wendy's, which in 1989 was the first burger chain to experiment with menu items for $1, lowered prices on its Super Value Menu to 99 cents in January. And in February, Burger King started offering its own version of a dollar menu, including the Whopper Jr. and cheeseburgers.The Dollar Menu became a permanent part of McDonald's menu in the United States in late 2002. It offers items like a double cheeseburger, the fried McChicken sandwich, French fries, a hot fudge sundae, pies, a side salad, a yogurt parfait and a 16-ounce soda.Since McDonald's started advertising the Dollar Menu nationally, the double cheeseburger has become the chain's most ordered item. Even priced at $1, double cheeseburgers bring in more revenue than salads or the chicken sandwiches, which cost $3.19 to $4.29.McDonald's executives say the Dollar Menu has driven enormous additional traffic into the stores, primarily young men and women aged 18 to 24. ""The Dollar Menu appeals to lower-income, ethnic consumers,"" said Steve Levigne, vice president for United States business research at McDonald's. ""It's people who don't always have $6 in their pocket.""Just three and a half years ago, McDonald's was struggling mightily. Its stock had tumbled 56 percent in 10 months and the company had reported its first quarterly loss. Sales at existing stores in the United States, by far McDonald's biggest market, were not growing and in many instances were declining.Stung by obesity lawsuits and criticism from books like ""Fast Food Nation,"" the company's brand seemed passé and the high-calorie, high-fat, high-sodium cuisine appeared poised for a long decline.But that did not happen. Today, McDonald's business, both in the United States and globally, is growing; the chain gets some one million more American visitors a day than it did just a year ago.Other factors have contributed to this turnaround, which has been surprisingly speedy for such a large company. McDonald's has been opening fewer stores and sprucing up restaurants and improving service. The chain has placed a greater emphasis on breakfast and introduced a successful global marketing campaign with the ""I'm Lovin' It"" tagline. But McDonald's says one of the most important factors in its newfound success has been its low-priced staples.Dollar Menu ads aimed at young blacks and Hispanics often focus on how much hearty food can be bought for just $1, a message many young consumers are eager to hear.""The problem here is that you're dealing with a segment where you have these huge obesity issues and you're making eating Big Macs and double cheeseburgers look like it's fun and exciting,"" said Jerome Williams, a professor of advertising at the University of Texas, Austin, and one author of an Institute of Medicine report last year on the marketing of junk food to children and teenagers.David Ludwig, director of the obesity program at Children's Hospital in Boston, calls marketing fast food to blacks and Hispanics a ""recipe for disaster.""""Fast-food consumption has been shown to increase calorie intake, promote weight gain and elevate risk for diabetes,"" Dr. Ludwig said. ""Because African Americans and Hispanics are inherently at higher risk for obesity and diabetes, fast food will only fuel the problem.""According to an analysis of government data published this month in The Journal of the American Medical Association, 45 percent of non-Hispanic blacks and 36.8 percent of Mexican-Americans aged 20 and over are obese, as opposed to 30.6 percent of non-Hispanic white adults.Blacks and Hispanics are also more likely to suffer from obesity-related diseases. Blacks are 1.8 times as likely to have Type 2 diabetes than whites, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Mexican-Americans, the largest Hispanic subgroup, are 1.7 times as likely. And 42.9 percent of blacks have cardiovascular disease, while 33.3 percent of whites do, according to the American Heart Association.Obesity and related diseases also carry a high financial cost. Problems created by obesity increase the nation's health care costs by $93 billion a year, mostly from Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, according to a 2003 study done by RTI International in North Carolina.McDonald's agrees that Hispanics and blacks are core customers. The company gets 17 to 18 percent of its sales from each group. In the overall United States population, blacks represent 12 percent and Hispanics 14 percent, according to the Census Bureau.Mr. Lamar, McDonald's marketing executive, points out that the company has worked with Dr. Rovenia Brock, a popular African-American fitness guru, to promote physical activity. Mr. Lamar also says the company market its salads to black women, who have the highest rates of obesity of any segment of the population.Last May, the company ran a commercial featuring four African-American women talking about the McDonald's fruit and walnut salad and getting their ""fruit buzz."" The ad ran on BET, the Black Family Network and ""Girlfriends"" on UPN.But Professor Williams at the University of Texas says the majority of McDonald's ads aimed at blacks feature Quarter Pounders With Cheese, Big Macs and French fries. McDonald's says that it advertises all its products equally across all markets and that over the last three years the most advertised menu items were Premium Chicken Sandwiches, McGriddles breakfast sandwiches and premium salads.Marketing experts say McDonald's, which has long been proud of its inclusive advertising, is among the most shrewd when it comes to reaching blacks and Hispanics. The company's ads aimed at black consumers tend to be stylish and use hip contemporary language and music.""Look who's trying to add some flavor to her life,"" says a young black man wearing an earring, silver chain and baseball hat that match his sweatsuit as he eyes a black woman dressed in a business suit ordering a Spicy Chicken Sandwich. The ad, which ran on BET, the TV One cable network and ""The Bernie Mac Show"" on Fox, was created by Burrell Communications, the Chicago-based agency that does most of McDonald's advertising for black consumers.Rick Mariquen, director of Hispanic consumer marketing at McDonald's, says ads aimed at Hispanics in both Spanish and English often feature groups of friends or families gathering at McDonald's. ""They come to the stores in large groups, often families, and see the experience as a social one,"" said Mr. Mariquen, whose parents are from Guatemala.In the last four years, McDonald's has increased its advertising spending on Spanish-language television by 60 percent, to $57.4 million a year, according to Nielsen Monitor-Plus.But to people like Ms. Schneider, the nutrition adviser in Fresno County, all those ads only make her job more challenging. Through a federally funded program run with the University of California, Davis, she offers free nutrition education classes in heavily Latino communities. Many of the classes, she says, are attended by people who are overweight with a host of health problems.Ms. Schneider says she does not think it is realistic to instruct people to stop going to fast-food restaurants. But she says the program encourages students to go less frequently or make different menu choices.""Restaurant advertising looks very fun and social,"" Ms. Schneider said. ""But fast-food ads don't show you what happens when you're in your 40's and your cholesterol's high and your heart has to work really hard to pump.""'"
"'06-04-19,'1','Paul Shapiro, the director of advanced Holocaust studies at the museum here, said the documents would offer insights into the day-to-day evils of the Nazi era, ""the routine process of deportation, concentration camps, slave labor, killing."" And perhaps, he said, the paperwork will offer clues to ""a few new perpetrators"" who, if no longer subject to earthly justice, can at least stand before the bar of history.Mr. Shapiro said museum officials hoped to make the documents ""truly accessible,"" available for computer viewing at Holocaust research centers around the world. Since 1998 about half of the documents have been copied in digital form. About 20 percent of the documents were copied on microfilm before 1998, Mr. Shapiro said.Until now, Holocaust survivors and their relatives have been able to seek information from the Bad Arolsen archives, but they have sometimes waited years, said Sara J. Bloomfield, director of the Holocaust museum in Washington.The files are controlled by the International Tracing Service, which operates as an arm of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The service, which since the end of World War II has used the files to help people learn about relatives who were victims of German atrocities, has been swamped. Its budget, provided by Germany, has been cut as part of national austerity measures.The tracing service is run by a commission representing the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Israel, Poland and Luxembourg. Germany has long insisted that for the archives to be opened, all 11 countries would have to vote to amend the 1955 treaty that set up the tracing service as it restored German sovereignty.In Washington on Tuesday, Ms. Zypries said Germany would move at a meeting in Luxembourg next month to change the treaty to open the archives. She said her government would try to persuade Italy, which had also resisted opening the documents, to go along.The State Department's special envoy for Holocaust issues, Edward O'Donnell, said the United States favored opening all records on the Holocaust.""We're very encouraged by the statement of the justice minister,"" he said. ""We look forward to continuing the negotiating process.""In its resistance to making the archives widely accessible, the German government has cited the personal nature of much of the information in the files. The papers may disclose, for instance, who was treated for lice at which camp, what medical experiments were conducted on particular prisoners, and which inmates were tempted to collaborate with their captors.But Ms. Bloomfield said such considerations were invalid. ""The history is the history,"" she said, adding that Holocaust documents released earlier also contained personal information. ""Let it be open.""While historians and researchers will find the material invaluable, the real beneficiaries are the relatives of Holocaust survivors. ""Many are dying every day,"" Mr. Berger said. ""They deserve to know what happened to their fathers or their uncles.""The Holocaust museum officials praised the German justice minister as a warm and open person and credited her with helping to sway her government. They had kind words also for Wolfgang Ischinger, until recently the German ambassador to the United States, and his successor, Klaus Scharioth.Only two months ago, when the United States and Germany were still at odds, Ms. Bloomfield called Germany's stand ""a scandal and a big scar"" on the country's image, and Mr. Shapiro said Germany's position was ""a form of Holocaust denial.""But on Tuesday, Mr. Berger said Germany's leaders had embraced their country's responsibility for the evils of the Nazi era. As for the harsh words of February, he said, ""That's history.""'"
"'06-04-19,'1','And so it has been ever since, with even the federal government chiming in last week, setting rebuilding conditions so loose that local officials greeted them with unrestrained delight.At the almost daily mayoral debates here, as the campaign winds down to Saturday's primary, the question of whether eastern New Orleans is unsafe hardly comes up. When it does — ""How morally responsible is it to tell people to rebuild there?"" the candidates were asked Monday night — they move on quickly and talk about the failed levees.""The answer is, we have to demand accountability from the federal government,"" said the Rev. Tom Watson, one of the candidates.One leading candidate, Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu, said, ""Those of us that have been down here know that nothing less than Category 5 hurricane protection will do, first of all,"" after the moderator, Chris Matthews, shifted the question slightly.With the big questions ducked, the intervening campaign language — about the need to be ""working together,"" for instance, or the importance of tourism, or ""the best food you've ever had in your life"" awaiting the New Orleans visitor, all highlights of the Monday debate — has a disconnected air about it.Campaign events are strangely out of kilter. On the steps of the ruined criminal courts building Monday, facing an empty landscape of crumbling commercial buildings, the former District Attorney Harry Connick Sr. mumbled an endorsement of one of the leading candidates, Ron Forman. Hardly anybody was there to hear Mr. Connick's encomium, even if it had been audible.Some nonpoliticians are dismayed by this prevailing silence. Years before Hurricane Katrina, they warned about the dangers facing the newer parts of the city, those built on reclaimed swamp like eastern New Orleans. Old maps showed that the city's late-19th-century footprint corresponded almost exactly to unflooded New Orleans, 2005.""If you're planning on having more hurricanes, the most sensible thing is to return to the areas that existed before the pumps drained the back swamps,"" said the geographer Peirce Lewis, whose mid-1970's history of the landscape of New Orleans, written as New Orleans East was being built, sounded alarm bells about the new development.""It was a real estate speculation by people who were unwise or dishonest,"" said Dr. Lewis, now an emeritus professor at Pennsylvania State University.The view then ""was that technology had taken care of the problems of hurricanes and there was nothing to worry about, which pleased everybody,"" he said.""Anybody who looked at the wind path of Camille knew perfectly well what was going to happen,"" Dr. Lewis continued, referring to the 1969 monster storm that missed New Orleans by 50 miles but still inundated southeast Louisiana and devastated the Mississippi Gulf Coast.New Orleans East marched on, however — a prized sanctuary for the nascent black middle class that was fleeing the decaying inner city and was unwelcome either in the white-flight suburb of Metairie or in much of Uptown New Orleans. A generation later, the area was under water, and the black doctors, dentists and lawyers who populated it are gone, and angry.Saying they should not go back where they were is the new third rail of New Orleans politics.""The political candidates have decided it's too sensitive to take on directly,"" said Pres Kabacoff, a developer here who has specialized in renovating old buildings and neighborhoods.The veteran of a fraught effort in the late 1990's to redevelop one of the city's worst housing projects, Mr. Kabacoff zeroed in on a crucial point: What might be important in the long term confronts, in the short term, the city's immemorial racial realities.To simply declare some neighborhoods off-limits would be ""racially loaded,"" Mr. Kabacoff said. ""These candidates are going to have to be very sensitive to the racial implications. It's going to take some real understanding. This town could get broken apart very easily, racially.""Consciously or otherwise, the major contenders in Saturday's election are all steering well clear of that risk.'"
"'06-04-19,'1','He added, ""I am dealing with the operating system produced by Microsoft every day.""The business focus follows a tradition set by Deng Xiaoping on his first visit to the United States in 1979, when he communed with American capitalists just as China began to shed its Maoist legacy and open up to the outside world.Beijing has since treated close ties to American business leaders as vital to its overall relations with Washington, because the two countries are much more integrated economically than politically, diplomatically or culturally.Still, direct dealings with corporate leaders is a novelty for Mr. Hu, who, unlike his predecessors, almost never meets foreign business leaders in Beijing and remains aloof from the commercial dealings of the Chinese government.Mr. Hu, 63, has made multiple trips to Europe, Russia, East Asian neighbors, and even Latin American and African countries, since assuming China's top political posts, head of the Communist Party and president, in 2002 and 2003. At least initially he put less emphasis on forging tighter links to the United States, which he has criticized in domestic speeches as a potential threat to China's ruling Communist Party.But Chinese officials and analysts say he has since made clear that internal priorities — maintaining rapid economic growth and tamping down a wave of unrest over corruption, governmental land grabs, and severe pollution — are better served if Beijing cultivates cordial relations with Washington.He is also eager to head off a backlash in Congress over China's record $203 billion trade surplus with the United States last year. Two proposals in Congress call for imposing sanctions against China unless it allows its tightly controlled currency to rise against the dollar, reducing the cost advantage of Chinese exports in the American market.At home, Mr. Hu also hopes a high-profile mission to the United States, with the pomp of a 21-gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House and an elaborate reception at the home of Mr. Gates, the world's richest man, will shore up his standing both within the Communist Party hierarchy and in the eyes of the general public in China.""His relative status in the leadership is strengthened when he focuses on foreign policy, where he is clearly the No. 1,"" said David Bachman, a China specialist at the University of Washington.Mr. Hu arrived amid intensive security on Tuesday morning, with access to his downtown luxury hotel blocked on all sides.Several hundred local residents lined the streets along his hotel. They were divided between members of Chinese patriotic groups, many carrying paired Chinese and American flags, and anti-Beijing protesters, especially members of the Falun Gong movement, which is outlawed in China, and supporters of Taiwanese independence. Falun Gong supporters used sound trucks to blast messages into Mr. Hu's hotel, accusing China's internal security forces of torture, organ harvesting and other atrocities. They also appeared near Microsoft's headquarters.Mr. Hu's visit, brokered in part by Gary Locke, a Chinese-American lawyer and Washington's former governor, came as a boon for Seattle's leading corporations. Even local farmers got a plug for their produce, as beef with Walla Walla onions, Granny Smith apples and local asparagus were on the menu for the gathering at Mr. Gates's home.Boeing, which will show Mr. Hu a production line and allow him to operate a flight simulator, earlier signed an agreement to sell 80 of its single-aisle 737 aircraft to China in a purchase valued at $4.6 billion.Microsoft, which gave Mr. Hu a tour of a hyper-technological home of the future, was reaping the rewards of a new regulation requiring all Chinese-made computers to preinstall a copyrighted operating system to prevent piracy.In the past two weeks, Microsoft has signed four agreements with Chinese computer manufacturers to preinstall Windows. The largest came Monday, when the Lenovo Group said it would spend $1.2 billion over the next year on Windows.Craig J. Mundie, Microsoft's chief technical officer, said he hoped the visit by Mr. Hu signaled that China now views protection of intellectual property, including software, as vital to its own development.""I think Chinese leaders have now made that conceptual leap — that they need this if they are going to make the transition to a knowledge economy from a manufacturing economy,"" Mr. Mundie said. ""It is also true that Microsoft will be a natural beneficiary.""'"
"'06-04-19,'1','But does pressure to support Israel distort American decisions? That's a matter of judgment. Prominent Israeli leaders and their American supporters pressed very hard for the invasion of Iraq; but the United States would probably be in Iraq today even if there had been no Israel lobby. Is Israel, in Mearsheimer/Walt's words, ""a liability in the war on terror and the broader effort to deal with rogue states?"" I think it is; but that too is an issue for legitimate debate.The essay and the issues it raises for American foreign policy have been prominently dissected and discussed overseas. In America, however, it's been another story: virtual silence in the mainstream media. Why? There are several plausible explanations. One is that a relatively obscure academic paper is of little concern to general-interest readers. Another is that claims about disproportionate Jewish public influence are hardly original — and debate over them inevitably attracts interest from the political extremes. And then there is the view that Washington is anyway awash in ""lobbies"" of this sort, pressuring policymakers and distorting their choices.Each of these considerations might reasonably account for the mainstream press's initial indifference to the Mearsheimer-Walt essay. But they don't convincingly explain the continued silence even after the article aroused stormy debate in the academy, within the Jewish community, among the opinion magazines and Web sites, and in the rest of the world. I think there is another element in play: fear. Fear of being thought to legitimize talk of a ""Jewish conspiracy""; fear of being thought anti-Israel; and thus, in the end, fear of licensing the expression of anti-Semitism.The end result — a failure to consider a major issue in public policy — is a great pity. So what, you may ask, if Europeans debate this subject with such enthusiasm? Isn't Europe a hotbed of anti-Zionists (read anti-Semites) who will always relish the chance to attack Israel and her American friend? But it was David Aaronovitch, a Times of London columnist who, in the course of criticizing Mearsheimer and Walt, nonetheless conceded that ""I sympathize with their desire for redress, since there has been a cock-eyed failure in the U.S. to understand the plight of the Palestinians.""And it was the German writer Christoph Bertram, a longstanding friend of America in a country where every public figure takes extraordinary care to tread carefully in such matters, who wrote in Die Zeit that ""it is rare to find scholars with the desire and the courage to break taboos.""How are we to explain the fact that it is in Israel itself that the uncomfortable issues raised by Professors Mearsheimer and Walt have been most thoroughly aired? It was an Israeli columnist in the liberal daily Haaretz who described the American foreign policy advisers Richard Perle and Douglas Feith as ""walking a fine line between their loyalty to American governments ...and Israeli interests."" It was Israel's impeccably conservative Jerusalem Post that described Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, as ""devoutly pro-Israel."" Are we to accuse Israelis, too, of ""anti-Zionism""?The damage that is done by America's fear of anti-Semitism when discussing Israel is threefold. It is bad for Jews: anti-Semitism is real enough (I know something about it, growing up Jewish in 1950's Britain), but for just that reason it should not be confused with political criticisms of Israel or its American supporters. It is bad for Israel: by guaranteeing it unconditional support, Americans encourage Israel to act heedless of consequences. The Israeli journalist Tom Segev described the Mearsheimer-Walt essay as ""arrogant"" but also acknowledged ruefully: ""They are right. Had the United States saved Israel from itself, life today would be better ...the Israel Lobby in the United States harms Israel's true interests.""BUT above all, self-censorship is bad for the United States itself. Americans are denying themselves participation in a fast-moving international conversation. Daniel Levy (a former Israeli peace negotiator) wrote in Haaretz that the Mearsheimer-Walt essay should be a wake-up call, a reminder of the damage the Israel lobby is doing to both nations. But I would go further. I think this essay, by two ""realist"" political scientists with no interest whatsoever in the Palestinians, is a straw in the wind.Looking back, we shall see the Iraq war and its catastrophic consequences as not the beginning of a new democratic age in the Middle East but rather as the end of an era that began in the wake of the 1967 war, a period during which American alignment with Israel was shaped by two imperatives: cold-war strategic calculations and a new-found domestic sensitivity to the memory of the Holocaust and the debt owed to its victims and survivors.For the terms of strategic debate are shifting. East Asia grows daily in importance. Meanwhile our clumsy failure to re-cast the Middle East — and its enduring implications for our standing there — has come into sharp focus. American influence in that part of the world now rests almost exclusively on our power to make war: which means in the end that it is no influence at all. Above all, perhaps, the Holocaust is passing beyond living memory. In the eyes of a watching world, the fact that an Israeli soldier's great-grandmother died in Treblinka will not excuse his own misbehavior.Thus it will not be self-evident to future generations of Americans why the imperial might and international reputation of the United States are so closely aligned with one small, controversial Mediterranean client state. It is already not at all self-evident to Europeans, Latin Americans, Africans or Asians. Why, they ask, has America chosen to lose touch with the rest of the international community on this issue? Americans may not like the implications of this question. But it is pressing. It bears directly on our international standing and influence; and it has nothing to do with anti-Semitism. We cannot ignore it.'"
"'06-04-19,'1','Last year, I.B.M. said it was laying off more than 10,000 workers, mainly in Europe, to address increased global competition in the services business. Yesterday, David Grossman of Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco said that the fundamentals in services ""have bottomed and should continue to get better.""Industry analysts closely monitor I.B.M.'s services business because it accounts for more than half of revenue and most employees.I.B.M. reported quarterly earnings of $1.08 a share, 27 percent higher than the period a year earlier. That was 3 cents above the consensus of Wall Street analysts, as compiled by Thomson First Call.Quarterly revenue was $20.7 billion, in line with estimates, but off 10 percent from last year, before I.B.M. completed the sale of its personal computer lines to Lenovo of China.Excluding the PC business, revenue in the quarter was flat. Without the effect of fluctuations in the dollar, which has been stronger in the last year, revenue was 4 percent higher in the 2006 quarter than it was last year.I.B.M. is aggressively pursuing growth in emerging markets like India and China. First-quarter revenue rose 61 percent in India and 15 percent in China. I.B.M. employs 45,000 people in the two nations, out of a worldwide payroll of nearly 330,000.""We'll continue to shift investments to these high-growth countries,"" the chief financial officer, Mark Loughridge, said in a conference call, adding that the group also included Russia and Brazil.Indeed, I.B.M. said it would hold its yearly conference for financial analysts, which is traditionally in New York, in Bangalore, India, in June.The company's quarterly results were helped by a 47 percent increase in sales from the microelectronics division. I.B.M. is producing the microprocessors that power the next generation of machines from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo.The revenue from mainframe computers, while up 22 percent in terms of processing power delivered, slipped 6 percent. Mr. Loughridge attributed this to a temporary pricing strategy to entice customers to use the big computers for running software programs, like the Linux operating system and Java, that typically run on smaller machines.""That is a structural force that is likely to continue,"" an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, A. M. Sacconaghi, said.With its vast range of businesses, I.B.M. often reports a mixed collection of results. ""How they got there is a little different than I had thought,"" Mr. Sacconaghi said, ""with services being somewhat more encouraging and the mainframe being somewhat disappointing. But all in all, it was a pretty typical I.B.M. quarter, stronger profits than revenues, and pretty solid.""'"

"'06-04-19,'1','In March 1964 Robert S. McNamara opened a speech about South Vietnam with the statement that ""the independence of a nation and the freedom of its people are being threatened by Communist aggression and terrorism."" Many words later, Mr. McNamara, the secretary of defense, concluded, in rosy terms that sound eerily similar to contemporary dispatches, that ""when the day comes that we can safely withdraw, we expect to leave an independent and stable South Vietnam, rich with resources and bright with prospects for contributing to the peace and prosperity of Southeast Asia and of the world.""Much happened in the bloody decade that followed, but one of the most memorable chapters of the Vietnam War has also long been one of the least revisited: the antiwar movement inside the military. Called the G.I. Movement, this resistance manifested itself in countless ways: in organized protests, in desertions and in the coffeehouses that sprang up across the country near military bases. In the early 1970's the documentary filmmaker David Zeiger worked in one such coffeehouse, the Oleo Strut in Killeen, Tex., not far from Fort Hood. Named for a helicopter shock absorber, the Oleo Strut was where off-duty soldiers went to decompress and to check out the latest issue of one of the many underground military publications, like The Fatigue Press, that gave powerful voice to their dissent.In his smart, timely documentary about the G.I. Movement, ""Sir! No Sir!,"" Mr. Zeiger takes a look at how the movement changed and occasionally even rocked the military from the ground troops on up. On one level the film serves as a corrective to the rah-rah rhetoric about Vietnam in such schlock entertainments as the 1980's ""Rambo"" franchise, in which Sylvester Stallone's veteran turned mercenary ritualistically wipes away the spit lobbed at him by a phantom antiwar protester. The image of the spat-upon Vietnam veteran, explains Jerry Lembcke, himself a Vietnam veteran and one of the persuasive talking heads who appears in the new film, helped maintain the important fiction that opposition to the war came strictly from outside the military.During the 1960's and 70's American newspapers routinely reported a significantly different story than the one later cooked up by Hollywood and other revisionists. This film shows that as antiwar sentiment gathered strength in American streets, a parallel movement seized the armed forces. By September 1971 dissent among the ranks had become a front-page subject in this newspaper, with a headline that read ""Army Is Shaken by Crisis in Morale and Discipline."" Soldiers were fed up and up in arms, and not always against the Vietcong. Desertions were on the rise, as were fraggings, named for the fragmentation grenades lobbed at superiors by their own men. By 1974 the Defense Department would record more than half a million incidents of desertion since the mid-60's.Mr. Zeiger fits so much into his 84-minute film that it's hard not to wish he had spent more time on what happens when American soldiers break ranks with their leaders. John Kerry's bid for president proved that long after fighting in Vietnam came to an end, a war of words continues to rage. It's a war of words that finds Jane Fonda -- who performed for tens of thousands of troops in an antiwar revue, ""Free the Army,"" and makes a passionate appearance in the film -- still labeled Hanoi Jane. ""Remembered as a war that was lost because of betrayal at home,"" Mr. Lembcke has written, ""Vietnam becomes a modern-day Alamo that must be avenged, a pretext for more war and generations of more veterans."" In ""Sir! No Sir!,"" Mr. Zeiger remembers that war and the veterans whose struggles against it are too often forgotten.Written and directed by David Zeiger; directors of photography, May Rigler and Mr. Zeiger; edited by Ms. Rigler and Lindsay Mofford; music by Buddy Judge; produced by Mr. Zeiger, Evangeline Griego and Aaron Zarrow; narrated by Troy Garity; released by Balcony Releasing.

"'06-04-19,'1','Declines had been expected as companies and auditors became accustomed to the new rules and as fewer controls needed to be tested.The report was issued days before an advisory committee on small business is expected to recommend to the Securities and Exchange Commission that smaller companies be exempted from complying with the law on the ground that it is too costly.The committee's preliminary recommendation calls for companies with market capitalizations below $128 million to be exempted entirely, while those with market value up to $787 million would have to report on their own controls but would not be required to involve auditors.The costs of complying with Section 404 remain far greater than was expected when the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed in 2002. Older laws had required companies to have good internal controls, but it appears that many did not.In addition, there have been complaints that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board adopted a standard that required too much work to check too many controls, including some that were unlikely to be important. There were reports of thousands of controls being tested at some companies.The survey by CRA covered the same companies that had been chosen at random for the first year's study. They covered only companies audited by the four big accounting firms.For smaller companies, the study said that the average number of material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in internal controls fell to 1.3 incidents per company in the second year from 5.3 in the first year. The number of controls tested by auditors fell to 206 in the second year from 262 in the first.For larger firms, the average number of weaknesses and deficiencies fell to 2.5 incidents per company from 5, as the number of controls tested fell to 540 from 669.The study said the total cost for companies included their internal costs and the cost of the Section 404 audits. It said that while these auditing fees fell for both large and small businesses, the decline for large companies was completely offset by rising charges for their regular audits. For smaller companies, total auditing costs fell as the cost of the regular audits rose less than the decline in Section 404 costs.'"
"'06-04-19,'1','Former New York City teachers who have been out of the system for at least two years will also be eligible for the subsidies. Teachers already living in the New York area who switch to the city schools could simply use the money to pay their existing rent or mortgage.""What you are starting to see is a very different compensation structure for teachers in the City of New York, different from the traditional lockstep thinking on teacher pay and seniority,"" Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said in an interview yesterday, ""based on system need and performance.""Mr. Klein also cited a provision in the latest city teachers' contract, approved this fall, that created a new master teacher position with additional pay of $10,000 a year. ""The differentials will have power to attract people,"" Mr. Klein said, ""to give our city a competitive advantage.""Depending on experience, teachers eligible for the subsidies will earn base salaries of $45,600 to $69,840 a year. The city projects that the housing assistance will cost about $15,000 per teacher, including federal payroll taxes and other ancillary charges, for a total of perhaps $1.5 million a year until the shortage abates.While that is a relatively minor sum in the context of the system's annual budget of more than $15 billion, officials said the program had a value that far outstripped its cost.""It has a major impact as far as really sending a signal to those teachers that we want you and will be really creative in attracting you here,"" said Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott, the mayor's top education aide at City Hall.Elizabeth Arons, the city Education Department's chief executive for human resources, said that for September the city expected that it would need to hire 800 math teachers, 450 science teachers and 1,300 special education teachers simply to fill routine vacancies created by retirements, sabbaticals, leaves of absence and attrition.Most of these jobs will be staffed by participants in alternative teaching certification programs like Teach for America and the New York City Teaching Fellows, she said. Even once these positions are filled, there will be about 100 to 200 positions in each specialty filled by a teacher not specifically certified for that subject.It is common for science teachers to be assigned to math classes and vice versa and in some schools English and history teachers also must teach math and science.Ms. Arons said the housing incentives were aimed at experienced teachers from other districts and those who had left the profession largely because there were so few teachers coming out of graduate schools certified to teach science or math. ""There are no math and science teachers coming out of universities,"" she said. ""This is not anything that's new, it's across the nation. It's been talked about for the last 20 years. We are all faced with the alternative structures.""The shortage of math and science teachers has recently moved to the forefront of the nation's education agenda. According to a recent report by the National Academy of Sciences, nearly 60 percent of eighth graders in American schools -- double the international average -- are taught math by teachers who neither majored in math nor studied it to pass a certification exam.President Bush this year proposed to retrain teachers to increase the ranks of advanced placement and international baccalaureate teachers in math and science by 70,000 over four years.The shortage of qualified math and science and special education teachers has also become a much more urgent problem for states and school districts because of the federal No Child Left Behind law, which sanctions schools that do not make sufficient annual progress in certain subjects.The law currently requires annual testing in English and math and will mandate testing in science beginning in the 2007-8 school year. In addition, states and districts must show progress among various subgroups of students, among them children receiving special education services.Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers, said that her union had growing concerns that the state might force the transfer of veteran teachers into struggling schools if steps were not taken to create incentives and get volunteers.""We solved the problem in probably one of the most innovative ways we could,"" she said. ""Affordable housing is really important to recruit and retain teachers.""The deal marked a rare example of cooperation between the union and the Bloomberg administration.While other school districts across the country have sought to make housing more affordable for teachers, experts said New York City's program appeared to be one of the most concerted and generous efforts specifically aimed at teachers in subject areas with the worst shortages. Chicago, for instance, offers up to $7,500 in housing aid to all teachers but requires newly hired teachers to live in the city.In California, a state program offers teachers substantial help with the down payment on a home that depending on the local market can amount to $20,000 or more. But the money must be repaid.And some local districts, like Santa Clara and San Jose, in extremely hot housing markets have their own programs that include monthly stipends or subsidized rentals in district-owned housing developments. When programs are combined, some teachers can get as much as $100,000 in home-buying help, said Ken Giebel, a spokesman for the California Housing Finance Agency. But much of the money has to be repaid.In New York City, teachers who get the housing assistance would likely also be eligible for four years of up to $3,400 in annual tuition reimbursement from New York State under a separate incentive plan promoted by the Pataki administration several years ago to recruit educators into high-needs schools.And they would potentially be eligible to use their housing assistance from the city in conjunction with an existing federal program called Teacher Next Door that offers teachers the chance to buy homes in depressed urban neighborhoods at half price.Andrew M. Cuomo, who as federal housing secretary helped create the Teacher Next Door program, praised New York City's new effort. ""It's smart,"" said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is running for State Attorney General. ""The cities tend to pay lower salaries than the surrounding suburbs and the cost of housing is higher, so it's double trouble.""Teachers receiving housing assistance will have to sign a contract requiring them to repay part of the money if they fail to serve three years in a struggling school.'"

"'06-04-20,'1','Cardinal O'Malley, who will distribute pamphlets about the finances in every parish, said he hoped that as a result of the report, released a few weeks before the archdiocese's annual fund-raising drive begins, ""people will understand what our finances are and how we're using it, and hopefully will want to help us continue the mission of the church.""The cardinal said that a key to instilling confidence in parishioners was releasing information about the costs of the sexual abuse crisis and the sources of the money that paid for it.Although archdiocesan officials have repeatedly said parish collections and other donations would not be used to pay for legal settlements to abuse victims, some parishioners have remained skeptical. They have also distrusted assurances that the money generated by the closing of 62 of the 357 parishes in the archdiocese would not finance the abuse settlements.The new information sought to end those concerns. The reports showed that through June 30, 2005, $150.8 million was spent on the abuse crisis, including $127.4 million in legal settlements, $8.8 million in counseling and prevention programs and $8.3 million in legal and professional costs related to the settlements.Of that money, $68.8 million came from selling the archbishop's residence and other administrative buildings, with the rest from insurance and selling other properties not related to the closed parishes.""There's been so much talk about the finances of the archdiocese and so much mystery and questions raised,"" Cardinal O'Malley said. ""We're not trying to keep secrets from people. We're not trying to deceive them. We are trying to use the limited resources that we have for the mission of the church, and we want people to be on board about that.""The cardinal and lay leaders of committees he appointed to examine the finances and propose improvements characterized the situation as serious, but not irrevocable. They said the cause of the problems was not the abuse settlements per se, but declining donations as a result of the abuse crisis, pension funds hurt by declining stock prices, skyrocketing health care costs for priests and the expensive maintenance for old parish buildings.""We're in a difficult financial position,"" said John H. McCarthy, an accountant who led the committee that prepared the reports, which covered from July 1, 2003, to June 30, 2005. The biggest liability was $135 million in unfunded pensions for clergymen, Mr. McCarthy said.An investment banker who led the organization and management review committee, James F. O'Connor, said that the management of the archdiocese required a ""substantial overhaul,"" and that he hoped that the church could achieve a balanced budget in 18 months.Charles Zech, an economics professor at Villanova University, said that might be optimistic.""Eighteen months seems to me like a relatively short time,"" Dr. Zech said. ""An operating deficit of $46 million, even for a diocese as large as Boston, that is high.""Francis J. Butler, president of Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities, said he believed that the deficit was the largest of any diocese.""If they restore the trust of the rank-and-file donor in their policies,"" Mr. Butler said, ""I would be optimistic that they would be able to address this.""Mr. Butler and Dr. Zech said they were impressed by the extent of the disclosure, which included not just the central operations, but also 43 affiliated entities like schools and Catholic Charities.""They've gone way beyond the standards,"" Mr. Butler said.Dorothy Kennedy, president of the Boston chapter of Voice of the Faithful, a lay reform group, said, ""It's a step in the right direction.""Ms. Kennedy added that the release would probably inspire her to resume donations to the annual appeal.""I think we will have full fiscal recovery if we have full financial transparency on all levels,"" she said. ""I think it will encourage people to come back. There are many people not donating because they don't feel secure where money is going.""Jon Rogers of St. Francis Cabrini in Scituate, which closed in October 2004 but has been occupied by parishioners hoping to persuade the archdiocese to reopen the church, said he was very pleased with the disclosure.""Americans are funny,"" Mr. Rogers said. ""You ask them to help, and they will basically crawl over each other to make sure the situation is rectified.""'"
"'06-04-20,'1','Dr. Gerberding said the disease had spread quickly because of the dense concentration of students in affected cities and because the vaccine is not perfect. It has about an 80 percent efficacy rate for people who have been inoculated with one dose, and a rate of about 90 percent for people who have received the recommended two doses.""We have absolutely no information to suggest that there's a problem with the vaccine,"" Dr. Gerberding said. ""What's going on here is basically a number of people who haven't received both doses, coupled together with people who have received the vaccine but are susceptible anyway, living in crowded conditions like college dormitories or mixing up with other students at spring break or during holidays, and setting up a cascade of transmission that's going to take a while to curtail.""In recent years there have been 250 to 300 mumps cases annually in the United States, said Dr. Jane Seward, acting deputy director of the division of viral diseases for the C.D.C. The last significant outbreak was in 1989, when Kansas had 269 cases. This time, the states with the most cases, after Iowa, are Kansas, Illinois and Nebraska.Chase Hardin, 19, a freshman at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, had a stiff neck in early March, but did not think anything of it until ""it looked like someone had stuck an orange in the side of my neck.""""I had no clue that I could get that,"" said Mr. Hardin, who was vaccinated as a child. ""I thought it was something of the past.""Christine F. Cassa, a University of Iowa freshman, got the mumps a few weeks ago, along with four or five other students on her dormitory floor. She said she had heard of about a dozen cases in her 900-student dormitory, Burge Hall.""The dorms are so like close quarters,"" Ms. Cassa said. ""You're around so many people, and you don't think about what you're touching and what you're drinking, and people share a lot of stuff.""Since December, the university's student health service has confirmed 55 cases, said Lisa James, associate director of student health.Because of the wide range of symptoms, from achy limbs to swelling, officials did not initially consider mumps a possibility.""Now we're testing a lot of students, even with mild symptoms, especially if the students say they've been in contact with someone who's had it,"" Ms. James said. Students who have symptoms are told to isolate themselves for at least five days.Officials say it could be worse. ""We're seeing really very low attack rates,"" Dr. Seward said. ""If we didn't have the high two-dose coverage, we'd be seeing thousands of cases, or tens of thousands of cases.""Dr. Gerberding said the main step the C.D.C. was taking was to provide an additional 50,000 doses of the mumps vaccine, half donated by Merck.The Iowa Public Health Department is trying to contain the outbreak through public education and inoculation.""It's hard to say what comes next,"" said Dr. Quinlisk, the state epidemiologist. ""When mumps was around, it tended to be a winter and spring disease, and it tended to go down in the summer. We'll be waiting to see if Mother Nature gives us a little help.""'"
"'06-04-20,'1','Herbert E. Berman, the president of the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, the state agency that manages the 147-acre island, said the backup system was removed for repairs last fall on orders of the State Department of Labor, the agency responsible for inspecting the tramway. He also said the system was not required, but inspectors said that if it was going to be used, it had to work.But he said the surge that knocked out the main system could have disabled the secondary power system as well. He said it was expected to be returned and re-installed in a matter of weeks.So rescuers assembled a cagelike rescue basket that had been stored on Roosevelt Island, but never used in a real emergency, to carry the passengers to safety from the tram car over the East River. But the rescuers improvised a way to carry the people in the second tram car to safety after realizing that otherwise they would have to wait until the first evacuation had been completed.Mr. Berman said that in the tramway's 30 years, emergency procedures had never been needed before. ""That's a pretty good record,"" he said. The rescue, he added, ""was a tedious process, but it was a safe process.""The mayor said the rescue effort had ""worked perfectly.""""It was a classic operation of this city,"" he told reporters at Fire Department headquarters in Brooklyn, ""and it showed that all of these people worked together. We did what we had to do; we got everybody down safely.""Mr. Bloomberg said it took so long to evacuate the two tram cars ""because our emergency response people did exactly what they should do.""""They didn't rush to do anything just to satisfy a beat-the-clock kind of exercise,"" he said.And, as other officials noted yesterday, when the tram stopped about 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Fire Department workers who arrived at the scene believed that the power would go back on quickly. For that reason, department personnel who had been trained to rescue passengers from the tram were sent to other duties.In fact, the power did come on again, at about 8:15. The two tram cars moved about 75 feet, only to grind to a halt again.That was when the Police Department's emergency service unit took over. Officers from that unit had been working on a rescue plan just in case, and at 8:30 they decided to go ahead with it.They started with the tram car on the Roosevelt Island side because it was carrying more passengers. After the basket was assembled at the end of the tramway, about a dozen officers and firefighters -- who by then had returned to the scene -- climbed in to test how much it could hold.By then it was almost 11 p.m., and the passengers had been stuck for six hours. Four officers, all trained as emergency medical technicians, rode out in the cage.David Keller, a passenger in the stalled tram car, said that he and another man, along with the tram operator, had removed two windows using tools that the operator found in a toolbox in the car.""At this point, people were a little nervous,"" Mr. Keller said. ""Now you've got the windows out, and here comes this little basket. Nobody was hysterical or crying. Some of the kids were nervous with their moms, but they were told everything would be all right.""Two of the officers climbed into the tram car, introduced themselves and won the crowd's confidence, Mr. Keller said. They soon worked out an exit route, which involved stepping onto one of the tram's bench seats, onto the window frame, across a gap some passengers said was as wide as four feet and then into the rescue cage.""That was scary,"" said Jeanne Raichle, another passenger. ""I was really glad to get on that basket.""The weather helped, Mr. Keller said. There was little wind. ""I've been on there in storms and bounced around,"" he said. ""But the water was even pretty placid for the East River.""Mr. Keller said that for the first couple of hours, the tram car had been quiet and the passengers had kept to themselves. Then, he said, ""we all started joking."" Mr. Keller said that Dax Maier, 12, who was heading to Roosevelt Island for a tennis lesson, told jokes to the crowd, and his mother cautioned him by cellphone to tell clean jokes.The cage made five trips before the tram car was empty, the first at 11:15 p.m. on Tuesday, the last at 2:55 a.m. yesterday.Some passengers said communication between the tram operators -- one in each car -- and officials on the ground left them uncertain about what was being done to bring the tramway back to life. Mr. Keller said the tram operator's walkie-talkie failed around 10 p.m. ""He had a cellphone, and he told the tower, 'This is my number,' "" Mr. Keller recalled.Officials debated whether to use a fire ladder or a crane to reach the tram that was stuck near First Avenue. They settled on hiring a crane, which took a couple of hours to reach the scene.And in a display of ingenuity, the crane was used to hoist an elevatorlike device called a ""man-bucket,"" which was lashed to the tram car while police officers on the ground held guide ropes to keep the bucket from swaying. It was 4:07 a.m. when the last passenger was finally plucked from the tram.'"

The Bloomberg administration and the Port Authority are also offering to lease 1.2 million square feet in the buildings.Until now, the rebuilding process has been held up by political differences among the government agencies, questions about the financial prospects of the Freedom Tower and uncertainty over Mr. Silverstein's ability to finish the $7 billion project when only $2.9 billion in insurance money was available.""We're now in agreement on how to move forward,"" said Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the authority and Mr. Pataki's chief economic development official. ""I'm hopeful that the Silverstein Properties will accept the recent offer, so we can start building the Freedom Tower as quickly as possible.""Senator Charles E. Schumer, who has been supportive of Mr. Silverstein and critical of the political maneuvering at ground zero, embraced the proposal last night.""This sets the parameters for the best deal possible under the circumstances,"" Mr. Schumer said. ""I urge Larry Silverstein to accept it, if the numbers work.""Bud Perrone, a spokesman for Silverstein Properties, said: ""We welcome the government's willingness to resume negotiations. The Silverstein team will undertake a thorough review of the proposal.""The latest impasse arose with the groundbreaking for the Freedom Tower, which had been planned for this month. There was also a growing realization that there was not enough money to rebuild the entire site, although Mr. Silverstein insisted that he could do the job.Mr. Pataki had championed the Freedom Tower, the largest of five proposed towers, as a way of restoring New York's skyline with a symbol of resilience. But the skyscraper is widely considered to be too big, in the wrong place and nearly impossible to lease to corporate tenants, who consider it a potential terrorist target.Mr. Bloomberg raised the possibility that Mr. Silverstein would build only two towers before running out of money in 2009, defaulting on his lease and walking away from the project with hundreds of millions of dollars. Better to deal with the problem now, he said.Mr. Coscia of the Port Authority also called for a new arrangement with Mr. Silverstein, who leased the trade center from the authority in July 2001, six weeks before it was destroyed.In negotiations over the past four months with Mr. Cahill, Mr. Silverstein tentatively agreed to a deal in which the Port Authority would take control of building the Freedom Tower and one other building. But City Hall, New Jersey and authority commissioners on both sides of the Hudson felt that the Pataki administration's plan shifted all the risk to the authority while enriching Mr. Silverstein.Mr. Silverstein has blamed government ineptitude for the gridlock. But now government officials are claiming a breakthrough.""We believe that this proposal represents a significant turning point,"" Mr. Coscia said. ""It provides a fair platform for all the parties to cooperate on rebuilding. It creates an opportunity to accelerate and energize the process.""Under the unified government plan described yesterday, the Port Authority would take control of the Freedom Tower project, using $1.7 billion in tax-free Liberty Bonds and about $970 million in insurance money. Mr. Silverstein would be paid to build it. The Pataki administration would provide $250 million and has pledged to secure leases for about one million square feet from federal agencies, which would enable the authority to obtain additional financing. Mr. Schumer said last night that federal customs officials were interested in a large block of the space.The authority would also take control of a site on Greenwich Street, which it would probably sell to a residential developer.Mr. Silverstein, in turn, would develop three office towers along Church Street, between Vesey and Liberty Streets. To ensure that he builds quickly, the city and the Port Authority are offering to lease 1.2 million square feet at market rates, according to Mr. Coscia and Mr. Ringler, and the city would provide Liberty Bonds for financing. But his development fee would be restricted to 2.5 percent, not the 5 percent he originally demanded.In the coming months, the authority would design plans with Mr. Silverstein for a shopping mall that would be part of two of his towers, then sell it to him and a retail developer. In addition, Mr. Silverstein would be required to adhere to strict construction schedules and contribute at least $140 million toward the cost of common infrastructure.If Mr. Silverstein decides that the arrangement does not work for him, Mr. Coscia said he would be offered an alternative: he would be paid $50 million and given what is known as Site 5, a parcel valued at $300 million that could be the site of a residential tower.""The unified offer from the public sector will ensure full financing and the build-out of the site on an expedited timetable and a deal that's fair to all the parties,"" Mr. Doctoroff said.'"
"'06-04-20,'1','Housing subsidies have become an increasingly common recruitment tool in high-priced communities that are struggling to improve their teacher corps. New York City joined the trend this week with an innovative program that will pay subsidies of nearly $15,000 to experienced math, science and special education teachers who agree to work in some of the city's toughest middle and high schools.A subsidy initiative was first proposed by the teachers' union in the 1990's. This one comes at a time when the city is struggling to recruit qualified teachers in the face of stiff competition from nearby suburbs, which can offer somewhat higher salaries and less challenging student populations. Teachers already working in the city will also be eligible for some forms of housing assistance.The subsidy sends the important signal that the city is dedicated to attracting the best teachers and improving its schools.But neither this program nor others like it around the country address the bedrock issue: public universities are turning out too few math and science teachers.The schools need to drive up the numbers of students who are prepared to excel in math and science when they arrive at college. Elected officials must then do whatever it takes -- including raising salaries -- to make sure that more of the most talented math and science students end up in classrooms and spend their careers there.'"

"'06-04-20,'1','The Rangers started the season picked to finish near the bottom of the standings, and they are starting the playoffs as a prime candidate to go out in the first round. If the Rangers are trying to find an encouraging sign for their matchup with the Devils, the chance that they will be overlooked is about all they have.""We were underdogs from the beginning and we are again,"" forward Jed Ortmeyer said. ""Everyone is writing us off already.""When the Rangers look across the Hudson River, they see their polar opposite: a team that has won 11 games in a row, an organization that has dominated the past decade, a franchise that has recently accomplished more with less. The dynamic between the big-brother Rangers and the little-brother Devils has become more intriguing than the one between the Rangers and the Islanders.Unlike other New York sports rivals, the Rangers and the Devils meet semiregularly with the season at stake. There was the brawl between the teams in the 1992 playoffs, Mark Messier's famous guarantee in the 1994 playoffs and Mike Richter's barehanded save in the 1997 playoffs. Entering this season, the Rangers had won 3 of the past 37 regular-season games against the Devils, but they had somehow taken all three playoff series.""This brings back a lot of memories,"" Messier said Wednesday in a conference call. ""Looking back, some of the series we played against the Islanders and the Devils were the most fun because of the competitiveness.""Players theoretically feed off adrenaline at this time of the season, but the Rangers might have used all their energy reserves just to get here. They are showing the typical symptoms of fatigue: rookies hitting the proverbial wall, defensemen making boneheaded mistakes, scorers failing to finish plays. Even Jaromir Jagr, who has skated near full speed since opening night, said he was using mind games to push himself.""If I'm tired, I tell myself that the other guy is a lot worse,"" Jagr said. ""I tell myself I feel better than him. I don't know if that's true. But it's what I do.""Despite all the reasons to pout, Jagr was still in a joking mood Wednesday, though his humor has turned slightly self-deprecating. When asked if there were any positive aspects to playing in New Jersey, Jagr said, ""Let me think."" Finally, he said, ""Maybe Rangers fans will come.""Jagr is worried about the Devils' disciplined approach, but he is hopeful that some of his supporters will sneak into Continental Arena and tilt the home-ice advantage. The Rangers have mixed feelings about the Meadowlands. On one hand, it was the site of the team's last series victory, in 1997. On the other, it was where the Rangers started the five-game losing streak that handed the division title to the Devils.Should the Rangers win Game 1 on Saturday afternoon, no one will be talking about regular-season games, blown leads or the division championship that wasn't. The Rangers will once again become New York's adorable underdogs. They are learning right now how quickly momentum can change.""It just takes one game,"" Rangers Coach Tom Renney said. ""In a lot of cases, it's a period. In some cases, it's a play.""Renney has tried team meetings and individual meetings. He has tried praise and criticism. During his news conference Wednesday, he threw his support behind Fedor Tyutin, an embattled defenseman, and made it clear that he needs more production from Petr Prucha, a high-scoring rookie.Renney is continually reminding the Rangers what they achieved through the first half of this season, when the slate was clean and the odds were against them. He insists they are getting another fresh start. Peeling off those old jerseys was just a part of it.'"
"'06-04-20,'1','The pressure on Euronext by hedge funds comes after Nasdaq made an unsolicited bid for the London Stock Exchange in March, then took a stake of nearly 15 percent of London's shares a little more than a week ago. Not content to sit on the sidelines, New York Stock Exchange representatives have been speaking to London market equity holders in recent days about buying their shares.Also on Wednesday, shareholders at a special meeting here voted for their exchange to disburse £510 million to investors. Executives of the London exchange had said they would not make a decision about any merger until such an action had been taken. Now that the plan has been approved, London market executives can concentrate on forging a deal with the Nasdaq Stock Market, Euronext or the New York Stock Exchange.London exchange investors will receive £2 for every share they hold, beginning on May 15. The cash outlay will leave the exchange slightly in debt, but that is not expected to dissuade London's suitors. Potential acquirers are ""not looking at the L.S.E. on that basis,"" said Michael Long, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods here. Any acquisition will be ""so much more about strategic plans,"" he said.Markets in New York and London have been buzzing about what a trans-Atlantic deal would look like, but it may be months or longer before investors have an answer. Executives from the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have yet to sit down and meet, two executives involved in the negotiations said. To date, Nasdaq has not amassed more than the 14.9 percent stake it disclosed on April 11.Nasdaq is ""playing a long game"" one executive said, adding that investors should not expect Nasdaq executives to be ""running around like firemen.""Quickly obtaining another chunk of the London Stock Exchange's shares may prove difficult for any suitor. Many of its remaining top investors are banks, including Barclays and UBS, and banks' stakes are generally not held in one division.Instead, they are spread around the institution, with some perhaps in asset management and some in proprietary trading. Often, the shares are part of the index-linked funds that make automatic purchases tied to a Financial Times-Stock Exchange index, so carving out the London Stock Exchange stake would be very difficult.Still, no one in London is ruling Nasdaq out. Its decision to take the 14.9 stake in the London market was highly unexpected, coming as it did after Nasdaq had said the month before that London shares were trading too high for a takeover.""I wouldn't be surprised if they surprised us again,"" Mr. Long of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said.'"
"'06-04-20,'1','And the sharp monthly rise, which exceeded Wall Street expectations, gave some pause to economists and investors who were encouraged just a day earlier by Fed minutes that suggested the central bank was leaning toward ending its two-year sequence of rate increases with just one more rise to 5 percent, from 4.75 percent.On Tuesday, the minutes from the last meeting of the Fed's policy-setting committee, in late March, were released, indicating that most of its members thought the end of the rate increases ""was likely to be near."" Investors were further soothed by the report that prices at the factory door -- also excluding food and energy -- increased by only 0.1 percent, their slowest pace since November.But a day later, the news was not as comforting. Long-term interest rates rose. The price of the 10-year Treasury bond fell and its yield -- which moves in the opposite direction -- increased to 5.02 percent from 4.98 percent. Stocks dived briefly before edging back up, but the price of gold rose to more than $640 an ounce, up from about $621.Even so, many analysts remained convinced that the new inflation report, by itself, does not change the overall outlook for interest rate moves at the central bank.""Our Fed watchers say there's a consistent story that the Fed is one and done,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York. ""Today's data doesn't change this story.""The jumpiness in financial markets over the economic reports this week underscored how it is becoming more difficult for investors to read the Fed's intentions as it nears the end of its tightening cycle.In part, that's because the Fed has not made clear exactly what information -- actual data on consumer and commodity prices or other indicators, like unemployment and factory utilization, which can put pressure on wages and prices -- will determine whether it is satisfied that inflation will remain under control.""The Fed doesn't know when it's going to stop, so unlike the past couple of years it can't give signals in advance to markets,"" said Nigel Gault, chief economist for the United States at Global Insight. ""The Fed's actions will be dependent on incoming data, so as data comes in it will shift around the market's expectations of the Fed's actions.""Besides gasoline, the rise in the price measure was also driven by the cost of shelter: apartment rents, hotel prices and, most important, what the Labor Department statisticians call homeowners' ""equivalent rent,"" which altogether make up about a quarter of the basket of goods and services used to measure consumer prices.Some economists said this might portend a troubling new inflationary trend in rental markets as potential homeowners deterred by high housing prices decided to rent instead.The price of clothing also added to overall inflation. But it tends to be particularly volatile, depending on holiday schedules and weather, which led several economists to predict that apparel prices will go back down in April.Now that rates have risen from their extraordinary lows of the early years of the decade, the Fed faces tougher choices as it seeks to find what it considers a ""neutral rate"" for borrowing costs, a level that neither stimulates nor retards economic growth.For one thing, it is still unclear how much the housing market will soften, slowing construction activity and taking some air out of household spending.For another, the cooling effect of the Fed's 15 interest rate increases since June 2004 has not yet finished working its way through the economy.""There's tightening in the pipeline that has not yet been manifest,"" said Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City in Cincinnati.At the meeting in March, some members of the Fed's policy-setting meeting expressed worries that they might go too far in raising rates and risk squelching economic growth.""The Fed,"" Mr. Gault said, ""must decide whether it is confident that the slowdown will bring inflation down on its own.""'"

"'06-04-20,'1','A teenager was embarrassed to have to urinate in a bottle near a car full of strangers.The 20 people in the car from Roosevelt Island to Manhattan were in for the long haul. They were not rescued until shortly after 4 a.m. yesterday.Two infants, crying for milk, drank juice hauled up in a basket by passengers through the tram's trap door. Other supplies included baby wipes, potato chips, blankets and bedpans. The increasingly irritable adults devised a makeshift private bathroom by hanging a few blankets in one corner.As the ambulances, fire engines and news helicopters circled back to Roosevelt Island to focus on the first tram, the passengers in the other one felt abandoned.At one point, around 1 a.m., with the midair rescue cage inching slowly off Roosevelt Island, passengers in the tram stalled high above First Avenue heard from authorities that it might take hours more to rescue them.Their patience broke. ""We're going to be here until the sun comes up again!"" Ms. Rivera recalled thinking.The rides had started ominously for both Ms. Rivera, on the Roosevelt Island side, and Mr. Gutierrez, on the Manhattan side. Shortly after 4:30 p.m., the doors on each tram closed, and they almost missed their rides. But the operators recognized them as regulars and reopened the doors.Minutes later, Mr. Gutierrez's tram, headed toward the island, jerked to a halt. They were over First Avenue, not far from the river. The tram, which can hold 126 people, was about one-third full, with room for people to mill about or sit on the floor or on the benches ringing the car. Mr. Gutierrez counted at least 15 children.As the minutes turned into an hour, the adults shared small talk, exchanged bottled water and calmed a 4-year-old boy who thought he was about to throw up, Mr. Gutierrez recalled. (The boy did not.)Then, two false starts, shortly after 6:30 p.m. and again about 8:15, brought the tram high above the water.The adults began to notice that the tram operator's walkie-talkie was not working. Neither was the old military-style telephone in the tram.With the sun setting, the passengers said, they were receiving no official information, but were relying on the 20 or so cellphones on board. Friends and family members were relaying information from radio and television news reports.As night fell, the passengers were left in the dark until a police van pulled to the middle of the Queensboro Bridge and cast a powerful light in the gondola's direction.""We felt like chickens in a very dark chicken coop,"" Mr. Gutierrez said, ""with a very strong light that hurt my eyes.""Still, thanks to their cellphones, the passengers knew they would soon be rescued. Mr. Gutierrez's wife, Teresa, 40, was freed in the rescue cage's second trip. Mr. Gutierrez was in the fourth trip, the next to last.On the stranded tram headed to Manhattan, the passengers and the operator were also receiving their information by cellphone, at times directly from television reporters. But two police officers on bicycles on the Manhattan side of the Queensboro Bridge were able to signal their cellphone number by clicks of their flashlight.For a while, the passengers did not hear from the authorities. The gondola, which was being manually pulled forward, stalled above First Avenue. The lights flickered faintly inside the tram.An Italian man, accompanying his elderly parents on the tram, apologized and said he had to urinate. He did so in a plastic bag. They opened a trap door and let the bag drop.Shortly after 9 p.m., the authorities called and said they had drinks, cookies, blankets and other supplies for the passengers, including baby wipes for two infants. But the rescue basket in the tram proved cumbersome. It took six people pulling rope and three people steadying it to lower the orange basket, somewhat larger than a backyard trash can, to the street.Much later, Ms. Rivera said, maybe after 1:30 a.m., passengers saw a fire engine with something resembling a cherry picker bouncing toward the tram.""It looked like it was bending,"" she recalled. ""And everyone was looking out the windows, and they said, 'I'm not going out on that thing.' ""At last, in the small hours of the morning, a huge crane appeared, lifting a platform and a cage, like the goddess of justice holding up a scale. It did not sway.The passengers were elated. They said a brief prayer of thanks. And they came down in two smooth trips.Ms. Rivera's last thought for the evening was this: ""This crane was the best idea. Why didn't anyone think this up two hours after we were stranded? Why did it take 12 hours?""'"
"'06-04-20,'1','Sales rose 34 percent, to $4.36 billion, compared with $3.24 billion a year ago. Sales were slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimate of $4.52 billion.The challenge Apple faces on Wall Street, it seems, is mostly in managing high expectations. For example, Apple sold more than 8.5 million of its popular iPod portable music and video players, or 60 percent more than in the quarter a year ago. Still, most analysts estimated that Apple would sell 9 million and 10 million in the quarter.""People come up with all sorts of numbers, but I think 8.5 million of anything is pretty great,"" the chief executive of Apple, Steven P. Jobs, said in an interview yesterday.Wall Street analysts, Mr. Jobs said, will have a tricky time projecting quarterly iPod sales because ""no one has ever done this before,"" meaning sold digital music players at the pace that Apple has recently. Sales, as expected, fell off from the holiday quarter, when Apple sold 14 million iPods. But Apple pointed to industry figures showing its share of digital music player sales in the United States market rose to 78 percent in March.Apple switched half of its Macintosh models to Intel microprocessors in the quarter, replacing PowerPC chips supplied by I.B.M. ""We're moving rapidly and we're thrilled with how it's going,"" Mr. Jobs said.Macintosh sales in the quarter were about the same as a year ago, rising slightly to 1,112,000 machines.""People are postponing the purchases of Macs, especially professionals in advertising, publishing and design who are waiting for specialized software programs to be ready for the Intel-based Macs,"" said Charles Wolf, an analyst at Needham & Company, who owns Apple shares and has a hold recommendation on the stock.""It's going to be difficult to get a real sound sense of underlying demand for most of this year,"" Mr. Wolf said. ""But Apple has dodged the Intel transition bullet so far. And sales could really take off, once the shift is complete and the software is ready.""Apple's profit margins, executives said, were lifted by lower-than-anticipated prices for some parts, notably the flash memory in iPods.In the current quarter, Apple said it expected sales of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion and earnings of 39 cents to 43 cents a share, after charges for stock-based compensation. Both the sales and profit guidance were below analysts' expectations.If cautious about the current quarter, Apple is optimistic for the long term. In a sign of that optimism, Mr. Jobs announced plans Tuesday evening to build a 50-acre corporate campus near company headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. At a meeting of the Cupertino City Council, Mr. Jobs said that Apple's rapid growth meant it needed more room.The complex will probably take four or five years to design and build. When completed, it would accommodate up to 3,500 workers. The campus will be in addition to the headquarters in Cupertino.""We'll occupy both of them,"" Mr. Jobs said in an interview.'"
"'06-04-20,'1','""We're trying to educate the public about our collections,"" Mr. Pierce (pronounced purse) said.""If you took someone from Paris or St. Louis who had never been to New York, and asked them to characterize the Frick and the Morgan,"" he mused, ""they would be able to characterize the Frick,"" the Fifth Avenue mansion turned museum that was once the home of the industrialist Henry Clay Frick. ""But they couldn't say what exactly what the Morgan was.""Having grown by 75,000 square feet, the Morgan for the first time will be able really to tell its story of how the financier J. Pierpont Morgan spent a lifetime collecting, starting at age 14, when he ordered his first set of covers of the Illustrated London News in 1852.Eventually, Morgan assembled a library that ranged from collections of religious texts to classics of Victorian literature, medieval art and historical manuscripts. He collected paintings by Corot, Frederic Edwin Church and Asher B. Durand as well as old masters like Hans Memling and Perugino.From 1890 (when his father, Junius Morgan, died) to his death in 1913, Pierpont Morgan amassed more than 3,000 objects, including 600 medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and 1,500 old master drawings.His son, J. P. Morgan Jr., decided that his father's library was too important to remain in private hands, and in 1924 he opened it as a public institution.The Morgan's collections have since expanded through gifts and purchases. In 1994 the dealer, collector and longtime board member Eugene V. Thaw pledged his prestigious collection of old master and 19th-century drawings; in 1998, the Morgan also received Carter Burden's collection of American and European literary works and the Pierre Matisse Gallery archives, which includes letters from artists including Balthus, Chagall, Miró, Tanguy, Giacometti and Dubuffet.In designing his addition, Mr. Piano was as sensitive to the Morgan's past as he was to its needs for the future.Half of the expansion is below ground. Mr. Piano and his team burrowed down some 60 feet, removing about 46,000 tons of rock that Morgan officials say was carted away in 1,300 truckloads. Its underworld is a blend of public spaces -- the auditorium for concerts -- and highly private areas, like its climate-controlled storage vaults, meticulously organized by collecting category.Above ground are galleries that, while retaining the modest scale of the original Morgan buildings, are mainly set around large glass windows providing panoramic vistas of Manhattan buildings.In the old reading room can now be found a selection of drawings dating from the 15th to the 20th centuries: Leonardo and Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Rubens, Watteau and Tiepolo, Cézanne and Pollock. Across the hall, where special exhibitions were once installed, are custom-built cabinets displaying illuminated manuscripts set against dark brown ultrasuede. Here visitors will file past treats from the Hours of Catherine of Cleves to 35 hand-painted tarot cards, one of the earliest and most complete 15th-century sets known to exist.Signaling a new openness, the Morgan's office is no longer protected by red ropes. The public will be able to troop through that sanctum to admire his collection of Italian and Flemish old masters and family portraits on walls of crimson-flocked fabric. In anticipation of the reopening, all the artworks have been cleaned and the lighting updated.""We wanted to let the public have a closer look,"" Mr. Pierce said. Even the Morgan's original private vault in that room will be visible.The new, modern galleries will have a fresh emphasis on the 20th century. Last year the Morgan hired its first curator for works of art from the last century. In 2005 it also received an important bequest from the Broadway lyricist Fred Ebb: mostly works on paper by German Expressionist and Vienna Secessionist artists, including Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele.""Our basic challenge,"" Mr. Pierce said, ""is how to maintain a balance between beautiful shows that relate to the permanent collection while at the same time have shows with popular appeal.""One telling sign is an exhibition planned for this fall: ""Bob Dylan's American Journey: 1956 to 1966.""'"

"'06-04-20,'1','Paul S. Otellini, Intel president and chief executive, acknowledged in a conference call with analysts that PC growth had ""moderated somewhat"" from the double-digit rates of recent years.Intel executives, however, insisted the company would work down its inventory by the end of the second quarter. ""The first half of 2006 has been a time to reset our business,"" Mr. Otellini said.He added that he expected Intel to return to ""normal seasonal patterns"" in the second half of the year.In lowering its revenue forecast for the full year, Intel said it now expected revenue to decline 3 percent from last year's revenue of $38.8 billion, rather than increase 6 percent to 9 percent, as the company had said in January. It said revenue for the second quarter would be $8 billion to $8.6 billion, below Wall Street's forecast of $8.85 billion.To help address the problem, Mr. Otellini said Intel was cutting its costs by more than $1 billion for the year, while maintaining its current product plans.In the third quarter, Intel is expected to roll out a new chip design, the ""core microarchitecture,"" which the company hopes will help it gain back market share. Intel has lost some ground as Advanced Micro ramped up its new dual-processor server line faster than Intel, giving it an early-lead advantage.But perhaps just as significant for investors is that Intel's gross profit margin has shrunk to 55.1 percent, substantially below the 59 percent the company forecast in January. Intel executives said margins were hurt by lower microprocessor revenue and higher inventory write-downs.Andy D. Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, defended the company's performance against Advanced Micro during the quarter, asserting that Intel did not lose any additional market share after conceding last month that it had experienced a ""slight"" loss in the fourth quarter.In the fourth quarter of 2005, Intel's share of the overall microprocessor market was 76.9 percent, compared with 82.2 percent a year earlier, while Advanced Micro rose to 21.4 percent, from 16.6 percent, according to Mercury Research.Intel's net income declined 38 percent during the first quarter, which ended April 1, to $1.35 billion, or 23 cents a share, compared with $2.18 billion, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Without a change in accounting to reflect stock options, Intel said the first-quarter earnings would have been 27 cents a share.First-quarter revenue fell 5.2 percent, to $8.94 billion, roughly the midpoint of the revised guidance the company issued in March. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had forecast earnings of 23 cents a share on revenue of $8.91 billion.In March, the company lowered its revenue forecast to a range of $8.7 billion to $9.1 billion, down from a previous estimate of $9.1 billion to $9.7 billion, citing a ""slight"" loss of market share and weaker sales of microprocessors.Mr. Walia, the RBC analyst, said he wished that Intel would be more realistic in its assessment of how long its turnaround was going to take, adding that the worst might not yet be over. ""For all the things Intel needs to work out, you've got to have a perfect scenario,"" he said. ""They're being hit from all sides.""'"

"'06-04-20,'1','Shares of J. P. Morgan rose 2 cents yesterday, to $42.62. The bank has underperformed its smaller rivals since its 2004 merger with Bank One.Yesterday's results underscored the progress made in cutting costs, improving operations and integrating five core businesses. Yet, they also showed how much work there is to be done in a difficult operating environment.Net income for the retail banking group fell 11 percent from a year ago to $881 million, driven by a fall-off in mortgage originations and profit margin pressure on deposits and loans from higher interest rates.""The re-fi boom is long since gone,"" Michael J. Cavanagh, J. P. Morgan's chief financial officer, said in a conference call yesterday, discussing mortgage refinancing.The entire banking industry is being squeezed by a flat-yield curve and intense competition. And despite stronger product sales in the Chase bank branches, the division was not immune.J. P. Morgan's credit card unit posted huge gains in the quarter as net income rose 73 percent, to $901 million. But that large increase reflected an unusual $285 million after-tax benefit from fewer bankruptcy defaults after a surge in filings late last year.The results obscure a decline in credit card revenue, which fell 2 percent, to $3.7 billion, from year-ago period, and may suggest more challenges ahead. Payment rates have continued to increase. Marketing expenses were higher. And the impact of tough new minimum payment rules, which could cost the bank as much as $500 million, will not be felt until the second half of this year.As did its chief rival, Citigroup, which reported first-quarter results earlier this week, J. P. Morgan showed strong investment banking results.Revenue was up 12 percent, to a record $4.7 billion. But compared with Citigroup, the performance of individual investment banking units was more mixed. For instance, J. P. Morgan's equity markets business, which posted $1.2 billion in revenue on strong commission gains and trading profits, helped offset fixed-income market revenue of $2 billion, which was down 13 percent.Over all, the investment banking group's earnings fell to $850 million, a 36 percent decline from a year ago, after taking a big charge to expense stock options and increasing its loan-loss reserves. Without the options expense, however, the division's quarterly profit would have increased to about $1 billion, up 50 percent from last quarter. (Profit was down 25 percent from the period last year because the bank benefited from a loan-loss reversal.)Morgan's treasury services and asset management divisions both posted double-digit earnings from a year ago, and its commercial banking unit showed a more modest 4 percent gain. Private equity earnings, however, fell to $103 million, down over 76 percent from the period last year.And in one notable difference from prior conference calls, Wall Street analysts asked about financial and operational issues. There were no questions about when Mr. Dimon was going to pursue a mega-deal.'"
"'06-04-20,'1','Experts say blowups are the exception. But because governments are not required to report the details of their swap activity, no one knows for sure the extent of the total exposure, or where the trouble spots may lie.""The public needs to better understand the nature of these transactions,"" said Robert H. Attmore, chairman of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, an independent group that writes accounting rules for state and local governments.The seven-member board voted Tuesday to proceed with a project to make governments provide much more information about their use of derivatives.One example of what can go wrong is now playing out at the Delaware River Port Authority, which handles bridges, railroads and other transportation services near Philadelphia for Pennsylvania and New Jersey.In 2001, the port authority was planning to sell $358 million of bonds. Officials wanted to economize by using a floating interest rate, much as a home buyer might choose a variable-rate mortgage because it has a lower interest rate than a fixed-rate mortgage.But the port authority also wanted to protect itself from future interest rate increases. So it struck a side agreement with UBS Securities, involving a type of derivative called an interest rate swap option, or swaption.The swaption gave UBS an option which, if exercised, would start streams of payments between the port authority and UBS. The terms meant that UBS would get the larger payment if interest rates fell below a certain point, and the port authority would get larger payments if rates rose above it. The swap was thus meant to serve as a hedge for the port authority, with the possible stream of payments from UBS offsetting the rising amounts it would have to pay its bondholders if rates moved up.The concept may have been sound, but in the real world things turned out differently. Before the bonds could be issued, the governors of Pennsylvania and New Jersey had a falling-out over plans to dredge a long stretch of the Delaware River. That caused a split on the port authority's board, making it impossible to issue the bonds. Meanwhile, interest rates have remained low, prompting UBS to exercise its swap option and start collecting its money.Now the authority must make payments to UBS every month, even though the bonds were never sold.Officials of the port authority confirmed these details but declined to comment further.The port authority's recent financial statements do not show that the problems were looming. In 2003, the port authority did disclose, in its footnotes, that it had entered into several interest rate swap options in exchange for upfront payments totaling $40 million from three financial services firms. The footnotes explained that the port authority would be exchanging a stream of payments with UBS for many years if UBS exercised its option. But they did not show how big the payments might be, or explain the risks.Randal J. Finden, who is managing the accounting board's derivatives project, said interest rate swaps can be tricky to evaluate because they sometimes go through periods when they look like losers, only to recover when interest rates change. He has been trying to devise a series of tests that would identify swap agreements that are irretrievable failures.In his approach, governments that find they are caught in unsuccessful swap contracts would be required to show the failures on their balance sheets. They would report a liability in the amount that it would cost to buy out of the swap contract.Getting out of a failed swap can mean making a huge payment.The port authority's swap with UBS would probably fail the tests Mr. Finden is devising, because the swap is not serving any valid hedging purpose.The accounting board has no regulatory power, and Mr. Finden, the derivatives project's manager, said the board was not trying to discourage governments' use of derivatives.Still, public finance experts say that fuller disclosure would bring failed derivatives out into the open quickly. That, in turn, could motivate governments to cut their losses when a swap contract fails, rather than pouring more money into an unsuccessful transaction in hopes that interest rates will eventually turn in their favor.Peter L. Block, a director in Standard & Poor's government ratings division who has been analyzing governments' use of swaps, said analysts like him were eager to see what would show up once the new accounting procedures come into force.Mr. Block said he was guessing that most swaps would pass the coming accounting test.""If 98 percent are stable,"" he said, ""you want to know about the 2 percent that aren't, because you might have big exposure to them.""'"
"'06-04-20,'1','On the fifth floor of a Fifth Avenue building Tuesday afternoon, there were four versions of Jonathan Pryce, the actor. One was walking around in a dark gray suit, looking slightly uncomfortable as he sipped ginger ale and posed for pictures near the other three versions, which were immobile, silent and painted so that they were almost -- but not quite -- his doppelgängers.""It's just enough removed from me to make it possible for me to look at it,"" said Mr. Pryce, who took a break from the Imperial Theater, where he is starring in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" to visit the Forum Gallery to see the work of Sean Henry, a British sculptor.In 2004 Mr. Henry became enthralled with Mr. Pryce as the lead character in a London production of Edward Albee's play ""The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?,"" about a man in love with, yes, a goat. Mr. Henry then persuaded Mr. Pryce to sit for him to create three bronze sculptures, each depicting a scene from the play (minus the goat).Mr. Pryce said that he agreed only because he was interested in what the intersection of ephemeral performance and durable sculpture might look like.""I'd have run a hundred miles if anybody said they wanted to do a sculpture of me,"" he said, adding, of actors: ""We're awfully self-aware. I think that's the polite way to put it.""Asked where he thought his likenesses might end up -- a living room? a lobby? maybe even a park? -- Mr. Pryce cringed a little and said he had not thought about it. ""I won't be buying them,"" he said, smiling.'"

"'06-04-21,'1','Mr. Wisan says he has been frustrated at every step, including efforts to communicate with residents. Mass mailings to residents seeking tax payment have gone unanswered, and some were found strewn across the floor of the post office, unopened, Mr. Wisan said. His representatives sent to knock on doors here in town and in the twin border community of Colorado City, Ariz., have invariably encountered people not home. Some holdouts have even started building walls around their houses.On Wednesday night, Mr. Wisan took the extraordinary step of convening a town hall meeting to wheedle, threaten and beg residents to break with tradition and pay their individual tax bills — and thus, in a very real way, enter the American mainstream.If they refuse, he said, they risk losing their houses when the courts settle the issues of law and faith. He also threatened to evict them personally.""It's a basic obligation,"" Mr. Wisan told the meeting of more than 40 people. ""My position is that people have to pay to live on trust property.""Mr. Wisan was appointed to oversee the trust after a judge concluded that church leaders, the objects of suits in recent years, including one by a group of young men who said they had been wrongly evicted from the community, were not adequately defending themselves in court and were risking the residents' welfare.After Mr. Wisan's appointment, church leaders ordered people to stop contributing to the church fund that went to pay the taxes.In some ways, Hildale and Colorado City, in a region that is home to the largest concentration of polygamists in the country, could be ordinary Southwestern farming towns. Plowed fields are interspersed by houses and dirt roads. Horses graze in pastures against the backdrop of red-rock hills. What is different are the houses themselves.Some look more like dormitories, several stories high with rows of windows. Others are unfinished.Residents say the community rarely borrows money, and so houses are built, or improved, with cash when it is available.Walls line some main roads. Some are stone, others are wood. All are high enough to conceal the houses and their worlds from the street, and they are often marked with prominent trespassing warnings.The entanglements of religion and real estate run deep in Hildale, which has had polygamist communities for the better part of a century. Most everyone who showed up on Wednesday night had been excommunicated by the F.L.D.S. church or had left voluntarily, some attendees said, because most active members were following the church instructions to keep away.What that meant was that Mr. Wisan had to communicate through the people at the meeting to the invisible and much larger community beyond. About 8,000 to 10,000 people are believed be living on trust lands.The numbers are uncertain, and their identities in the secretive community are also uncertain, said Jeffrey L. Shields, a lawyer who works with Mr. Wisan. The trust has an assessed value of $110 million and consists mainly of the towns plus a few lots, several thousand acres altogether, though a full survey is under way, Mr. Wisan said.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, has no connection to the F.L.D.S., and disavowed polygamy as the price of statehood in 1890. Groups like the fundamentalist one split off over that decision, denouncing it as a political compromise and not the word of God.Mr. Wisan told the meeting, which people videotaped, that one family close to the indicted leader, Warren Jeffs, compromised and quietly paid $14,000 in taxes last week. He also said he had identified 75 prominent families with the largest houses and tax bills and planned to pursue them, as well.Mr. Wisan said it was too early to say what might occur next. Some residents predict that the community could disperse to other parts of the West or to Canada, taking a page from the Mormons of old who came to Utah in 1847 to avoid persecution. Others fear violence.Mr. Wisan on Wednesday urged people to stay, saying abandoning houses here and starting over somewhere else would be financially disastrous. Even for those who want to stay, the road promises to be winding at best.Ross Chatwin, who said he had been forced out of the church, sued and won the right to stay in his house. He said he wanted to continue to do so, though he does not own the house because it is on trust land.Another man said he had built a house on the trust site and lost it when the church denounced him. He wants to return.One man who refused to give his name for fear of reprisals by the church said he was a member and was trying to have his extended family of more than 40 siblings from the wives — ""the mothers""— agree that the old days were over and that they had to deal with the likes of Mr. Wisan.Lenore Holm, a former member who fought the church years ago over what she concluded was the forced marriage of her teenage daughter to an older man, asked Mr. Wisan why money from the trust, including the sale of some land, could not go to paying the tax bill for everyone.Mr. Wisan said that it would simply not be fair, because that would let freeloaders who are avoiding their taxes off the hook at the expense of the trust and that the court had assigned him to protect the community as a whole.'"
"'06-04-21,'1','A Supreme Court decision last year allowed the federal government to arrest anyone using marijuana, even for medical purposes and even in states that have legalized its use.Congressional opponents and supporters of medical marijuana use have each tried to enlist the F.D.A. to support their views. Representative Mark Souder, Republican of Indiana and a fierce opponent of medical marijuana initiatives, proposed legislation two years ago that would have required the food and drug agency to issue an opinion on the medicinal properties of marijuana.Mr. Souder believes that efforts to legalize medicinal uses of marijuana are a front for efforts to legalize all uses of it, said Martin Green, a spokesman for Mr. Souder.Tom Riley, a spokesman for Mr. Walters, hailed the food and drug agency's statement, saying it would put to rest what he called ""the bizarre public discussion"" that has led to some legalization of medical marijuana.The Food and Drug Administration statement directly contradicts a 1999 review by the Institute of Medicine, a part of the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's most prestigious scientific advisory agency. That review found marijuana to be ""moderately well suited for particular conditions, such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and AIDS wasting.""Dr. John Benson, co-chairman of the Institute of Medicine committee that examined the research into marijuana's effects, said in an interview that the statement on Thursday and the combined review by other agencies were wrong.The federal government ""loves to ignore our report,"" said Dr. Benson, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. ""They would rather it never happened.""Some scientists and legislators said the agency's statement about marijuana demonstrated that politics had trumped science.""Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the F.D.A. making pronouncements that seem to be driven more by ideology than by science,"" said Dr. Jerry Avorn, a medical professor at Harvard Medical School.Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a New York Democrat who has sponsored legislation to allow medicinal uses of marijuana, said the statement reflected the influence of the Drug Enforcement Administration, which he said had long pressured the F.D.A. to help in its fight against marijuana.A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration referred questions to Mr. Walters's office.The Food and Drug Administration's statement said state initiatives that legalize marijuana use were ""inconsistent with efforts to ensure that medications undergo the rigorous scientific scrutiny of the F.D.A. approval process.""But scientists who study the medical use of marijuana said in interviews that the federal government had actively discouraged research. Lyle E. Craker, a professor in the division of plant and soil sciences at the University of Massachusetts, said he submitted an application to the D.E.A. in 2001 to grow a small patch of marijuana to be used for research because government-approved marijuana, grown in Mississippi, was of poor quality.In 2004, the drug enforcement agency turned Dr. Craker down. He appealed and is awaiting a judge's ruling. ""The reason there's no good evidence is that they don't want an honest trial,"" Dr. Craker said.Dr. Donald Abrams, a professor of clinical medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said he had studied marijuana's medicinal effects for years but had been frustrated because the National Institutes of Health, the leading government medical research agency, had refused to finance such work.With financing from the State of California, Dr. Abrams undertook what he said was a rigorous, placebo-controlled trial of marijuana smoking in H.I.V. patients who suffered from nerve pain. Smoking marijuana proved effective in ameliorating pain, Dr. Abrams said, but he said he was having trouble getting the study published.""One wonders how anyone"" could fulfill the Food and Drug Administration request for well-controlled trials to prove marijuana's benefits, he said.Marinol, a synthetic version of a marijuana component, is approved to treat anorexia associated with AIDS and the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer drug therapy.GW Pharmaceutical, a British company, has received F.D.A. approval to test a sprayed extract of marijuana in humans. Called Sativex, the drug is made from marijuana and is approved for sale in Canada. Opponents of efforts to legalize marijuana for medicinal uses suggest that marijuana is a so-called gateway drug that often leads users to try more dangerous drugs and to addiction.But the Institute of Medicine report concluded there was no evidence that marijuana acted as a gateway to harder drugs. And it said there was no evidence that medical use of marijuana would increase its use among the general population.Dr. Daniele Piomelli, a professor of pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine, said he had ""never met a scientist who would say that marijuana is either dangerous or useless.""Studies clearly show that marijuana has some benefits for some patients, Dr. Piomelli said.""We all agree on that,"" he said.'"
"'06-04-21,'1','HONIARA, Solomon Islands, April 20 (Reuters) — A new prime minister was sworn in at a private ceremony on Thursday as Australian troops and police officers patrolled the Solomon Islands capital after two days of rioting over his selection.Australia said it was committed to restoring order in the troubled South Pacific island chain to prevent it from becoming a failed state and a possible haven for terrorism.Violence erupted on Tuesday after Snyder Rini was chosen by Parliament as the new prime minister. The protesters said his government would be heavily influenced by local Chinese businessmen and Taiwan, which the Solomon Islands recognizes in place of mainland China.Despite the lack of diplomatic relations, China asked the Solomon Islands to protect its citizens, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday.Chinese diplomats were sent to the Solomon Islands and arranged shelter for about 500 Chinese citizens at the police compound, Mr. Qin said.An Australian police official said about 70 people had been arrested after the riots and looting, much of it against Chinese-owned businesses.'"
"'06-04-21,'1','These services attract people to Google's site, where they may also conduct searches, he said in an interview. ""All of a sudden Google is top of mind again, over and over again.""Google continued to make substantial capital investments, mainly in computer servers, networking equipment and space for its data centers. It spent $345 million on these items in the first quarter, more than double the level of last year. Yahoo, its closest rival, spent $142 million on capital expenses in the first quarter.Google has an enormous volume of Web site information, video and e-mail on its servers, Mr. Schmidt said. ""Those machines are full. We have a huge machine crisis.""Jordan Rohan, an analyst for RBC Capital Markets, called Google's capital spending ""unfathomably high,"" noting that it spent the same percentage of its revenue on equipment as a company in the telephone business, an industry traditionally seen as far more capital-intensive than the Internet.He said investors would tolerate this high spending level as long as Google's results continued to be so strong.""If Google's market share continues to increase, and its position as the central hub of the Internet is reinforced, an extra $1 billion is a worthwhile investment,"" Mr. Rohan said. ""The day market share peaks, we have a problem.""Investors saw little problem in the latest numbers. Google earned $592 million in the first quarter, compared with $369 million in the year-earlier period.Excluding charges for stock-based compensation and payments to the plaintiffs' lawyers in the settlement of a class-action lawsuit, earnings were $2.29 a share, well ahead of the $1.97 that analysts had anticipated.Gross revenue was $2.25 billion, up 79 percent. Analysts prefer to look at Google's revenue after deducting the payments it makes to services like America Online, which display its advertisements and keep most of the money from them. Using this measure, Google's revenue was $1.53 billion, compared with the $1.44 billion that analysts had estimated.The company's stock, which ended regular trading at $415, up $4.50, rose after hours to $448.31 It reached a high of $475.11 in January and was at $432.66 before its last earnings report, then fell back as far as $337.06 in March.Google saw faster growth on the Web sites it owns, which are far more profitable because it does not have to share advertising money. Google's sites posted revenue of $1.3 billion, up 97 percent.Revenue from partner sites was $928 million, up 59 percent. Google kept 22 percent of the revenue for ads shown on partner sites, compared with 21 percent a year ago.Revenue is growing faster overseas. Revenue from outside the United States was 42 percent of total revenue, compared with 39 percent a year ago. The company said that it noted particular growth in Britain, France and elsewhere in Northern Europe.Mr. Rohan said that in the first quarter, Google's search revenue in the United States grew 10 percent from the fourth quarter of 2005, about the same growth as Yahoo. Google has long grown substantially faster than Yahoo, and it is still increasing its share of user searches, he said. That means Yahoo is starting to catch up on technology to generate more advertising revenue for each search, he said.Google added $825 million to its cash hoard, giving it $8.4 billion in cash at the end of the quarter. In April, it raised another $2.1 billion by selling shares to the public and spent $1 billion to buy 5 percent of AOL.The company also continued to hire at a breakneck pace. It added 1,110 workers in the quarter for a total of 6,790 full-time employees.In a conference call with investors, Mr. Schmidt highlighted several areas for future growth.One was advertising from local businesses on the company's main search service, as well on its local search and maps products. The delivery of such advertising is based on an inference of the user's location from the search query or Internet protocol address.""Locally targeted ads are an increasingly meaningful contributor to revenue, and much more is coming,"" Mr. Schmidt told the investors.Mr. Rashtchy, the Piper Jaffray analyst, estimated that 10 percent of Google's advertising was local.Mr. Schmidt also said the company saw great opportunity in developing services for mobile phones. It has developed a system called a transcoder that will reformat Web pages for display on the small screens of cellphones.The company has started delivering advertising on its mobile service in Japan and it is negotiating with wireless carriers to put advertising on its services in other countries as well, Mr. Schmidt said in an interview.'"
"'06-04-21,'1','The question is why. Why would a star of Michael Douglas's stature and intelligence attach himself to a Washington thriller as deeply ridiculous, suspense-free and potentially career-damaging as ""The Sentinel?""Mr. Douglas, as bristly and pugnacious as ever, plays Pete Garrison, a veteran Secret Service agent still smarting from his failure to keep Ronald Reagan out of harm's way in 1981. More than two decades later, serving in the administration of President Ballentine (David Rasche), he is in charge of protecting the first lady, Sarah (an inert, expressionless Kim Basinger).Pete radiates the aggression of a riled-up pit bull straining at its leash behind a chain-link fence; the foam practically drips from the corners of his mouth. In his bizarre code of ethics, it's apparently O.K. for him to be carrying on a steamy, secret affair with Sarah. He even drops the word love, which lands with the squishy thud of a rotten tomato lobbed from a hotel window.Duty soon interrupts the hanky-panky. After the shooting of a fellow agent who had hinted to Pete of some dirty business afoot, a tipster informs him of a presidential assassination plot involving a traitor inside his own hallowed Secret Service; it would be the first blemish on the agency's spotless record.Although ""The Sentinel,"" directed by Clark Johnson from a screenplay by George Nolfi, and based on a novel by Gerald Petievich, would like to keep you guessing the identity of the guilty party, it is obvious from the get-go. And those dang foreigners behind it all are the usual vague assortment of acceptable scapegoats: former members of the K.G.B., neo-Nazis and members of a drug cartel. The movie is too timid to name names or to identify grudges. The words Al Qaeda, mentioned only once and in passing, are the only indication that we are living in a post-9/11 world.'"
"'06-04-21,'1','As if the collection of delicate and brilliantly colored flowers were not enough, the organizers of this year's orchid show at Rockefeller Center have added another horticultural touch, bamboo. Lots of it, hanging from the ceiling of the huge tent rising above the skating rink where more than 5,000 orchids are being exhibited.The bamboo sculptures are called Sogetsu, after an art movement created in Japan in the late 1920's and an offshoot of a Japanese tradition known as ikebana. The sculptures are created from thinly sliced bamboo, intertwined and falling from stalks suspended from the tent's rafters.Tetsunori Kawana, a Sogetsu artist who recently moved to New York from Japan, designed the organic sculptures and a nest of bamboo for the gold statute of Prometheus. The work required more than two tons of bamboo cut from 650 poles.The Greater New York Orchid Society organized the show, which is going on until late Sunday afternoon. The society wanted to fill the space above the skating rink with something that would complement the orchids.""We wanted a sort of voluptuousness of interesting shapes,"" said David Horak, the society's president and the show's chairman. ""We see a fertile and stimulating relationship.""Still, that did not prevent some apprehension this week as the sculptures were being installed above the rink, some hanging dangerously close to the floor. Mr. Horak was concerned that the bamboo might overwhelm the orchids brought in by more than 70 international exhibitors.""It's a balancing act,"" he said.It took about three dozen workers four days to create the sculpture and about two dozen to install it. Thomas A. Madden Jr., managing director for Tishman Speyer Properties, the owners of Rockefeller Center, said that the company wanted to do something bigger, better and more interesting with the orchid show, now in its fifth year at the rink.'"

"'06-04-21,'1','Shiite politicians have in recent days mentioned two possible replacements: Jawad al-Maliki, an outspoken and highly visible member of Parliament, and Ali al-Adeeb, a longtime party official and aide to Mr. Jaafari.Mr. Jaafari won the nomination in February by a single vote in a ballot among Shiite political leaders, in part because of support from Moktada al-Sadr, the anti-American cleric who controls the largest bloc of seats in the main alliance. But his nomination brought a groundswell of opposition among Sunni Arab, Kurdish, secular and even some Shiite politicians, who said he had failed to improve services or stem the violence.Leaders of the Shiite bloc, the United Iraqi Alliance, met throughout the day to deliberate on new nominees; as the largest bloc in Parliament, the alliance has the constitutional right to name the prime minister. Members said a meeting of the full membership -- 130 representatives -- was set for Saturday morning, and a meeting of the 275-member Parliament was scheduled for later that day.President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, suggested at the news conference that the opposition blocs would not oppose the Shiites' next nominee.""The alliance is free to choose its candidate, and we respect the alliance and its will,"" he said. ""Whoever will be the candidate of the alliance, we will approve it.""It remained unclear why Mr. Jaafari gave in on Thursday, especially after having vowed on Wednesday that he would not give up his nomination. But outside pressure doubtless played a role.Ashraf Qazi, the United Nations envoy in Iraq, met Wednesday with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most influential Shiite cleric, to press the need for Shiite politicians to resolve the impasse.The Shiites have also been pushed by the American government to settle the dispute, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice intervened during her visit this month. American officials have lobbied the Shiites to replace Mr. Jaafari because of his close ties to Mr. Sadr, who commands the loyalty of a vast and unpredictable militia, and his relationship with Iran, where he lived for many years in exile.Although Mr. Jaafari did not formally withdraw, he made it clear that he was ending his resistance to stepping aside. In the letter to the Shiite alliance, which was read at a news conference by an official from Mr. Jaafari's Islamic Dawa Party, he said he was leaving the nomination completely to the Shiite bloc.The alliance could reassert his nomination, but leaders across the political spectrum said that was very unlikely.In a late-night televised address to the nation, Mr. Jaafari said he did not want to impede the progress of the alliance. ""I cannot accept being a barricade or looking like a barricade,"" he said.Some officials speculated that the Shiites might have yielded under the threat that Sunni Arab, Kurdish and independent blocs would form a larger coalition to commandeer the right to pick a prime minister.But despite their shared distaste for Mr. Jaafari, the Kurds and Sunni Arabs have major divisions that would make any such alliance extraordinarily difficult. The Kurds, for instance, insist on seizing Kirkuk and displacing Arabs, mostly Sunnis, who were settled there under Saddam Hussein.Mahmoud Othman, a member of Parliament and senior official in the Kurdish political alliance, said it appeared that the leading Shiite clerics in Najaf, particularly Ayatollah Sistani, had forced Mr. Jaafari's hand.""Jaafari resisted as long as he could, but he reached the point where he couldn't resist any more because of the pressure he had from Najaf,"" Mr. Othman said.Shiite leaders met Thursday to deliberate, and said they planned to continue talks on Friday.The most likely possibility is that the bloc will choose another candidate from Mr. Jaafari's Dawa group, according to Khalid al-Atiya, an independent member of the bloc. Several days ago, Shiite leaders agreed that Dawa could nominate a candidate if it withdrew Mr. Jaafari's candidacy.In addition to Mr. Maliki and Mr. Adeeb, Haider al-Abadi, a top aide to Mr. Jaafari and a former minister of telecommunications under the Iraqi Governing Council, emerged as a potential candidate.Several leaders said the most viable candidate appeared to be Mr. Adeeb, though he is not as well-known as Mr. Maliki. ""I don't know much about him and a lot of people don't know much about him,"" said Mr. Pachachi, a secular Sunni Arab.Mr. Othman said Mr. Adeeb ""looks more acceptable to most people.""At the joint news conference, the mood was slightly more optimistic than in the recent political debate.""We think this is a remarkable change in the stand of Dr. Jaafari to solve this crisis, and the ball is now in the court of the United Iraqi Alliance,"" said Tariq al-Hashemi, the head of the largest Sunni bloc, the Iraqi Consensus Front.But away from the microphones, political leaders cautioned that other fights lay ahead, including a battle over an acceptable candidate to be National Assembly speaker.The first order of business for Parliament at its next session will likely be the selection of the speaker and his two deputies; approval will require an absolute majority. The post is expected to go to a Sunni Arab, and on Thursday, the Iraqi Consensus Front voted to nominate Mahmoud al-Mashhadani for the post, Mr. Mashhadani said in a telephone interview.But two senior Kurdish political officials said Mr. Mashhadani was not acceptable. ""We don't prefer him, we think he's very much ideological and extremist,"" said one of the officials, Mr. Othman. ""We prefer somebody more moderate.""Mr. Mashhadani was considered a compromise candidate by the Sunnis, who had wanted to put forward Mr. Hashemi. But the Shiites considered Mr. Hashemi too sectarian, and he bowed out several days ago.At the news conference, Mr. Hashemi said his willingness to step aside should encourage the Shiite alliance to move quickly, too. ""The candidates have to enjoy the agreement of all the political blocs that won in the elections, and for that reason I responded,"" he said.After the selection of a speaker, Parliament must elect a president and two vice presidents by a two-thirds vote, according to the Constitution. President Talabani is expected to retain his post, and the other two slots will go to a Shiite and a Sunni Arab.Mr. Mashhadani said the Sunni bloc nominated Mr. Hashemi on Thursday for one of the vice presidencies. Adel Abdul Mahdi, the Shiite politician who lost to Mr. Jaafari in the internal ballot, is expected to be the Shiite's vice presidential candidate.After that, the president has 15 days to ask the prime ministerial candidate to form a cabinet, and the prime minister in turn has 30 days to name the members. Each candidate needs approval by an absolute majority of Parliament.American and Iraqi officials say they hope the formation of a unified government will stem the sectarian violence that has bloodied Iraq, with a sharp increase in fatalities among civilians, police officers and soldiers in recent months.On Thursday, gunmen in camouflage in six pickup trucks stormed two bookstores in Baghdad and kidnapped six people, according to an official in the Interior Ministry. Seven bodies were also found around the capital, the official said.American and Iraqi security forces continued to come under attack on Thursday. An improvised bomb exploded near a police convoy in the Yarmouk neighborhood in Baghdad, killing a civilian and wounding four policemen, the Interior Ministry official said. An American military convoy in Baghdad was hit by a homemade bomb, wounding two soldiers and seriously damaging a tank, the official said.In Kirkuk, a convoy belonging to an electricity company traveling between Kirkuk and Tikrit was ambushed by insurgents firing machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, killing five people, all foreigners, and wounding three others, a police official in Kirkuk said.In Basra, a car bomb killed two civilians and wounded five others, including three traffic officers and a border guard, the police said.'"

"'06-04-21,'1','Naturally, the opinions issued by the three major proxy advisers are a matter of interest to Pfizer's board, its management and owners. But this is especially so now because the coming election at Pfizer will be subject to guidelines adopted by the company last year that require any director who receives less than 50 percent of the shares cast at the annual meeting to offer to resign from the board.The 2004 memo supporting Proxy Governance was written by Mr. McKinnell in his capacity as chairman of the Business Roundtable, a Washington-based lobbying group for corporate America. Through a spokesman, he declined to comment on it. The memo was supplied by a recipient who was concerned about its tenor; he was granted anonymity because he feared retribution from Pfizer.In it, Mr. McKinnell called on Roundtable members to help Proxy Governance ""thrive in the marketplace"" by using its services. ""We have all seen the increasingly hostile recommendations from existing proxy advisory firms,"" he wrote, ""who continue to promote narrow interests at the expense of long-term shareholder value."" Identifying a ""pressing need for a serious alternative,"" Mr. McKinnell continued, ""we are pleased to report on the creation of Proxy Governance Inc.""Founded in 2004, Proxy Governance describes itself as a new breed of advisory service, providing advice that is ""completely free of conflict"" and ""with the goal of truly building long-term shareholder value."" Its founder, Steven M. H. Wallman, was a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1994 to 1997; the firm is a unit of Foliofn, a financial services company.John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, said Mr. Wallman approached the organization in the early 1990's about starting a new proxy advisory firm. When he came back to them in 2004, they liked what they saw. ""It met our criteria of independent, conflict-free and increasing the competition in investment advisory services,"" he said.Mr. Wallman said that Mr. McKinnell's memo asking for support had no bearing on Proxy Governance's current or past opinions on Pfizer. The firm's analysts ""do whatever they thought was the right thing and I have given them complete free rein to do that,"" Mr. Wallman said. ""We don't have any conflicts; we don't provide consulting services; we don't provide services to short sellers; we don't do anything other than present our views or opinions.""Proxy Governance covers 3,000 United States companies. ""Instead of subscribing to a best-practices principle that should be applied to all companies, we look at individual firms and how they performed in making a voting recommendation,"" said Shirley Westcott, managing director for policy at the firm.In its Pfizer report, Proxy Governance concluded that the company's directors merited support from shareholders even though the pay awarded to Mr. McKinnell in recent years, including his pension benefit, exceeded that of the company's peers while its performance lagged theirs. Mr. McKinnell will receive $6.5 million a year after he retires.""The amount of pay per se is really not that far above that of peer companies,"" Ms. Westcott said. ""The issue, of course, is his pension payments. What we did here is we gave the company credit for the initiatives it has taken.""Those initiatives included removing the stock component of Pfizer executives' pay to calculate the company's pension payouts, and Pfizer's move to ask shareholders to approve future yearly pension payouts that exceed 100 percent of an executive's annual salary and bonus. ""They also did a very good job of disclosing their pension benefits,"" Ms. Westcott said, ""something very few companies did to date.""Neither of these actions persuaded either Institutional Shareholder Services or Glass Lewis to recommend shareholder support for Pfizer's entire board. I.S.S. advised owners to withhold votes from two directors: Dana G. Mead, chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Corporation, the university's board of trustees, and head of Pfizer's compensation committee; and George Lorch, a former chief executive of Armstrong Holdings, a maker of flooring and ceiling materials, who is also on the committee.Glass Lewis recommended that Pfizer shareholders withhold support for M. Anthony Burns, former chief executive of Ryder System Inc., a transportation company, because he headed Pfizer's compensation committee from 1995 to 2005. During those years, the committee was slow to address and identify the growing pension benefit that was accruing to Mr. McKinnell and other executives, Glass Lewis said.There are several relationships between Pfizer, the Business Roundtable and Proxy Governance. For example, William C. Steere Jr., Pfizer's chairman emeritus and one of its directors, is a member of Proxy Governance's policy council. The firm said that he did not participate in any matters involving Pfizer.In addition, the Business Roundtable, headed by Mr. McKinnell, was Proxy Governance's first subscriber, buying about 160 subscriptions to its service for its members. Subscriptions ranged in cost from a few hundred dollars a quarter to $35,000 a quarter, the firm said. Mr. Wallman declined to say how much the Roundtable paid but said the bulk subscriptions stopped last year.And, according to a public S.E.C. memorandum, James P. Melican, Proxy Governance's chairman until recently, represented the Business Roundtable at a private meeting with Cynthia A. Glassman, an S.E.C. commissioner, in October 2003, as the firm was being created. The Roundtable representatives attended the meeting to argue against an S.E.C. proposal that would have provided greater access to shareholders in the nomination of directors; the proposal subsequently died.Margaret M. Foran, Pfizer's corporate secretary and its vice president for corporate governance, joined Mr. Melican as a Roundtable representative at the meeting. Mr. Melican could not be reached for comment.One enthusiastic recipient of Mr. McKinnell's memo about Proxy Governance was Philip J. Purcell, then the chief executive of Morgan Stanley who was ousted from the firm last year. ""We should put your heads together to see how we can support and use this service"" he wrote in the memo's margin to three of his top lieutenants.Even with help from the Business Roundtable, Proxy Governance's parent company, Foliofn, appears to be struggling. In January, a venture capital firm that had invested $15 million in Foliofn reported that it had written its value down to zero.Correction: April 22, 2006, Saturday An article in Business Day yesterday about Proxy Governance Inc., which advises institutional shareholders on how to vote in board elections and other corporate matters, referred imprecisely to an investment in its parent company, Foliofn, by a venture capital firm. Although that firm did report in January 2006 that it had written down the investment to zero, that first occurred in September 2003.'"
"'06-04-21,'1','Henry Ford was captivated by the idea of Jewish financiers plotting to undermine the United States; he became a proselytizer for ""The Protocols"" in his newspaper, The Dearborn Independent. Hitler, an admirer of Ford, was introduced to ""The Protocols"" by the Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg, and cited it in ""Mein Kampf."" More than 23 editions of ""The Protocols"" were published by the Nazi party over 20 years.During the last half-century, it has also become a canonical text in the Islamic world. One edition on display here, printed in Pakistan in 1969, was presented by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia to state visitors in the 1970's, its jacket showing a snake, representing the Jews, wrapped around the crescent of Islam while casting its glance over the entire Eastern Hemisphere. Another edition is an Arabic translation of ""The Protocols"" that was posted on the Palestinian State Information Services Web site until protests led to its removal last year.Now ""The Protocols"" would presumably be affirmed with less embarrassment: the Palestinian Authority is presently controlled by the militant Islamist organization Hamas, whose 1988 covenant could almost be read as a rewrite of ""The Protocols."" ""Our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious,"" that covenant says. ""With their money, they took control of the world media, news agencies, the press, publishing houses, broadcasting stations and others,"" it declares of Jews.""They aim at undermining societies, destroying values, corrupting consciences, deteriorating character and annihilating Islam,"" it says, asserting that Jews were behind the French and Russian revolutions, the Freemasons, the Rotary Clubs, imperialism, the two world wars, the United Nations, the drug trade and alcoholism. It cites a source: ""Their plan is embodied in 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.' ""Unfortunately, this exhibition, organized by Daniel Greene, while illuminating as far as it goes, doesn't do more than briefly refer to that charter. It also only cursorily summarizes the perspective of the various editions of ""The Protocols"" on display. And the text of ""The Protocols"" itself can be read only on two pages of an open book.Evidence that ""The Protocols"" was forged is scarcely more detailed, revealed primarily in a wall-size reproduction of part of the 1921 Times of London exposé that demonstrated that the book was cribbed from an 1864 polemic by the French writer Maurice Joly attacking Napoleon III: ""Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu."" The words of Joly's villain, Machiavelli, were later put into the mouths of conspiratorial Jews.But what an opportunity was missed in not doing more with this exhibition!For the tale of how this volume was forged -- which only recently came to light with the release of Soviet-era files, suggesting that it was written by Mathieu Golovinski, a Russian exile living in France in 1898 -- is remarkable in itself. So are the peculiarities of its sources, which also include an 1868 novel, ""Biarritz"" by Hermann Goedsche, which describes a nocturnal meeting of rabbis in a Prague cemetery, where they discuss plans for world domination. So a royalist Russian used the fantastical imaginings of a German and the antiroyalist text of a Frenchman imitating the arguments of an Italian, in order to defame Jews.The text itself also demands more analysis. One reason for its resiliency despite its demonstrably faked origins is that it is not just another anti-Semitic tract. Its intellectual trappings reflect something profound about anti-Semitism itself.Conspiracy theorists abound in all arenas, of course, and there is surely something satisfying about seeing varied sources of villainy so swiftly click into place as manifestations of a single master plan. Advocates of ""The Protocols"" are undeterred by evidence that the book is forged: it reveals, they say, a higher truth.That truth, though, is not really about Jews. Reading the text itself (which can be found at ddickerson.igc.org/protocols.html), one is shocked not at its anti-Semitism, but at its knotty, pseudophilosophic assertions; ""The Protocols"" really is ersatz Machiavelli. It is astounding that something so difficult has been so appealing.""Men with bad instincts are more in number than the good,"" states its opening sally; they are ""beasts of prey"" who can only be governed by cunning. Their greatest delusion, asserts the purportedly Jewish narrator, is their growing belief in liberalism. But political freedom is a ""bait,"" being offered to them by Jews, who are using it to undermine the traditional order. Soon societies everywhere, the narrator says, will fall prey to the ""despotism of capital, which is entirely in our hands.""A catalog of threatening modernity is being boasted of: liberal rights proliferate, faith falters, commerce rules, citizens are seduced by ""corruption and luxury."" ""Think carefully of the successes we arranged for Darwinism, Marxism, Nietzscheism,"" the Jews in ""The Protocols"" say, and look what ""disintegrating"" effect these ideas have had. These Jews claim to be undermining the world with ""disenchantments"" in order to take it over.This forgery encapsulates the image of the cosmopolitan Jew as the unprincipled molder of modernity.But modernity and liberalism are never really meant seriously by these Jews; the ideas are manipulations, fabrications. In addition these Jews sound as if they could confirm Al Qaeda or Islamist movements in their indictments against the West. The Jews of ""The Protocols,"" in their determination to dissolve national boundaries in pursuit of power and profit, could also as easily be associated with globalization, inspiring anti-Americanism as much as anti-Semitism. ""The Protocols"" feeds into a wide variety of resentments and longings for a premodern world.But the really astonishing thing is this: These Jews, in secretly planning to overturn the very forces of liberalism and modernity they have just created are doing just what their anti-Semitic nemeses desire. That is not the only point of agreement. Look at the Jews' approach in ""The Protocols."" They believe in absolute power. They will brook no opposition. They will use the rights and values of liberalism to undermine it, exploiting its weaknesses. They will be patient and ruthless and unrelenting.Hitler once said he used similar techniques for similar ends. He did. So do the Islamists. If ""The Protocols"" has found such resonance among anti-Semites across the world, it is partly because, in its villainous Jews, they see images of what they yearn to be.""A Dangerous Lie: The Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" opens today at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.

"'06-04-21,'1','Paul D. Eaton, a retired two-star Army general who used to command the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Ga., and later helped train the new Iraqi military, said in an interview, ""I was stunned,"" when a Pentagon review did not call for enlarging the Army and Marines. General Eaton, who called for Mr. Rumsfeld's resignation in March, said, ""They failed to account for the contemporary operating environment.""While the conduct of the war has provoked the critics, tensions between officers and their civilian boss began long before Iraq. Mr. Rumsfeld's pursuit of his ""transformation"" agenda stirred some of it.So did the manner in which he executed it, viewed by many officers as overbearing. Calling himself ""genetically impatient,"" Mr. Rumsfeld gave a talk the day before the Sept. 11 attacks in which he said the Pentagon bureaucracy was a threat to national security.Douglas Macgregor, a retired Army colonel who has long argued that Army leaders were unimaginative and too cautious, recalls a Rumsfeld aide's jesting that the defense secretary thought the Army's problems could be solved by lining up 50 generals and gunning them down.Certainly, there are experts who have argued that the Pentagon has long been in need of change. Mr. Rumsfeld's agenda to reshape the military, in fact, has long been shared by President Bush.In a 1999 speech, Mr. Bush pledged to develop light, mobile and lethal units that could be quickly deployed. He vowed to appoint a secretary of defense who would change the military structure. Once in office, Mr. Bush decided that the strong-willed Mr. Rumsfeld was the man.The new secretary wasted no time promoting his program. He was enamored of missile defense and precision weapons. He was skeptical about the Army leadership, which he considered old-fashioned, wedded to heavy forces and slow to change. The Army was pursing its own version of transformation, but it fell short of what Mr. Rumsfeld had in mind.Some longstanding critics of the Army leadership felt they finally had an ally at the top with Mr. Rumsfeld in charge. But soon there was friction between the new defense secretary and the generals he viewed as Clinton holdovers. As the United States began to plan its Afghan operation, Gen. Hugh Shelton, an Army general who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when Mr. Rumsfeld first took up his post at the Pentagon, became concerned that Mr. Rumsfeld's transformation agenda would get a field test before the military was ready.Days before he retired, General Shelton ran into Maj. Gen. Dell Dailey, the two-star head of the Joint Special Operations Command, in the White House parking lot. The Afghan war plan depended heavily on Special Operations forces, and General Shelton warned that the military had to resist the defense secretary's push to pare forces. Lives and the success of the mission hung in the balance, he argued.Mr. Rumsfeld would later argue that the Afghan operation had been a major success as the United States toppled the Taliban and eliminated Al Qaeda's camps by relying on Special Operations forces, Afghan allies, air strikes -- and by avoiding the commitment of substantial ground forces. Critics, though, argued that the absence of adequate American soldiers had made it easier for Osama bin Laden to escape.By the time the Iraq war approached, Richard B. Myers, an Air Force general, had been installed as the new Joint Chiefs chairman. Mr. Rumsfeld's supporters considered General Myers and his eventual successor, Gen. Peter Pace of the Marine Corps, to be helpful in overcoming deeply entrenched institutional resistance to transformation.Critics say Mr. Rumsfeld discouraged dissent by elevating those who supported his program. ""He tended to surround himself with those that support his agenda,"" said Maj. Gen. John Batiste, former commander of First Infantry Division and one of the retired generals who has criticized Mr. Rumsfeld. ""He was involved with the selection of flag officers to an unprecedented level.""With his team in place, Mr. Rumsfeld summoned the senior military leadership to his Pentagon office in late 2001 to review the military's contingency plan for war with Iraq.As Greg Newbold, the retired three-star general who served as chief operations deputy for the Joint Chiefs, outlined the plan, which called for as many as 500,000 troops, it was clear that Mr. Rumsfeld was increasingly irritated. He said he did not see why more than 125,000 troops would be required.""My regret is that at the time I did not say, 'Mr. Secretary, if you try to put a number on a mission like this you may cause enormous mistakes,' "" General Newbold recalled in an interview. ""Give the military the task, give the military what you would like to see them do, and then let them come up with it. I was the junior military guy in the room, but I regret not saying it.""Former aides to Mr. Rumsfeld said he never told Gen. Tommy Franks, the head of the Central Command, how many troops to deploy. But Mr. Rumsfeld repeatedly asked why the force could not be smaller and deployed more quickly. He also planted ideas and sent papers -- a process his aides called ""suasion"" -- in line with his agenda. General Franks initially proposed a force of up to 385,000 troops. That number shrank as the war plan morphed from a version called the Generated Start, to the Running Start, to the Hybrid, to Cobra II. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who was an adviser to Mr. Rumsfeld, described the discussions between General Franks and the defense secretary as one of ""constant negotiation.""In a departure from typical practice, President Bush gave Mr. Rumsfeld and not the secretary of state responsibility for post-war Iraq. A month before the invasion, Mr. Rumsfeld outlined his philosophy in a speech called ""Beyond Nation Building."" By avoiding a large troop presence and major reconstruction, the United States would guard against the creation of a culture of dependence on the part of the Iraqis.Eleven days after that speech, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, appeared before Congress and was asked how many troops might be required to secure post-war Iraq. His response was several hundred thousand. On Mr. Rumsfeld's instruction, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz complained about the remark to Thomas E. White, the Army secretary, the next morning. General Shinseki, Mr. Wolfowitz said, had spoken out of turn and was off base. (Mr. White dug in his heels in support of the general and was fired by Mr. Rumsfeld soon after Baghdad fell.)For all of the controversy, General Shinseki's numbers were similar to those generated by the Central Command. General Franks had projected that the attack would begin with just a portion of the invasion force, which would grow to 250,000 troops by the time Saddam Hussein's force was defeated and the United States began to stabilize Iraq. There was, however, a subtle but significant difference. Secretary Rumsfeld hoped to off-ramp -- that is, cancel the deployment -- of some units if the Iraqi military's resistance crumbled, and he wanted to reduce the occupying force as quickly as possible.As the war unfolded, there were enough troops to defeat the Republican Guard and take the Iraqi capital. But as American forces advanced on Baghdad, Secretary Rumsfeld pressed the question of off-ramping the First Cavalry Division, which was the final division in the war plan. General Franks went along. Lt. Gen. David McKiernan, the chief allied land war commander, was unhappy about the move, but did not protest.The United States soon found there were not enough soldiers to control the borders, establish order in the capital or deprive the enemy of sanctuaries. The decision of L. Paul Bremer III, the head of the occupation authority, to disband the Iraq army only added to the deficit of forces. That decision was approved by Mr. Rumsfeld. Neither Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, nor the Joint Chiefs were consulted about the decision.For months, Mr. Rumsfeld and General Myers refrained from describing the resistance in Iraq as an insurgency. Finally, on July 16, 2003, Gen. John P. Abizaid, who succeeded General Franks at the Central Command, told a Pentagon news conference that the United States was dealing with a ""classical guerrilla-type campaign.""Some former generals say that General Franks and other military leaders bear responsibility for many of the miscalculations in Iraq. Gen. Jack Keane, the former acting Army chief of staff, said that the Bush administration's aversion to nation building was wrong for Iraq. But he faults the generals, including himself, for failing to develop a comprehensive plan for a potential insurgency.""The fact is that the Ba'athist insurgency surprised us and we had not developed a comprehensive option for dealing with this possibility,"" he said. ""This was not just an intelligence community failure, but also our failure as senior military leaders.""In an Op-Ed article last month in The New York Times, General Eaton wrote that another factor contributed to the problems: ""I have seen a climate of groupthink become dominant and a growing reluctance by experienced military men and civilians to challenge the notions of the senior leadership.""News Analysis Michael R. Gordon is the chief military correspondent for The New York Times.

"'06-04-21,'1','Eight months after Hurricane Katrina shattered American oil output in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest producer in the region, Royal Dutch Shell, said yesterday that it had completed repairs on its Mars platform and would resume production ahead of schedule.Mars, the biggest offshore structure in the gulf, was among the hardest hit by the storm that struck on Aug. 29. Production should start up again next month, Shell said, and the Mars platform is expected to return to producing 140,000 barrels of oil and natural gas a day, its level before the storm, by the end of June. Initially, the company estimated that repairs might last well into the second half of the year.Shell's announcement came as oil futures rose in New York above $70 a barrel this week, and might provide the market with a small measure of comfort that large quantities of oil would soon be returning. Mars accounts for about 5 percent of the Gulf of Mexico's output.Crude oil for May delivery settled at $71.95 yesterday, down 22 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It touched a high of $72.40 a barrel earlier in the day, exceeding an intraday mark of $70.85 reached after Hurricane Katrina.The Mars platform was directly in the path of the storm and suffered extensive damage from 80-foot waves driven by winds with speeds up to 175 mile an hour. A 1,000-ton drilling rig on top of the platform was toppled, shattering the upper decks and living quarters and forcing Shell to close the platform.'"
"'06-04-21,'1','Increasing gasoline prices have put Republicans on the defensive at a time when they are counting on the economy to help offset the myriad other problems they face, starting with the Iraq war.Republicans say they have spent years advocating policies that would reduce the reliance on imported oil, largely by promoting more domestic energy production, and they point to the energy bill that President Bush signed last August as a step in that direction. They said that the law encouraged conservation and greater use of ethanol in gasoline and that it would have done more for domestic oil supplies if Democrats had not fought so hard against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.Mr. Bush tried to get ahead of the issue in January in his State of the Union address, saying that the nation is addicted to oil and urging steps to reduce reliance on energy imports.The White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill have worked closely together for months on a campaign to highlight what they say is the strength of the economy, partly to offset what administration officials acknowledge are the negative psychological effects of high oil and gasoline prices on consumers. A Washington Post/ABC News poll this week found that 59 percent of Americans rated the economy ""not good"" or ""poor,"" despite solid economic growth and declining unemployment.""The better we are at getting out the overall message that the economy is growing and the reasons behind it, the better we'll be able to deflect the silly political attacks from the Democrats,"" said Brian Nick, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Democrats are tailoring campaign messages to pierce any economic good news by focusing on other aspects of the energy law, chiefly the subsidies worth nearly $15 billion for gas and oil companies and the bill's lack of a more muscular approach to conserve energy and reduce the dependence on foreign oil.While Democrats are eagerly laying blame for the situation on the Republicans, they did little to advance energy measures in eight years under President Bill Clinton. Democrats remain split to some degree over how to proceed, but in general favor greater investment in ""clean fuel"" technologies, more incentives for driving fuel-efficient vehicles and stronger steps toward reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Those positions were included in a measure sponsored last year by more than 30 Democratic House members who opposed the Republican version of the energy bill. Even so, 75 Democrats in the House and 25 in the Senate voted with the Republicans to pass Mr. Bush's bill.The recommendations of the memorandum to Democratic candidates include holding a campaign event at a gas station ""where you call for a real commitment to bringing down gas prices and pledge that, as a member of Congress, you will fight for families in your district, not the oil and gas executives for which the Republican Congress has fought so hard.""A survey by Public Agenda, a nonpartisan research organization, in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs magazine suggests that the message could not be more timely. The survey said voters now believed that fears over energy independence rivaled the Iraq war as the leading foreign policy issue for the nation.Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of Public Agenda, said the survey found that 90 percent of Americans viewed the lack of energy independence as a risk to security, that 88 percent said problems abroad were endangering supplies and increasing prices and that 85 percent believed that the federal government could do something if it tried.In a similar survey six months earlier, Mr. Yankelovich said, just Iraq generated those levels of concern.""If Democrats can make an explicit connection that Senator So-and-so could have done more but didn't, the message will resonate among voters,"" he said. ""This has really become a hot-button issue.""If voter anger stays high, Democrats, as the minority party, stand to benefit most, said Amy Walter, a political analyst for The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter.""Angry voters are motivated voters,"" Ms. Walter said. ""If the message in November is one of change, this is helping to make the case for Democrats.""The spotlight on energy also provides environmentalists and liberals generally opportunities to make broader points. Amid a blaze of publicity, former Vice President Al Gore is about to release a documentary about global warming that urges, among other points, more aggressive steps to cut tailpipe emissions.Even as high gasoline prices create an incentive to conserve -- something environmentalists have sought to achieve through proposals like higher taxes on energy -- the impact of high-priced gas hits hard in suburban and rural districts, where families are forced to drive greater distances for routine needs. Many of those regions are predominantly Republican.In Minnesota, the leading Republican candidate for the open Senate seat, Representative Mark Kennedy, a three-term congressman, said he also heard voters' anger and frustration.Reflecting the dangers facing his party over fuel costs, Mr. Kennedy said he told voters that the energy bill was not enough and pointed out that he is a co-sponsor, with Representative Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, of a bill that calls for taking back tax credits from energy companies and doubling investments in ethanol and other renewable fuels.'"

"'06-04-22,'0','They said the current president, Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, would retain his job, while a top Sunni Arab leader, Mahmoud Mashhadani, was expected to become speaker despite concerns from some Kurds and Shiites who sought someone more moderate.If legislators make the selections formal at Saturday's Assembly session, it will signal a turnabout in the political process from just a few days ago, when Mr. Jaafari, with the support of Moktada al-Sadr, the firebrand Shiite cleric, had resolutely refused to give up his job despite growing pressure from Sunnis, Kurds, some Shiites and the United States.Even so, more difficult political fights may remain before a new government is formed. Mr. Maliki will have to put together a cabinet that includes officials overseeing powerful ministries, including interior, defense, finance and oil.For Sunnis, perhaps the most divisive issue is the Interior Ministry, which includes the police and is now run by a hard-line Shiite with close ties to Iran. Sunnis say men wearing police uniforms have accounted for large numbers of sectarian tortures and murders, where men are arrested but their bodies are found days later -- sometimes with holes drilled in their head or limbs.""Today was a major positive, but there are tough days ahead, especially with regard to the selection of ministers,"" Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador to Iraq, said in an interview. He said he told Mr. Maliki on Friday of the importance of independent ministers, and of the need to eliminate militias from the Iraqi security forces and to scale back the Shiite-backed program that bars former Baathists from many jobs in the Iraqi government and institutions.""I met with him for a long time today and he was very positive,"" Mr. Khalilzad said.Born in 1950 in Hindiya, between the cities of Karbala and Hilla, Mr. Maliki was educated in Iraqi Kurdistan and was exiled to Iran after Mr. Hussein vowed to eliminate leaders of the Islamic Dawa Party. Mr. Maliki later traveled to Syria and returned to Iraq after the American invasion three years ago.""He is very close to Jaafari,"" said the acting Assembly speaker, Adnan Pachachi. ""He is known for his tough stands on issues like the Baathists and terrorism. He is an elegant speaker and is very forceful in espousing his views.""A Western diplomat in Baghdad said a major difference between Mr. Jaafari, who is also a Dawa member, and Mr. Maliki was that Mr. Maliki appeared to be more ""competent.""""The overall impression one has for him from his experience and background is that he's a strong leader and that he will be able to do a better job,"" the diplomat said. ""Mr. Jaafari was tested and demonstrated that he was not able to be an effective leader, but Mr. Maliki is a strong leader and is tough minded.""The diplomat also said Sunni leaders took some comfort in knowing that Mr. Maliki had fewer ties to Iran than some Shiite leaders did, including his top rival for the prime minister's job, Ali al-Adeeb, the son of an Iranian.Earlier this year Mr. Jaafari won a narrow vote within the Shiite alliance to continue as the prime minister after the December parliamentary elections. But other political parties objected, accusing him of weak and ineffective leadership and an inability to deal with growing sectarian tensions and an entrenched insurgency. After resisting pressure to give up his job, Mr. Jaafari suddenly reversed himself on Thursday and agreed to let the Shiite alliance select another nominee for prime minister.Just two days ago, Kurdish officials and some Sunni Arab leaders had expressed a preference for Mr. Adeeb, the other candidate for prime minister, describing Mr. Maliki as too sectarian and inflexible to win wide support among political blocs.But by Friday afternoon it was clear that Mr. Maliki would emerge the nominee of the alliance, which controls nearly half the seats in the Assembly. By the time the seven parties within the Shiite alliance were polled on Friday night, Mr. Maliki had won support all of them except for the Fadilah Party, said Hammam Hamoudi, a senior official in the Shiite alliance. Those supporters included Mr. Sadr, who is fearful of backing politicians with close ties to Tehran.The need to avoid another drawn-out battle over the prime minister's job, and the hope that a new government could help stabilize the country, appeared to be significant factors in the decision by Kurdish and Sunni Arab leaders to support Mr. Maliki.""We don't have many options, and we would like to push the political process forward,"" said Tariq al-Hashemi, leader of the Iraqi Consensus Front, the largest Sunni Arab group, on Friday. ""We will cooperate with him and we will support him tomorrow.""In an interview Friday night, Mahmoud Othman, a senior member of the Kurdish political alliance, said of Mr. Maliki, ""We have no objection to him and we wish him success."" He also said the Kurds would support Mr. Mashhadani. The day before, Mr. Othman had described Mr. Mashhadani as an ""extremist"" not suitable to become speaker.Bickering political factions could conceivably raise objections to any nominee, Mr. Othman explained, but he said that now there was ""no time"" for that because of Iraq's current condition. ""This needs to move forward, so we had no objection,"" he said.In addition to Mr. Maliki, Mr. Talabani and Mr. Mashhadani, four other leaders are said to be part of a rough consensus among the major political blocs. The two vice presidents are expected to be Mr. Hashemi and Adel Abdul Mahdi, aShiite who narrowly lost the nomination for prime minister to Mr. Jaafari earlier this year. Another Shiite official, Khalid al-Attiya, and a Kurd, Aref Tayfour, are also expected to become deputy assembly speakers.Insurgents killed more than 20 Iraqis on Friday, including six Iraqi soldiers in Bayji, north of Baghdad, The Associated Press reported. The American military also said that a marine was fatally wounded in combat in Anbar Province on Thursday.'"
"'06-04-22,'0','WASHINGTON, April 21 - A former top official of the Central Intelligence Agency has accused the Bush administration of ignoring intelligence assessments about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs in the months leading up to the Iraq war.Tyler Drumheller, the former head of the C.I.A.'s European operations, is the second C.I.A. veteran in recent weeks to attack the White House's handling of prewar intelligence. The criticism comes as the administration is already facing complaints from retired generals who have criticized the decision to go to war in Iraq and charged that civilian policy makers at the Pentagon ignored the advice of uniformed officers.In an interview on the CBS News television program ""60 Minutes"" that will be broadcast Sunday evening, Mr. Drumheller said that White House officials had repeatedly ignored the intelligence community's assessments about the state of Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs. Mr. Drumheller declined an interview request on Friday, citing an agreement with CBS that he not make public comments until the television interview is shown. A CBS news release issued on Friday included excerpts from the interview.According to the release, Mr. Drumheller cited one instance in which George J. Tenet, then the director of central intelligence, told President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney that a paid agent in Saddam Hussein's inner circle, Foreign Minister Naji Sabri, had reported that Iraq had no active programs for weapons of mass destruction.Three days later, according to Mr. Drumheller's account, the White House told C.I.A. officials that it was proceeding with plans to go to war.'"
"'06-04-22,'0','Microsoft plans to argue that events in the technology industry since 2004 prove that regulators' concerns are unwarranted. The commission plans to contend that its concerns have been validated.If the company succeeds in persuading Judge Bo Vesterdorf, the president of the Court of First Instance, and his 12 fellow judges that its behavior has not harmed competition, it will be able to continue the profitable strategy of bundling new software features into its ubiquitous Windows operating system.""At issue is whether companies can improve their products by developing new features,"" Microsoft said in a statement.Two years ago, the commission concluded that bundling Media Player, the company's music- and video- playing program, into Windows put rival players, like Real Player, made by RealNetworks, and Quicktime, made by Apple, at a competitive disadvantage. It ordered the company to sell a second version of Windows without Media Player.Next week, Microsoft will cite Apple's success with its iPod portable music player and iTunes, its music portal on the Internet, as proof that competition and innovation are buoyant in this part of the software market.""The commission's theory was that the market would tip irreversibly in Microsoft's favor if Media Player remained integrated in the operating system, but there's no evidence of this happening,"" said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group that plans to support Microsoft in court next week.""The market is thriving,"" he said. ""Apple is doing very well and there's a new media player called Flash, owned by software maker Adobe, which has a bigger market share than both Microsoft's Media Player and Quicktime,"" he said. ""The market evidence disproves the foundation of the commission's theory.""The commission was unavailable to comment. Thomas Vinje, who represents a software trade group made up of some of Microsoft's rivals, including Oracle and Sun Microsystems, dismissed Microsoft's interpretation of the facts.Apple's strength in the music- downloading market is not a result of its Quicktime player but of the runaway success of its iPod portable music player and its iTunes online music store, said Mr. Vinje, a partner in the Brussels office of the law firm of Clifford Chance.""The arrival of iTunes hasn't made any difference to the ability of media players such as Real Player to penetrate the market,"" said Mr. Vinje, who will take part in next week's hearing.He said the media-playing market had already tipped in Microsoft's favor in the same way the Internet browser market did when Microsoft's Internet Explorer crushed the rival Netscape.""Market developments have validated the commission's concerns,"" Mr. Vinje said. ""It is vital that the court confirms the Media Player decision because it provides a legal precedent that could be used to prevent Microsoft continuing its abusive bundling practices in the future.""The need for such a precedent is urgent, he said, because Microsoft plans to bundle several new features into its next generation of Windows, called Vista, which is scheduled to be introduced at the beginning of next year.Microsoft will also argue that market developments since the 2004 antitrust ruling undermine the portion of the case that concerns the ability of rival software companies to make programs that work smoothly with Windows, which runs more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers.The commission ordered Microsoft to offer licenses to rivals for details about Windows to allow them to make server software that operates properly with Windows. It concluded that Microsoft was giving an unfair advantage to its own server software, which runs smoothly when connecting computers in a network.The interoperability portion of the case lies on the border between competition law and intellectual property law, said the person familiar with Microsoft's thinking.The court has said that compulsory licensing of a firm's intellectual property can be justified only when the information concerned is indispensable to the whole market.""The Linux market is thriving, which shows that the information the commission wanted Microsoft to reveal is not indispensable,"" Mr. Zuck said. In addition, ordering Microsoft to license out this information ""undermines intellectual property protection in Europe,"" he said.Microsoft's opponents will argue that the information is vital to create a level playing field for rivals in the server software market, and that the compulsory licensing order does not infringe on any of Microsoft's intellectual property rights.""Microsoft only started mentioning intellectual property rights once it was clear it would lose the case two years ago,"" Mr. Vinje said. ""It's an after-the-facts strategy, and I hope the judge will see it for what it is.""""There is healthy competition and interoperability in all the markets covered in this case, and we will bring those facts to the court next week,"" Microsoft said in a statement.'"
"'06-04-22,'0','While offsets do not actually eliminate pollution, they do enable groups like Carbonfund.org to use the money to stimulate the production of clean electricity, which is more costly than burning coal or oil. An independent organization ensures that the money supports real projects. Some groups subsidize existing power production; others finance the building of new wind turbines or solar collectors.In the two years since they appeared, such voluntary offset programs have become increasingly popular. But it is not clear whether they actually do any good, or are just one more way for Americans to feel good about doing things that pollute the atmosphere.Take Biff Cuthbert. Running an organic clam farm for a few years taught him all about being green. But when he recently needed a new vehicle to haul musical equipment for his folk band, as well as his two Akita dogs, Mr. Cuthbert ignored his environmental conscience and bought a cream-colored 2004 Land Rover, which gets 12 miles to the gallon.Feeling a pang of conscience about driving such a gas-guzzler, Mr. Cuthbert paid $79.95 to Terrapass.com, a group that helps finance non-polluting solar, wind and methane-driven energy projects. In exchange, he got a sticker for his windshield verifying that he is offsetting some of the 16,766 pounds of carbon dioxide his Land Rover will emit this year.""It rounds the edges off of the guilt a little bit, I guess,"" said Mr. Cuthbert, 62, of Guilford, Conn. ""It's a little like having your cake and eating it too,"" Mr. Cuthbert said.Web sites like terrapass.com, carbonfund.org, nativeenergy.com and self.org focus on automobile emissions because drivers can become aware of their carbon footprint every time they fill up. An average car produces about 10,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.Tom Arnold, one of the founders of Terrapass, a carbon-offset seller that, unlike most others, actually intends to make a profit, said that just as in the dawn of recycling a generation ago, the idea of carbon offsetting is being embraced at first by ""greenies"" who already plant trees, eat organic foods and buy fuel-efficient cars. As these environmentalists accept the altruistic good of doing something for the planet that will not immediately benefit them, they hope to spread the ideal of living a ""carbon-neutral"" life to nonbelievers.Carbon offsets for power plants are already traded at an exchange in Chicago and will be part of a regional pact that New York and seven other northeastern states have formed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The Rockefeller Brothers Fund bought offsets to cover the amount of pollution produced by all 1,479 people who attended conferences at its Pocantico Conference Center in Westchester County last year. Ben & Jerry's buys enough offsets to cover its manufacturing and retail operations, and even the Rolling Stones have bought offsets to make their concerts carbon neutral. The whole idea is to cap, and eventually reduce, the amount of greenhouse gases produced in the United States. But with gasoline prices nearing $3 a gallon, getting people to shell out even more to drive can be easier said than done.Take the Gormans of Stamford, Conn., a family of self-professed environmentalists. Cynthia Gorman, 52, works for a transportation safety company in New Rochelle, N.Y., and commutes the 20 miles each way in her dark green 2001 Toyota Prius hybrid. A dedicated recycler, she said she buys a carbon offset from Terrapass every year because driving the hybrid on the highway ""only gets maybe 42 miles per gallon."" Hybrids are more efficient in the city, where their electric motors take over.But when Ms. Gorman pulls back into the driveway of her Stamford home, she parks her Prius, with its Less Gs license plates, next to her husband Tony's dark green 2000 Dodge Durango, an S.U.V. that gets 13 miles per gallon, if that.""For all that I'm doing, he's screwing up everything,"" Ms. Gorman said. Mr. Gorman does not try to hide his responsibility. He is a hunter, and a reggae producer, and he needs the S.U.V. to haul things. His license plate reads ""Ire Mon"" -- a reggae singer's way of saying ""It's O.K.""--which is how he feels about his choice of wheels.Mr. Gorman said that his wife sent him Web information about carbon offsets a while ago but that he did not understand what it was about and just let it fall through the cracks.Mr. Gorman said he would probably buy his own pass at some point, but he worried that this green guilt thing could go too far. ""It can really get you so depressed that you never leave the house,"" he said. ""Look, sometimes you have to make a compromise. Yeah, I'm an environmentalist, but I need that vehicle.""A few days ago, Ms. Gorman took the decision out of his hands and bought a Terrapass for his Durango.People who run offset programs insist that while guilt is part of the motivation for those who join, the movement really is more about a way of living. ""What we're about is getting folks to live a net zero climate-neutral lifestyle,"" said Tom Boucher, president of Native Energy, which helps build wind turbines on Indian lands.Ann C. Seligman, 45, lives in Manhattan and owns a 2004 Prius, so her ""carbon footprint"" is already small. Nonetheless, her husband, Michael, gave her a $99 carbon pass from www.carbonfund.org for her birthday. ""We live in a basement apartment, not far from the East River, so global warming may come back to haunt us,"" she said.Charles R. Church, 65, a retired lawyer in Manhattan, pays for a Native Energy $6-a-month pass even though he uses public transportation and rarely takes his 2002 Volvo station wagon out of its garage.""The threat of global warming is becoming part of the zeitgeist and I'm happy about that,"" Mr. Church said. Offsetting his carbon footprint does not cost much and does not take much effort, he said, adding, ""It just strikes me as the right thing to do.""'"
"'06-04-22,'0','The dismissal was announced Thursday at the C.I.A. in an e-mail message sent by Porter J. Goss, the agency's director, who has made the effort to stop unauthorized disclosure of secrets a priority. News of the dismissal was first reported Friday by MSNBC.Ms. McCarthy's departure followed an internal investigation by the C.I.A.'s Security Center, as part of an intensified effort that began in January to scrutinize employees who had access to particularly classified information. She was given a polygraph examination, confronted about answers given to the polygraph examiner and confessed, the government officials said. On Thursday, she was stripped of her security clearance and escorted out of C.I.A. headquarters. Ms. McCarthy did not reply Friday evening to messages left by e-mail and telephone.""A C.I.A. officer has been fired for unauthorized contact with the media and for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information,"" said a C.I.A. spokesman, Paul Gimigliano. ""This is a violation of the secrecy agreement that is the condition of employment with C.I.A. The officer has acknowledged the contact and the disclosures.""Mr. Gimigliano said the Privacy Act prohibited him from identifying the employee.Intelligence officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the dismissal resulted from ""a pattern of conduct"" and not from a single leak, but that the case involved in part information about secret C.I.A. detention centers that was given to The Washington Post.Ms. McCarthy's departure was another unsettling jolt for the C.I.A., battered in recent years over faulty prewar intelligence in Iraq, waves of senior echelon departures after the appointment of Mr. Goss as director and the diminished standing of the agency under the reorganization of the country's intelligence agencies.The C.I.A.'s inquiry focused in part on identifying Ms. McCarthy's role in supplying information for a Nov. 2, 2005, article in The Post by Dana Priest, a national security reporter. The article reported that the intelligence agency was sending terror suspects to clandestine detention centers in several countries, including sites in Eastern Europe.Leonard Downie Jr., The Post's executive editor, said on its Web site that he could not comment on the firing because he did not know the details. ""As a general principle,"" he said, ""obviously I am opposed to criminalizing the dissemination of government information to the press.""Eric C. Grant, a spokesman for the newspaper, would not address whether any C.I.A. employee was a source for the secret prison articles, but said, ""No Post reporter has been subpoenaed or talked to investigators in connection with this matter.""The disclosures about the prisons provoked an outcry among European allies and set off protests among Democrats in Congress. The leak prompted the C.I.A. to send a criminal referral to the Justice Department. Lawyers at the Justice Department were notified of Ms. McCarthy's dismissal, but no new referral was issued, law enforcement officials said. They said that they would review the case, but that her termination could mean she would be spared criminal prosecution.In January, current and former government officials said, Mr. Goss ordered polygraphs for intelligence officers who knew about certain ""compartmented"" programs, including the secret detention centers for terrorist suspects. Polygraphs are routinely given to agency employees at least every five years, but special polygraphs can be ordered when a security breach is suspected.The results of such exams are regarded as important indicators of deception among some intelligence officials. But they are not admissible as evidence in court -- and the C.I.A.'s reliance on the polygraph in Ms. McCarthy's case could make it more difficult for the government to prosecute her.""This was a very aggressive internal investigation,"" said one former C.I.A. officer with more than 20 years' experience. ""Goss was determined to find the source of the secret-jails story.""With the encouragement of the White House and some Republicans in Congress, Mr. Goss has repeatedly spoken out against leaks, saying foreign intelligence officials had asked him whether his agency was incapable of keeping secrets.In February, Mr. Goss told the Senate Intelligence Committee that ""the damage has been very severe to our capabilities to carry out our mission."" He said it was his hope ""that we will witness a grand jury investigation with reporters present being asked to reveal who is leaking this information.""""I believe the safety of this nation and the people of this country deserves nothing less,"" he said.Ms. McCarthy has been a well-known figure in intelligence circles. She began her career at the agency as an analyst and then was a manager in the intelligence directorate, working at the African and Latin America desks, according to a biography by the strategic studies center. With an advanced degree from the University of Minnesota, she has taught, written a book on the Gold Coast and was director of the social science data archive at Yale University.Public records show that Ms. McCarthy contributed $2,000 in 2004 to the presidential campaign of John Kerry, the Democratic nominee.Republican lawmakers praised the C.I.A. effort. Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, ""I am pleased that the Central Intelligence Agency has identified the source of certain unauthorized disclosures, and I hope that the agency, and the community as a whole, will continue to vigorously investigate other outstanding leak cases.""Several former intelligence officials -- who were granted anonymity after requesting it for what they said were obvious reasons under the circumstances -- were divided over the likely effect of the dismissal on morale. One veteran said the firing would not be well-received coming so soon after the disclosure of grand jury testimony by Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff that President Bush in 2003 approved the leak of portions of a secret national intelligence estimate on Iraqi weapons.""It's a terrible situation when the president approves the leak of a highly classified N.I.E., and people at the agency see management as so disastrous that they feel compelled to talk to the press,"" said one former C.I.A. officer with extensive overseas experience.But another official, whose experience was at headquarters, said most employees would approve Mr. Goss's action. ""I think for the vast majority of people this will be good for morale,"" the official said. ""People didn't like some of their colleagues deciding for themselves what secrets should be in The Washington Post or The New York Times.""Paul R. Pillar, who was the agency's senior analyst for the Middle East until he retired late last year, said: ""Classified information is classified information. It's not to be leaked. It's not to be divulged."" He has recently criticized the Bush administration's handling of prewar intelligence about Saddam Hussein's unconventional weapons programs.'"
"'06-04-22,'0','Measuring return on investment is almost impossible, but companies with such plans seem as enthusiastic as any sabbatical taker. They discount fears that those taking leave will use the time to find other employment.""A lot of times, people think it's just for the employee, but it is a tremendous advantage that we get as a company,"" said Richard Floersch, chief people officer and executive vice president for worldwide human resources at McDonald's. ""It's re-energizing that lasts more than a day. Depending on what they do while they are gone, they come back even more skilled and talented than when they left.""McDonald's program began in the 1960's and provides eight weeks of paid time off, in addition to vacation, after every decade of work. All full-time employees are eligible as well as some at the restaurant level. A leave taker's job may be filled by someone with lesser experience, so the company can evaluate people in new positions without committing to promotions.""There are no senior executives who do not appreciate the critical importance of keeping your best people motivated and energized,"" said Hugh Simons, chief financial officer for the Boston Consulting Group, which offers sabbaticals to partners every five years.Some programs began as a response to the tight job market in the 1990's, though only a handful of companies seem to have pulled back when the economy tightened. Last year, 23 percent of companies offered sabbaticals -- 17 percent unpaid, 6 percent paid -- according to the Society for Human Resource Management. That number has held fairly steady since 1997, when the group started measuring sabbaticals.A spokesman, Frank Scanlan, predicted that the numbers could gradually increase as companies seek to retain baby boomers who are approaching retirement age and want time off but do not want to sever ties to employers. He said organizations must be cognizant of that, noting it is less expensive to retain an employee than to recruit a new one.Even so, Carol Evans, president and chief executive of Working Mother Media, said that while the issue seems to be coming up more, sabbatical programs are beyond the reach of most American companies.In addition to keeping employees productive and preventing burnout, sabbaticals can also help companies keep their most valued employees in slow times. Rather than lay them off, a top performer may receive reduced pay and a sabbatical until business picks up and he or she can resume full salary, said Donna Klein, president of Corporate Voices for Working Families.""Companies find they have to be more strategic in the way they make decisions about manpower allocation and staff,"" Ms. Klein said.The printing company Quad/Graphics started its program in 1999. Full-time employees who have been with the company for 25 years are eligible for four weeks with pay. The program was created to help longtime employees re-examine their commitment to the company, decide if they want to do something else or transition into retirement. So far, 60 of 12,000 employees at Quad/Graphics have taken the leave.John Lill, a 57-year-old manager in Quad's direct marketing group, and his wife traveled to Italy and found relatives in September 2005. He has been with Quad for 26 years and said his adjustment back was easy.""A week's vacation, you have a pile of messages and e-mail, and you just have to get into it,"" he said. ""With my contacts knowing I'd be gone for a month, it wasn't as hectic as being away for even a week.""Besides, he added, ""living out of a suitcase for a month is wonderful, but I wanted to get back to a stable routine, and I came back completely energized.""Some companies require relatively few years of service but are pickier in how they allow employees to spend their time. The outdoor clothing company Timberland, for example, began its program in 2002, allowing employees who had been with the company for three years to apply for a three- to six-month paid sabbatical with a nonprofit group of their choice; the employee must have had a prior relationship with the group. Six employees so far have taken advantage of the program. This year, Timberland will reduce the requirement to just one year of full-time employment.Rose Stanley, benefits manager at WorldatWork, a professional association for compensation, benefits and work-life practitioners, said that since time had become the new currency, employees value days off as much as or more than dollars.""Companies are starting to see that there are benefits to offering their employees time,"" Ms. Stanley said. ""As they begin to discover and train employees -- managers, especially -- to value that and to see the benefit to that, then they can see how it comes back to them with creativity, rejuvenation and loyalty.""Martha Barber, a 52-year-old partner at the law firm of Alston & Bird, took three months and rented a furnished condo on the ocean at Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla., in early 2005.""I lived there with nothing in mind but to shut out the noise, to get away from our crazy multitasking ultra-scheduled lives,"" said Ms. Barber, who lives in Charlotte, N.C. For three months, she did not read a newspaper, watch TV news or check her BlackBerry. ""I essentially shut it all out.""Since 1986, her law firm has made sabbaticals available to its 300 or so partners who have been with the firm for five years. Not including vacation, those in their 30's get an additional month, with an extra month coming each decade thereafter. Partners in their 60's can earn up to four extra months off, plus vacation, per decade. Ben F. Johnson, managing partner, said the firm, which is based in Atlanta, benefited from sabbaticals because they made executives work together.""It encourages partners to develop groups of people who can attend to the client's needs when they are not going to be present,"" he said.'"
"'06-04-22,'0','CORPORATE BOOM -- Companies as diverse as International Business Machines, United Parcel Service, Google, Wells Fargo and Pepsi Bottling all reported better-than-expected profits in the first quarter, affirming other signs of strong economic growth. As the numbers rolled in, the Dow Jones industrial average rose to a six-year high.Even General Motors posted encouraging results, reducing its loss in the first quarter to $323 million from $1.25 billion in the period last year. The year-ago loss, originally $1.1 billion, was restated recently, along with G.M.'s loss for all of 2005.The news was not so good at another manufacturing titan, Ford. It said it lost $1.19 billion in the first quarter, dragged down by a $2.9 billion loss in its North American operation, as sales flagged and its latest restructuring effort began. It was Ford's worst quarter since 2001.Companies scheduled to report earnings next week include AT&T, Lockheed Martin and Microsoft.REGULATION ROLLBACK -- An advisory committee appointed by the Securities and Exchange Commission has concluded that thousands of smaller companies should be exempted from significant parts of a four-year-old law that imposed new auditing rules.The committee has concluded that the law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is too expensive for small businesses. It will propose exempting publicly traded companies with market capitalizations of less than $787 million; that would exclude about four-fifths of companies whose shares trade on public stock markets.The change has been championed by the United States Chamber of Commerce and other business groups that have sensed a changing climate in Washington. The law, which has forced companies to disclose hundreds of examples of serious accounting and auditing problems, was adopted in 2002 after the scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, HealthSouth, Qwest and other companies.The committee is expected to present its recommendation to the full S.E.C. on Monday.DAY IN COURT -- Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron, got a chance to tell his side of the story behind the collapse of the company, which was one of the country's biggest before an accounting scandal in 2001.Under often hostile questioning by prosecutors, Mr. Skilling staunchly maintained his innocence and avoided major gaffes. But he also revealed to the jury that he had steered his employees to tell him what he wanted to hear rather than the unvarnished truth about how the company really operated.In 2001, for example, while discussing Enron's role in California's newly deregulated electricity market, he said to an Enron lawyer ""We're pure as the driven snow, right?"" When the lawyer told him about strategies that traders had used, many of them later found to have served to manipulate the market. ""O.K.,"" Mr. Skilling said. ""So we're as pure as the driven snow?""Enron's other former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, is scheduled to take the stand on Monday.SETTLING UP -- J. P. Morgan Chase agreed to pay $425 million to settle its part of a class-action lawsuit that contends dozens of banks cheated investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars from initial public offerings during the 1990's market boom. Of 55 investment banks named as defendants, J. P. Morgan is the first to settle, and its agreement may prompt other Wall Street firms to follow.

"'06-04-22,'0','""This is really like cattle moving around a pasture, grazing on the greenest part of the grass,"" said Peter Bicks, a defense lawyer at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. ""The greenest part of the pasture now appears to be, in the post-Vioxx era, drugs.""The suits are keeping the pharmaceutical industry on the defensive at a time when drug makers are trying to rebuild their image amid public anger over prescription drug prices and the fact that some companies did not disclose negative information from clinical trials during the 1990's.Lawsuits over prescription drugs carry perhaps the highest stakes of all product liability litigation, lawyers on each side say. Plaintiffs' lawyers may spend years and millions of dollars to prepare for a single trial, but a victory can come with a verdict of $10 million or more.To gain leverage against the companies, trial lawyers aim to build ""inventories"" of hundreds or thousands of plaintiffs that they can settle simultaneously for hundreds of millions of dollars.Last year, Eli Lilly agreed to spend $700 million to settle 8,000 lawsuits over Zyprexa, a drug for schizophrenia that causes severe weight gain in many patients. Wyeth has spent $15 billion since 1998 to resolve lawsuits over its fen-phen diet-drug combination, which can cause severe heart problems and is no longer sold. And Wall Street analysts estimate that Merck may eventually have to pay $10 billion to $50 billion to end the litigation over Vioxx, which has been linked to heart attacks and strokes.While Fosamax, Seroquel, Ortho-Evra and Prempro are still being sold, clinical trials or reports to the Food and Drug Administration have linked them to serious side effects. Fosamax has been associated with severe jaw decay; Seroquel with weight gain, which raises the risk of diabetes; Ortho-Evra with blood clots, which can cause strokes; and Prempro with an increased risk of breast cancer.In each case, plaintiffs' lawyers say, drug makers hid early indications of the side effects and improperly marketed their medicines.""These companies just do it again and again and again,"" said Paul J. Pennock, a partner who leads litigation against drug makers for Weitz & Luxenberg, one of the largest plaintiffs' law firms. ""They try to create much larger markets for these drugs than is warranted, particularly given what they know about the risks.""But lawyers for drug makers say that prescription medicines are as safe now as they have ever been and that the rash of suits reflects an emboldened and enriched plaintiffs' bar.For a decade, large plaintiffs' law firms have profited from suing corporate America over asbestos-related diseases, but asbestos suits are slowly drying up, leaving plaintiffs' lawyers searching for new targets, defense lawyers say. In addition, plaintiffs' firms have grown flush with cash from settlements of asbestos and tobacco lawsuits and now have the resources to finance cases that can take years and millions of dollars of upfront investment.To build caseloads, plaintiffs' firms aggressively advertise for clients. Smaller firms then refer potential plaintiffs to a handful of large firms like Weitz & Luxenberg that can afford to invest in complex cases. In return, the smaller firms receive a share of the proceeds from any settlements or verdicts.""It's an industry, an amazing industry,"" said Barbara R. Binis, a lawyer at Reed Smith who has successfully defended Wyeth in several diet-drug lawsuits. ""They all talk to each other, and they all play off what each other is doing.""Drug suits may also have been spurred by changes in federal laws intended to discourage class-action litigation, said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University. Unlike traditional consumer class-action cases, in which thousands or millions of plaintiffs with relatively small claims are combined into a single case, drug lawsuits are usually not combined into a single mass trial. Instead, each lawsuit is tried individually, although a single judge oversees the process of document production and witness depositions for all the cases.""Class-action reform has a tendency to make class actions less desirable, and the class-action device is not what's being used in these cases -- these are multiple individual cases,"" Mr. Zipursky said.But plaintiffs' lawyers say they do not take on drug cases lightly, despite the prospect of lotterylike rewards, because pharmaceutical suits are very difficult to win.With billions of dollars in annual profits, drug makers have essentially unlimited resources for their defense, and the cases often turn on complicated scientific evidence that can be hard to explain to juries. As they prepare cases for trial, lawyers must spend millions of dollars and thousands of hours interviewing witnesses and sorting through company documents. In the last few years, suits over Serzone, an antidepressant, and Rezulin, a diabetes drug, have largely fizzled.""These are tough cases,"" said Christopher Seeger of Seeger Weiss. Mr. Seeger was among the lead lawyers in the Zyprexa settlement but has lost the only Vioxx case he has tried. ""I don't really hear a lot of plaintiffs' firms sitting around, saying, 'Here's the next big moneymaker,' because these are monsters, these cases.""None of the next wave of suits will be as big as Vioxx, lawyers for both sides say. In the Ortho-Evra, Prempro and Fosamax cases, the potential pool of plaintiffs is relatively small, numbering thousands of patients instead of tens of thousands. In the Seroquel cases, plaintiffs will probably not win huge damages even if they do win their suits, because they are mentally ill and mostly unemployed, limiting the economic damages they can be awarded. Damage awards for economic loss are closely tied to income. .But the cases may offer some advantage for plaintiffs compared with Vioxx suits, said Tim M. O'Brien, a partner with Levin Papantonio. In both the Ortho-Evra and Fosamax cases, plaintiffs have a ""signature disease,"" a condition that is closely linked to use of the drug but is otherwise very rare. The use of contraceptive patches has been linked to blood clots, which are unusual in women of childbearing age, while the jaw decay associated with Fosamax is also very rare. In contrast, the heart attacks that plaintiffs' lawyers assert were caused by Vioxx have many other causes.""Those cases that are retained are going to be easier to prove than the Vioxx cases,"" Mr. O'Brien said.The Prempro cases may be the longest shots, because Prempro use has been linked with a relatively slight increase in breast cancer risk. But Tobi Millrood, of Schiffrin & Barroway, which represents about 1,000 of the 6,000 Premarin cases nationally, said he believed that he could convince juries of the link between individual cancer cases and Premarin use.""Many of the women I represent don't have any of the risk factors that can be associated with breast cancer,"" Mr. Millrood said.Further, the litigation can prove damaging for drug makers even when they are not financially ruinous. As part of the lawsuits, drug makers must turn over their internal e-mail and documents to plaintiffs' lawyers. While the documents are often transferred under seal, they can be leaked or become public during trials.The Vioxx case has badly damaged Merck's once pristine reputation by bringing to light e-mail that contained derogatory comments made about the Food and Drug Administration in 2000 by Dr. Edward M. Scolnick, who at the time was Merck's chief scientist.'"

"'06-04-22,'0','The health insurer Aetna said yesterday that it would not pay for a nerve-stimulating implant the government has approved as a last-ditch treatment for severe depression.While some analysts said the national noncoverage decision is a continuation of existing policy that came as no surprise, investors saw it as a blow for the device's manufacturer, Cyberonics. The company, based in Houston, has been citing previous case-by-case approvals of coverage by 8 of Aetna's more than 50 local and regional health plans as a sign of growing acceptance of the device among insurers.Cyberonics shares tumbled as low as $24.60 in heavy trading before ending at $24.93, down almost 7 percent.The pacemaker-like device is implanted in the upper chest to stimulate the vagus nerve as it rises through the neck. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last July even though critics said clinical trials had not proved its effectiveness.It has been approved to treat epilepsy -- a therapy Aetna and most other insurers cover -- since 1997. Reports by epilepsy patients that the treatment had a positive impact on their moods led the company to investigate it as a depression therapy.Cyberonics estimates the market for treatment-resistant depression at 4.4 million Americans, or roughly 10 times the number of epilepsy patients. The device sells for about $15,000. Last year's regulatory approval covers marketing for patients over 18 who have repeatedly failed other forms of depression therapy.'"
"'06-04-22,'0','A federal judge in Kansas has dealt another blow to the crusade by the state's attorney general, Phill Kline, to restrict abortions under the phony banner of combating child abuse.In February, the Kansas Supreme Court blocked Mr. Kline from invading the medical privacy of 90 women and girls who were treated at two abortion clinics. This week, a federal trial judge in Wichita killed Mr. Kline's daft idea to require doctors, school counselors and psychotherapists, among others, to report all sexual activity by people under 16, from kissing to sexual intercourse.In 2003, Mr. Kline issued an advisory opinion that changed the interpretation of Kansas' law requiring the reporting of child abuse. It made mandatory the reporting of every instance of suspected consensual sex among teenagers of similar ages, including any pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease or request for contraception.Doctors, nurses, therapists and sex educators sued, and the federal judge, Thomas Marten, held that Mr. Kline's opinion violated the actual language of the underlying state statute, which gives those treating adolescents discretion to decide whether illegal sexual activity amounts to actual child abuse. Kansas law prohibits intercourse, oral sex and lewd touching by anyone under 16.Setting a potentially important constitutional precedent, Judge Marten also found that adolescents enjoy a limited right of informational privacy in their communications with health care workers.Judge Marten said Mr. Kline's blunderbuss reporting requirement would jeopardize the physical and mental health of adolescents by deterring them from seeking testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control and counseling. It would also hurt efforts to combat real child abuse by overwhelming social service officials.'"
"'06-04-22,'0','Microsoft has hired Steven Berkowitz, the chief executive of Ask Jeeves, to run its floundering Internet division, Microsoft said yesterday.Mr. Berkowitz became president of Ask Jeeves in 2001 and chief executive in 2003. He helped transform the service, which was introduced to answer questions posed in English phrases, into a search engine to compete with Google. Mr. Berkowitz continued to run the company after it was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp last July.Microsoft has been struggling to redefine its online strategy and build an advertising-based business to confront competition from Google, Yahoo and others. The company's MSN service, which dates from 1994, has gone through a series of sharp strategy shifts as Microsoft has wrestled with whether it is a media company as well as a software vendor.Most recently, the company decided to revive its effort to build advertising-based businesses as it sees Google give away free software, supported by advertising.Despite a large investment to develop and promote its new search engine, Microsoft's share of the search market in the United States has plummeted. In March, it had 13 percent of the search market, down from 16 percent a year earlier, according to comScore Networks. Ask Jeeves held its share constant at 6 percent over the same period.'"
"'06-04-22,'0','""We're really pleased,"" said Joe Escobedo, the lead lawyer for the Garza family. ""We thought that Mr. Garza's case was a very, very strong case.""Lawyers for Merck denounced the verdict and said they expected it would be overturned on appeal. Juries in South Texas have a history of returning large verdicts for local plaintiffs against companies with headquarters out of state, said Richard L. Josephson of the firm of Baker Botts, who was the lead lawyer for Merck's defense team in the case.Making the case even more difficult for Merck, Mr. Garza's family was well known in Starr County, where he had lived and where the lawsuit was heard, Mr. Josephson said.""This is a one of a kind; this is an aberration,"" he said. ""If I had tried this case in Houston, where I live, I think we would have won it 19 out of 20 times.""Mr. Josephson said that Judge Alex W. Gabert, who oversaw the suit, should have dismissed the case before it reached a jury because lawyers for Mr. Garza's family had no scientific evidence that Vioxx had caused Mr. Garza's heart attack.""There really isn't any good science to indicate that Vioxx can cause a heart attack in less than 30 days,"" Mr. Josephson said. ""It shouldn't have been submitted to the jury.""In addition to his heart attack in 1981, Mr. Garza underwent a quadruple bypass in 1985, and was a smoker who was also overweight and had high blood pressure.Mr. Garza's family claimed that he had taken Vioxx for 25 days before his heart attack, although medical records confirmed only 7 days of use.Mr. Escobedo said that Vioxx was especially dangerous to Mr. Garza because of his other risk factors and that he should never have been prescribed the drug.""Mr. Garza was the last person in the world that should have been taking Vioxx,"" said Mr. Escobedo, who told the jury that Merck had known since 2000 that the drug posed heart risks but continued selling it for four years.The verdict highlights the risks that Merck faces as the number of lawsuits over Vioxx continues to grow.Shares of Merck fell about 1 percent after the verdict was announced yesterday, and closed down 26 cents, at $34.74.About 20 million Americans took Vioxx from 1999 to 2004, when Merck withdrew the drug after a clinical trial showed that it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes compared with a placebo. Earlier clinical trials had also shown that Vioxx appeared to be much riskier to the heart than naproxen, an older painkiller.In its earnings report this week, Merck disclosed that it faced 11,500 product-liability lawsuits over Vioxx, with 23,300 separate plaintiffs, as well as 190 class-action lawsuits. Merck has set aside almost $1 billion to defend itself from the lawsuits, but the company has not yet given any estimate of what it believes its total liability in the cases will be.In each of the three cases Merck has lost, juries have awarded verdicts of more than $10 million, and have ordered Merck to pay punitive damages, which are supposed to be awarded only in cases of egregious corporate conduct.Merck has said that it plans to defend Vioxx lawsuits case by case, and a month ago that strategy appeared to be working. After losing a $253.5 million verdict in the first case to reach trial, Merck won the next two.But recently the tide has seemed to turn abruptly against the company, as its lawyers struggle to explain a raft of documents that show its scientists were concerned about Vioxx's heart risks several years before Merck stopped selling the drug in 2004.Merck lost a Vioxx suit this month in New Jersey, where the jury awarded a 77-year-old heart attack survivor and his wife $13.5 million in damages. That man had taken Vioxx for four years.Kenneth L. Frazier, Merck's general counsel, said in a conference call after the verdict yesterday that he was pleased with the performance of Merck's defense lawyers. Merck never expected to win every case at trial and believes it has strong ground for appeal, he said.""The realities of the world are that jury cases have uncertain outcomes,"" he said.'"

"'06-04-23,'0','IN response to parental outrage over book-laden backpacks, a half-dozen states have been considering weight limits on textbooks for public elementary and high schools. California is at the forefront, requiring publishers to provide lighter-weight options to textbooks exceeding age-appropriate thresholds — three pounds for up to fourth grade, four pounds for fifth through eighth grade, five pounds for high schoolers.Now the issue has graduated to campus. In Wisconsin, State Representative Marlin D. Schneider believes that backpacks jammed with heavy books pose health risks for college students just as they do for smaller children. As part of a ""student bill of rights,"" he has introduced legislation seeking weight limits on textbooks in the state's public universities.How weighty is the overweight textbook issue on campus? College students say they are more likely to carry a laptop than books, and heavier books have already been divided into multiple volumes. But consider this heavyweight champ: ""Art History"" by Marilyn Stokstad (Pearson Prentice Hall, revised second edition, 2005), currently weighing down students at Emory University in Atlanta, Augsburg College in Minneapolis and Victoria College in Texas.

"'06-04-23,'0','VERONA has always seemed to me a nearly perfect Italian city. You have the central location, hard by the Lago di Garda with its dreamy vistas (and German vacationers); you have the ochre buildings and busy piazzas and open-air market; you have one of Titian's greatest Assumptions in the duomo; you have Juliet's balcony and statue worn shiny by the hands of thousands of supplicant (or voyeuristic) lovers. And you have the Arena, one of those near-legendary ancient amphitheaters with an acoustic so fine that an unamplified voice there can be heard by 18,000 people — something showcased, every summer, by a full season of outdoor opera.Opera is why I fell in love with Verona — opera in general, and ""Aida"" in particular. It began on a drizzly day when damp visitors to the city anxiously asked each other whether the show would go on. At the Arena, cancellations aren't announced until show time (at 9:15 p.m.), so around 7:30 I made my way up to an ""unreserved stone step"" (an official price category of Arena seating; there are discounts for those under 26 and over 60) and took my place next to three generations of an Italian family, who had brought a picnic and sophisticated recording equipment so they could pirate the performance. (Note to first-timers: this is illegal.) And there we sat, soggily, along with thousands of others: through the drizzle until the official curtain time when it was announced that the rain might let up; through the mopping of the stage; through the downpour that followed; through another mopping-up; and through a performance that began after 10:30 p.m. and lasted into the wee hours of the morning.Was it worth it? Absolutely. Some bond was formed among all the die-hards who waited it out, and you could even feel it from the stage, where the fine singers (Sharon Sweet, Dolora Zajick, and, I believe, Franco Bonisolli) sang full-heartedly, as if to reward everyone for being there and remind us why anyone would want to hear the opera in the first place. Before that, I had never had much use for ""Aida"" (I was young); but I got it that night. It has remained one of my favorite operas ever since.There is something special about outdoor opera. Touristy? It can be. Great art? It can be that, too. Big emotions make sense in these big spaces on soft summer nights when undying love seems, suddenly, eminently possible. And whether it's Verona's more traditional pageantry or the more contemporary stagings at the Seebühne (lake stage) in Bregenz, Austria, thrust out into Lake Constance, opera's large scale and spectacle, its color and glitter, seem to come into even sharper focus when outlined against the night sky and the stars.Verona is the quintessence of outdoor opera in Europe: it's the biggest, the longest, and it's Italian to boot. It doesn't always have the biggest stars, but there are always a few singers familiar to opera buffs sprinkled among the respectable, largely Italian B-list casts: this summer these include Fiorenza Cedolins and Marcelo Alvarez as Tosca and Cavaradossi, Daniela Dessí and Fabio Armiliato as Cio-Cio San and Pinkerton in ""Madama Butterfly"" and José Cura as Canio and Leo Nucci as Tonio in ""Pagliacci."" Visually, tradition means emphasizing spectacle over experiment: of five productions at Verona this year, two are new and three are by Franco Zeffirelli, a director who at his worst is adept at producing competent familiarity that appeals to a wide cross section of operagoers. The 2006 season also includes ""Carmen"" and, of course, ""Aida.""'"

While orbiting the Earth, he was able to take a picture of Manhattan in which Central Park and some of the surrounding real estate can be seen.Until the sale to Ms. Bronfman, Mr. Olsen owned two apartments with views of the park from Columbus Circle. He bought the apartment at 1 Central Park West, which is also known as Trump International Hotel and Tower, in October for $5.95 million, according to city records.The other apartment, which he still owns, is near the top of the Time Warner Center, opposite the Trump building. He bought that apartment for $9.1 million in 2004. In showing his space photograph to an interviewer shortly after his return to Earth, Mr. Olsen indicated a tiny speck at the corner of the park, which he said was the Time Warner Center. Mr. Olsen made millions as founder of a company that produced infrared sensors.Ms. Bronfman's father was ranked No. 224 this year on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, with an estimated net worth of $3 billion. The family's fortune came from the Seagram liquor company.Ms. Bronfman did not respond to two telephone messages that were left requesting an interview.But her broker, Leighton Candler, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group, said her client chose the building because of the hotel amenities offered.

"'06-04-23,'0','Michael Worthington, the co-founder of ResumeDoctor, said the most common résumé transgressions could be found in three areas: education, job title and dates of employment.Mr. Worthington and other job experts insist that job seekers can sell themselves successfully without resorting to exaggeration and half-truths.Gaps in employment, both short term and long term, can be more easily explained than in the past, Mr. Worthington said. Losing a job to downsizing or layoffs has less of a stigma, and many employers are more sympathetic to time off taken for personal and family reasons.Job candidates who have not graduated from college or completed work toward a higher degree should not try to fudge it, the experts say. A résumé should indicate if applicants are a few credits short and when and if they plan to complete the degree.Some job seekers claim job titles they never had, even though they performed many of the duties the title might suggest. The solution, some hiring managers say, is not to say you were a producer if you were an associate producer, but to stress that you had the responsibilities and duties of a producer.Résumé embellishers may also want to refrain from lies for the simple reason that it is easier than ever to catch cheating. A simple Google search can often turn up a wealth of information on a prospective employee. A 2005 survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management showed that 40 percent of human resource professionals had increased the time they spent checking references since 2002, and 52 percent said they contracted out at least part of the background checking to professionals.So why risk lying on your résumé? And why does the phenomenon seem more prevalent than in the past?Hiring managers cite a myriad of reasons. Many people are desperate and feel financial pressure to land a job, while some are confident that ""white lies"" will not be discovered. Karen N. Danziger, executive vice president of the Howard-Sloan-Koller Group, a New York recruiting agency for media and publishing professionals, suspects that job seekers have adopted a mentality of ""if they can do it, I can do it,"" given the prevalence of cheating.Rafet Kaplan, the Northeast bureau chief for the Fox News Channel, who has been responsible for hiring at several companies, said: ""I think it's a baseline insecurity. They want to look and feel better about themselves."" He said his company conducted extensive background checks to root out résumé prevaricators.Steven A. Miranda, the chief human resource and strategic planning officer for the Society for Human Resource Management, says that a skilled interviewer who digs deep enough will be able to identify job candidates who have misrepresented themselves on their résumés.But he acknowledges that some candidates fall through the cracks. He points to a number of recent résumé-padders, like David J. Edmondson, the former chief executive of RadioShack, who claimed college degrees he did not have, and Bausch & Lomb's chairman and chief executive, Ronald L. Zarrella, who falsely claimed to have an M.B.A.But many ordinary workers say they believe that some exaggerations are necessary to survive in a brutally competitive job market. A 36-year-old office manager from Brooklyn, who insisted on anonymity, justified her own résumé misrepresentations as a form of self-preservation.""I have some misleading things on my résumé,"" she acknowledged. ""I didn't graduate from college; I'm nine credits short of a degree. In my mind, I have a college education, just not a degree, and I shouldn't be penalized for that.""On her résumé she lists the college she attended without dates of attendance or graduation. She said that if asked, she would admit that she did not have her degree, but added that so far she had not been asked.Few human resource employees or hiring professionals would sympathize with her or anyone else with a misleading résumé.""It speaks to issues of integrity and credibility,"" Mr. Kaplan of Fox News said.Mr. Kaplan recalled his own experience interviewing a candidate who lied on his résumé about completing college. He said he wanted to hire the person, but a background check revealed that the applicant had barely attended the college. Mr. Kaplan noted that a college diploma was not required for the job, but the misrepresentation became a deal-breaker.Ms. Danziger of Howard-Sloan-Koller has noted a sharp increase in résumé exaggeration and errors of omission that she says can in part be attributed to job candidates' over-reliance on professional résumé writers. In an effort to make their clients more marketable, there is a tendency for the writers to ""cover up the rough spots,"" she said.""There's usually a lot of hyperbole,"" Ms. Danziger says about such résumés. ""A lot of buzzwords. It just feels dishonest.""Tory Johnson of Women for Hire said: ""Nobody wants to be seen as having a mediocre track record. It's human nature to want to be seen in the best possible light, as long as it doesn't cross the line. Everything has to be in verifiable territory.""'"
"'06-04-23,'0','In the last year and a half, several other high-profile pairings have been announced. In December 2004, Exelon in Chicago said it would buy the Public Service Enterprise Group in Newark. A year later, the FPL Group in Juno Beach, Fla., said it would acquire the Constellation Energy Group in Baltimore. And in February, National Grid, a British utility, said it was buying KeySpan in New York. Only the combination of Constellation and FPL would have been prevented by the former law, said Timothy O'Brien, manager of the Evergreen Utilities and Telecommunications fund.David M. Schanzer, utility analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, predicted that future deals would come either as utilities in slower-growth regions like the Northeast try to enter the faster-growing Southwest and Southeast, or as utilities in states with knotty regulatory environments expanded into places with friendlier ones.""The big noisy deals like Constellation-FPL are out of the way at this point,"" he added. ""You'll see more medium-sized to smaller ones as companies fine-tune.""Progress Energy, with operations in the Carolinas and Florida, fits Mr. Schanzer's criteria, though he would not speculate on whether it might be an acquisition target.Europe, too, is seeing a flurry of proposed combinations, said Paul Justice, an analyst at Morningstar. E.ON of Germany is trying to snag Endesa of Spain in the largest utility deal ever proposed. And at the urging of the French government, Suez and Gaz de France are trying to merge to ward off a takeover of Suez by Enel of Italy.Still, rather than guess which companies may be acquired, individual investors may be better off looking for power companies making infrastructure improvements that let them operate more efficiently and earn bigger profits from existing customers, particularly those served by regulated subsidiaries. Mr. O'Brien of Evergreen called that process ""gold-plating the rate base"" and explained that it included upgrades to transmission and distribution networks. ""Gold-plating means that, if your rate base is growing at 5 to 6 percent a year, then your earnings are growing 5 to 6 percent, too,"" he said.Among the companies making these sorts of investments, said Shelby G. Tucker, a principal at Banc of America Securities, are PG&E in San Francisco; Edison International in Rosemead, Calif.; Consolidated Edison in New York; and the Southern Company in Atlanta. ""Between transmission and distribution and environmental investments and some new coal plants, there's a layer of growth there over the next three to four years,"" he said. ""I'm not suggesting 15 to 20 percent a year. But if you have a company with earnings growth of 5 to 6 percent and throw on top of that a 4 percent yield, that's a 10 percent total return.""The willingness of many investors to engage in this kind of traditional calculation -- based on the expectation of steady, long-term returns -- represents a sharp improvement in the sector's reputation. Just a few years ago, this once-safe-and-steady industry looked reckless and rickety. The combined effect of the Enron scandal, California's deregulatory debacle and failed attempts at diversification had dragged down many companies' shares. The stocks of the electric utilities in the S.& P. 500 fell by about 20 percent a year, on average, in both 2001 and 2002, said Alexander Young, equity market strategist for Standard & Poor's Equity Research.But the industry has bounced back, with prices of the index's electric utilities, on average, jumping by double digits each year from 2003 through 2005.""A lot of what's been going on in our sector is disasters or partial debacles and recoveries,"" Mr. Scott of Progress Energy said. ""If you're a utility, how can you possibly produce 20 percent-plus returns? The only reason you can do that is if you're recovering from a level where you tanked your stock.""Progress's stock, for its part, is down around 4 percent after gyrating wildly in the last two years, weighed down partly by a $1 billion dispute with the I.R.S. over the company's production of synthetic fuels. The I.R.S. decided in February to allow the tax break. The stock rose on the news, but then returned to its previous, lower level.ANOTHER tax issue -- the tax-favored status of dividends -- is perhaps the biggest uncertainty hanging over the utilities sector, said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. In 2003, Congress cut the maximum tax on qualified dividends to 15 percent, from as high as 35 percent. The lower rate will apply only to dividends received by the end of 2008 unless lawmakers extend the break.""If that doesn't look like it's going to be done,"" Professor Siegel said, ""there's a question of how much utilities would be hurt.""At the very least, the year-to-year comparisons of after-tax returns would be much more complicated.'"

That trifecta may result in a confidence number on Tuesday that is lower than the market expects, Mr. Koesterich said.A Bloomberg News poll of economists expects a reading of 106.2 in the consumer confidence report by the Conference Board, down from 107.2 last month.""Consumer confidence is definitely something to keep an eye on,"" Mr. Koesterich advised. ""We're starting to see some changes in the economy, and the question is how they're going to affect consumers. Expectations are for a minor dip, and my guess is the risk is to the down side.""Not long ago, a weaker reading might have bolstered the stock market by reassuring investors that the Federal Reserve's moves to raise interest rates were nearing an end.

"'06-04-23,'0','For a shortcut, clichéd summation of growing consumer sophistication, consider the wine category: Back when we didn't know anything, wine meant Blue Nun, jugs of Gallo, little bottles of Lancers and hokey Aldo Cella commercials. Nowadays we have taste, and even suburban megamarts have huge and varied wine selections for the demanding mass affluent. Of course, real wine connoisseurs have walked the earth for many years -- as have nonconnoisseurs who find such people to be annoying snobs and who find today's megamart selection to be a big, bewildering taunt. It's one thing to sense that there's a huge spectrum of quality represented on that shelf, but it's something else to make a decision. Perhaps, in light of this, it's no surprise that a new factor has emerged that apparently helps many of us parse the options: the ""critter label.""A critter label is any label that features an animal, from a hippo to a frog to a penguin. According to ACNielsen, the market-research company, 438 viable table-wine brands have been introduced in the past three years, and 18 percent -- nearly one in five -- feature an animal on the label. ""Combined with existing critter labels,"" the firm said in a summation of its research on this matter, ""sales of critter-branded wine have reached more than $600 million.""It's a bit surprising that a market-research company has decided to define a wine category by its label design. It seems more logical to consider wine by, say, variety or region or vintage. The appearance of the bottle obviously has no effect whatsoever on the quality of the product, and as Danny Brager, who is vice president of ACNielsen's beverage-alcohol unit, explains, there has not traditionally been a ""critter"" category in his firm's database. But while critter wine may not be an official term in the wine business, it's a notion that has been bandied about in various forms quite a bit in recent years. ""The industry is talking about it,"" Brager says. That's why ACNielsen decided to put some formal research into the critter question.The alpha critter, it seems, is a kangaroo, the one represented on the label of the Australian wine brand Yellow Tail, which came into the U.S. market several years ago and, in part thanks to a ubiquitous marketing campaign, now moves millions of cases a year. Needless to say, Brager attributes the success of any given critter wine to such traditional factors as quality and price, not just its mascot or label design; consumers see Yellow Tail, at less than $8 a bottle, as a good value. ""We don't want people to think if you slap an animal on it, it'll sell,"" he says. Still, that brand was ""one of the very first ones to depict an animal on the label and almost seemed like it made a connection with the consumers who were looking to have fun with their wine,"" Brager continues. ""People associated the wallaby and the label, and it was easy to ask for when you walked in the store.""The critter craze is in some ways merely a subset of the more widespread growth of clever or outright gimmicky wine packaging and branding strategies (like Sogno Uno, a 2004 vintage featuring a blend of Italian grapes and a picture of a porn star on the label). This speaks to the flip side of increased consumer interest in wine: yes, more of us want better wine, but that doesn't mean we have any newfound interest in reading label descriptions that are hard to pronounce, let alone understand. So perhaps the animal stampede has grown so crowded not just because the critters are memorable but also because there is something approachable, unstuffy, even friendly in a bottle of Goats Do Roam compared with one of Côtes du Rhône.This brings with it the potential for a reaction against the zooification of the wine aisle. An oenophile is unlikely to skip the ""best Bordeaux wines"" roundup in favor of the ""best mammalian-representation wines."" In fact it seems inevitable that at some point, wine snobs -- who derive prestige not just from making their own well-informed choices but also from trashing your foolish ones -- are going to start sneering at the adorable creature depicted on the bottle you bring to their dinner parties. And maybe someday, critter labels will go the way of Aldo Cella, and mainstream wine drinkers will have to find a new way of reconciling sophistication and fun.'"

"'06-04-23,'0','JOHN BRUTON, the European Union's ambassador to the United States and the former Irish prime minister, says American chief executives are mistaken if they believe that Western Europe is slow-growing or protectionist. Here are excerpts from a conversation:Q. Are you concerned that we're seeing more protectionism, or even economic nationalism, on both sides of the Atlantic?A. In Europe last year, there were more takeovers by companies of one country of companies in another country than in any year since 2000. So it's not surprising that there has been the occasional case in which questions have been raised. But if you were to look at Europe 10 years ago, many companies wouldn't have even contemplated making the offers they are today. You could argue that the controversy is a sign of liberalization, rather than the opposite.There is, in every country, a wariness about foreign ownership. But a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shows that the foreign investment laws in nine countries of the European Union are more liberal than are the laws in the United States of America.Q. What was European reaction to the furor that prevented a Dubai group from buying control of ports in the United States from a British company?A. There was a worry that the issue was being looked at not on its actual merit or on genuine security grounds, but rather on broader political grounds. In Europe, we do not feel that political barriers should be put in the way of investments. To have a stevedoring operating entity owned by one foreign company being taken over by another foreign company wouldn't have prejudiced the right of the U.S. Coast Guard or Customs to do all they needed to do to protect security. I have spent time talking to members of Congress about this. Europe is by far the biggest investor in the United States. America should remain a place that welcomes foreign investment. I was reassured. Members said this was a unique case and didn't have broader implications.'"

"'06-04-23,'0','By the time the Padres had won, Beltrán was ensconced in the training room, receiving treatment. His hamstring still felt tight.On Saturday morning, after team doctors evaluated the results of the M.R.I., Beltrán learned that his injury was not serious. The doctors cleared him to play Saturday night, but Beltrán said he did not feel comfortable playing the outfield, and Endy Chávez started in center field. If he were needed to pinch-hit again, Beltrán said he could.""If I was close to 100 percent, I'd be out there in the field,"" he said.Before Friday's game, local doctors examined the results and reported nothing serious. But the Mets appeared firm in their decision not to let Beltrán play until he told them that he felt fully healed and their doctors had scanned the results and given their approval.Why, then, would the Mets allow Beltrán, their $119 million investment, to pinch-hit in a game in April? After Friday's game, Randolph explained that he would not have allowed Beltrán to pinch-hit if he had been led to believe that the injury was serious. He clarified his reasoning before Saturday's game.""If he was leading off an inning, I wouldn't have put him in,"" Randolph said. ""But he came in with runners on base, and we felt he could do damage at the plate.""On his grounder, Beltrán ran at about half-speed to first. If the ball had squirted past or deflected off a diving Josh Barfield, Beltrán said, his instinct would have been to run hard. But he says he feels discomfort on long strides and would have needed to be replaced by a pinch-runner.Beltrán had the M.R.I. at 2:30 p.m. at the Scripps Clinic in nearby La Jolla, Calif., the same hospital where he was evaluated last August after sustaining facial fractures and a concussion in an outfield collision here with Mike Cameron. Beltrán arrived at Petco Park around 4 p.m. and had some treatment and a massage while awaiting word from the Mets' doctors that never came.He said Ray Ramirez, the head trainer, asked him if he could pinch-hit. Beltrán started loosening up in the fifth inning, stretching and high-kneeing, and he was swinging in the batting cage in the seventh inning when Randolph sought him.Beltrán's recent misfortune with leg injuries -- he pulled a quadriceps muscle last May, and the pain limited his effectiveness for two months -- have made him hesitant to rush back from this injury. But asked why he was willing to play if the team doctors had not received the test results, Beltrán said: ""Swinging the bat is no problem. It's just the running.""Before Friday's game, Randolph explained the protocol for his determination whether to play Beltrán. The training staff offers guidance, he said, but the decision is ultimately his after he speaks with Beltrán.""He'll give me a thumbs up or a thumbs down,"" Randolph said. ""That's how it goes.""'"

"'06-04-23,'0','Live well, spend less. It's a nice concept -- but one that's often hard to pull off when you are an American tourist traveling through Europe and struggling to find ways to offset the weakness of the dollar. Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.Cobbled streets, a sleek new subway system, some of the top restaurants in Scandinavia and that ubiquitous Nordic sense of style: It all adds up to a highly attractive -- and costly -- vacation spot. Yet even though this city of Renaissance castles and classic modern design routinely ranks among the 10 priciest places in the world, a recent crop of wallet-friendly hot spots and some enduring gratis experiences mean more mileage for your kroners.For haute cuisine, the city's best kroner-to-quality ratio is Copenhagen Food Consulting (Abel Cathrines Gade 7; 45-3313-6060). A haven of minimalist Scandinavian style in the trendy Vesterbro district, the two-year-old upscale restaurant (known by the locals as Cofoco) offers a seasonal three-course menu of modern Danish-French dishes for 225 kroner (about $37, at 6.3 kroner to the dollar). Offerings might include cod with apple and mint or duck with yogurt, beets and horseradish. Its bargains have made Cofoco a popular cult address, so book in advance. Or hit the streets for a hot dog, the sidewalk specialty of Copenhagen. Sold from pushcarts labeled ""Polser,"" the tube steaks come thick or thin, grilled or boiled, and topped with dried onions, sweet pickles and tangy rémoulade sauce, generally about 20 kroner.The words ""designer-chic"" and ""hostel"" don't usually wind up side by side, but the new Danhostel Copenhagen City (50 H.C. Andersens Boulevard, 45-3311-8585; www.danhostel.dk) is changing that. Outfitted by the Danish design firm GUBI, which helped furnish the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the 16-story hostel has more than 1,020 beds spread over 187 rooms. You can have one of the cool white chambers all to yourself or share with strangers. An Internet cafe, a restaurant and a central location sweeten the deal. Depending on season, a room for two to four people costs 520 or 600 kroners (70 or 80 euros; $86 or $95) a night.Opened last year, the futuristic Copenhagen Opera House, on the island of Holmen (45-3369-6969; www.operahus.dk), has become one of the most talked-about new cultural venues in Europe. Unsold advance tickets to its performances -- a roster of ballets, classical concerts and operas -- are offered to the public at half price at 4 p.m. on the day of the show at the box office at August Bournonvilles Passage 1, in the main square, Kongens Nytorv. (Half-price, same-day tickets for other venues operated by the Danish government are also sold there.) Another bargain: People under 25 and over 65 receive a 50 percent discount when ordering tickets more than a week in advance.Best Things To Do FreeA number of top museums permanently abolished entry fees in January, including the National Museum (Ny Vestergade 10; 45-3313-4411), and the National Gallery (Solvgade 48-50; 45-3374-8494), a vast space stocked with European art since 1300 (though special exhibitions can have a fee). Also, circle Wednesday on your calendar: Showcasing cutting-edge creations, the Danish Design Center (27 H.C. Andersens Boulevard, 45-3369-3369) is free on Wednesday from 5 to 9 p.m. Also free on Wednesday (and on Sunday) is the New Carlsberg Museum (Dantes Plads 7; 45-3341-8141) across the street. The collection includes French Impressionist painting and ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian art. But it is closed for renovation from May 1 to June 27.Exploring the bicycle-friendly Danish capital on two wheels is a breeze thanks to 2,000 free bikes the city provides from April through November at 110 racks around town. Simply slide a 20-kroner coin into the slot on the front of the bike to release it from the rack. The coin will be returned when the bike is replaced. More details at www.bycyklen.dk.'"
"'06-04-23,'0','FANS of Calexico, a band from Tucson, know the thrill that can come from music that crosses borders: since the mid-1990's, the band has been blending pensive indie rock with alt-country and elements of mariachi. But Joey Burns, the lead singer, is even more eclectic in his listening habits, calling himself a ""frustrated ethnomusicologist"" whose tastes are broad and insatiable. During a recent European tour that found him adding to his pile of CD's, he spoke by phone with Ben Sisario about what he has been listening to.Amparanoia is the project of a Spanish singer named Amparo Sánchez, who is from Granada but moved to Madrid and got involved in the mestizo scene there, where she met Manu Chao. The name refers to her ""positive"" paranoia about music -- her idea for the group was to mix rhythms and styles from many backgrounds with crazy combinations, like rumba with ranchera, bolero with ska, and reggae with hip-hop. On her new album, ""La Vida Te Da"" (Wrasse), the sonic mixture is seamless. I hear a trace of blues and sadness in her melodies -- turns out her inspiration to sing came from listening to Billie Holiday records as a child -- as well as a raspy hint of flamenco and a jazzy, stream-of-conscious style of rap.Earnest, passionate and enthusiastic. I love the intertwined call-and-response vocals, and the combination of pop, folk, lo-fi and electro rock. On its last album, this five-piece band from Omaha held up its layered melodies with innovative percussion that came in the form of the tap-dancing stunner Jamie Williams. Its new album, ""Bottoms of Barrels"" (Team Love, to be released May 23), includes a rhythm section, though it still has plenty of space in the arrangements for the slashing guitars and walls of vocals to shine through. Variety is the key here, whether in a foot-stomping rock song, a slow ballad or even an electro-acoustic thumper like ""The Freest Man."" That song could be a look back to the 1980's, with synth and chorused guitar lines draped in black, but the vocals offer hope: ""Don't drown yourself in all your old regret/ Because that heaviness will steal away your breath.""Death Vessel is basically one guy, Joel Thibodeau, who is living in Brooklyn right now. He has this high-lonesome thing going on, and it's heavenly. His voice is very high -- I'd call him a definite alto -- and when you first listen to it you're not sure if it's male or female. As a songwriter, he's close to Bill Callahan of Smog or Richard Buckner, but he sounds completely different. On ""Stay Close"" (North East Indie), his songs are based on bluegrass and country music and have a nightmarish take on contemporary life; on ""Deep in the Horchata,"" he sings: ""Losing our voices, and guts we had to spill/ Now that you've dropped the A-bomb/ You've put a mute on cicadas' song."" The name Death Vessel sounds full of metal and leather, but it's kind of beautiful, too. In Mexico, they celebrate the Day of the Dead, but it's really a celebration of life, cloaked in remembrance of people who have passed away. It's just in the way you interpret it.One of my friends said that Sweden releases the most music per capita of any country in the world. And it's good music, too. The Concretes, from Stockholm, are a case in point. On their latest album, ""In Colour"" (Astralwerks), the vocals are what ground the overall sound, but what stands out is the creativity in the arrangements and instrumentation: trumpets, woodwinds, banjo, mandolin, background choruses, big guitars, organ and strings. It's the sound of the Scandinavian summer, with plenty of sun but also the occasional dark and moody storm. Victoria Bergsman, the lead singer, often paints landscapes where memories seem to drift away for a while, but, as she sings in ""Tomorrow,"" ""hang around to greet the future.""On her beautifully dark and bittersweet new album, ""The Mezzanine"" (Warm), Liz Durrett keeps the songs sparse in accompaniment -- nylon-string guitar and spacey keyboard -- to allow her lush and textured vocals to take on a full surround-sound quality. She mostly does her own harmonizing, though some of it has a familiar sound: it comes from her producer and uncle, Vic Chesnutt. She's from Athens, Ga., one of the capitals of indie rock, though her songs also capture the gothic South in songs like ""Creepyaskudzu,"" with shadowy and mysterious spirits in her past that are ""heavy as horseshoes thrown on the lawn.""'"
"'06-04-23,'0','But the long-term record of most hedge funds is not at all impressive. Research by Burton G. Malkiel, a professor at Princeton, and Atanu Saha, a principal at the Analysis Group, found that over long periods hedge funds significantly underperform index funds, like those based on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.For openers, the hedge funds they looked at -- starting with 604 in 1996 and rising to 2,700 in 2003 as the funds proliferated -- earned less than an S.& P. index fund in the period he studied, 1996 to 2003: an annual average return of 9.3 percent, compared with 9.4 percent for the index fund (and 10.1 percent for a simple stock-and-bond portfolio). But hedge funds also create much more tax liability because they trade so often and have so much short-term taxable income, compared with a tax-efficient index fund. And, as is well documented, they have far higher fees than index funds.It is easy to buy an index fund that charges a management fee of only about 20 basis points -- two-tenths of a percentage point -- of the amount invested. A hedge fund takes an astounding fee of one to two full percentage points of net assets off the top, and then 20 percent of any profits. This cuts hedge fund returns to significantly less than those of broad-based index funds.Dr. Malkiel and Dr. Saha calculated that even if hedge funds earned almost 50 percent more than market returns, the higher taxes and fees that hedge funds pay would whittle away their net return to investors to 20 percent less than index funds.Other commentators, including my pal and colleague, Phil DeMuth, say that even these results overstate hedge fund results. For one thing, there is survivorship bias -- always a problem in the back alleys of finance -- because only the hedge funds that survive report at all. If you take into account the ones that fail, the results would be worse.Then there are problems of self-selection, in which only the funds that feel like it report at all, and instant-history bias, in which hedge funds that are brand new and have just had one good spurt can skew all the results. And because many assets of hedge funds are illiquid, the managers can put any price they want on them for any period until they sell them (and maybe even after that). This can be used to greatly underreport volatility because the assets in question can be reported at any price the managers wish, even while comparable liquid assets are gyrating wildly.To be sure, some hedge funds do well. Some do incredibly well, but rarely do any of them do incredibly well for a long time. As far as I can tell, in the past few years, almost none have done as well as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index fund, the Dimensional Fund Advisors' U.S. Micro Cap Portfolio, Dimensional's Emerging Markets Portfolio or the wildly popular Fidelity Contrafund, all of which cost almost nothing to invest in -- although the Contrafund is being closed to new investors at the end of the month, and its glory days may have passed in any event).HEDGE funds, as Phil DeMuth says, are not necessarily a great investment, but they are a great compensation program for hedge fund managers. Warren Buffett, a true god of investments, says much the same thing eloquently in his most recent annual report for Berkshire Hathaway. His estimates of how much of America's corporate profits are sucked out of the system's owners, the shareholders, and diverted to investment managers is breathtaking and depressing.So, weary travelers, worry about bad hotels. Worry about parents who will not do a thing to quiet noisy children. And worry about the sad fact that your teenagers probably don't appreciate you. (Have I mentioned this already? I wonder why.) But don't feel bad if you're not in a hot hedge fund. Hardly anyone else is, either.'"

"'06-04-23,'0','Hip-hop was long considered unfit for polite society. And yet the extraordinary snubbing of New Orleans hip-hop comes at a time when the genre is gaining institutional validation. The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History recently announced plans for a hip-hop exhibit. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum exhibited ""Roots, Rhyme and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story"" in 1999. Colleges and universities around the country are offering conferences and courses devoted to hip-hop history. At the same time that hip-hop is being written out of the history of New Orleans, it's being written into the history of America. Could that possibly be a coincidence?The story of New Orleans hip-hop begins in earnest with what is known as bounce music: festive beats, exuberant chants, simple lyrics that ruled local nightclubs and breezeway parties in the late 1980's and early 90's. The future hip-hop star Juvenile got his start in the bounce-music scene. But like many New Orleans musicians before him, Juvenile found out that having a citywide hit wasn't quite the same as having a nationwide hit.By the mid-90's, Southern hip-hop was starting to explode, and so some New Orleans entrepreneurs figured out ways to go national. Master P, a world-class hustler and less-than-world-class rapper from the city's rough Calliope projects, founded a label called No Limit, and used it to popularize a distinctively New Orleans-ish form of hard-boiled hip-hop. For a time Master P was one of pop music's most successful moguls. (He made the cover of Fortune, and he never let anyone forget it.)Master P's crosstown rivals were the Williams brothers, proprietors of Cash Money Records, which eventually replaced No Limit as the city's dominant brand name. Cash Money signed up the hometown hero Juvenile (who was raised in the Magnolia projects), as well as the city's greatest hip-hop producer, Mannie Fresh. Working with a great group of rappers including Lil Wayne and B. G., Fresh perfected an exuberant electronic sound; he did as much as anyone to pull the musical legacy of New Orleans into the 21st century. You could hear brass bands in the synthesizers, drum lines in the rattling beats, Mardi Gras Indians in the sing-song lyrics. (If you're wondering where to start, try Juvenile's head-spinning 1998 blockbuster, ""400 Degreez,"" which has sold 4.7 million copies.)Like most musical stories, this one doesn't really have a happy ending -- or any ending at all. Master P's empire dissolved, which explains why you might recently have seen him on ""Dancing With the Stars."" Mystikal, one of the city's best and weirdest rappers, split with No Limit in 2000, and he's currently serving a jail sentence for sexual battery and tax evasion. Juvenile, B. G. and Mannie Fresh have all left Cash Money, though Lil Wayne remains.The came Katrina. Not all of the city's stars were living in New Orleans when the storm hit, but all lost houses or cars or -- at the very least -- a hometown. Lil Wayne moved his mother to Miami; Mannie Fresh set up shop in Los Angeles; B. G. is living in Detroit.But the music never stopped. Juvenile's ""Reality Check"" (UTP/Atlantic), released last month, was the fastest-selling CD of his career; for the defiant first single, ""Get Ya Hustle On,"" he filmed a video in the devastated Lower Ninth Ward. B. G. recently released a strong new album, ""The Heart of tha Streetz Vol. 2 (I Am What I Am)"" (Koch); it was strong enough, in fact, to earn him a new record contract with Atlantic. In ""Move Around,"" the album's first single, Mannie Fresh sings (sort of) the cheerful refrain: ""I'm from the ghetto, homey/ I was raised on bread and baloney/ You can't come around here, 'cause you're phony.""And then there's Lil Wayne, who last fall released ""Tha Carter 2"" (Cash Money/Universal), perhaps the finest album of his career (it has sold about 900,000 copies so far). In his slick lyrics and raspy voice, you can hear a city's swagger and desperation:All I have in this world is a pistol and a promiseYeah, I'm from New Orleans, the Creole cockpitWe so out of itAll right, so this isn't the stuff that feel-good tributes are made of. Despite the topical video, ""Get Ya Hustle On"" is a mishmash of political commentary and drug-dealer rhymes. (The song included the well-known couplet, ""Everybody tryna get that check from FEMA/ So he can go and score him some co-ca-een-uh."") And much of the music portrays New Orleans as a place full of violence and decadence: expensive teeth, cheap women, ""choppers"" (machine guns) everywhere. If you're trying to celebrate the old, festive, tourist-friendly New Orleans, maybe these aren't the locals you want.Furthermore, much of the post-Katrina effort has focused on ""saving"" and ""preserving"" the city's musical heritage. Clearly top-selling rappers don't need charity. In fact, many have been quietly helping, through gifts to fellow residents and hip-hop charities like David Banner's Heal the Hood Foundation.But it's worth remembering that many New Orleans hip-hop pioneers -- from DJ Jimi to the influential group U.N.L.V.-- aren't exactly millionaires. And for that matter, many rappers aren't nearly as rich as they claim. In any case, glowing recollections aren't the only way to pay tribute to the city. The story of Katrina is in large part a story of poverty and neglect; it's no coincidence that many of the rappers come from the same neighborhoods that still haven't been cleaned up. Surely the lyrics to a Juvenile song aren't nearly as shocking as those images most of us saw on television.The language of preservationism sometimes conceals its own biases. If all the dying traditions are valuable, does that also mean all the valuable traditions are dying? If a genre doesn't need saving, does that also mean it's not worth saving? If New Orleans rappers seem less lovable than, say, Mardi Gras Indians or veteran soul singers, might it be because they're less needy? Cultural philanthropy is drawn to musical pioneers -- especially African-American ones -- who are old, poor and humble. What do you do when the pioneers are young, rich and cocky instead?Believe it or not, that question brings us back to the Smithsonian, which has come to praise hip-hop. Or to bury it. Or both. The genre is over 30 years old by now, and while its early stars now seem unimpeachable (does anyone have a bad word to say about Grandmaster Flash or Run-DMC?), its current stars seem more impeachable than ever. From 50 Cent to Young Jeezy to, well, Juvenile, hip-hop might be even more controversial now than it was in the 80's; hip-hop culture has been blamed for everything from lousy schools to sexism to the riots in France. In a weird way, that might help account for the newfound respectability of the old school. To an older listener who's aghast at crack rap, the relatively innocent rhymes of Run-DMC don't seem so bad. If the new generation didn't seem so harmful, its predecessors might not seem harmless enough for the national archives.Maybe the New Orleans hip-hop scene -- ""gangsta gumbo"" -- just hasn't been around long enough to make the history books. But that will change, as the rappers start seeming less like harbingers of an ominous future and more like relics of a colorful past. New Orleans hip-hop will endure not just because the music is so thrilling, but also because the rappers vividly evoke a city that is, for worse and (let's not forget) for better, never going to be the same.After all, long before his name was affixed to an airport, Louis Armstrong, too, seemed manifestly unfit for polite society. Back when he recorded ""Muggles,"" an ode to marijuana, he was a symbol of the so-called ""jazz intoxication"" that was corrupting an earlier generation the way hip-hop is corrupting this one.A quarter-century from now, when the social problems that Juvenile and others so discomfitingly rap about have become one more strand of the city's official history, they may find themselves honored in just the kinds of musical tributes and cultural museums that currently shut them out. By then, their careers will probably have cooled off. They'll be less influential, less popular, less controversial; not coincidentally, they'll have a less visceral connection to the youth of New Orleans. And finally, their music -- and maybe also their recording studios, their custom jewelry, their promotional posters -- will seem to be worth saving. Perhaps, like so many other pop-music traditions, ""gangsta gumbo"" is a dish best preserved cold.'"
"'06-04-23,'0','The neighborhood, too, has surpassed their expectations. ""Here, everyone lives in families,"" Ms. Sorel said. ""I love when the school lets out, and all the mothers and aunts and grandmothers come to pick up the little ones.""""Nobody said 'Good morning' in TriBeCa,"" Mr. Sorel added.""Oh, no!"" Ms. Sorel said. ""Nobody ever paid any attention to anybody else.""The apartment itself is exactly the kind of place that certain New Yorkers will always dream of, despite the recent buzz about modernism. The six-story building with an elegant lobby was completed in 1898, and their apartment, one of two on each floor, has a marble fireplace and carved wood moldings. The worn wood floors look as if they've been burnished with honey.A long hall connects front to back, passing by four rooms along the way, one of which is Ms. Sorel's tidy office, and arriving finally at two additional rooms. One is the couple's bedroom and the other Mr. Sorel's studio -- the most extravagantly messy room in the house, with ink spills on the floor and piles of paper lying about.In all, the place feels less like an apartment than a well-lived-in old house. This impression is bolstered by the furnishings: comfortable odds and ends in which the Sorels take a kind of reverse pride.""It's all secondhand,"" Mr. Sorel said. ""This chair was from a church shop.""""This one you bought for $5,"" Ms. Sorel said.But a visitor could be forgiven for overlooking the furniture altogether and focusing instead on the artwork, which is everywhere, mostly illustrations by Mr. Sorel. ""One thing we loved about moving here was all the wall space,"" said Ms. Sorel, noting that their wide-open loft had offered few places to hang pictures.It's not just the work's ubiquity that draws notice. Mr. Sorel's best drawings are as distracting as a thunderstorm gathering outside. Rendered with seemingly reckless energy, they resolve themselves again and again into gestures of exquisite subtlety. The drama of his subjects' lives is distilled into the perfect curl of a lip, the soft worry on a brow, the murderous rage barely contained behind a public smile.""I handpick my subjects for their complete insanity,"" Mr. Sorel said. ""I love hypocrisy. I'm essentially a mean-spirited person.""He doesn't mind being surrounded by his own work. ""You don't know what a relief it is to finally like your drawings,"" he said. ""For a long time, I knew that my drawings were lousy. If you keep doing something, you get better at it.""The years of struggle had their commensurate residences. There was the $97-a-month apartment that the couple lived in just after they married, in 1965. ""We were completely broke,"" Mr. Sorel said.That was followed by 15 years in an isolated old farmhouse in Putnam County, where the couple raised their two daughters. From there, they moved to Franklin Street, which, Mr. Sorel said, ""was bohemian and down and out in 1982.""""In a peculiar way, we were trying to prove we weren't old and middle-class,"" he added.It's an oddity of real estate that, as neighborhoods change, people have to move to stay in the same place. Coming to Harlem restored a sense of neighborliness to the Sorels' lives that had slowly deteriorated in TriBeCa.But in many ways, the New York they pine for is irretrievably lost. ""There's no cafe life anymore,"" Mr. Sorel said. ""There's no meeting by chance. The dinner party is the big social gathering.""His professional interactions have also grown less spontaneous and convivial over the years. ""There was something so invigorating and amateur"" about magazine offices in the 60's and 70's,"" he said. ""Now everything is very corporate and very cold. It's not all that pleasant -- the high-rise with security at the desk. There are several stages before you get to see anybody, and then they don't want to see you because they're in the middle of something, so you generally meet them in the reception room.""And so goes life in this evolving city: the chummy lunch with an editor is replaced by the terse exchange and chilly handshake; the warm camaraderie of neighborhoods by an impersonal obsession with real estate values; the parent or grandparent by the professional nanny. Yet the Sorels really can't imagine living anywhere but New York.""I feel very much at home here,"" Ms. Sorel said.Her husband does, too. ""I think New York City is essential to my work,"" he said. ""There's something in the air; the tempo is different. Certainly, physically I've proved that I can do it anywhere. I mean, I've been able to do a drawing on Martha's Vineyard!""""I feel nervous when I'm not in New York City,"" he said. ""It's my natural environment. A polar bear really wants to be up at the North Pole. He doesn't want to be in Central Park.""'"

"'06-04-23,'0','Tickets, as well as peanuts, popcorn and hot dogs, are substantially less expensive in the minors than in the big leagues. The best seat in the house for a Staten Island Yankees' game costs $11; a seat at the top of the upper deck of Yankee Stadium is $20.Of course, players in the minor leagues are far less polished than their big-league counterparts, but most people who go to a game already know that. The quality of play is not much better than what it is at, say, a local college game. And the age of most of the players is similar. Only one of the 26 players on the current roster of the Lakewood BlueClaws, the Philadelphia Phillies' Class A affiliate, has celebrated his 24th birthday.Still, minor league officials like to say they have built an audience by emphasizing the notion that a night in Lakewood, Coney Island or Bridgeport is affordable family entertainment.It is an appeal that has resonated.In 2005, the 16 minor league teams in the area drew a total of 3,835,689 fans, or slightly fewer than the record 4,090,440 the Yankees drew last year while playing in a stadium about 10 times the size of an average minor league park.While minor league fans will not get to see Alex Rodriguez swatting a home run for the Yankees or Pedro Martínez pitching to perfection for the Mets, they may get to cavort with a fuzzy mascot or participate in a three-legged race between innings.""If people leave the park without knowing who won or lost the game, then we have done our job,"" said Jim Beaudoin, the general manager of the Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League, a team based in Norwich.Indeed, minor league baseball has become such a cottage industry that it is now regarded as a way to lure families and large groups into redeveloped areas where baseball is just one attraction. Retail shops, restaurants, office space and hotels are often other parts of the package.But a minor league ballpark does not guarantee that the area around it will be developed. For instance, KeySpan Park on Coney Island, where the Brooklyn Cyclones, a Mets' farm team, have played to capacity crowds since 2001, does not appear to have changed its surroundings much.""If a ballpark is not part of a larger urban redevelopment, it's not going to be successful,"" said Mary-Jane Foster, a real estate developer who with her husband, Jack McGregor, owns and operates the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League.That lesson has not been lost on Mr. McGregor and Ms. Foster, who own one of three Atlantic League expansion teams on the drawing board. In their case, a ballpark in Yonkers is to be the jewel of a $3.1-billion downtown renovation project.The two other proposals for the Atlantic League, which was founded in 1998 and is made up of independent teams with no major-league ties, call for new stadiums to be built as part of Meadowlands Xanadu, a shopping center and entertainment complex going up in the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey, and a project in Nassau County on Long Island.For now, Steven B. Kalafer -- a developer and owner of about 30 automobile dealerships who at one time had a stake in every team in the Atlantic League with the exception of the Atlantic City Surf -- also owns a New Jersey franchise called the Bergen Cliff Hawks, which he planned to have play at a ballpark at Xanadu. But for now, the financially troubled developers of Xanadu have failed to produce a plan for the park and Mr. Kalafer is suing them.The Nassau County team, which still does not have a name, will be operated by Frank Boulton, the founder and commissioner of the Atlantic League who already owns three teams in it, including the Long Island Ducks, which has played to capacity crowds at the 6,000-seat Citibank Park in Central Islip since its inception in 1998.Mr. Boulton does not seem to be concerned that his new team will be based about 25 miles west of the Ducks, who drew 429,218 to 70 home dates last season. He conceded in a recent interview that the landscape could become too cluttered with minor league teams, although he insisted that point had not yet been reached.As Mr. Kalafer said, ""The region was simply under-served.""That is not to say that owning a minor league team in the region is a ticket to success.Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who is a leading authority on sports business, said in a telephone interview that while it is hard to have too many minor league teams -- since fans prefer to travel only minutes to a game -- the New York area might well be reaching that point.""I'm exaggerating here, but it's a little bit like having a bowling alley in each community,"" he said.But when it comes to the New York area, with 16 minor league teams and more on the way, Mr. Zimbalist said: ""It sounds to me like 16 is too many. You can certainly have a glut.""Take the New Jersey Cardinals, a farm club of the St. Louis Cardinals, which at the end of last season moved from Sussex County to a new ballpark in State College, Pa., where the team will be called the Spikes. Or the Ravens, an Eastern League affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, who left New Haven, Conn., for Manchester, N.H., where a new ballpark was completed after the 2003 season.""Yale Field did not have some of the amenities you'd like to have in a modern ballpark,"" said Charlie Dowd, the former general manager of the Ravens who is now general manager of the Bridgeport Bluefish.But just as quickly as teams move to other homes, new ones take their place. For instance, Sussex County and New Haven quickly lured franchises from the Can-Am League, another independent league. The New Haven County Cutters entered the league in 2004, and the Sussex Skyhawks will make their debut this season.The Cutters' management spruced up Yale Field, a charming ballpark in West Haven, Conn. As for the Skyhawks, the team spent $1.5 million renovating Skylands Park, in Augusta, yet it sliced ticket and concession prices to woo back fans, and it is focusing heavily on group sales. A box seat that had cost $12 is now $10, and hot dogs, which sold for $3.25, now cost $2.50.""I absolutely think it's a gold mine,"" said the general manager of the Skyhawks, Ben Wittkowski, who had worked for the New Jersey Jackals, another team in the Can-Am League in Montclair. ""It's the only game in town.""Although the Long Island and Somersetteams have always attracted large crowds, other Atlantic League teams have struggled. The Nashua Pride, in New Hampshire, moved to the Can-Am League during the off-season, forcing the eight-team league to replace them with the Road Warriors -- who do not yet have a home park -- to balance the schedule.Another of Mr. Boulton's teams, the Atlantic City Surf, averaged 2,018 fans a game last year at its 5,900-seat stadium, the Sandcastle. The Newark Bears, a New Jersey team that had been owned in part by Mr. Kalafer until late last year, averaged 2,709 in 2005 at the 6,200-seat Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium.""But this will really be the first season since the park has opened that there's not construction going on in front of the site,"" Mr. Kalafer said.The Bridgeport Bluefish were founded in 1998 by a group of investors that included Ms. Foster and her husband, Mr. McGregor. Another member of the group, Mickey Herbert, bought controlling interest in the club in 2000, but Ms. Foster and Mr. McGregor bought the team from him in December 2005.Last season, the Bluefish averaged only 3,036 fans a game at the 5,300-seat Ballpark at Harbor Yard. The team did not have enough money to advertise, a crucial component to success in the minors, said Mr. Dowd, the general manager.This year, Ms. Foster said, the push is on to make the Bluefish enticing to suburban mothers, who usually make the entertainment decisions for their families.""It has not made money,"" Ms. Foster said of the club. ""But we also believe that it can, or else we would not have come back.""Indeed, Ms. Foster says she is so sure of the drawing power of minor league teams that she and her husband plan to run an Atlantic League team in Yonkers, where the stadium will be the hub of that city's redevelopment when it is completed, probably in 2008.""We were really amazed at how Yonkers has turned itself around,"" she said.Even though the downtown area of Yonkers, a city of 200,000, is less than 10 miles from Yankee Stadium and less than 20 miles from Shea, Mayor Philip A. Amicone believes that the team will not be competing for customers with New York's two big-league teams.""To travel to Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium costs a fortune for a family,"" he said. ""Now, Yonkers is going to be a place where people want to come again.""The ballparks on the drawing board for the Meadowlands and in Nassau County will not be in the middle of urban areas, although the goal for each is the same: to draw those seeking affordable family entertainment to a site that also has offices, shops and restaurants.In fact, a ballpark was not originally included in Charles B. Wang's plan to renovate Nassau Coliseum, the home of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League.In addition to a substantially refurbished arena and a sports technology center, Mr. Wang -- the owner of the Islanders and founder of Computer Associates -- wanted his ambitious project to include office towers, hotels, apartment buildings and town houses.Mr. Wang and Reckson Associates, a development company based in Long Island that is his partner in the project, were awarded the project last month over a rival bid by the owners of the Mets, in part because they added a 6,000-seat minor league ballpark to their plan to match the one the Mets proposed.The Meadowlands Xanadu development is no less ambitious. Besides a luxury hotel and office buildings, the Mills Corporation, the lead developer of the site, has vowed that Xanadu will be a 4.8-million-square-foot ""entertainment destination.""What Bergen County stands to gain -- if a ballpark is ever built there -- is a team that it truly can call its own.""It's a community builder, it's something that can bring pride to a community,"" said Steve Cohen, the general manager of the Brooklyn Cyclones. ""We realize that not everyone who comes to a Cyclones game is a die-hard baseball fan.""As Mr. Cohen put it: ""For every two people who walking in are baseball fans, there are two people who aren't. But they leave with a smile on their faces, just like the baseball fans do.""'"

"'06-04-23,'0','Like many other companies, Pfizer has a mighty arsenal, backed by shrewd alliances and relationships with institutional shareholders. The Pfizer battle, governance experts say, illustrates an imbalance of power between company owners and managers that is prevalent today.""The management has these unlimited resources to fight back, and the shareholders are pretty much powerless,"" said John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group. ""The thing has gotten so out of hand that words almost fail me. The shareholders should not tolerate it.""Institutional shareholders, who vote the stock on behalf of their individual investors, are supposed to act in the best interests of those who own the stock, and the institutions questioned said they were careful to avoid conflicts in proxy votes. But shaking up the status quo may not always be in their own interest.Pfizer is known for its assiduous courting of institutional shareholders. One way is through Margaret M. Foran, Pfizer's corporate secretary and vice president for corporate governance, who is co-chairwoman of the board at the Council of Institutional Investors, an influential organization of pension funds. She is also on the board of the International Corporate Governance Network, an institutional investor organization in London. Ms. Foran, who said she is a student of governance issues, added that her involvement in these organizations helped her stay current on best practices at corporations.MANY of Pfizer's biggest institutional stockholders also earn considerable fees for providing money management services to the company. These institutions could fear damaging such relationships by voting against the company. Some members of Pfizer's board serve on boards of firms that are among its larger shareholders, raising questions about their allegiances.Management says Mr. McKinnell is being paid for 35 years of service in an industry that has very long business cycles for attaining measures of success established by the board. It says Pfizer's board continues to strengthen the connection between pay and performance.""We have a duty to the shareholders to articulate and communicate the position of the board and I think that is what the company is intending to do,"" said Stanley O. Ikenberry, president emeritus at the University of Illinois and a member of Pfizer's board and compensation committee. ""Hank McKinnell's compensation is down sharply for the current year, but looked at both in the context of one year and multiple years and in terms of pension, the board has reviewed those issues, discussed them extensively and supports the decisions that have been made.""By contrast, a grass-roots group of businesspeople -- Investors for Director Accountability -- sees a pervasive problem in his pay. ""Mushrooming management compensation, unconnected to performance, is an obvious area where directors have failed the people they legally represent,"" the organization said last month. ""Shareholders should withhold their votes for the four nominees of the Pfizer board of directors who are members of the board's compensation committee. This would be a first step on a long road to restore director accountability to owners.""Glass Lewis & Company of San Francisco, and Institutional Shareholder Services of Rockville, Md. -- two of the nation's three proxy advisory firms -- recommend withholding support from at least one Pfizer director because of questionable pay practices. Mr. Ikenberry is not one of them.The third firm, Proxy Governance Inc. of Vienna, Va., recommends that owners vote in support of the entire board. Proxy Governance has received major support from the Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization for big corporations whose chairman is Mr. McKinnell. The firm says its opinions are free of conflict.But recommendations from proxy advisers, who are paid by institutions for advice on how to vote, are not always heeded -- a vivid example of a power shift outlined by Mr. Bogle, in his book, ""The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism."" Ownership of American companies, he argued, has moved from a diffuse group of individual shareholders into a handful of powerful financial institutions such as mutual funds and banks. These organizations are ""reluctant dragons"" when it comes to exercising corporate citizenship, Mr. Bogle wrote.One reason, he said, ""is the clear conflict of interest they face in managing the retirement plan assets of the very corporations whose shares they own and collectively control.""""Even when a governance or proxy issue involves a corporation that is not a client,"" he added, ""the reluctance to speak out persists, giving credence to this perhaps apocryphal comment by a pension fund manager: 'There are only two types of clients we don't want to offend: actual or potential.' ""Conflicts of interest are not always evident, of course, but the potential for them arises at five investment firms among the top 10 holders of Pfizer shares. These are companies that earn money from Pfizer by managing some part of its pension plan, retirement savings plans or employee 401(k) accounts. And Pfizer directors serve on the boards of three investment firms that hold enough Pfizer stock for their customers to be among the company's top 20 shareholders.PFIZER'S top shareholder is Barclays Global Investors, holding 4.54 percent of the stock outstanding. It also manages three funds offered to Pfizer employees in various 401(k) plans and provides investment management services to Pfizer's pension, from which it generated $2.65 million in 2004, the most recent year for which documents are available.Fidelity Management and Research, which holds 1.62 percent of Pfizer's shares for its customers, also manages several funds offered in Pfizer employee 401(k) and savings plans. Dodge & Cox, holder of almost 1.3 percent of Pfizer's shares, manages a stock fund offered to Pfizer employees in various 401(k) plans and provides investment management services to Pfizer's pension, for which it earned $1.06 million in 2004.Northern Trust, holder of 1.35 percent of Pfizer's shares, made approximately $2 million as trustee of the company's pension and savings plan. It also manages an index fund for Pfizer employees in Puerto Rico. J. P. Morgan Chase, holder of 1.26 percent of Pfizer shares, generated $750,000 in fees from the drug company's pension plan.Jeffrey Diermeier, chairman of the CFA Institute, the nonprofit association that sets performance-reporting standards for the investment industry, said these types of relationships were troubling. ""It is fundamental that multiproduct financial organizations aggressively and proactively deal with these conflicts by actively requiring their asset managers to vote proxies in the interests of their asset management clients and not in their own short-term business interests,"" he said. ""This takes leadership, but it can be done.""An analysis of last year's votes shows that most of these large holders supported Pfizer's board in both the election of its directors and in shareholder proposals.Officials at Fidelity, Dodge & Cox and Northern Trust, for example, supported Pfizer's board completely in 2005, voting for its directors and against all shareholder proposals on its ballot. Barclays' funds also voted for all Pfizer directors, but a handful of the funds voted against management on some matters and supported shareholder proposals such as one recommending that Pfizer separate the roles of chairman and chief executive.Tom Taggart, a spokesman for Barclays Global Investors, said the firm would not discuss how it planned to vote but said ""the investment side of the business is totally separate from the proxy voting side."" He added that Barclays used an outside adviser to determine how it voted.A spokesman for Dodge & Cox funds referred to its proxy voting guidelines, which state that the firm is committed to resolving all potential conflicts in its clients' best interests and uses an outside consultant to determine how it will vote. Northern Trust's spokesman said this was also the case at his firm. J. P. Morgan Chase and Fidelity said they vote their clients' shares without regard for any of their firms' other relationships.TIAA-CREF, the money management firm that counts Mr. Ikenberry as president of its board of overseers, also voted alongside Pfizer's board last year. Mr. Ikenberry said that he had had absolutely no discussion with the firm on the issue of voting Pfizer shares. A spokesman for TIAA-CREF said that members of the board of overseers have no role in voting of proxy matters at the firm.OTHER Pfizer directors also serve on boards of financial services firms, such as Goldman Sachs, a holder of 0.82 percent of the company's shares; J. P. Morgan Chase; and trust units of Deutsche Bank, which holds 1.36 percent.Representatives of those firms said their directors have no influence whatsoever over voting decisions made by their asset management units.Frederick E. Rowe Jr., chairman of Greenbrier Partners, a money management firm in Dallas, and head of the Texas Pension Review Board, is the point man for the grass-roots organization aiming at Pfizer.""It's not 80/20 or 90/10,"" Mr. Rowe said. ""One hundred percent of the people we've talked to on the phone and on the Web are outraged at what has happened in executive compensation in general and at Pfizer in particular. I know Pfizer has long-term relationships with institutional holders and they have lots of business to pass around, but I am hopeful that the institutions will vote the way 100 percent of the true owners of Pfizer would want them to vote.""Shareholder inertia may be a big factor in keeping the status quo at Pfizer. Along with the stock they own directly, institutions hold stock for individual investors in their vaults for safekeeping. Those shares will be voted as Pfizer's board directs unless investors give other instructions to their brokers. Last year, 1.4 billion Pfizer shares, or 20 percent of the stock outstanding, received no instructions from their true owners and were voted with the company's board.Likewise, if the holders of Pfizer stock in the company's 401(k)'s and pension plans do not instruct the trustees how to vote, those shares will be voted in the same ratio that those providing instruction voted. If, for example, 80 percent of Pfizer's shares voted in favor of its directors, 80 percent of the pension plan shares receiving no instruction would also be voted for those directors.Gary Lutin, an investment banker at Lutin & Company in New York and an adviser in corporate control contests, said: ""The Pfizer case shows that even prominent, good corporate citizens need to be monitored. All the best governance theories won't make any difference if investors don't bother to watch the people who are supposed to be guarding their property.""'"

"'06-04-24,'0','Five years earlier, before similar elections, Vittorio Sgarbi, then deputy culture minister in Silvio Berlusconi's conservative government, also opposed the planned museum. His protests contributed to a year's delay in construction. Mr. Sgarbi is no longer in government, and Mr. Berlusconi has lost his job as prime minister, but Mr. Sgarbi has returned to the fray. ""It's the worst monument ever built in Rome,"" he said.The Ara Pacis itself, though, has its own political history.The altar was commissioned by the Roman Senate in 13 B.C. and inaugurated in 9 B.C. to honor Augustus for ""pacifying"" Gaul and Spain. In one frieze, the emperor appears in a procession with priests, loyal aides and family members. Other reliefs identify him with the heroic Aeneas and with Romulus and Remus, the city's mythical founders. Carvings of cattle, swans, insects, flowers and fruit underline the message that, under Augustus, Romans enjoyed peace and prosperity.The altar, which was placed in the Campus Martius, or the field of war, was probably destroyed after Rome fell to the Barbarians. But early last century, parts were traced to museums in Florence and Rome (as well as the Louvre in Paris) and other pieces were found in excavations. In the late 1930's, Mussolini ordered the altar's reconstruction and installed it in a building designed by Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo beside the Tiber.Mussolini's motivation was unambiguous: he saw himself as a new Augustus. A wall of Morpurgo's building carried the text of ""Res Gestae Divi Augusti,"" or ""Deeds of the Divine Augustus,"" the emperor's memoirs recounting his triumphs. (This wall is the only piece of the old building retained by Mr. Meier.) Such was Mussolini's pride in his ""new"" Ara Pacis that he included it in Hitler's tour of Rome in 1938.In that sense, then, the Ara Pacis has now been rescued from its Fascist association, if not from politics. Mr. Rutelli, himself a center-left politician, invited criticism when he chose Mr. Meier as the project's architect without an open competition. The city council eventually approved the plan, but things moved slowly. Finally, in 2000, after a protective structure was built around the Ara Pacis, Morpurgo's building was demolished.But, partly in response to Mr. Sgarbi's campaigning, lengthy archaeological studies brought fresh delays. Finally, after Mr. Veltroni became mayor, construction began in spring 2003. The Ara Pacis, which remained in place throughout, was unwrapped in ceremony in September.Mr. Meier, who three years ago built a modern church in a Rome suburb, said he felt confident that the new museum would in time be fully accepted. ""There's a lightness here that is different from that of old museums,"" he said. ""You see the city in a totally different way from this building. The city becomes alive from your experience of being here.""Certainly, Mr. Veltroni could not be happier, not least because he sees this ""marvelous work,"" as he put it, as a precursor of a still more ambitious modernization of Rome.In fact, much is already happening. While situated in a suburb, Renzo Piano's new Parco della Musica auditorium is now generally applauded. And among other big-name architects, Zaha Hadid is building the Maxxi contemporary art and architecture center outside the city walls, and Santiago Calatrava has designed a new sports complex in the suburb of Tor Vergata.""This is a city where you can go from Bernini to Michelangelo to Julius Caesar to Meier,"" Mr. Veltroni said. ""This is what we want to protect, Rome's double identity. There is no contradiction between the beauty of the past and the beauty of the present.""'"

"'06-04-24,'0','Users so far have shown lackluster interest in Viiv, the name Intel gave to a set of technologies for multimedia computing.But even if Intel is successful in establishing the new business brand, the landscape of the chip industry has been transformed. Where there was once a single preferred source of chips for personal computers, there are now two competitive suppliers: Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.""Before this, A.M.D. was a wannabe, with inconsistent quality and enhancements,"" Mr. Brookwood said. ""But they've changed the dynamics of the industry.""How much the momentum of the two companies has diverged became clear in recent earnings announcements. Last week, Intel reported a drop in profit and gross profit margin. And it lowered its forecast for the full year, saying it now expected revenue to decline 3 percent from last year's $38.8 billion, rather than improve 6 percent to 9 percent.Advanced Micro's results, announced a week earlier, painted a different picture. For the first time, its first-quarter gross margin, at 58.4 percent, surpassed Intel's 54.9 percent -- reflecting the price-cutting that Intel has undertaken to try to win back sales. And A.M.D. executives put the company's target for gross profit margin at 55 percent to 60 percent for this quarter, compared with Intel's 50 percent, plus or minus a couple of points, excluding share-based compensation effects of approximately 1 percent. (The expected reduction from first-quarter levels is primarily a result of a higher proportion of lower-margin products in the overall mix, along with higher microprocessor unit costs.) Advanced Micro's first quarter represented its 11th consecutive period of significantly better sales growth than Intel.Investors have taken notice. Advanced Micro's stock, though it has recently given up some gains, has risen 43 percent in the last six months and 117 percent in the last year, closing Friday at $31.73. Intel shares have dropped 18 percent in the last six months, to $19.06.How much market share Intel lost in the first quarter on either a per-unit or dollar basis will not be known for a week, when market research companies release updated figures.But it remains much the larger company. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Intel's share declined to about 78 percent of the overall microprocessor business, from 82 percent a year earlier, while Advanced Micro's share rose to 21 percent, from 17 percent, according to Mercury Research.Both companies are expected to benefit from pent-up demand that will be generated by the release of the Windows Vista operating system at year's end. But even more significant to Intel's effort to regain momentum is a fundamental new chip design that the company says it will begin to roll out in the third quarter.""The new core microarchitecture is incredibly important,"" Mr. Brookwood said, ""because the old architecture is what got them into this problem. Intel thought clock speed could drive performance for a decade, but they were wrong.""Instead, Intel discovered that gains in processing speed came at the price of greater power consumption and heat, forcing it to rethink its design approach and find other ways to achieve performance.Advanced Micro was able to address the same goal more quickly, without having to overhaul its basic chip architecture, and as a result managed to leapfrog Intel in performance.While Intel says it will have its problems under control in the second half of the year, not all analysts are convinced that it will meet its goal of returning to normal seasonal growth.Mr. Brookwood is among the optimists. ""As this year unfolds, Intel will become more competitive,"" he said. ""The company is completing a two-year program digging out of the hole it got itself into.""But Eric Ross of ThinkEquity Partners, said, ""I'm not convinced they will see the growth they're expecting in the second half.""For its part, Advanced Micro is trying to take advantage of every opportunity afforded by Intel's missteps as an opportunity to gain more of the market. ""Our share gains continue,"" the chief executive, Hector Ruiz, said in a conference call with analysts after the company's earnings release. ""We believe that once again, we took dollar share across server, notebook and desktop product offerings.""Andy D. Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, said last week that Intel did not lose market share in terms of units during the first quarter, ended April 1, though he acknowledged that it might have lost market share as measured by revenue -- again a reflection of Intel's price-cutting.In the American retail market for personal computers -- excluding direct-to-consumer sellers like Dell -- Advanced Micro surged slightly past Intel last October, with its processors in 49.8 percent of all desktop and notebook computers sold, compared with 48.5 percent for Intel.A.M.D. has forged an ever-closer relationship with some of its best customers, notably Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. Some analysts have speculated that Dell, long a loyal Intel customer, may choose to increase its use of Advanced Micro chips, which are typically less expensive than Intel's.Dell's share of the worldwide PC market fell slightly in the first quarter of 2006, to 18.1 percent, from 18.6 percent in the period a year earlier, according to the market researcher IDC. Today, the only Dell computers that do not use Intel chips are those marketed under the Alienware label, which Dell acquired last month.Henri Richard, Advanced Micro's senior vice president for worldwide sales, took issue with those predicting an Intel comeback. ""For some reason, analysts think history will repeat itself,"" he said in an interview. ""I would argue that things are different now. We didn't have the breadth and depth of success we have now.""Things will not be the same inside Intel either. Paul S. Otellini, who took over as chief executive last spring, said last week that the company had begun undergoing the most significant analysis of its efficiencies since the 1980's. To help the bottom line, Mr. Bryant told analysts, Intel planned to cut more than $1 billion this year, taking about $400 million from research and development and $600 millionout of administration and marketing.Advanced Micro asserts that one of the few things holding it back is Intel's ""monopolistic"" business tactics. That, Advanced Micro hopes, will be addressed by a three-judge panel in California that is hearing its case in an antitrust suit it filed against Intel last summer.Lawyers for the two companies have already met in court to begin establishing a timetable for the case, and are expected to do so again in September. Advanced Micro has asked that the trial begin in the first quarter of 2008, while Intel is asking for a start in September 2008. Litigation over one matter or another has been a constant factor in the two companies' relationship over several years.If Intel's new chip initiative succeeds, the competitive equation could look different by then. And Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates, says investors are jumping too quickly to the conclusion that Intel's troubles cannot be repaired in the next few quarters.""Things are in place for Intel to roll back A.M.D.'s gains,"" Mr. Kumar said. ""Last year was unique. But it's just one bad year out of many for Intel, and one good year out of many for A.M.D.""'"
"'06-04-24,'0','Increasingly, what goes on behind a studio's gates is growing less rarefied than during the studios' heyday. Each now has a gift shop with studio products. Warner Brothers in Burbank, Calif., has a Starbucks in its gift shop and a Poquito Más -- a Mexican-style fast-food chain -- inside the less expensive of its two commissaries.According to several regular Hollywood diners, the last significant upgrade at the studios was the Rotunda, a restaurant for executives and their guests on the Walt Disney Studios Burbank lot as part of a larger architectural reconstruction in 1990. Featuring Doric columns, generally cool temperatures and an unobstructed view of fellow diners, the Rotunda admits only Disney employees and their guests.""I still like the Disney Rotunda the best,"" said Jim Wedaa, an independent movie producer who got his start as an executive on the Disney lot. ""Because the service there is the best, and it feels like a real restaurant in the middle of an office building.""Having had more than 5,000 business lunches in Hollywood (by his own account), he welcomes the notion of a Grill outpost at Paramount, should it come to pass.""It would make the lot the hottest commissary in town,"" he said, explaining that the lunch ritual still has some of the old magic, especially if an executive is asking guests to wend their way through snarled traffic for lunch. ""It's a total power play when people ask, 'You want to come over to the lot?' ""Starting as a place to feed your employees cheaply and quickly in the days of silent films, the cafeteria-style commissary soon spawned a white-tablecloth sibling, the executive dining room. The term ""commissary"" is often used interchangeably between the two, even as studios retained both.To some, inroads made by outside franchises such as the Grill spell an eventual end to the intangible mystery of eating in the same spot where Veronica Lake may have once tucked into her salad across from Alan Ladd.""When I go to lunch at a studio, I always get the sense that I am a part of that studio's history,"" said Jon Klane, an independent producer. ""For instance, the Fox commissary is where Shirley Temple had her birthday party. And if the Grill is going to superimpose their brand, then I think it's going to be the death of that history. But it's emblematic of what's happening at the studios right now; they're squeezing every last piece of the pie.""Jonathan Lemkin, a prolific screenwriter who just wrote the script for an action movie starring Mark Wahlberg, to be distributed by Paramount next year, says the commissary mystique is not threatened by the possibility of a Grill franchise.""I think the opposite is true. I'd be thrilled if there was even better food,"" said Mr. Lemkin. ""But, look, you're talking to someone who has his meals delivered six days a week.""'"

"'06-04-25,'0','The nub of the disagreement is around whether — and how quickly — the new government will hold a vote to redraw the country's constitution and decide on the fate of the monarchy and the king's precise role. Party leaders, in interviews today, insisted that the king, late Monday, had conceded to their entire roadmap for peace, which includes the referendum on the constitution.The skeptics — and they include the parties' younger, more radical foot soldiers responsible for sustaining three weeks of defiant street demonstrations — pointed out that the king's speech did not explicitly mention the vote on the constitution.Nor did the anger towards the monarchy dissipate on Katmandu's streets. ""Hang Thief Gyaney,"" a clutch of demonstrators chanted today, just as they have for the last 20 days. Several held up photos of security forces accused in the fatal shooting of demonstrators.In the city center, less than a mile from Narayanhiti Palace, protesters dislodged metal billboards carrying the words of the king. ""Monarchy is always guided by the optimum interest and continuous progress of Nepal and the Nepali people, not by cheap popularity,"" read one. His words lay crushed on the street, and young men took turns stomping on them with great delight.The king is regarded by his followers as an earthly descendant of a Hindu god. Whether he had managed to save his crown by the concessions made Monday night remains to be seen. Certainly he gave up much more than he wanted to, and undoubtedly placed the institution of the monarchy in peril.Katmandu remained in the grip of rambunctious demonstrations all day, though the mood was palpably less menacing today than previously. There were celebrations on the street, but also tough warnings to the party leaders not to renege on their promise of a vote on the constitution.""Now the ball is in the court of the seven-party alliance,"" cried Gagan Thapa, the leader of the youth faction of Nepali Congress, not far from the home of the chosen, Mr. Koirala, who was nowhere to be seen. ""They should fulfill the commitment they have made to the people.""Mr. Thapa promised to continue the demonstrations until the party leaders announced a date for the constitutional vote. ""Our movement is still on,"" the crowd yelled around him.""The leaders shouldn't get weak in the knees,"" Dhundi Raj Dahal declared, during an impromptu rally in the eastern outskirts of the city. ""If they get weak, yesterday's antiking anger will be redirected against them.""The paralyzed capital, in the vise of two weeks of curfew and nearly three weeks of a general strike, came to life in the flash of one night. Beauty salons and bakeries reopened. Vegetable markets remained open all day. Taxis plied the roads. Soldiers vanished from view, even from around the palace where they had formed a strict cordon the day before.""I think the solution is not too far,"" said a hopeful Resham Shrestha, who managed to open his coffee shop for the first time in nearly three weeks. The political crisis cost Mr. Shrestha nearly $300, a crippling amount in this, one of the world's poorest countries. That a hard road lay ahead did not go unnoticed by party leaders. They said they realize all too well that their only hope for bringing peace to this country and holding on to power is to wean the Maoists off the gun and into the corridors of power.The Maoists and the Seven-Party Alliance last fall signed an accord that obliges the politicians to accept the Maoists' demand for a vote on the constitution, while at the same time obliging the Maoists to agree to play by the rules of parliamentary democracy. It is a significant retreat from the Maoists' original goal of establishing a one-party Communist state. The mystery now is whether they mean what they say.""We will try our best, using our wisdom, to convince them to come towards the political mainstream,"" added Mr. Khanal, a central committee member of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist).Going forward, the Maoists may not have it easy either. Their war has cost an estimated 13,000 lives over the last 10 years and not succeeded in bringing them to power. There seems no military solution in sight. Their only chance of coming to power and pushing through broad social reforms, starting with the demand for a kingless democratic republic, depends largely on their alliance with the politicians.Among the questions looming is not simply whether the politicians will keep their promise of a constitutional referendum, but whether they will go so far as to ask people to vote on the future of the monarchy itself — or settle for what one Western diplomat called ""an implicit agreement"" to hold on to the institution in a ceremonial role.Second, will the parties be able to persuade the Maoists to at least put down their guns, while elections are under way? Third, will the new government be able to persuade the military to declare a cease-fire, with an invitation to the Maoists to reciprocate?""The parties have taken power,"" said one European diplomat. ""Now they must demonstrate they have it. They must push all the way to the boundary of what's possible.""Nepal's most important ally, India, today also pointed to the tough tests that lay ahead.""We are conscious of the challenges that lie ahead for Nepal as it embarks on the journey towards restoring political stability, achieving economic recovery and finding a peaceful solution to the armed conflict,"" its foreign ministry said in a statement. ""These challenges will require the positive contribution of all concerned, drawing upon the support of the people of Nepal.""'"
"'06-04-25,'0','Russian business and the state of its economy and politics dominated headlines following an annual gathering of executives and investors in London, known as the Russian Economic Forum. During the first day of meetings, some of Russia's most prominent businessmen talked up the Russian economy and a series of planned initial public offerings, despite concerns about state interference. Vedomosti, a privately owned newspaper paper known for its independent voice, noted that increasing government control over business stifled the usually critical, freewheeling atmosphere of the forum. ""Even at a distance of 2,500 kilometers Russian businessmen are not able to either criticize authorities or fight with them,"" the paper wrote. The article went on to recall speeches at previous forums by opposition leaders, including Mikhail Kasyanov, who at one forum inveighed against the Kremlin for its lack of transparency and corruption. Mr. Kasyanov, however, was not invited to attend this year by the forum's organizers, a coalition of companies. The sole dissenting voice, according to Vedemosti, was Pyotr Aven, the president of Alfa Bank, who remarked that despite Russia's economic growth and energy-fueled budget surplus, the average pension was still trailing in world statistics.Vremya Novostei, a newspaper often seen as sympathetic to Kremlin policy, focused on the economic benefits that the planned public offerings could bring to Russia. The paper reported that RAO Unified Energy System and Russia's Railroads system are among the companies planning to go public. ""The market is at its peak,"" the owner of ESN Energo, Grigory Berezkin, told Vedemosti, echoing the praise of other chief executives and financial experts. Rosneft, a growing state oil company, reiterated its intentions to make its shares available to the world market; some analysts predict it will be the largest offering ever. The president of the investment bank Deutsche UFG, Ilya Shcherbovich, was quoted by Vremya as saying that Rosneft's public offering ""could place Russia among the three countries with the largest primary source of investment, after the United States and Great Britain.""SECRET BUNKER DISCOVERED: The paper reported that a secret bunker was discovered under Hotel Rossiya, which allegedly leads to the Kremlin and to a supposed government metro line called ""number 2.""NEW TWIST IN MURDER OF ARMENIAN: Police arrested a suspect in the murder of a 17-year-old Armenian student, who claims that he killed the student not because of his nationality, as was originally suspected, but over a girl. Some say, however, that the turn of events is an attempt by authorities to protect the country's image following a recent outburst of hate crimes, rather than a sincere attempt to tackle the problem of racial and ethnic violence in Russia.PARTY SUPPORTS WTO BID: United Russia, the pro-Kremlin parliamentary majority, announced its approval of Russia's attempt to join the World Trade Organization. The party's step was seen as an effort to support President Vladimir V. Putin's bid to join the organization, despite concerns at home about the impact of its provisions.'"
"'06-04-25,'0','In the United States, men confident about their paternity are almost always right, but those who insist that children are not their own are correct only 30 percent of the time, a new study finds.A review of more than 65 studies of paternity has concluded that actual rates of nonpaternity — cases in which a man incorrectly believes he is biologically related to a child — are much lower than the widely cited 10 percent.""Many of our beliefs about nonpaternity are based on anecdotes or hearsay,"" said Kermyt G. Anderson, the lead author of the study and a professor of anthropology at the University of Oklahoma. ""We don't know exactly how many men think they're the father and how many don't. But the 10 percent figure is almost certainly inflated.""Using the most extensive data on nonpaternity rates assembled to date, the researchers tentatively concluded that men confident about their paternity are usually right: they are biologically unrelated only 1.7 percent to 3.7 percent of the time.Those who insist they are not the fathers, on the other hand, are in fact the biological fathers in more than 70 percent of cases, a figure derived from data released by paternity testing laboratories.The researchers found that figures varied widely depending on the group examined, and they cited published studies that included a range of nonpaternity rates from four-tenths of 1 percent in Sephardic Kohanim, or Jewish priests; 3.7 percent in Britain; 9.1 percent among the Yanomamo of Brazil; and up to 11.8 percent in some parts of Mexico. The review will appear in June in Current Anthropology.'"
"'06-04-25,'0','For the elderly, bereavement or an unhappy marriage may weaken the effectiveness of a flu vaccine, but other stresses do not appear to affect the immune system's response to the shots, as they do in younger people.British researchers gave blood tests to 184 people over 65 to establish whether they had antibodies to influenza virus strains. The participants also filled out detailed questionnaires about recent life events, social support, marital status and satisfaction and health habits. Finally, they each received a flu vaccine effective against three different strains of virus. The results appear in the May issue of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.At a test at one month after the vaccination, 32 percent of the group who had suffered the death of a family member or friend during the previous year had a significantly weakened antibody response to two of the strains compared with those who had not endured such a stress. Those who were happily married or living with a partner had a significantly increased antibody response to one of the strains compared with those who were not. These factors remained significant even after adjusting for other factors that might affect the production of antibodies.According to studies cited in the article, vaccine response in younger people is also affected by stressful events, including some much less serious than bereavement.Anna Phillips, the study's lead author and a research fellow at the University of Birmingham, said that interventions with the elderly may ""improve marital quality in the married, or cope with bereavement in the bereaved, which might in turn have a positive effect on the immune response to the flu vaccine.""'"
"'06-04-25,'0','I SPEND most of the year on the road with a pickup truck hauling a 32-foot trailer carrying a portable swimming pool and scuba gear.I visit all kinds of places -- food festivals, air shows, trade conventions, anywhere there are people -- set up the pool, fill it with 27,000 gallons of water and invite people to try diving.On some level, what I'm doing is so unusual and unexpected that people have a difficult time believing me. I parked at a truck stop in Texas recently, far away from the closest body of diveable water, and another motorist pulled alongside my trailer.""What you got in there?"" he asked.I tried to sound convincing, but he just rolled his eyes. Would you believe anyone who said that at a truck stop in Texas?Setting up the pool is the most difficult part of the job. A lot of things can go wrong, and they often do. At a boat show in Norwalk, Conn., recently, the water started out running clear, but about halfway through the process it turned dark brown. I had to empty the pool and start over. Then the heater broke down. I have to heat the water to 86 to 90 degrees. Otherwise it would be an unpleasant experience, even for someone wearing a neoprene wetsuit.In Mexico City, the pool water had to be trucked in. When I added the chlorine -- poof! -- suddenly it billowed black clouds underwater. The water had reacted to the chlorine and was completely unusable. I had to retire five filters that day, and after several attempts to fill the pool, I finally found the noncombustible variety of Mexican water at a bottling plant.'"
"'06-04-25,'0','This means coming up not just with minor hits, but with breakthrough inventions like the Apple iPod or the Sony Walkman. Otherwise, Samsung risks the same fate as many of the once-formidable Japanese electronics giants it overtook on its way to the top.""We are at a pivotal moment for the company,"" said Mr. Kim, a vice president in charge of long-term research and development. ""If we don't become an innovator, we could end up like one of those Japanese companies, mired in difficulties.""Mr. Kim is helping lead Samsung's push to reach this goal, which the company is pursuing with the same ferocity and determination that it has used to conquer global markets. The company plans to invest $40 billion in research and development during the next five years, double what it spent in the preceding five years. It has more than doubled its number of researchers, to 32,000, from 13,900 six years ago.Nowhere is Samsung's effort to reinvent itself more apparent than here in Suwon, where the company has built what it calls the largest research and development center in Asia. In recent years, it has erected towering glass offices and sprawling laboratories with space for 15,000 engineers. The center stands on the site of the company's original 1969 electric fan factory.Suwon's newest facility is the Digital Research Center, completed in September, with the floor space of 30 football fields and audiovisual labs big enough for 9,000 researchers, though it has so far hired only 5,200. Of those, 150 are from foreign countries, including China, India and the United States.Mr. Kim said the new labs reflected Samsung's shift from simply developing products toward basic research to find the next big idea.""If you look at Samsung's R.& D. 10 years ago, we had a lot more D. than R.,"" Mr. Kim said from his office here. ""Today, R. is getting much more attention.""If any company can transform itself, analysts say, Samsung can.With a market value exceeding $96 billion, Samsung has done well, they say, because it is the rare corporate giant that remains nimble on its feet. It excels at identifying new technologies and business opportunities early, and then seizing control of the market with overwhelming production volume.It did this perhaps most successfully with a new form of rear-projection TV, which replaced the first generation of bulky, dimly lighted sets that were the original big-screen televisions. The company saw its chance to break into the American market when Texas Instruments approached it at a 2001 trade show in Tokyo, Samsung executives said.Texas Instruments gave Samsung information about a computer chip it had developed that used millions of microscopic mirrors embedded in a rotating disk to project bright full-color images onto screens. The American company had already shopped the chip to the Japanese makers Hitachi, Matsushita and Mitsubishi Electric, who were each developing a single TV model, the executives said.Samsung jumped on the new technology, producing its first prototype within 12 months, in January 2002. Over the next months, Samsung introduced three models using the technology, called digital light processing, with prices for TV's ranging from $3,500 to $5,000, less than half the Japanese makers' prices at the time. By December 2003, Samsung had produced a million of the TV's, becoming the market leader.""This new technology was the chance we needed,"" said David Steel, a vice president in Samsung's digital media division in Suwon. ""Then we ruthlessly executed by moving faster than the competition, not only to catch up but to pass.""Mr. Steel says one secret to Samsung's speed is that it makes almost every major electronics component itself, from computer chips to plasma screens. Often, building new products means simply assembling these components in new combinations. He said this also permitted Samsung to go in new directions, building multifunctionality into household electronics and other consumer goods.Samsung offers a camcorder that can also serve as an iPod-like music player, voice recorder, portable TV set and computer flash drive. One refrigerator model has a built-in tablet computer that not only controls temperature but also permits users to surf the Internet, watch television and send e-mail messages. One cellphone model works like a full-fledged digital camera and also plays music.""We think big trends like convergence, and the move to wireless and networking, will play to our strengths,"" Mr. Steel said. Mr. Steel, a British citizen with a doctorate in physics, exemplifies a recent push by Samsung to attract foreign talent. Hired in 1999, he was the first non-Korean to reach top management.Samsung's rivals see it as a formidable competitor but not yet a trailblazer. But that could change soon, they say.""Our TVs are better,"" Nobuyuki Oneda, Sony's chief financial officer, said in an interview earlier this year. ""But Samsung's cash flow is amazing. It is hard to invest in and develop products"" at the same pace as Samsung. Another new Samsung strength, analysts say, is design. The company has design centers in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tokyo, Shanghai and Milan. Recent designs for flat-panel TV's are based on trends from furniture shows in Italy.At headquarters in Seoul, designers are told to find inspiration outside the office, and are given Wednesday afternoons off to do so, said Christian Collins, a senior manager in Samsung's cellphone division. One popular cellphone was modeled after the dashboard of a German sports car, said Mr. Collins, an American hired away from Verizon Wireless to work for Samsung.Executives also note that Samsung has reinvented itself before.When the company was founded as part of the Samsung industrial group, it was so little known that the only market where it could sell its first black-and-white TV sets was Panama. By the early 1990's, Samsung had become a successful producer of cheap commodity electronics, many of them sold under different brand names.Then Lee Kun Hee, Samsung group chairman, started a sweeping makeover, pushing the company to focus on quality instead of quantity. ""Change everything but your family,"" Mr. Lee told his work force.Samsung pushed its way up the technological ladder, elbowing aside previous incumbents, most of them Japanese. In 1992, it became the world's largest producer of memory chips. In 1995, it made its first liquid-crystal display screen, a technology it eventually mastered to the point that the former front-runner, Sony, joined it in a joint venture to build L.C.D. screens.Samsung has also tried hard to improve its international image. It has spent more than $6 billion since 1998 on marketing, helping sponsor the last five Olympics and erecting a large video sign in Times Square in 2002.But for all its accomplishments, Samsung has failed to win the sort of brand recognition enjoyed by companies like Apple and Sony. Stepping up to the next level of corporate advancement, analysts say, requires inventing a product that reshapes an entire industry and serves as an icon for a generation.Apple did it with the iPod, as Sony did a generation earlier with the Walkman, a 1979 product that still gives the company a technological cachet of cool that Samsung lacks.""Samsung is a great company, but its products are still basically identical to everyone else's,"" said J. J. Park, an electronics analyst in the Seoul office of J. P. Morgan Securities. ""Samsung is still waiting for its Walkman.""While acknowledging that it has not had such a hit product yet, Samsung says its push to turn itself into a research powerhouse is already showing results. Last year, Samsung registered 1,641 patents in the United States, ranking fifth among companies, behind Matsushita of Japan but ahead of Intel.Executives say it is only a matter of time before Samsung comes up with a hit that will catapult it into the pantheon of global innovators.""Those sort of innovative products come once in a generation,"" said Mr. Collins, of Samsung's cellphone division. ""We've had lots of semi-iconic products, and we will have an iconic product soon enough.""'"
"'06-04-25,'0','Congress is debating legislation that may accelerate this process, although there is disagreement over how much pressure should be imposed on plant owners. A bill introduced by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, would give plant owners the option of replacing chemicals as a way to improve security, while a separate bill introduced by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, would require certain plants to use safer technology if it was considered practical.The biggest safety improvements have occurred at sewage and water treatment plants. Nationwide, 207 of them have switched to less hazardous processes, most often by replacing chlorine gas with liquid chlorine bleach or ultraviolet light as the primary treatment process.Chlorine gas is much more dangerous because if a storage tank, often a rail car, is pierced or blown up, the gas could form a cloud that could kill thousands of people. One of the plants that stopped using it, Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant in the District of Columbia, included 1.7 million people in its hazard zone.An additional 29 manufacturing or electrical power plants also switched chemicals, including Cargill Inc. factories in Memphis and in Eddyville, Iowa, which had used anhydrous sulfur dioxide to soften corn for corn syrup and animal feed. The chemical, which is extremely hazardous, has been replaced by sodium bisulfite, which is a solid and therefore considered much less of a threat.The study was conducted by contacting 1,800 chemical plants, factories, water utilities and other facilities that had dropped off an Environmental Protection Agency list of industrial facilities that handle significant quantities of extremely hazardous substances. A total of 284 plants either replied to a questionnaire or a follow-up interview about why they were no longer on the list; of those, 225 had made the switch after the terrorist attacks.Of the plants, 217 said concern over an accidental chemical release had motivated the switch. One hundred and seventeen cited concern over terrorism or a desire to improve security. The cost of changing varied widely, from less than $100,000 to more than $20 million. Several plant managers said in interviews on Monday that the new approaches had also resulted in higher operating costs.The total population put at risk by all 284 plants, according to E.P.A. data, was about 38 million, the report said.That number overstates the extent of the actual risk, because it assumes that a major accident would discharge the toxic chemical in a circle around the plant, when in reality chemical leaks generally form much narrower plumes driven by wind and other factors, said Richard A. Falkenrath, a former deputy homeland security adviser at the White House.'"
"'06-04-25,'0','The boycott of commerce, work and school is intended to reflect the impact that immigrants have on the economy, they said, and to protest many of the harshest proposals under review in Congress for dealing with illegal immigrants.Not all immigrant advocates and leaders are supporting the boycott. Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, an outspoken advocate of rights for illegal immigrants, has cautioned against taking part in an action that he suggested might cause a public-opinion backlash.But here, and in a cluster of nearby communities that together form one of the hubs of Long Island's Hispanic population, there is an apparent consensus that without flexing its economic muscle, the immigrant community will lose the momentum some feel it has gained during the past weeks of demonstrations across the country.""Our intention is to show those who write our laws that we value our workers in this land, a land made of immigrants,"" said Nelson Hernandez, the owner of a real estate company, Legacy Homes, who will join his 20 employees in showing support for a lenient approach to illegal immigrants.Chris Lopez, the manager of a wholesale grocery supplier, Jimenez Wholesale in Freeport, that supplies more than 300 small groceries and bodegas on Long Island, said that immigration reform was a matter of survival for businessmen like himself and his clients.""If they pass the worst bills, we could lose all our customers,"" he said. ""It's better to close for one day than to close forever.""Mr. Lopez came illegally to the United States in 1979 from the Dominican Republic. He said he earned his citizenship after marrying an American, the mother of his four children. ""One graduated just now from Stony Brook,"" he said. ""And the other three are going to go to college, too.""Under the harshest measures passed by the House of Representatives, but not included in the major bills before the Senate, it would be a felony to live in the United States without visa documents, an immigration status that is currently treated only as a violation of civil law.A Senate bill favored by immigration advocates, including the business owners who gathered yesterday, would permit most illegal immigrants to remain in the country legally, and to earn citizenship over time.""For me, this is the best country,"" said Mr. Carmona, the co-owner of Pollos Mario, a two-story place with uniformed servers and $8 entrees that seem too much to eat in one sitting. ""It gives me a chance to work, and that is all I wanted."" He, his wife and a 19-year-old daughter live in a rented house in Flushing, Queens, and hope to buy a home when they can afford it.Of his 32 employees, he said, about half are legal and the rest he cannot vouch for. ""When I need a dishwasher, I hire the guy who comes for the job,"" he said, leaving unsaid two facts of life in America as he knows them: Illegal immigrants often take jobs that others will not. And he was once one of them.'"

"'06-04-25,'0','Still, Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox's chief executive, made no attempt to sugarcoat the quarter. ""Clearly, I am disappointed in our gross profit decline,"" she told analysts on a conference call yesterday.Several factors contributed to the shortfall. Xerox sharply cut prices on some black and white copiers, which increased sales but hurt margins. Gross margins were 40.2 percent for the quarter, a drop of 1.6 percentage points from last year.In addition, many senior maintenance people took voluntary buyouts last year, and Xerox invested heavily in training less experienced workers to service high-end equipment.Xerox also signed several contracts to manage document flow for other companies. The revenue from those contracts will start coming in next quarter, but Xerox has already incurred the costs of hiring workers to fulfill the contracts.Nuvera, a printer that Xerox introduced last year that can print 144 pages a minute, got off to a slow start, in part because it did not have the binding, stapling and other finishing abilities that book publishers normally require. Xerox has just introduced the finishing ability, and expects its sales to increase accordingly.Ms. Mulcahy reassured analysts that Xerox will meet earnings expectations of $1 to $1.10 for the year. But investors may be a hard sell. ""The sales aren't there, and there are just too many moving parts on the cost side,"" said Ulysses A. Yannas, who follows Xerox for Buckman, Buckman & Reid and is avoiding Xerox shares.Xerox was helped in the first quarter by a lower tax rate than expected, and several analysts said they worried that Xerox would meet its numbers for the year through low taxes and share repurchases rather than increased sales.""Xerox is operating in a competitive environment that is not just intense, but intensifying,"" said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, who is steering clear of Xerox shares. ""Maybe they will make their numbers for the year, but it may not be with quality earnings.""The big unknown is whether customers will step up their purchases of office equipment. A growing number of companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Kodak and Canon, are actively looking for slices of the printing and copying pie, yet the pie as a whole is not getting bigger.""The office equipment market doesn't seem to be getting a big share of the recovery in capital spending,"" said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman Sachs who is neutral on Xerox shares. ""So it's not like the other guys are hitting the cover off the ball, either.""MARKET PLACE Correction: April 26, 2006, Wednesday The Market Place column in Business Day on Tuesday about first quarter earnings for the Xerox Corporation misstated its estimate for how much it would earn for the year. It is $1 to $1.07 a share, not $1 to $1.10 a share.'"
"'06-04-25,'0','The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center has a stable roster of prominent artists, many of whom have been affiliated with the group for more than a decade. But the organization also maintains a more fluid artist development program called Chamber Music Society Two, through which young professionals can gain valuable performance experience. On Sunday afternoon in Alice Tully Hall some of the participants assembled for the first of two concerts intended to showcase their work.As the level of the playing suggested, Chamber Muisc Society Two is clearly an important program, though its participants shouldn't harbor any dreams of earning a place on the society's official roster. The graduates may often be invited back as guests, but not one has joined the organization's senior ranks.Sunday's concert began auspiciously with an electric performance of Schoenberg's String Trio, a taut and masterly 12-tone work that is one of the gems of his difficult final decade in America. The experience of pain seldom seems far from Schoenberg's oeuvre, but this work in particular was a response to his debilitating illness in the summer of 1946. Schoenberg left behind vivid descriptions of his physical collapse and medical treatment, including his amazement at a hulking male nurse named Gene, ""who could pick me up and put me down again like a sofa cushion.""Without a vital performance, the work's highly abstract language can seem inaccessible, but Harumi Rhodes (violin), Richard O'Neill (viola) and Clancy Newman (cello) gave the piece a crackling, visceral reading that held the audience in rapt attention. Brahms's Clarinet Trio (Op. 114) followed in a fluid if more buttoned-down performance by Mr. Newman, Alexander Fiterstein (clarinet) and Benjamin Hochman (piano).For the program's final work, Schumann's Piano Quartet, the younger players including Adam Neiman (piano) collaborated with Paul Neubauer, a veteran violist in the Chamber Music Society. Ms. Rhodes deserves special mention here for a beautifully turned solo in the Andante Cantabile movement.The work was sensibly prefaced by Gyorgy Kurtag's Schumann tribute, ""Hommage à R. Sch.,"" which compresses Schumann's expressive world into six jewel-like miniatures of remarkable concision. The performance was tightly wrought and effective, and it showed just how well Mr. Kurtag's music conforms to a writerly dictum once coined by Isaac Babel: a sentence is complete not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.'"

"'06-04-25,'0','The commission argued in 2004 that by including its own music and video-streaming software, called Media Player, in its operating system, Microsoft would have an unfair advantage and thus stifle competition in this sector of the software market.In the earlier ruling, the commission also said that Web sites would start to create their content for the Microsoft Media Player only and rival players would be pushed aside as consumers turn to the most readily available player -- the one inside Windows.But Jean-François Bellis, of Van Bael & Bellis, a Belgian law firm, who is Microsoft's lead lawyer on the bundling side of the appeal, said that evidence from the marketplace showed that the commission's reasoning was flawed.""PC makers already put more than one player on their PC's,"" Mr. Bellis said. RealPlayer, which during the 1990's was one of the pioneers of streaming music and video content, ""was widely distributed at the time of the commission's decision,"" he added.According to figures presented by Microsoft to the court, a majority of Web site content providers create music and video content that work on at least two media players, and Mr. Bellis added that 85 percent of computer users also used at least one non-Microsoft player.""There is no evidence that the market was tipping"" toward Microsoft, Mr. Bellis said. ""The commission decision must be rejected, as it is disproved by events in the market. The absence of evidence of tipping is a striking repudiation of the commission's theory.""But in its presentation in the afternoon, the commission rebutted these arguments. Far from repudiating the commission's position, events before the 2004 ruling, as well as developments after it, have confirmed the fears of the regulators, said Per Hellstrom, the commission's lawyer leading the Media Player side of the case.Before 1999, RealPlayer dominated the market for software to play streaming media, although Microsoft had a product called NetShow. But in 1999, when the company reintroduced NetShow -- calling it Media Player -- as a streaming player similar to the RealPlayer, and bundled it into Windows, the market was turned on its head, Mr. Hellstrom said.Today, with an 85 percent market share, Mr. Hellstrom said the Windows Media Player had already ""achieved dominance in this market."" ""In 1999, Microsoft's strategy was to reposition the battle from NetShow versus Real to Windows versus Real,"" Mr. Hellstrom said.An internal Microsoft document dated June 5, 1997, appeared to support his argument, according to the commission. In an e-mail message to colleagues, Jim Durkin, Microsoft's product unit manager for networked multimedia products, said the push to win the battle in the market for streaming software came from Bill Gates, then the company's chief executive and now its chairman.""Bill's comment was, 'This is a strategic area and we need to win it,' "" Mr. Durkin said in the e-mail message, which was also cited in the United States Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft.Referring to a similar battle between Microsoft and Netscape, the first mass-market Internet browser, which has been dwarfed by Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, Mr. Durkin said that RealPlayer ""is like Netscape -- the only difference is we have a chance to start this battle earlier in the game.""Two years later, Windows Media Player was introduced, and RealPlayer has since become a small player in the market it helped create, the commission and an ally, the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, argued.Since the earlier ruling, Microsoft has introduced Windows XP edition N, as required by the European regulator. XP edition N has Media Player stripped out, but it sells at the same price as the version of Windows XP with Media Player included.To date, not one order for XP edition N has been placed by PC manufacturers, Mr. Bellis said, and 1,787 have been ordered by computer stores across Europe in the nine months since it went on sale. This is equal to 0.005 percent of all XP sales in Europe during the same time period, Mr. Bellis said.This, he argued, was proof that end users did not want an unbundled version of Windows.But the commission and its allies argued that the failure of edition N validated their claim that the market had tipped in favor of Media Player. ""No demand for edition N shows that Microsoft has succeeded in foreclosing the market,"" said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer in the Brussels office of Clifford Chance, who is representing the European Committee for Interoperable Systems in the appeal.'"
"'06-04-25,'0','""I am very, very anxious and trying to do all that I can to get the truth out about Enron,"" he said.Mr. Lay told the jury he was proud of the wealth he enjoyed after building Enron into what appeared at the time to be one of the nation's most successful companies, adding that he used some of that money to assist his 5 children, 12 grandchildren, and 96-year-old father-in-law.But since Enron went into bankruptcy at the end of 2001, becoming the embodiment of the era of corporate scandals that followed, Mr. Lay has been ruined financially and faces decades in prison if he is convicted on any of the six counts of fraud and conspiracy against him.""I guess you could say,"" Mr. Lay said, ""in the last few years I've achieved the American nightmare.""Mr. Lay, an experienced public speaker, sought to portray himself as anything but the greedy, image-obsessed corporate chieftain that has become his enduring label since Enron's fall. Trying to humanize himself, Mr. Lay, the son of a Baptist preacher from Missouri, turned several times to his wife, Linda, in the front row of the spectator's gallery, pointing out how she had been in the courtroom every day, calling her ""very supportive"" and a ""strong foundation for me.""Indeed, Mr. Lay seemed to open up his life to the 12 jurors who could send him to prison for a term that could easily last the rest of his life. He made ready references to his faith in God and noted that he met Linda, whom he married 24 years ago, when she was a single mother working as his secretary at a Florida natural gas company.And when his lawyer, George McCall Secrest Jr., asked Mr. Lay if he was perfect, Mr. Lay said no. ""Just ask my wife and five children,"" he added.As he has done before, Mr. Lay laid the blame for Enron's problems at the door of Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer who testified against him after pleading guilty in a deal with the government.""It all begins with the deceit of Andy Fastow,"" Mr. Lay said, explaining that his deepest regret was hiring and promoting Mr. Fastow, who did a ""tremendously brilliant"" job of hiding his crimes from his superiors at Enron.""I've said before, I accept full responsibility for everything that happened at Enron,"" Mr. Lay testified. ""Having said that, there's no way I could take responsibility for the criminal conduct that I didn't know about.""At every turn, Mr. Lay was quick to brand Mr. Fastow a liar and a crook. He denied that Mr. Fastow privately presented him with a list of problem assets that needed to be urgently written down just days after Mr. Skilling resigned from the company. Mr. Fastow testified that the list included billions of dollars in overvalued international assets.""That did not happen,"" Mr. Lay said in a strong voice. ""Period.""Mr. Lay's appearance drew a handful of former Enron employees to the courtroom. He also attracted some supporters, including Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Houston, who together with other politicians in the city received support early in her career from Mr. Lay, a prominent Republican.It was the second appearance in the courtroom for Ms. Jackson Lee, perhaps the most prominent African-American politician in Texas, who also attended a trial day in January.""We know Ken Lay as a civic leader in this community,"" Ms. Jackson Lee said in an interview. ""It is important for us to be able to hear the facts.""Mr. Lay plans to emphasize that prominence in the community later in the trial, when he will call some of Houston's most respected figures as character witnesses. Among those, according to one of his lawyers, will be the Rev. William A. Lawson, the founding pastor of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church, a prominent black church.As Mr. Skilling did in his two weeks on the stand, Mr. Lay added other villains beyond Mr. Fastow and his underlings to those who he said brought down Enron. He blamed short-sellers -- investors who bet on a stock falling in price -- and articles in The Wall Street Journal about Mr. Fastow's hidden partnerships for the ""run on the bank"" that he said caused Enron's creditors to stop dealing with its cash-intensive energy trading business.He made clear that Enron's fall deeply affected him. ""There is absolutely nothing in my life,"" he said, ""that comes close to the same level of pain and the same enduring pain.""Mr. Lay also admitted that he regretted, in hindsight, having stayed on as chairman and not leaving the company he led for 15 years completely when Mr. Skilling succeeded him as chief executive. ""If I had done that, I wouldn't be sitting here,"" he said.Long known as Enron's popular and outgoing ""Mr. Outside"" to Mr. Skilling's inside role, Mr. Lay argued that he was detached from the detailed goings-on within Enron's executive suite. Asked by Mr. Secrest if he was a micromanager, Mr. Lay responded, ""Oh no, I'm very much a decentralization person.""Mr. Lay also seemed to signal a slight departure from a defense that has emphasized unity with Mr. Skilling, stressing that he, as the public face of Enron, was regularly traveling about half of every month. While Mr. Lay praised Mr. Skilling's management of the company, he also sought to contrast their styles.""Jeff's not the best person sometimes in dealing with regulators, sometimes with politicians, sometimes with the C.E.O.'s of other companies,"" Mr. Lay said. ""He's perhaps from time to time a little bit more blunt than I am.""Mr. Skilling, sitting at the defense table, smiled warmly at the description. But his lead lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, frowned deeply.Mr. Petrocelli later denied any concern that Mr. Lay could be trying to suggest that Mr. Skilling was more culpable because he was more involved in the company's day-to-day operations.""As you can see, what Mr. Lay is telling you lines up exactly with the picture Mr. Skilling has said, because they are both telling the truth,"" Mr. Petrocelli told reporters outside the courthouse.Legal analysts said they never really expected Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling to turn on each other in their testimony, because the two have long pursued a joint defense. But with Mr. Lay taking the stand second, some have speculated that it was remotely possible that he would seek to deflect some blame to Mr. Skilling for any mismanagement of the company.Mr. Lay spent much of the afternoon arguing he still believed that the statements he made to employees and analysts were accurate when he made them. He dismissed criticisms that his ceaseless cheerleading might have crossed the line into misleading, even criminal behavior.""I might say, indeed if you look at surveys of leaders, most leaders are optimistic,"" he said. ""Most people don't like to follow pessimistic leaders.""Mr. Lay also supported Mr. Skilling's contention that he stepped down as chief executive for personal reasons because he was burned out in the job rather than because he knew that Enron was in trouble. ""It was pretty clear that Jeff wasn't having much fun in his new job,"" Mr. Lay testified.He also addressed some of the more serious charges against him, including the accusation that he set in motion a toothless investigation into charges of accounting improprieties by a former Enron vice president, Sherron S. Watkins, and sought to have her fired. Instead, he said, he protected Ms. Watkins from any retaliation by Mr. Fastow and took her concerns seriously.And he defended charges that the company was engaging in ""aggressive accounting,"" especially through the use of the LJM partnership set up by Mr. Fastow, which prosecutors assert was improperly used to manipulate Enron's earnings.Mr. Lay recounted a heated management retreat outside Houston in September 2001, during which Richard A. Causey, the company's chief accounting officer, slammed his fist on a table in rebutting charges by those running the different business units that Enron's accounting was going too far.When Mr. Lay asked the group how many managers had used LJM in the ""past 12 months"" to help meet earnings targets, he said, hands went up from ""virtually all of the heads of the operating groups.""'"
"'06-04-26,'1','In a telephone interview, Mr. Mollohan said he and Mr. McBride had a 50-50 ownership of the 300-acre farm near Parsons, W.Va., and of its $800,000 mortgage.""A conflict assumes that you are benefiting from that relationship in an inappropriate way, and that's just not the case,"" he said. ""I'm benefiting to the extent of my ownership, and that benefit is totally reliant on my asset.""Mr. McBride is one of three of Mr. Mollohan's real estate partners who have received federal contracts or earmarks, which is a major aspect of a 500-page complaint that the conservative National Legal and Policy Center filed with the United States attorney's office challenging Mr. Mollohan's finances.Over the past three years, Mr. Mollohan and his wife have bought five empty lots with Laura Kurtz Kuhns and her husband on Bald Head Island, N.C., where the two couples have side-by-side oceanfront vacation homes that they rent out. Ms. Kuhns, a former aide in Mr. Mollohan's Washington office, is the director of the Vandalia Heritage Foundation, one of five nonprofit organizations Mr. Mollohan founded and then financed with $250 million in earmarks since 1999.The Mollohans are also co-owners of 27 condominiums with Rosemary and Joseph Jarvis Jr., who is a third cousin of the congressman and had a Department of Energy contract in the mid-1990's.The House ethics manual does not specifically address such private real estate investments, but cautions against members' accepting benefits or making ""pecuniary gains"" that could be perceived as connected to their official duties.The West Virginia farm is one of eight parcels Mr. Mollohan owns in Tucker County, where Vandalia and two of the other nonprofit organizations have been active. Mr. Mollohan and Mr. McBride said they had been searching for years for a farm like the one owned by Mr. Mollohan's parents, where they had baled hay and chased cattle as children.""It's a place for us to get away where cellphones don't work and fish bite and beer stays cold,"" Mr. McBride said of the spread along the Cheat River that they bought from a former FMW executive's widow.Mr. McBride serves on the board of one of the Mollohan-created nonprofit agencies, MountainMade, which helps local artisans sell their wares. He gave $12,700 to Mr. Mollohan's campaign and political action committees between 1997 and this February. He is also among the organizers of a Mollohan-backed effort to create a bank in his district specializing in loans to high-technology companies, whose investors include two of the nonprofit agencies.FMW Composite Systems was founded in 1993 by Mr. McBride, an Army veteran and a lawyer who previously worked in the coal industry, a tire business and a real estate brokerage. It is privately held, and Mr. McBride would not disclose its annual revenue, but said ""a fair portion"" of the business was in federal contracts.Records show the company as having received $2.9 million in seven contracts from the Navy and the Air Force in 2004.In 2002, FMW got a $619,000 subcontract from the Institute for Scientific Research -- another Mollohan-created earmark beneficiary -- for a NASA project known as the Super Lightweight Interchangeable Carrier, developing a new pallet to carry tools and materials inside the space shuttle. FMW continued to get NASA contracts for the carrier for several years, including $1.5 million in 2005 from Mr. Mollohan's $2.1 million earmark.""Congressman Mollohan was briefed on the program by us, yes,"" Mr. McBride said, adding that his company delivered the new pallet, weighing 1,800 pounds instead of the old one's 3,800, in July, 2005. ""Yes, he's been helpful, of course, but in terms of the numbers of programs or numbers of dollars that he's provided to various programs, he's not the largest, by far.""Mr. Mollohan said Tuesday that the potential conflict of interest ""did not occur to me"" when buying the farm with Mr. McBride. Asked whether any other real estate partners had federal contracts, he said his brother, Robert H. Mollohan, with whom he inherited the Ramada Inn in Morgantown, W.Va., ""mows lawns"" for military reserve units around the state.""I had absolutely nothing to do with it,"" Mr. Mollohan said of his brother's contracts, adding that he did not even know the name of the landscaping company. ""Robert got that all on his own.""'"

"'06-04-26,'1','""I didn't want other people to know,"" said Amadou, 18, referring to his illegal status. ""They're all U.S. citizens but me.""Most team members learned of his problem only yesterday at a meeting with Kristian Breton, 27, the staff member at the East Harlem Tutorial program who started the team, inspired by his own experience in the competition when he was a high school student in rural Mountain Home, Ark.Alan Hodge, 18, echoed the general dismay. ""We can't really celebrate all the way because it's not going to feel whole as a team without Amadou,"" he said.Amadou's teammates have struggled with obstacles of their own. When Mr. Breton called a meeting of parents to collect permission slips last week, only five showed up. One boy's mother had a terminal illness, Mr. Breton learned. Another mother lived in the Dominican Republic, leaving an older sibling to manage the household. One of the six girls on the team said her divorced parents disagreed about letting her go, and her mother, who was willing to approve the trip, lacked the $4 subway fare to get to the meeting.But Amadou's case stands out. As he tells it, with corroboration from immigration records and other documents, he was 13 and spoke no English when his mother brought him to New York from Dakar on Sept. 10, 2001. He was 14 when she went back, leaving him behind in the hope that he could continue his American education.By then, he had finished ninth grade at Norman Thomas High School in a program for students learning English as a second language. But his mother left instruction for him to take a Greyhound bus to Indianapolis, where a Senegalese woman friend had agreed to take him in and send him to North Central High School there.""It was the same thing when I was in Africa,"" he said, describing a childhood spent shuttling between his grandmother and the household of his father, a retired police officer with 12 children and three wives.The woman in Indiana, who had four children of her own, changed her mind about keeping him after his sophomore year, and he returned by bus to New York in the summer of 2004. ""I had to find a way to help myself for food and clothes, and to buy some of my school supplies,"" he said, recalling days handing out fliers for a clothing store on a Manhattan street corner. ""I ended up living with another friend — I'm under age and I can't live alone.""Taking shelter with a taxi driver, a friend of the family who could sign his report cards, Amadou enrolled in 11th grade at Central Park East. Under longstanding Supreme Court decisions, children have a right to a public education regardless of their immigration status, and in New York, as in many other cities, a ""don't ask, don't tell"" approach to legal status has prevailed for years.But after the 9/11 attacks, practices around the country changed. On a rainy highway in Pennsylvania on Nov. 7, 2004, Amadou met a very different attitude when he had the bad luck to be a passenger in a car rear-ended by a truck. The state trooper who responded questioned his passport and school ID, and summoned federal immigration officers, who began deportation proceedings.There is no right to a court-appointed lawyer in immigration court, and though Amadou's friends hired one for him at first, records show that the lawyer soon withdrew. ""We really couldn't afford to pay,"" Amadou explained.By the time the case was finally sent to a special juvenile docket in federal court after several adjournments, Amadou had already turned 18, closing off some legal options that can lead to a green card for juveniles, said Amy Meselson, a Legal Aid lawyer who took on the case last week.At this point, she said, his best chance is probably a long shot: a measure included in an amendment to many Senate immigration bills, known as the Dream Act, which offers a path to citizenship to young people of good character who have lived in the United States for five years, been accepted to college, or earned a high school diploma or the equivalent.Opponents say the measure will encourage illegal immigrants, and subsidize their education at the expense of American children and their taxpaying parents.But mentors for Amadou's team, which calls itself ""East Harlem Tech,"" seem to have no ear for such arguments.""He's been a hard-working and diligent student with mathematical ability and a scientific mind,"" said Rhonda Creed-Harry, a math teacher at Central Park East. But though he has been accepted at the New York City College of Technology in Brooklyn, he said he could not attend because he does not qualify for financial aid.Ramon Padilla, a team mentor who stopped a year short of a college degree himself and now works in the audio-visual department at Columbia University, called the news that Amadou faced deportation ""overwhelming.""""I'm telling you, he's a great kid, a very talented kid,"" he said, adding that Amadou played an important role in building the robot, with help from Frank Sierra, a buddy of Mr. Padilla who repairs elevators. Starting from a standard set of parts, each team had six weeks to design a robot that could move down a center line and throw balls into a goal. In the last round of the competition, Amadou helped his team form a winning alliance with teams from Morris High School in the Bronx and Staten Island Tech, which both advanced to the finals as well.Mr. Breton, who made last-minute trips to the Bronx to gather parental permissions, said he was determined not to leave Amadou behind. ""I started with 19 people, and I want to take 19 people to Atlanta,"" he told the student. ""I want to make sure that everybody has the full opportunity, because I feel you've earned it.""Amadou returned the compliment. ""Because of him, it happened,"" he said.Yet on the train to Atlanta, accompanied by another staff member, Amadou was still worried. Bloomberg L.P., which is underwriting the full cost of the team's trip to Atlanta, plans to display its robot at the company's headquarters in New York and invite the team up to celebrate their achievement. He said he was afraid that for lack of the right ID he might be turned away from the building.'"
"'06-04-26,'1','Since then, the agency says it has greatly accelerated its efforts and has now made decisions on about 90 percent of the applications and approved about $8.5 billion in loans.But critics of the agency contend that problems remain. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, told lawmakers last week that the agency had been unprepared for a major disaster and was almost ""purely in a reactive state.""The agency was also criticized last year for making disaster loans in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that were not closely related to those events.Mr. Barreto's departure comes in the midst of a broader reshuffling in the Bush administration, which is struggling with low poll ratings, widespread unhappiness about rising energy prices and an economic agenda that has become stalled in Congress.The pace of that reshuffling accelerated this month after Joshua B. Bolten took over as Mr. Bush's chief of staff. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political strategist, gave up his formal responsibility as domestic policy adviser last week, and Scott McClellan, Mr. Bush's chief spokesman, announced plans to step down.Representative Donald Manzullo, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House Small Business Committee, praised Mr. Barreto's efforts.""Under Hector's leadership, the S.B.A. streamlined many functions and learned to do more with less while facing unparalleled challenges to the S.B.A.'s disaster loan program,"" Mr. Manzullo said Tuesday in a statement, adding that Mr. Barreto had cut costs by $100 million a year by eliminating subsidies for the agency's major loan-guarantee program.Democratic lawmakers were much harsher. ""He was simply not up to the challenges of running this agency,"" said Representative Nydia M. Velázquez of New York, the senior Democrat on the House small business panel. Ms. Velázquez had called for Mr. Barreto's resignation in December and said Tuesday that he had ""made the right decision"" to step down.Mr. Barreto, in a brief telephone interview, said he was proud of his tenure and that his resignation had nothing to do with the criticisms of his agency.He said he would lead the Latino Coalition, a small advocacy group that has been largely backed by Hispanic business executives and has lent support to some of Mr. Bush's initiatives. Last year, for example, members spoke out warmly in favor of Mr. Bush's plan to overhaul Social Security and let people put some of their payroll tax contributions into individual investment accounts.Mr. Preston, who must be confirmed by the Senate, is a senior vice president of the ServiceMaster Company, a multibillion-dollar corporation whose businesses include TruGreen ChemLawn, a lawn care company; and Terminix, a pest control company.Unlike Mr. Barreto, whose family owned a restaurant in Kansas City, Mr. Preston has spent nearly all his career with large corporations.'"

"'06-04-26,'1','Microsoft has argued that Edition N's failure illustrates that the market does not want an unbundled version of Windows, while the commission says its lack of appeal is a sign that the market for media players has already tipped in favor of Microsoft.Microsoft spent much of its second day in court on Tuesday dismissing the idea of discount pricing for Edition N. ""It wouldn't have made sense asking for a price differential because media players are free,"" said Jean-François Bellis, a lawyer who represents Microsoft.Members of the 13-judge panel hearing the case began their cross-examination of the two sides on Tuesday, but no clear pattern emerged in their questioning.For the company, the judges scrutinized its argument that Media Player and Windows were deeply integrated. ""Was it a marketing strategy designed to gain market share?"" asked Judge John Cook, The Associated Press reported. Microsoft's lawyers said the move was part of the company's strategy to further integrate its operating system.Another judge elicited an admission from the commission that its order for Microsoft to offer Windows without Media Player had not worked. ""I am afraid we cannot say our remedy has had any real impact, as far as we can see,"" Mr. Hellstrom said, according to Reuters.Because it is an appeal hearing, the burden of proof rests on Microsoft to show that the commission's ruling was in error.On Wednesday, the court will turn its attention to the second strand in the commission's ruling against Microsoft. The 2004 ruling ordered the company to disclose technical details to rival makers of server software to allow them to build server programs that work as smoothly with Windows as Microsoft's own server software.Microsoft is expected to argue that this order breaches its intellectual property rights. The hearing is scheduled to last the rest of the week.Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group supporting Microsoft in the weeklong hearing, said in an interview on Tuesday that the commission ""might now be entertaining the notion that Microsoft might have to bribe consumers to buy an inferior product.""Erik Simon, an executive working for the software company Video Banner, based in Los Angeles, said that bundling hurts small rivals. Mr. Simon, whose company builds video advertising and online voice messaging services, which compete indirectly against Media Player, was in Luxembourg to assist the commission in its defense of the 2004 ruling.""The commission's ruling two years ago was an excellent first step, but as a second step it needs to set a price differential between the two versions of Windows,"" Mr. Simon said in an interview. ""This is a big issue for small companies like us that are up against the bundled software programs that Microsoft offers with Windows.""'"

Suozzi, who appeared in front of Mr. Spitzer's campaign headquarters in Manhattan to demand twice-a-month debates until the primary election in September.Mr. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, who lags far behind in the polls, said that Mr. Spitzer, the state attorney general, has been treating the election ""like a coronation"" and has avoided talking in detail about how he will address issues like Medicaid and the state budget. Mr. Suozzi began demanding debates earlier this month, but his aides said that they had not received a response from the Spitzer campaign.""I don't think that it can be that he's afraid to debate me,"" Mr. Suozzi said. ""I think that he's doing what traditionally happens with front-runners that are afraid to take any chances for people to find out what they really stand for and the chance that he'll make a mistake in the debate.""Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Spitzer campaign, said that the campaign had received several requests for debates from news organizations, but that it had not been decided when those debates would take place.""Of course we'll debate,"" Ms. Anderson said. ""Eliot has never shied away from an opportunity to debate his opponents.""'"
"'06-04-26,'1','""It was the idea of getting something for nothing, really,"" he said. ""So I began thinking, 'Why wouldn't that work for the airlines?' ""Over the next year, Mr. Crandall, Mr. Plaskett and their colleagues developed a secret plan modeled on green stamps, a surprise intended to catch their rivals off guard. On May 1, 1981 -- 25 years ago next Monday -- they unveiled a program called AAdvantage. Frequent-flier miles were born.MILES have become one of the most successful business ideas not just of the last quarter-century but in the modern history of capitalism. They have been a diabolically brilliant way to separate people from their money while making them feel as if they were instead getting a gift. Sure, you just spent $800 fixing your car, but you charged it to a credit card that awards miles, putting you that much closer to a free vacation.If you believe the popular idea that a mile is worth about a cent, the 14 trillion unredeemed miles that travelers hold are more valuable than all of the United States currency in circulation, as The Economist magazine has noted.That does not include the points racked up in the many copycat programs. At my local Tex-Mex place, I'm a member of the frequent-burrito-eating club.""We figured if we were successful,"" Mr. Crandall told me this week, ""we could replace S&H Green Stamps.""They have obviously done that, and then some. But the comparison also has a darker side. Green stamps, after all, aren't around anymore. They were the victim of their own inflationary spiral in the 1960's, when stores started awarding double and triple stamps, which cost them gobs of money.Soon, some store managers realized that they could offer eye-catching discounts instead, said Joseph C. Nunes, a marketing professor at the University of Southern California. About the only place to find the stamps these days is in Andy Warhol art (though S&H is trying to revive them online).They were another example of the notion that corporate America tends to drive every good idea into the ground like a tomato stake, as the writer James Grant has said about Wall Street. Now frequent-flier miles are following a similar path.They caught on because they did such a wonderful job of exploiting human nature. From his own experience with green stamps, Mr. Plaskett knew that collecting stickers or points could feel like an accomplishment in itself. So, American Airlines deliberately handed out thousands of them at once, because ""10,000 miles"" sounded a lot more impressive than ""6 flight segments.""The company made miles flown the unit of currency, instead of dollars spent, to reduce the chances that businesses would try to claim the awards from their employees. Business travelers, after all, were the ones deciding which airline to fly, even if their employers were picking up the bill. Frequent-flier miles became a little kickback.Best of all, the ultimate prizes -- vacations -- were just the sort of thing to induce daydreaming. Yet they cost American almost nothing, because the company was careful to give away seats that otherwise would have gone unfilled.No wonder, then, that United Airlines copied American within days and every other big airline soon followed.Just as they were intended to do, the programs delayed the march of low-fare carriers. One study done in the 1990's found that business travelers taking a 1,000-mile trip would pay an extra $170 on average to fly on the airline with their frequent-flier program.But I'd bet you wouldn't find the same premium today. Low-fare airlines are a lot bigger than they used to be, and they have their own frequent-flier programs. Corporate travel managers, meanwhile, can use software to force business travelers to choose the cheapest ticket.And miles don't have the pull they once did, because they, too, have been swept up into an inflationary spiral. Hard-core travelers who once viewed upgrades to first class as an inalienable right now find them hard to come by because so many miles are sloshing around and planes are so full these days. Claiming free tickets on popular routes can also seem almost impossible.Frequent-flier programs are not about to disappear, because no airline can afford to abandon them unilaterally. But compared with Mr. Crandall's original goal -- to keep airline seats from becoming a commodity -- the frequent-flier mile is looking pretty old and tired for a 25-year-old.Just look at what United is doing to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its program. It is letting its best customers use their miles to buy Callaway Golf clubs, Coach sunglasses and Canon digital cameras. That turns frequent-flier miles into just another discount, rather than the guarantee of loyalty that Mr. Plaskett envisioned.'"
"'06-04-26,'1','Officials at the comptroller's office countered that Signature could clear up any misconceptions about its billing by letting the comptroller's auditors in. Over the last five years, officials at the comptroller's office said, Signature led the state in billing Medicaid for massage therapy, hot/cold pack therapy and electric stimulation therapy, processing thousands of claims for millions of dollars. Mr. Hevesi called the billings ""potentially excessive"" in his letter to the Health Department.The effort to stop fraud and abuse in the state's $47 billion Medicaid program has taken on renewed urgency in Albany since The New York Times detailed problems with policing the system in a series of articles last year.When it comes to looking at Signature's billing, though, something of a turf battle seems to have erupted between the comptroller's office and the State Health Department and its new Medicaid inspector general, a position created in response to the series in The Times.Officials at the comptroller's office said that after their auditors were blocked, they moved to halt payments to Signature, which they said was paid $5.4 million by the state in 2005 for Medicaid services. The officials said the Medicaid inspector general's office challenged their right to withhold the payments.So Mr. Hevesi wrote a letter on Tuesday to Kimberly O'Connor, the Medicaid inspector general, raising his concerns. The letter was released to reporters.Referring to Signature, he wrote, ""It is astounding that you would pay this entity in the face of our express objections and in violation of the constitutional requirement that such payments must be subject to the comptroller's audit.""The Health Department countered that it started its own investigation of Signature in December, before the comptroller's audit began. ""At this time, pending the results of the review, no Medicaid claims are being paid to the health center,"" said Robert Kenny, a department spokesman.Mr. Sanders, of Signature, said Mr. Hevesi's actions were politically motivated. ""If the courts find that the comptroller does have the power to audit Signature, then Signature will, of course, cooperate with the comptroller as it has always cooperated with the Department of Health,"" he said in a written statement. ""But the comptroller appears not to want to wait for the court decision; he would, evidently, rather try his case in the media.""'"

"'06-04-26,'1','The rise in energy prices has undermined the administration's effort to build a case that its policies have led to economic prosperity and has given Democrats an opening to portray the White House and Congressional Republicans as allies of the oil industry. With Mr. Bush's poll numbers sagging and his party on the defensive over the Iraq war, Republicans have been scrambling to show they are trying to help consumers.Republican strategists said the anticorporate undertone of the Republican response carried the risk of a backlash from business leaders and free-market conservatives who deplore government intervention. But they said the risk was relatively small at a time when both parties want to promise voters relief.""I think there are a lot of people in the business community who are saying that to some degree, the oil industry brought some of this criticism on itself,"" said David Winston, a Republican pollster, noting recent headlines about the $400 million in compensation that Lee R. Raymond received in his last year as chairman of Exxon Mobil.Oil prices are hovering around $73 dollars a barrel, and consumers are paying more than $3 a gallon for gasoline in places. The sharp price increase in recent weeks has been driven by several factors, including concern about a confrontation with Iran, one of the world's largest oil suppliers.At various points, Iran has threatened -- and withdrawn the threat -- to slow production if the United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions against it for its nuclear enrichment program, which the United States says is part of a secret weapons program. Mr. Bush alluded to the issue in his speech, saying for the first time that some countries were playing on what he termed America's ""addiction"" to oil, adding, ""that reduces our influence"" in the world.Mr. Bush said the decision by the Clinton administration not to permit oil production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was costing the United States more than one million barrels a day of lost production.The investigation into possible price manipulation that Mr. Bush said the Federal Trade Commission was conducting began in August 2005, around the time Hurricane Katrina struck. The trade commission said Tuesday that the results of that initial investigation would be announced in May, and that for the past four years it had been reviewing prices in several markets.Mr. Bush also said he had ordered some short-term steps, mostly involving the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He gave American oil companies more time to pay back emergency loans taken from the reserve after the production disruptions of the last hurricane season. The Energy Department says the reserve has 688 million barrels in hand; it has room for 727 million barrels. The oil company paybacks would amount to a little over two million barrels.""Our strategic reserve is sufficiently large enough to guard against any major supply disruption over the next few months,"" Mr. Bush said. ""So by deferring deposits until the fall, we'll leave a little more oil on the market.""Oil experts, though, said that these steps were small ones, and that Mr. Bush's ability to affect gasoline prices was limited.For the longer term, Mr. Bush said he was asking Congress to repeal $2 billion in tax breaks and incentives in last year's energy bill. White House officials said he had never advocated the incentives for the oil industry.Mr. Bush suggested expanding the tax break for buying hybrids, which are more expensive than gasoline-powered cars, but which look more attractive to consumers today than they did a year ago. The break diminishes as soon as more than 60,000 units of any individual hybrid model are sold, but on Tuesday, Mr. Bush pressed to eliminate that ceiling.On Capitol Hill, Republicans accused the Democrats of blocking legislation to increase energy supplies by increasing domestic nuclear power and oil drilling. Democrats said Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress had failed to address the short-term cost of gas in the energy bill passed last year, and they dismissed the president's call for an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission as a toothless ploy.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said the party planned to introduce amendments about gasoline prices in the pending bill for spending for Iraq. The party's priority, Democrats said, is an amendment proposed by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, to suspend the federal sales tax on gasoline for 60 days and pay for the shortfall by changing rules to increase the taxes on oil companies.Many parts of the country have been experiencing high gasoline prices as refiners are scrambling to switch to an ethanol-blended gasoline instead of using MTBE. Refiners have decided to drop MTBE, a popular oxygen additive but one that has been blamed for water pollution.The rapid shift has created vast logistical challenges, mainly because of ethanol shortages and the difficulties linked to transporting it.'"
"'06-04-26,'1','After the news conference, Port Authority executives spoke to Mr. Silverstein, who leased the trade center six weeks before it was destroyed on 9/11, to resolve several relatively minor outstanding issues. They said that they hoped he would sign the agreement today before the board meeting. ""Nothing would make us happier than to see such an important step forward,"" Bud Perrone, a spokesman for Silverstein Properties, said last night.But the turmoil at ground zero will not disappear completely. Rebuilding officials expect that the focus will now shift from commercial development at ground zero to what many regard as the cornerstone of ground zero, the troubled memorial project.Consultants are expected to deliver a report in the next week showing that the cost of the memorial and a museum has swelled to as much as $800 million from $500 million. But until now, fund-raising has been sluggish at best. Gov. George E. Pataki's senior adviser for counter-terrorism has also raised concerns about security at the site.The agreement at ground zero provides for the Port Authority to contribute $100 million to the memorial. But the projected cost of the memorial is now so high that planners may have to pare elements of the project, potentially touching off another round of squabbling.Business groups like the Alliance for Downtown New York and the Partnership for New York City greeted yesterday's announcement with a sigh of relief. ""This is a shot in the arm for Lower Manhattan,"" said Eric Deutsch, president of the alliance. ""It removes the uncertainty and allows businesses to make long-term decisions to invest and relocate downtown.""Yesterday, Mr. Silverstein, who has long insisted that he is the best person to rebuild ground zero, put the best face on what amounted to a capitulation. The developer, who has a penchant for endless negotiations, failed to come to terms on March 14, a deadline set by Governor Pataki. He is now agreeing to a far less generous deal; he acknowledged yesterday that he had had to make additional concessions.In recent weeks, he was described as ""greedy"" by Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and New York's top economic development official, even as Mr. Silverstein complained about bargaining with rival government entities that, until recently, could not agree among themselves.Mr. Silverstein pointedly chose to hold the news conference in front of his new office tower, the only one rebuilt at ground zero, noting that government had failed to rebuild other parts of the site. In responding to the government's latest offer, he said, ""In four business days, we did what it took government four months to accomplish."" But, ultimately, he sued for peace.""The plan of last week recognizes the unique public nature of this project and will ensure that the rebuilding moves forward expeditiously and with certainty,"" Governor Pataki said yesterday. ""The plan will make certain that the rebuilt World Trade Center will anchor the financial capital of the world and make our nation proud.""Mr. Pataki, who has tied his legacy and his political ambitions to the Freedom Tower, can also claim victory, in that it appears that work can now proceed more quickly at ground zero. Mr. Silverstein will be paid a 1 percent fee to build the tower under the supervision of the Port Authority.""Once he signs the agreement, Silverstein told us he can start building the Freedom Tower within a matter of days,"" Mr. Gargano said. ""We're hopeful that will happen.""The announcement can also be seen as a victory for Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who effectively blocked a prior attempt by the Pataki administration to strike a deal with Mr. Silverstein. They feared that those agreements would have enriched the developer, while shifting most of the potential risk to the public.Mr. Bloomberg repeatedly said that Mr. Silverstein did not have enough money to complete the $7 billion project. He raised the possibility that the developer would run out of money in 2009 after building only two towers, default on his lease and walk away with tens of millions in profits, while the project was left unfinished.""It's not productive to look backwards,"" Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said yesterday. ""We all need to look forward and ensure that the goals we share of building out the site are achieved quickly and completely.""Under the proposed deal, Mr. Silverstein is surrendering control of the Freedom Tower and a second site, Tower 5, to the Port Authority. Tower 5 will probably be sold to a residential developer. To put the Freedom Tower on a sound financial footing, the Pataki administration has pledged to contribute $250 million and round up a million square feet of leases, most likely with federal agencies. The leases would allow the authority to get a mortgage, which, combined with $970 million in insurance proceeds, would cover most of the estimated cost of the building.Mr. Silverstein, in turn, would develop three office towers along Church Street, between Vesey and Liberty Streets. Construction could begin as soon as the authority completes the foundations on the eastern edge of the site, sometime next year.To ensure that he can obtain mortgage money and build quickly, the city and the authority have offered to lease 1.2 million square feet of space in what is known as Tower 4. But the developer's fee would be limited to 2.5 percent, not the 5 percent he at first demanded.In the coming days and weeks, the authority would work with Mr. Silverstein to design the shopping mall that is to be built in the base of two of the Church Street towers. Later, Mr. Silverstein would have the option of buying the retail part of the project from the authority.'"
"'06-04-26,'1','Nissan reported strong gains in the United States, where it earns about 60 percent of its profit. Nissan said American sales increased 6.1 percent, to top one million vehicles for a second year. The company said it had a 6.3 percent share of the American market, its biggest slice ever.Analysts said they expected even stronger results from Honda and Toyota, traditionally more profitable companies that will announce annual earnings later. Some analysts even warned of an eventual reaction in Washington if the Japanese were seen as profiting too much from Detroit's woes.""There is a possibility that political friction will be heightened,"" Kunihiko Shiohara, an analyst in Tokyo for Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report.The sales gains by Nissan in the United States came despite a lack of new models. Analysts said Nissan, like other Asian carmakers, has benefited as soaring gasoline prices have made its high-mileage cars more appealing.Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said the absence of new models would mean slower sales in the first half of this year. The company said it would idle plants in Mississippi and Tennessee for six days between now and June to reduce its inventory.But Mr. Ghosn said Nissan's sales would pick up this summer, when it starts releasing nine new models worldwide. In the United States, it plans three new models by next March: redesigned versions of its popular Altima and Sentra sedans, and a new version of the G35 sedan from its Infiniti line of luxury cars.""In the second half,"" Mr. Ghosn said, ""we will have an intensive product-launch offensive.""To offset sliding sales in its mature home market of Japan, Nissan said it was strengthening its push into developing markets like China. Sales in China rose 53.4 percent last fiscal year, to 297,000 vehicles, led by the popularity of a Chinese version of its Versa compact car, Nissan said.On Tuesday, Nissan also announced a move into another potential growth market, Russia, by saying it would build a factory in that country, to start production in 2009. The $200 million plant in St. Petersburg will follow one for Toyota, which will open a factory in the same city next year.'"
"'06-04-26,'1','Mr. Lay's testimony echoed the testimony of his co-defendant, Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former president and chief executive, who faces conspiracy, fraud and insider trading charges. Both have sought to refute the government's contention that they authorized and encouraged Mr. Fastow and others to use improper accounting and financial tricks to artificially increase profits.The government charges that Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay also misled analysts and employees into thinking that Enron was healthy when they knew it had deep-seated problems.Instead, Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling have argued that Enron, which filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, was generally performing well and was brought down by a ""classic run on the bank"" created by the misdeeds of a few rogue executives and the doubts sown by short-sellers and news reporters.While Mr. Skilling is charged with more crimes than Mr. Lay, it is Mr. Lay who is under pressure to explain the sudden collapse of the company he ran for 15 years. Mr. Skilling resigned abruptly in August 2001 after only six months as chief executive, forcing Mr. Lay to reassume the post for what ended up being five chaotic months before the company failed. Around the time Mr. Skilling resigned, The Wall Street Journal began digging into the LJM partnerships that Mr. Fastow ran while still acting as chief financial officer.""We thought The Wall Street Journal was on a witch hunt of Andy Fastow,"" Mr. Lay testified Tuesday, referring to a series of articles the newspaper published about the partnerships beginning in October 2001.""It was absolutely destroying the confidence investors had in the company and driving down the stock price,"" he added. Mr. Lay did not cite examples of incorrect reporting.Mr. Lay was both testy and defiant on Tuesday. He seemed out of sync with Mr. Secrest, who had had only a few weeks to prepare before stepping in Monday to conduct the direct questioning of Mr. Lay. Michael W. Ramsey, Mr. Lay's lead lawyer, has been sidelined after two heart operations in the last month.Clutching the side of the witness stand with his right hand, Mr. Lay at times appeared impatient with Mr. Secrest, admonishing him a few times: ""I'm not sure where you're going with this.""Mr. Secrest's questioning was so meandering that Judge Simeon T. Lake III admonished Mr. Secrest more than once, at one point for trying to introduce as evidence a letter that an Enron director, Herbert S. Winokur Jr., wrote to The Journal on Oct. 19, 2001, but never sent.""Of what relevance is this?"" the judge asked testily. ""Showing a draft of a letter that was never sent is not relevant.""As he has done before, Mr. Lay portrayed himself as a strategic thinker who left the details in the hands of experts and trusted that accountants and lawyers had vetted details of contracts and other deals, including off-the-books transactions. ""We didn't realize at that time that those transactions would become so important to the history of the company and the history of this corporate era,"" he said.Mr. Lay said he initially went along with Mr. Fastow's LJM partnerships, even though they required the board to waive Enron's conflict-of-interest policy, because they would save banking fees and give deal makers alternatives. But Mr. Lay said he believed Mr. Fastow had removed himself from the partnerships by the fall of 2001, when reporters and analysts started delving into them.Initially, Mr. Lay and the board defended Mr. Fastow in the face of mounting public concern over the partnerships. That changed on Oct. 24, 2001, Mr. Lay said, when he and the board learned that Mr. Fastow had earned at least $45 million from the deals. ""I was shocked,"" Mr. Lay said. He suspended Mr. Fastow later that day. When Mr. Lay went to tell Mr. Fastow the news, Mr. Fastow tried to discuss a severance package, suggesting that he would not be ""unreasonable"" and would settle for $5 million, Mr. Lay testified.""I said, 'Hell no, Andy, pack up your stuff and leave the building,' "" Mr. Lay recalled Tuesday.Mr. Lay also laid blame on Mr. Fastow and on Arthur Andersen, Enron's outside auditor, for $600 million in restatements that the company had to take in the fall of 2001 as a result of accounting problems, including for Chewco, another partnership set up by Mr. Fastow that Mr. Lay referred to as ""the nail in the coffin of Enron's demise.""Mr. Lay also sought to counter charges that he lied to Andersen auditors when he promised that a British water-distribution company called Wessex was to be the ""platform"" for a new push into the water business. Prosecutors charge that Mr. Lay was trying to thwart a write-down of the business to preserve Enron's credit rating.Mr. Lay said Tuesday that he was ""not opposed to keeping"" Wessex and did not recall if David B. Duncan, the lead Andersen partner on the Enron account, ever asked him in an Oct. 12 meeting about a growth plan for water. ""He wanted to know if we would sell it or keep it,"" Mr. Lay testified, referring to Wessex.'"

"'06-04-27,'1','To the families and loved ones of my co-workers, victims of the Sago Mine disaster:The explosion happened soon after the day shift arrived at the mine face on January 2, right after we got out of the man-trip. I do not recall whether I had started work, nor do I have any memory of the blast. I do remember that the mine filled quickly with fumes and thick smoke, and that breathing conditions were nearly unbearable.The first thing we did was activate our rescuers, as we had been trained. At least four of the rescuers did not function. I shared my rescuer with Jerry Groves, while Junior Toler, Jesse Jones and Tom Anderson sought help from others. There were not enough rescuers to go around.We then tried to return to the man-trip, yelling to communicate through the thick smoke. The air was so bad that we had to abandon our escape attempt and return to the coal rib, where we hung a curtain to try to protect ourselves. The curtain created an enclosed area of about 35 feet.We attempted to signal our location to the surface by beating on the mine bolts and plates. We found a sledgehammer, and for a long time, we took turns pounding away. We had to take off the rescuers in order to hammer as hard as we could. This effort caused us to breathe much harder. We never heard a responsive blast or shot from the surface.We eventually gave out and quit our attempts at signaling, sitting down behind the curtain on the mine floor, or on buckets or cans that some of us found. The air behind the curtain grew worse, so I tried to lie as low as possible and take shallow breaths. While methane does not have an odor like propane and is considered undetectable, I could tell that it was gassy. We all stayed together behind the curtain from that point on, except for one attempt by Junior Toler and Tom Anderson to find a way out. The heavy smoke and fumes caused them to quickly return. There was just so much gas.We were worried and afraid, but we began to accept our fate. Junior Toler led us all in the Sinners Prayer. We prayed a little longer, then someone suggested that we each write letters to our loved ones. I wrote a letter to Anna and my children. When I finished writing, I put the letter in Jackie Weaver's lunch box, where I hoped it would be found.'"

"'06-04-27,'1','The proposal came out on the same day that Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, announced that its first quarter earnings increased by 7 percent, pushed up by higher oil prices.Whether the senators' proposals will become reality was an unanswerable question this afternoon. Some of their ideas may not be popular with their Democratic colleagues. Then, too, whatever the Senate passes must get House approval, as well as President Bush's.Mr. Bush, touring the Gulf Coast region today, used a stop at a service station in Biloxi, Miss., to promote some of his energy ideas, which include drilling in the wildlife refuge, and to show his concern for consumers. ""The first thing is to make sure that nobody is getting cheated,"" he said. ""One of the roles of the federal government is to make sure that you're taken care of.""""We've got a problem because we're dependent on oil from overseas,"" Mr. Bush said, using the language he has embraced to argue for drilling in Alaska, proposed by the Republican senators today, and for building more refineries in the United States.The idea of opening up a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for gas and oil exploration has been explosive every time it has come up in Congress.At the senators' news conference, one questioner suggested that at least some proposals echo those incorporated in a sweeping energy bill passed last August — a suggestion that Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, deflected by describing the Republican program as ""a bold package.""Mr. Frist said he hoped a vote on the Republicans' package could be held ""very quickly."" Lawmakers of both parties have plunged into energy-related issues in the past few days and have been looking again at industry-friendly measures enacted in last year's energy bill.The $100 rebate seemed to be the centerpiece of the plan laid out today. ""It will show people that Washington gets it,"" said Senator Jim Talent of Missouri, ""and that it's time to provide some relief to Americans, to Missourians who are trying to support their families and are paying these very high gasoline prices.""Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania blamed ""the obstruction of the folks on the other side,"" meaning Democrats, for holding up progress on forward-looking energy legislation. Both Mr. Talent and Mr. Santorum are up for re-election.Besides a $100-per-family rebate, the Republican senators' package calls for giving the administration new authority to raise fuel-efficiency standards; spending $1.1 billion on alternative-fuels research and $1.8 billion on hybrid-vehicle research; opening part of the wildlife refuge for drilling, and subjecting oil companies to tougher scrutiny.""I know the Democrats have proposed, or last night were working and are strongly supporting, a windfall-tax proposal,"" Mr. Frist said. ""For the most part, I think we'd be very opposed to that. And if they'd like to vote on that, we'd like to take this directly to the floor and vote on this as well.""Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, where there is widespread sentiment for drilling in the wildlife refuge, said the tract was ""probably this country's best opportunity for a long-term source of oil that is quite apparent we desperately need."" The tract could yield a million barrels of oil a day — about what was lost during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita — and do it for 30 years, she said.'"
"'06-04-27,'1','And in the southern Iraqi town of Nassiriya, three Italian soldiers and a Romanian were killed when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb, the Italian news agency ANSA said.The two secretaries arrived in Iraq on Wednesday. Ms. Rice stayed the night in the heavily fortified green zone at a bend in the Tigris River in the city, while Mr. Rumsfeld stayed at Camp Victory, located near the airport a few miles outside Baghdad.In remarks today at a meeting with Mr. Rumsfeld, Iraq's national security adviser, Dr. Muwaffak Al Rubaie, said that there would be large reduction in the American troop presence by the end of the year.""Certainly at the end of this year, there is going to be a sizeable gross reduction in U.S. troops,"" he said, speaking at the opening of a meeting between senior Iraqi and American officials.He added that within the next two years, ""We hope most coalition troops will go back home.""Dr. Rubaie, who has previously said that 30,000 troops could withdraw from Iraq this year, also suggested that Iraqi and American officials were working on a formal plan to turn over responsibility to Iraqi security forces as security conditions and other milestones are achieved.""We have a plan now for a conditions-based transition agreement between the Iraqi security forces, the Iraqi government and the United States government"" that would lay out how Iraqi forces would take over responsibility for security in the country.Mr. Rumsfeld, who spoke after Dr. Rubaie's statement, made no comment on the Iraqi official's assertion that a large number of American troops would be withdrawn this year. He has previously expressed hope that could happen but said it would depend on improvement in security conditions and other factors.Iraqi troops have been taking over from American forces in some areas of the country, but Dr. Rubaie's statement was the first suggestion that the pace of that transition and possible American withdrawals is the subject on ongoing negotiations.Pentagon spokesman Eric Ruff said he had no immediate comment on Dr. Rubaie's statements.Dr. Rubaie is not expected to hold on to his job as national security adviser in the new Iraqi government now being formed, but he may receive another senior position.Throughout their visit, both cabinet secretaries also sought to put the past differences between the departments behind them by emphasizing that they would be working more cooperatively to bolster the Iraqi government, which the prime minister-designate, Mr. Maliki, says he wants to finish putting together in the next several days.The secretaries spent much of their joint visit, which officials said had been ordered by President Bush and which had not been previously announced because of security concerns, speaking with Iraqi officials in the heavily guarded Green Zone in central Baghdad.Administration officials said that in his meeting with Ms. Rice, Mr. Maliki spoke of ""re-establishing trust"" among Iraqis by acting quickly to restore electrical power and root out the influence of militias in Iraq's police forces, which number about 135,000 nationwide.With an estimated thousands of these forces in Baghdad alone infiltrated by the Badr brigade, a Shiite militia whose members have been accused of kidnapping and killing Sunnis, American officials said they did not know what sort of muscle or conciliation Mr. Maliki would use to carry out this pledge.""It's clearly one of the high priorities for the government,"" Ms. Rice said. ""How they go about that I think is something they will have to work through.""Mr. Rumsfeld, asked how American armed forces could do the job, said: ""The first thing I'd say is, we don't. The Iraqis do.""The new Iraqi government ""undoubtedly and unquestionably will be addressing the question,"" he added. ""Other countries have dealt with these issues. It's possible that these things can be done.""Many experts say, however, that demobilizing the militias, or disarming them forcibly, will be extremely difficult because they are heavily armed and well connected politically to leading Shiite figures without whose support Mr. Maliki's government could collapse.Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the American ground commander in Iraq, told reporters that the new government would need to crack down on the militias. ""That to me is an issue we've got to get fixed,"" he said. ""We need a policy on militias. We need a policy on weapons, and that is something the government is going to tackle early on.""At least in Ms. Rice's entourage, there was an atmosphere that the joint visit might offer a last chance to reverse some of the mistakes of the past three years in providing security for Iraq, getting the oil and power systems back and curbing sectarian hatreds and corruption.""Clearly this new Iraqi government must perform on behalf of the Iraqi people,"" said James Wilkinson, a senior adviser to the secretary . ""But the new government also gives us a chance to correct our mistakes and do our part to make Iraq work.""Bantering amiably with reporters about past comments interpreted as jabs at each other, the two cabinet secretaries both praised Mr. Maliki, the nominee of Iraq's Shiite voting bloc. He was so little known before his ascent that the Americans were surprised to learn on Wednesday that he preferred a different first name from the one that had been widely publicized last week, Jawad.Ms. Rice said of him, ""I found him very focused and very clear that he understood his role and the role of the new government to demonstrate that it was a government of national unity in which all Iraqis could trust and on which all Iraqis could rely.""It was unclear how much the American push to form an Iraqi government would speed the moment when the Bush administration decides whether there could be troop reductions later this year.Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the senior American commander, said he would wait until after a permanent Iraqi government was in place before making any recommendations to Mr. Bush on troop cuts.Mr. Rumsfeld told reporters at the briefing with Ms. Rice that he hoped reductions could take place. Asked whether any Iraqi leaders had expressed a preference for such cuts, he joked: ""No one that I talked to. I indicated that, needless to say.""As Ms. Rice and Mr. Rumsfeld met with Iraqi leaders, the violence that has plagued this country continued.Insurgents detonated at least four bombs near police patrols in Baghdad on Wednesday, killing three people, an Interior Ministry official said. At least three others were killed Wednesday in attacks across the country, and the bodies of 11 people were found in Baghdad, Karbala and Kirkuk, with all but one showing signs of torture, Reuters reported.The American military said in a statement on Wednesday that it killed 13 people on Tuesday in the restive town of Yusifiya, south of the capital, after troops came under fire as they began a raid on a suspected insurgent safe house. Five insurgents were killed outside the house as they tried to fire a rocket, the military said.Then, the military said, seven men and one woman inside were killed in an airstrike called against the house after American troops continued to be shot at. The statement said that every one of the men was later found to have been armed and that ""body bombs"" and ammunition were also found in the house.For their visit in Baghdad, Mr. Rumsfeld flew in from Washington overnight and arrived at dawn on Wednesday, and Ms. Rice flew in from Ankara a few hours later. ""We really want to be ready to hit the ground running with this new government when it's ready to go,"" Ms. Rice said on her way here.The joint visit of the secretaries of defense and state was significant given the history of squabbles between their departments since the beginning of planning for the Iraq war in 2002, when the Pentagon froze out the State Department from Iraqi reconstruction and political decisions.More recently, disputes between the departments over providing security for a system of American teams to help the government provide services at the province level had stalled their establishment in every province. The system, which has been championed by Ms. Rice, is in place in only 5 of Iraq's 18 provinces, including Baghdad.The air of tension spilled into the open last month when Ms. Rice commented early this month in Britain that there had been ""thousands"" of tactical errors in Iraq and Mr. Rumsfeld said later in a radio interview that he did not know what she was talking about.Asked on Wednesday whether he had learned what Ms. Rice was referring to, he joked, ""She's right here and you can ask her.""""Maybe you should ask me what I meant,"" Ms. Rice responded with a smile, adding that she did not mean ""thousands"" to be taken literally and or ""in the military sense."" She said she would be prepared to analyze administration mistakes when she returned to writing history, but not now.Later, Ms. Rice told Fox News, ""The secretary and I have an excellent relationship, and we're having a great time here in Iraq.""Asked if their appearance so quickly after Mr. Maliki's ascent might make him look as if he were an American puppet, Ms. Rice dismissed the question.""I don't think there is any doubt in anyone's mind that the 11 million Iraqis who went out and voted were exercising sovereignty and that this prime minister intends to do what he thinks is best for the Iraqi people,"" she said, calling his government ""the most democratic process ever in the Middle East.""'"
"'06-04-27,'1','Several skirts are homages to arte povera, the school of conceptual art that celebrates ephemerality and decay: one skirt is dyed in such a way as ""to create a damaged effect,"" while another assumes ""a dirtied look of almost destroyed beauty."" Another is ""painted with shadows to obtain a dirtied effect in a cancellation of beauty."" Sharp-edged miniature mirrors, which plate the hem of another, can render the garment ""somewhat uncomfortable when walking."" Clothing designed to facilitate self-mortification. Now I know what I'm wearing to the premiere of ""The Da Vinci Code.""For the duration of the show, the women's clothes for sale are mostly downstairs, underneath the zebrawood half-pipe that takes up the center space. It's as if Mr. Koolhaas and Ms. Prada decided to thumb their noses at the enterprise of shopping, creating a showroom for clothes that hardly has room to show clothes, a place where the grandiosity of the architecture takes a premium over the merchandise. At its heart this store seems almost ashamed of the fact that it is a store, veiling its commercial intentions beneath an apologetic veneer of art.But there is a history of ambivalence here. Ms. Prada herself is a former Communist, according to past iterations of the company's literature. Yet she has adapted herself quite fluently to the world of high-end fashion, and its prices. Often I found myself wondering if I was reading a price tag or bar code. A hand-beaded bolero jacket in navy-blue duchesse satin costs a bit more than $20,000. An elaborately embroidered skirt in orange taffeta is $11,515.Downstairs, two young women, their eyes ringed in kohl, pawed the clothes. ""I can't believe they let us touch this stuff,"" said one, pointing out the beautifully unfinished hem on a short evening jacket. It was the most finished-looking unfinished hem I have ever seen. A row of subtle drop-waist dresses in chalk, pink and gray looked wearable, as did a cotton dress with elaborate wooden beading. I liked the sandals teetering not on wedge soles but cantilevered up on bamboo stilts, like a Balinese beach shack, and the jeweled wedge sandals ($850). I didn't like the espadrilles with a big Prada nameplate on the front ($460), which look too logo-conscious to me, in a way that suggests a Chanel logo — circa 1986.Some of the practical machinery at work in the store is fascinating, like the wheels that can be turned to change the perimeters of the lower-level rooms, much like the rolling bookshelves in libraries. The men's clothing is now on display upstairs, at the Mercer Street end of the store; boxes and cases hang from a complex metal gridwork overhead and can be switched easily to change the layout.But the most heralded technological promises fail to deliver. The round elevator, which was constructed at a cost of $1 million, didn't work during my two recent visits. And even if it did, it (theoretically) travels only between the ground floor and the basement floor, a distance shoppers can travel in about four seconds by foot.In 2001 the dressing rooms were heralded as techno-wizardry: touch a button, and the glass enclosing each room is supposed to go opaque. But they were not working either (there are conventional dressing rooms at the back). So much hard work has gone into this place, and yet it has succumbed to the insults of time and the colloquial nuisances of city life, like the fire that, adding insult to injury, started in American Eagle Outfitters next door. The interior is such a major structural statement, and so impractically suited to most ventures, that whoever the next tenant is will be forced to destroy it and rebuild it.I also suspect that the store has not fully recovered from the fire's water damage. In one room on the lower level, dimly lit and quite cool, I inhaled and was suddenly seized by an attack of homesickness. I missed my parents terribly and craved a Snickers bar. And then I realized: the room was damp, and I was remembering summer camp.

"'06-04-27,'1','""The increasing tax burden is a sign of our weakening fiscal condition,"" Mr. Hevesi said. ""We are losing our competitive edge, and there will be a day of reckoning. Somebody has got to start thinking about the long term.""Not surprisingly, the tax burden falls the most heavily on the suburban counties in the New York metropolitan region, where homeowners routinely pay high taxes to finance their schools.Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties have tax burdens per household that are more than double the statewide average.Long Island homeowners have a tax bill of more than $10,000 per household on average, and taxpayers in the Hudson Valley region have a bill of more than $8,000.In Westchester, the overall tax bill has increased by 67 percent in the last decade, with the average bill per household reaching nearly $10,000 annually. But one of the highest increases came in Putnam, where the tax bill has grown by more than 77 percent in the last decade, with the tax bills topping more than $9,000 per household on average.In his report, Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, praised Gov. George E. Pataki's cap on Medicaid spending for counties, which the comptroller said had slowed the growth of property taxes this year.Earlier this year, the comptroller's office issued a report that found that county property taxes increased by about 3.3 percent in 2006, compared with an average annual increase of 7 percent between 2001 and 2005.The state's high tax burden is driven entirely by high property taxes, according to the most recent report, while state taxes are roughly the same as the national average. In the last five years, property tax bills increased by 42 percent, compared with inflation of 13 percent, according to the report.But the report also noted that the high property tax levels in suburban counties outside New York City might not be so burdensome on many residents there, because property values in those areas are so high and residents typically have much larger incomes.Most of the increases can be attributed to increases in taxes to pay for local school districts, the report said. School districts account for 61 percent of the property tax burden outside New York City. In all but the five largest cities in the state, property taxes are the only significant revenue source for school districts.Some critics of high property taxes, including Mr. Pataki, have proposed placing a cap on school spending to limit local taxes, but the State Legislature has rebuffed the idea, saying that such a cap would prevent districts from paying for their fixed costs.""This is an issue that is an obvious concern, but nobody is confronting the source of it,"" said Edmund J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center, a conservative fiscal policy group. ""The only solution to that is a cap on school taxes. Unless you do something like that it is absolutely certain to continue.""Property taxes began creeping upward in the 1990's, with an average annual increase of about 2.3 percent, according to the report.Then, in 1997, Governor Pataki, a Republican, and the Legislature enacted a School Tax Relief program, known as STAR, which allowed homeowners to reduce some of their property taxes and reimburse school districts. But Mr. Hevesi's report said that the program had merely shifted the costs to the state and not had much long-term impact in limiting property taxes.""STAR has had a minimal effect of limiting the tax rate,"" Mr. Hevesi said. ""Its impact is diminished when property rates go up in a short-term sugar rush.""But Wednesday, Mr. Pataki defended his STAR plan and criticized the Legislature for rejecting his proposal in this year's budget to tie property tax rebate checks for homeowners to caps in property tax increases.He said that despite increases in education aid for schools across the state, several districts were asking voters to approve property-tax increases in local elections next month.""That to me is wrong,"" Mr. Pataki said. ""That to me is not just wrong, that is something we should be taking action against.""Education advocates have said that any moves to cap school spending would hamstring their efforts to improve technology and keep up with the increasing fixed costs such as pensions and transportation.""We don't think that arbitrary caps work well,"" said David Ernst, a spokesman for the New York State School Boards Association. ""The costs of the local tax burdens have risen because the largest part of the school budgets are paid by local taxes. The problem is not at the local level.""Mr. Hevesi said that while local taxes make up the largest part of property tax bills, the state should come up with a plan to lower taxes, rather than shift the burden of costs from the state to municipalities.'"

"'06-04-27,'1','The Portuguese government, seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, has introduced legislation that forces utilities to pay 0.31 euro a kilowatt hour for solar energy.Spain and Germany have similar programs, and Italy recently introduced one as well.""It takes a huge amount of work to develop these projects, to get the permits, to find the modules, and solar energy still costs more than fossil fuels or wind,"" Mr. Marsden said. ""So we are only going to invest in countries with supportive regimes.""That list does not yet include the United States. Richard King, a team leader in the Energy Department's photovoltaic research group, said that many homeowners, particularly in California, had installed rooftop panels, as had some Wal-Mart stores and other businesses. But Mr. King conceded that American economics did not yet favor solar energy. He said that people in Portugal and many other parts of Europe were already accustomed to paying 25 cents to 30 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity.In the United States, the cost still averages 10 cents to 14 cents, ""and utilities are just not going to buy 25-cent solar electricity,"" he said.Mr. King said that the Energy Department was already spending about $78 million a year to seek ways to bring down the cost of photovoltaic cells, and that President Bush had asked Congress to authorize an additional $63 million a year. ""We want to mainstream solar energy by 2015, and that means putting it on cost parity with any other source of energy,"" he said.Solar panels are arrays of semiconductors that convert light to electricity. The wattage can be used directly in a home or fed into a utility's power grid.PowerLight, which was founded in 1991, already operates three interconnected clusters of solar panels in Bavaria that together generate 10 megawatts of electricity, and is building a 3-megawatt plant in Las Vegas, which will be the largest in the United States. G.E.'s manufacturing arm makes rooftop solar panels that are appearing in California and New Jersey. And Energy Financial Services already has $162 million invested in assorted solar projects that generate about 149 megawatts of electricity. Just this month it invested in new projects to use solar roofs to power two San Diego schools.But solar farms remain expensive to build, and a persistent shortage of the purified silicon needed to make solar panels has been a barrier to the industry's growth.Alex Urquhart, the unit's president, said that solar energy was among the areas that his group was actively exploring, but for now, ""The overall picture is still dominated by wind.""That may change, though. The silicon shortages are easing, and developing technologies are making solar installations more productive. For example, the PowerLight panels used in the Portugal project track the sun as it moves across the sky, to maximize exposure.Correction: April 29, 2006, Saturday A caption in Business Day on Thursday with a picture of a solar farm in Bavaria described the picture incorrectly. It was a photograph, not an artist's rendering.'"
"'06-04-27,'1','Mr. Ford, who is known for his interest in the environment, said in an interview that he wanted to use the meeting to lobby the government to finance a national delivery system for ethanol, the grain alcohol fuel made from corn.Together, the three companies have sold millions of flexible-fuel vehicles, which can run on either gasoline or a gasoline-ethanol mixture.G.M. has introduced a campaign to promote the use of E85, a mixture of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, blanketing billboards and the sides of buses with the slogan, ""Live green, go yellow.""But Mr. Ford said many of the 1.5 million buyers who own Ford's flexible-fuel vehicles either do not know they are able to run on both fuels, or are unable to find ethanol-based fuel that could help lessen the country's dependence on oil.""If the goal is to drive ethanol, you have to have it priced attractively,"" Mr. Ford said. That is a problem because the United States has only 600 stations that dispense ethanol-based fuel, versus about 176,000 gasoline stations. Still, the number of ethanol stations doubled last year and should grow further because of tax credits passed by Congress last year that are meant to promote the installation of E85 pumps.The discussion over ethanol comes amid rising gasoline prices, which threaten to hurt recovery efforts at Ford and G.M. Each lost market share and billions of dollars in North America last year, while Chrysler gained market share and made money.Together, G.M. and Ford have announced plans to cut 60,000 jobs and close more than two dozen plants through 2012.After Ford announced its cutbacks in January, Mr. Bush said the solution to reversing the automakers' problems lay in developing ""a product that's relevant."" Rather than having the government bail them out, as Congress did in 1979 to save Chrysler from bankruptcy, ""I think it's very important that the market should function,"" Mr. Bush added.Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of G.M., who is known for his candor, criticized Mr. Bush's comments this month. Speaking in New York, Mr. Lutz said: ""I'm a lifelong Republican, by the way, but next time around, Hillary, here I come. I'm a protest vote.""Mr. Ford said the discussion of a bailout would not be on the agenda for the meeting with Mr. Bush, whose former chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., served as G.M.'s lobbyist before joining the White House.Although this would be their first collective session with Mr. Bush, the three Detroit chief executives held two high-profile meetings with President Clinton. The first, in early 1993, took place in Little Rock, Ark., shortly before Mr. Clinton was inaugurated, in what was seen as an unusual show of support for an industry.The second, in May of that year, provided an opportunity for the companies to show off their cars. They lined up 120 automobiles in an event called ""Drive American Quality."" Mr. Clinton, a car buff, strolled among the gleaming vehicles, stroking the side panels of some and gazing avidly at others. There are no plans for any kind of auto show this time, officials at the companies said.'"

Putin's two-day summit with Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, ended on Thursday with a deal between Gazprom, the state energy monopoly, and the German chemical giant BASF. Rossiiskaya Gazeta reported that a joint bank venture is next on the two leaders' agenda, an initiative intended to deepen the economic ties between the two countries. Izvestia noted, however, that ""the Germans are still scared to allow our companies into their markets."" The newspapers generally agreed that the meeting was successful in strengthening relations that many feared would become worse after Ms. Merkel took over from Gerhard Schroeder, although Izvestia said the conference failed to achieve the ""breakthrough"" that Russian leaders were hoping for. ""The path of Russian businesses to the nearly inaccessible European markets will not become any easier,"" the paper said.Mr. Putin used the opportunity to speak out against Europe's growing caution over Gazprom's European energy purchases. He warned that if European countries continue to accuse Gazprom of ""expansion,"" the company would seek out other markets. Mr. Putin appeared particularly offended by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's warnings to Turkey and Greece not to sell their energy infrastructure to the Russian company. ""We need to talk about the general rules of the game,"" the paper quoted the president as saying. Kommersant derided Mr. Putin's comments as a knee-jerk reaction to any reference to the country's image as an unreliable business partner following Russia's widely criticized gas war with Ukraine in January. ""As soon as he sees European leaders,"" the paper said, ""he immediately starts to justify himself or to accuse them of something."" The paper even joked that Ms. Merkel selectively donned her headphones at a conference because the president's speech was ""most certainly of no interest to her"" — though Ms. Merkel does speak some Russian.SOLZHENITSYN ON RUSSIAN DEMOCRACY: In an interview, Aleksandr I.

"'06-04-28,'1','If a flu pandemic strikes, there will be no safe way to decontaminate a disposable face mask so it can be reused, a panel of medical experts said yesterday.The thicker of the two kinds of disposable masks can be reused if it has been protected by a plastic face shield or a thinner mask worn over it, said the Institute of Medicine panel, which included experts in infectious diseases and fabric engineering. But even then, the wearer must be careful not to touch it with unwashed hands.Even the best mask ""will do little to protect a person who uses it incorrectly, and we know relatively little about how effective these devices will be against flu even when they are used correctly,"" said Dr. Donald S. Burke, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, co-chairman of the panel.Face masks were used extensively during the global Spanish flu disaster of 1918 and in Asia during the SARS outbreak of 2003, but they have never been specifically tested against flu viruses.Because it could be months or years before vaccines and antiviral drugs are available in a pandemic, masks and measures like quarantines, hand-washing, avoiding handshakes and canceling public gatherings will be the first line of defense. But mask shortages can be expected in any epidemic, and so the Institute of Medicine, medical arm of the National Academies, was asked to study ways to stretch supplies.Of the two kinds of disposable masks, one is the surgical mask, made of a thin layer of cloth or paper. It is considered better at keeping sick people from spreading germs than at keeping wearers safe.Better but more expensive are N95 masks, often called respirators and made of spun plastic fibers. Designed to block 95 percent of particles and vapors if they are worn correctly, they are used in hospitals, but also by painters and woodworkers, and can be found in any hardware store.'"
"'06-04-28,'1','This leaves Mr. Olmert 6 seats short of a majority in Parliament. Two ultra-Orthodox religious parties, Shas, which won 12 seats, and United Torah Judaism, which won 6, are also candidates to join the coalition, though no agreements have been reached.Still, Israel's coalition governments have been unstable, and any move to evacuate many settlers from territory that would ultimately be controlled by Palestinians is certain to draw fierce opposition. Three right-wing parties that have opposed Israeli withdrawals are likely to constitute the main opposition.The Labor Party leader, Amir Peretz, a longtime trade union leader, is to become the defense minister in a move that has stirred debate in Israel, where the post has often been held by former generals with many years of military experience.""Peretz knows less about the job of defense minister than any incumbent in Israel's history,"" Matan Vilnai, who is also a member of Parliament from the Labor Party, told the Israeli newspaper Maariv.Mr. Olmert's confirmed and potential partners emphasized social issues in the campaign, with calls for raising the minimum wage and increasing benefits for the elderly.David Libai, the leader of the Labor Party's negotiating team, said the social policies of the new government would seek ""a real improvement in the condition of workers, the students, the poor, the pensioners and the sick.""Mr. Olmert will have to work with his partners on these issues with the expectation that they will back his political plans for setting a border.With the militant Islamist group Hamas leading the new Palestinian government, there appears to be no prospect of renewed negotiations at present, despite calls for a revival of talks by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is from the rival Fatah movement.In the Gaza Strip on Thursday, Israeli aircraft fired missiles at two cars carrying militants, killing a man from Islamic Jihad and wounding another, the Israeli military and Palestinian security officials said.Also in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority Interior Ministry began training a new security force of militants from various factions. About 50 recruits took part in exercises witnessed by journalists on Thursday.The Interior Ministry, led by Said Siam, a Hamas member, announced plans last week for the new force, though Mr. Abbas immediately moved to block it.The power struggle led to clashes last week between Hamas and Fatah supporters in Gaza City and street protests elsewhere.However, Mr. Siam said the force would proceed as planned.'"
"'06-04-28,'1','James R. Milkey, chief of the environmental protection division of the Massachusetts attorney general's office, said the new case was more narrowly focused on what has become a central policy question about global warming: whether the E.P.A. has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide, the principal contributor to global warming, as a pollutant.""We feel we have an extraordinarily strong argument on that point,"" Mr. Milkey said.New York City, the District of Columbia and three environmental groups also joined in the suit, along with Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.The suit seeks to force the environmental agency to start regulating emissions of heat-trapping gases, like carbon dioxide, from power plants and to tighten regulations of conventional smog-forming pollutants. The basis for the argument is that the agency has not lived up to requirements in the Clean Air Act to ensure public health.With 135 new coal-powered plants on the drawing board nationwide, environmental groups see tougher emission controls as an urgent need before the building of plants that can last for half a century or more. The proposed plants would ""blow a hole in the world's effort to curb global warming,"" said Daniel Becker, director of the global warming program at the Sierra Club, a party to the suit. ""A little over a third of U.S. global warming pollutants come from power plants, and the bulk of it from coal-fired power plants.""The Bush administration has argued that voluntary measures are the best way to proceed on global warming, rather than requirements on industry to reduce emissions.""E.P.A. will review all options and make an informed decision on how to proceed,"" said Jennifer Wood, a spokeswoman for the agency. ""E.P.A.'s climate protection programs continue to exceed the agency's greenhouse gas emissions goals and are on target to meet the president's 18 percent goal to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 2012.""The administration's decision not to classify carbon dioxide as a pollutant has complicated the desire of several states to regulate emissions from cars.California is in the midst of a legal battle with automakers over the state's new law putting strict curbs on emissions from the tailpipes of cars and trucks. New York and other states are planning to mimic California's standards and have also been sued by the auto industry. The industry has been supported by the Bush administration.Environmentalists and lawyers for the states argue that the Clean Air Act compels the federal government to regulate carbon dioxide.""Does the Clean Air Act care about climate?"" asked David Doniger, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""Yeah, it says so.""The E.P.A. does not dispute global warming as a concept. Its Web site says that climate change is expected to raise sea levels and alter precipitation trends.""Changing regional climate could alter forests, crop yields and water supplies,"" the agency says. ""It could also affect human health, animals and many types of ecosystems.""'"
"'06-04-28,'1','Dana G. Mead, the chairman of Pfizer's compensation committee, replied that Mr. McKinnell's pay was based on market forces and reflected the breadth of responsibility assumed by the chief executive in overseeing 110,000 employees.Mr. Mead, the chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Corporation, the institute's board of trustees, was one of two Pfizer directors who received substantial opposition from shareholders, according to the company's preliminary statistics. Some 21.7 percent of the shares cast withheld support from Mr. Mead while 21.3 percent withheld support from George A. Lorch, the chairman emeritus of Armstrong Holdings, the manufacturer of floor and ceiling materials.At last year's meeting, 2.84 percent of shareholders withheld support from Mr. Mead, and 2.91 percent withheld support from Mr. Lorch. Shareholders of public companies cannot vote against a director. They can either vote in favor of a board member or withhold their support.Frederick E. Rowe Jr., president of Investors for Director Accountability, a month-old organization of businesspeople and investors that urged Pfizer's shareholders to withhold support from all four of the board's compensation committee members, said that he was pleased with the shareholder vote.Mr. Rowe said that his only disappointment was that Mr. McKinnell did not offer to return some of his pension to the company's shareholders. ""He could have been a leader in something that every person in America knows is wrong, which is compensation is too high and compensation that goes up without performance is grossly unfair to shareholders,"" Mr. Rowe said.None of the seven proposals put forward by shareholders won support from a majority of votes cast at the meeting. But two were backed by almost 40 percent of the vote; one would have required separating the jobs of chief executive and chairman at the company, while another would have allowed cumulative voting of shares by holders. Cumulative voting allows small stockholders to aggregate their stakes and vote in any manner they choose --all for one director or in any combination.Shares of Pfizer fell 11 cents yesterday, to close at $24.86.Before the meeting began, a small plane flew over the hotel meeting site towing a banner that read: ""Give it back, Hank!"" A dozen or so labor union protestors stood outside the hotel chanting: ""Hank McKinnell, rich and rude, we don't like your attitude.""Charlotte Luethje, a small shareholder from Roca, Neb., said: ""I think the thing that bothers me most is that we keep talking about the differences in the haves and the have-nots. Take the oil companies, take the drug companies, you take whatever company you want. That's where the big money is, in the C.E.O.'s.""Paul Fitzhenry, a Pfizer spokesman, said the meeting showed that the company listens carefully to its shareholders and has responded with significant changes, including a stronger link between pay and performance. ""There remains more to be done,"" Mr. Fitzhenry said, ""and we'll continue to be responsive to shareholder concerns.""Of eight shareholders interviewed before and after the meeting, only one supported Mr. McKinnell's pay.

"'06-04-28,'1','The statements came just one week after Intel reported a 38 percent drop in profit, to $1.35 billion, from $2.18 billion last year, and a 5 percent drop in revenue, to $8.9 billion. Mr. Otellini said then that the company would cut its costs by more than $1 billion this year.Company executives said Thursday that Intel ended the first quarter with excess inventory of several million units, but that they were confident they could get inventory levels back to normal this year.Investors were encouraged by the news, and shares rose 59 cents, to $20.08. The stock has traded from $18.75 to $28.84 over the last year.""The gloves are off,"" said Ashok Kumar, an analyst at Raymond James. ""They realized the urgency of the situation.""Intel also said it was slightly advancing plans for delivery of a new core architecture that it hoped would put its microprocessors on a par with its rivals.Mr. Bryant said Thursday that its new chip technology for servers, called Woodcrest, would come in June, while its processor for desktop computers, code-named Conroe, would arrive in July, and its new chip for notebooks in August. The company had previously said only that the products would arrive in the third quarter.It is in the server market that Intel has had its sharpest decline in market share. ""For the first half of this year, we are focused on clearing out inventory and ramping our new products,"" Mr. Otellini said. ""We absolutely focused on winning back market share.""By speeding up delivery of its newest chips, Intel hopes to stave off additional inroads by Advanced Micro Devices, and to be in the market for the education purchasing cycle during the summer as well as for the holiday season, analysts said.Mr. Otellini, who took over as Intel's chief executive in May, said it would be ""simplistic"" if the revamping was limited to a reduction of Intel's work force. He called the evaluation of the business the most significant one since the 1980's, when Intel made a strategic shift out of the memory business to focus almost entirely on microprocessors.Some analysts said they thought layoffs were inevitable.""You cannot get to $1 billion reduction through manufacturing efficiencies alone,"" Mr. Kumar said. Intel's work force has grown substantially the last few years, to nearly 100,000 employees at the end of 2005, as the company continued to invest during the industry downturn. The company ended 2004 with 85,000 employees.For Intel, the overhaul would be the first since January 2004, when it reorganized into five divisions, each focusing on a specific market.In May 2004, the company suffered an embarrassing setback when it was forced to concede that its chip technology had hit a ""thermal wall"" and that the company was forced to make a ""hard toggle"" of its entire product line. It scrapped previous plans and shifted to work on dual-core processor technology, which obtains more computing power by stamping multiple processors on a single chip rather than straining to increase the speed of a single processor.Intel executives also said Thursday that the company planned to accelerate the rate at which it introduces major architectural changes to its product line, revamping its chips every two years instead of every five years or so.'"

"'06-04-28,'1','LUXEMBOURG, April 27 - Lawyers for the European Commission and Microsoft faced tough questioning on Thursday about the 2004 antitrust ruling against the company.During cross-examination by 13 judges of the European Court of First Instance who are hearing Microsoft's appeal of the ruling, the sharpest questions were reserved for the commission. Judge John Cooke, who will write the decision in the case, appeared to chastise commission lawyers for not taking the company's concerns about protecting its intellectual property seriously.Under the 2004 ruling, Microsoft was ordered to disclose technical details to rival makers of software for computer servers to allow them to develop programs that work as smoothly with the Windows operating system as Microsoft's own software does. The company contends this order breaches its intellectual property rights, while the commission argues that Microsoft is seeking to preserve trade secrets that fall short of legal protection.On Wednesday, Anthony Whelan, the commission's top lawyer handling the software development part of the case, argued that patent and copyright claims must be scrutinized by independent bodies before they were granted protection, whereas trade secrets did not. Yet the bulk of Microsoft's intellectual property argument revolves around the trade secrets in Windows that the commission wants the company to reveal.""Trade secrets are not entitled to the degree of protection that Microsoft claims,"" Mr. Whelan asserted.'"
"'06-04-28,'1','But making a dent in the militias' influence will be difficult to accomplish, as some elements of the Iraqi Army and security forces are already dominated by members loyal to one militia or another.Indeed, in a demonstration of the balancing act Mr. Maliki must perform both as prime minister and as leader of a fractious Shiite coalition, he met next with Mr. Sadr, the anti-American cleric who oversees the militia known as the Mahdi Army, thousands of young Shiite men who control northeastern Baghdad and have fought fierce battles with the American military.Mr. Maliki was careful not to offend Mr. Sadr, perhaps the most influential single force in the Shiite coalition, suggesting that militias deserve to remain an influence, even if only from within the military.""Merging the militias into the military,"" Mr. Maliki said, ""is not to disrespect them but to reward them for their role in the struggle against dictatorship,"" a reference to fighting by Kurdish and Shiite forces against Saddam Hussein. ""And it is a solution to the problem of having weapons outside the government.""Mr. Maliki also pledged to name nonsectarians to run the Iraqi Interior and Defense Ministries.Mr. Maliki's political pilgrimage to Najaf came as Baghdad residents were reminded that even the most powerful Iraqi leaders cannot protect family members from the savage violence here.Mr. Hashemi's sister was shot dead in a morning rush-hour ambush near her home. Her death came only two weeks after the murder of Mr. Hashemi's brother, and served as another indication of how insurgents are intent on terrorizing leaders of the new government. While government leaders are heavily guarded, their families are often easier targets.Mr. Hashemi's sister, Maysoon al-Hashemi, 61, who was director of women's affairs in her brother's Iraqi Islamic Party, was buried a few hours later. Co-workers recalled how bravely she took the news that her brother Mahmoud had been assassinated on April 13.Inside the Green Zone on Thursday, an American military spokesman offered an optimistic view of the situation in Iraq, saying the country was ""moving away"" from civil war.""All indications now are the acts of violence -- ethnosectarian violence is decreasing,"" Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch said at a news briefing. He cited a 60 percent decrease in casualties in Baghdad in the week starting April 16 compared with the previous week. Yet he also acknowledged that casualties had soared by 90 percent in the past 10 weeks, since before the bombing of the Askariya Shrine in Samarra in late February set off a wave of sectarian violence.Other newly released American government findings cast Iraq's situation in even less positive terms. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, reported that attacks against American-led forces, Iraqis and infrastructure increased 23 percent from 2004 to 2005.""The insurgency intensified through October 2005 and has remained strong and resilient since then,"" the G.A.O. said in a 31-page report. ""Many Iraqis in Baghdad and the central and northern Sunni areas have lost confidence in the Iraqi Army and police to improve the security situation. In some Sunni areas, support for the insurgents has increased, and Iraqi Shias have expressed greater confidence in their militias.""The G.A.O. also found that in contrast to past assertions that four provinces were facing serious problems, six were in ""serious"" shape and one was ""critical."" The finding was based on a study by the military and American Embassy in Baghdad.Before leaving Iraq, Ms. Rice and Mr. Rumsfeld voiced support again for Mr. Maliki as a strong leader who could re-establish confidence in the government, while Iraq's national security adviser, Dr. Muwaffak al-Rubaie, suggested there could be a large reduction in American troops by 2007.'"

"'06-04-28,'1','Coade is a kind of artificial stone that was made at Coade's Manufactory in London from 1769 to 1833. Interestingly for the late 18th century, its first two proprietors were women: a mother and her daughter, each named Eleanor Coade. (The daughter seems to have been the driving force in the business after 1771.) The daughter never married but was always referred to as Mrs. Coade, apparently the way the rare female entrepreneur was addressed.According to Alison Kelly's 1990 book, ""Mrs. Coade's Stone,"" Coade was a deeply religious Baptist and a sculptor with the Society of Artists. She hired artists more talented than herself, particularly John Bacon (1740-99), one of the leading neo-Classical sculptors of the period, who worked with her until he died.Her success is easily proved by a short list of customers, including George III, the Prince of Wales and a Debrett's full of English lords and dukes. There are Coade stone ornaments at Buckingham Palace, Brighton Palace, Castle Howard, Wilton, Syon House, Strawberry Hill (Horace Walpole's house), the Admiralty in Whitehall, St. Paul's Cathedral and the Royal Naval College Chapel in Greenwich.After Coade died in 1821, her relatives and others took over the firm; it went bankrupt in 1833.Coade stone is a vitrified ceramic artificial stone, with a matte finish, in colors ranging from pale gray to beige to light yellow. Its recipe was a jealously guarded secret, probably because there were other companies making artificial stone whose products did not weather as well.It is hard for a layman to understand the significance of its many ingredients. ""Coade stone consists mainly of a ball clay (from Dorset or Devon) to which were added grog, flint and sand to reduce shrinkage, and soda-lime-silica glass to help vitrify it,"" John P. S. Davis writes in ""Antique Garden Ornament"" (Antique Collectors' Club, 1998).The grog, or crushed unglazed pottery, was made with the ground powder of previously fired stoneware, which somehow insured greater stability and caused less shrinkage in the kiln. The ""fortified"" clay was kneaded, pressed into plaster molds and fired at a temperature of more than 1,100 degrees Celsius over four days.The resulting piece of ceramic is amazingly strong, stronger than lead and carved stone.Coade stone had several advantages. It was much cheaper than real quarry stone, resisted the British winter without cracking or breaking and unlike iron was not prone to oxidation. Best of all, it could be finely modeled and never lose its sharpness and clarity. It didn't melt away like limestone.The Coade company produced hundreds of designs, most of them new. Some were copies of ancient pieces like the caryatids from the Erechtheum on the Acropolis in Athens or the granite lions outside the Capitol in Rome.The company made both external architectural embellishments for classical buildings and garden ornaments. Prominent 18th-century architects like Robert Adam, James Wyatt, John Nash and John Soane ordered Coade keystones with masks, heraldic plaques and coats of arms, Ionic and Corinthian capitals, lion-skin swags, cornices, friezes, funerary monuments and medallions for their buildings.In her 1999 book, ""Antique Garden Ornament: Two Centuries of American Taste"" (Harry N. Abrams), Ms. Israel shows two allegorical Coade medallions with reclining nymphs incorporated into a wall on a property in Fort Washington, Pa. One woman, wearing a Greek toga and holding a leafy branch, represents Agriculture; the second, similarly dressed but with a bowl of fruit, is Abundance.Coade stone garden ornaments include vases, busts, pedestals, furniture and allegorical figures of all kinds. One favorite is a copy of the Medici Vase at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, outside London. (The original is in the Uffizi Gallery.) It depicts, in bas-relief, scenes of the sacrifice of Iphigenia.Another is a copy of the Borghese Vase at Stourhead, an English country house. (The original is in the Louvre.) It is covered with Bacchanalian revelers.Coade animals, real and imaginary, were popular subjects, including winged sphinxes, griffins, lions, eagles and horses. Dogs get no coverage in Ms. Kelly's book, but Ms. Israel has unearthed a drawing of a dog similar to the ones she is selling, in an influential 1807 book by Thomas Hope (1769-1831), ""Household Furniture and Interior Decoration.""Hope was a merchant, novelist, ardent classicist and amateur interior decorator. He spent eight years on the grand tour, making hundreds of drawings, and returned to England hoping to purify contemporary design by going back to ancient sources. His book included a drawing of a Grecian-style sofa with a recumbent greyhound perched where an armrest would normally be seen.In his book Mr. Davis writes that Hope bought several items from the Coade factory, including things he had designed. It is not known if he designed Ms. Israel's dog, but it looks identical to his drawing.'"
"'06-04-28,'1','Private equity is not a new area for law firms, but in some cases, the name or the status of the practice has changed. For example, Debevoise & Plimpton lawyers who used to say they worked on buyouts now call themselves private equity lawyers, said Franci J. Blassberg, a partner, who noted that her firm had added 20 lawyers in the area.At Debevoise and most other firms, private equity includes those who work on mergers and acquisitions, financing and formation of funds, as well as tax and employee benefits.Lawyers with these skills may have their pick of jobs. From 2003 to 2004, the legal search firm Major, Lindsey & Africa had listings for 20 private equity positions. But in the last 15 months, the firm was trying to fill 98 positions, said Jonathan Lindsey, a partner with the firm. The positions range from associates and partners to general counsels at private equity firms. The pay scale ranges from $150,000 for junior associates to ""very comfortable seven figures"" for some partners and general counsels.At many firms, the compensation tends to be higher than for comparable lawyers who are not doing private equity. It is, after all, ""'this year's black,"" Mr. Lindsey said.Because demand currently outstrips the supply of experienced lawyers, partners as well as associates in the area routinely are called by headhunters.""Once they know you're happy at your firm,"" said John R. LeClaire, a partner at Goodwin Procter in Boston, the calls ""start happening less.""Law firms, as a result, sometimes look beyond their traditional reach in their recruiting efforts. Marc H. Morgenstern, for example, then a partner at Kahn Kleinman in Cleveland who specialized in corporate as well as private equity work, was called ""out of the blue"" by a partner at a global firm whom he knew casually. The firm, which he declined to name, asked if Mr. Morgenstern wanted to head their Northern California office. Although he ultimately decided not to take the job, he wound up relocating to California, where he became a partner in the San Francisco office of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal.While private equity lawyers are on the top of most firms' wish lists, it is ""hard to decide to grow a private equity practice -- it's not a commodity,"" said R. Newcomb Stillwell, a partner at Ropes & Gray in Boston.It is frequently the same top-tier law firms doing more of the work. Part of the reason, said Mr. LeClaire of Goodwin Procter, is that ""there is the power of an incumbent.""""You share a history on the deal -- almost an informal secret language on how the firm does its deals that is invaluable,"" he said.Indeed, the large private equity firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, Carlyle and Bain Capital typically have longstanding relationships with large law firms.But consortiums or club deals, in which several large funds work together, allow lawyers ""to get in front of another private equity firm"" which can be useful for future work if there is a conflict, said Steven J. Gartner, a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher in New York who represents Warburg Pincus.Additionally, there may be more room for more firms because of newer private equity funds. Mr. LeClaire said that his firm, which is opening two new offices in California, was like a dark horse that had risen in league tables because of its work in the expanding middle market.With so much private equity and venture capital money sloshing around and trying to chase returns, there are concerns that the boom may be something of a bubble. For law firms, the question is how much to expand without becoming overextended in the event of a slowdown.Mr. Dettmer, for example, said his firm might open another office either in the United States or abroad, but was looking to expand ""in a measured way.""""We are not trying to double in size,"" he said.'"
"'06-04-28,'1','There are some bargains to be had, of course. Branson, Mo., a heavily tourist-dependent town, where 87 percent of visitors arrive by car, is for the third year offering a ""Gas Buster"" card, good for a total of $50 worth of discounts at local hotels, restaurants and shops, to anyone who can show receipts for $40 worth of gas bought in the 48 hours before arrival.Aspen, Colo., too, is again offering a $50 gas voucher, free parking, free bike rentals and assorted passes to attractions to anyone who books two nights of lodging in advance.And some voucher programs are kicking in earlier, and lasting longer. Last year and in 2004, about 100 inns, spread across the country, participated in ""Tanks a Lot,"" a program offering gas vouchers and assorted discounts and special discounts in June. This year, more than 60 inns began offering discounts in April, and Marti Mayne, a spokeswoman for BedandBreakfast.com, the promotional Web site that coordinates the program, said that many inns would extend the incentives well into the fall.LARGER hotels and theme parks may still come out with promotions as the summer gets closer, too. But it is not looking likely. Not one hotel or spa has asked the Automobile Club of New York to tell members of any incentives to compensate for high gasoline prices, the club says. That pattern -- or lack thereof -- is holding nationally. ""We're watching this issue to see how it plays out, but our parks and resorts have not been noticeably impacted by high or rising gas prices,"" said Donn Walker, senior manager of media relations for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.National hotel chains are sounding a similar theme. Kendra Walker, a spokeswoman for Hilton, said there were no plans for price sweeteners to lure drivers to Hampton Inns or other properties that cater to the drive-in trade. Marriott, which offered gas-discount cards at some hotels a year ago, does not have such plans now.Choice Hotels International, which owns Comfort Inns and Econo Lodge and several other brands that cater to driving vacationers, has occasionally offered gas-price-related discounts, but also has no plans to do so now. ""We aren't seeing any great downturn in occupancy rates or softening of travel demand due to the rising gas prices,"" said Wayne Wielgus, the chain's chief marketing officer. ""People may travel 300 miles instead of 400, but they're still traveling.""The AAA, which tracks automobile travel, expects that people will continue to take driving vacations, no matter what happens at the pumps this summer. ""Our experience tells us that the high price of fuel does not erode the number of Americans who travel during the summer,"" said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for the AAA. ""People have a certain amount of time from the job, the kids are out of school, and they'll cut back on other spending before they'll cancel a vacation they've been looking forward to.""That does not mean that tourist spots or hotels are ignoring the psychological impact that $3-plus gas can have on visitors. Their marketers know that, even though expensive gas probably adds $60, tops, to the cost of a 500-mile vacation, it still gets people worrying about budgets. So, they are taking steps to temper the fears with a dose of reality.That's certainly Florida's approach. Last year's high gas prices certainly did not keep vacationers away from Florida. According to VisitFlorida, the state tourism marketing organization, 85.8 million visitors came through, marking the first time the state exceeded the 80-million-visitor mark. And it expects a 3 percent increase in visitors this year.Still, after gas prices hit record highs in September, VisitFlorida began promoting Florida on Foot, a list of pedestrian-friendly destinations reachable by public transportation. And it put a fuel calculator on its Web site. Drivers can plug in the length of a planned trip and the mileage their cars usually get per gallon and figure out the total cost at various gas prices.""That way, people will see for themselves that the difference between gas at $2 a gallon or $3 a gallon is still a nominal part of the vacation's cost,"" said Vanessa M. Welter, VisitFlorida's director of communications.Chains that cater to lower-income vacationers are also hedging their bets. Accor North America, which owns the budget-priced Motel 6 and Studio 6 chains, has not introduced any new discount programs to ease the pain of gas-price rises. But it is more aggressively promoting the discount programs it has long had.Normally, discount-related advertising makes up about 40 percent of Accor's commercials; now the mix is half and half, and Eric Studer, Accor's senior director of advertising and marketing services, says it may soon tip even further toward the discount ads.""We don't see any indication of any big drop-off in people's travel plans, but we do realize that gasoline probably takes up a bigger percentage of the travel budget for low-income families,"" he said.That's the attitude at La Quinta hotels, too. Angelo Lombardi, the chain's chief operating officer, said its advance bookings presage a pretty good summer. Still, he said, La Quinta is tinkering with its advertising mix: less emphasis on the chain's high-speed Internet and king suites, more on the convenience of booking through the Web site. Mr. Lombardi does not rule out possible discounts or other special offers, either.""When you have 500 hotels, there are always going to be some empty rooms,"" he said, ""and we will make efforts through our marketing to make La Quinta a more likely choice for the leisure driving traveler.""IN fact, some destinations are trying to make the psychologically chilling effect of $3 gas work in their favor. South Dakota's Office of Tourism is offering a $20 voucher on its Web site that drivers in the 10 nearest states can download and cash in for ethanol-enhanced gasoline. A lot of ethanol is made in South Dakota, ""so we wanted to show empathy toward cost-conscious drivers as well as educate a larger audience about a product made here,"" said Billie Jo Waara, director of South Dakota's Office of Tourism.This year in Missouri, the Branson Lakes Area Chamber of Commerce, which administers the Gas Buster card program, added two additional sweeteners: 22 weekly drawings for a $100 gas voucher card, and a one-time drawing, on Sept. 30 -- when the program officially ends -- for a three-night vacation for four.No one at the chamber thinks that high gas prices have kept, or will keep, tourists away. Indeed, the stream of visitors to Branson has inched up steadily in recent years, to 7.3 million last year from 7.1 million in 2002. Instead, the chamber is hoping that the promotion will put Branson on more people's mental maps.""It is purely a public relations campaign,"" said Jennifer McCullough, the chamber's director of public relations. ""We hope a program with a catchy name like 'Gas Buster' will make more people think of Branson as a value destination.""'"
"'06-04-28,'1','The company said once again that the update for its new operating system software, Windows Vista, would not be available until January.For the first time, the company offered guidance on the coming year; its 2007 fiscal year starts in July.Microsoft said revenue for 2007 would be $49.5 billion to $50.5 billion, with earnings expected to be $1.36 to $1.41 a share. Financial analysts were forecasting $1.53 a share. That guidance created some concern among securities analysts in a conference call with Mr. Liddell.Richard G. Sherlund of Goldman Sachs, in a comment during the conference, said, ""There is something really big here that we haven't put our fingers on.""Other analysts were more direct in their assessment.""It looks like Microsoft is going to war with Google, and trying to get their product development back in track,"" said Eugene Munster of Piper Jaffray.According to Mark Stahlman of Caris & Company, the fact that Microsoft plans to spend significantly more in 2007 was an indication of renewed aggressiveness in its competitive strategy and an indication that the company was returning to the kind of actions it exhibited before the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit in the mid- and late 1990's.""It's pretty clear that Bill is running the company again,"" Mr. Stahlman said, referring to Bill Gates, ""and they are going to remake the business. They are being much more combative and much more strategically managed.""After Microsoft released its report, Mr. Sherlund issued a research note saying it appeared that the company planned to spend $2.4 billion more than he had expected in the 2007 fiscal year. He pointed to the costs of building the new Windows and Office Live online services, both intended to reposition the company to compete against Google and Yahoo.When confronted with that figure during the question-and-answer session with analysts Thursday, Mr. Liddell only partly disputed the conclusion of several of them that Microsoft had begun preparing to ""go to war"" with its online search rivals.""I would characterize it as a broad-based approach,"" he said. ""There are some big numbers there, that is certainly true.""Several other analysts noted that Microsoft's expenses appeared to be running away even before 2007, many of them focusing on what they called ""margin compression.""""It looks like a mess,"" said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, ""and the big issue is margins and expenses, the big issue is the bottom line. It makes it hard to get very excited about the company's near-term prospects.""During the conference call, Mr. Liddell was optimistic about progress in the introduction of the next-generation Xbox 360 video game player. He said that a significant part of the increased spending this year was related to a push Microsoft is making in an effort to capitalize on a delay in Sony's PlayStation 3.Microsoft now says it will ship 5 million to 5.5 million of the new Xbox systems in 2006. Sales of Xbox rose 85 percent, to $1.06 billion, in the quarter.The company also noted that its search ad revenue fell during the quarter as it tried to shift its online advertising away from a service provided by Yahoo to the newly developed MSN Ad Center system.It also reported that losses widened in its home and entertainment division, the Mobile and Embedded Devices Group, and the MSN service.Sales of Windows for PC's increased 7.5 percent, to $3.19 billion, in the quarter, while office sales rose 5 percent, to $2.95 billion.'"
"'06-04-28,'1','Fifty-seven people were arrested at a sit-in at New York University yesterday as part of an effort to pressure the university to grant its graduate teaching and research assistants union recognition.Graduate students and union supporters were arrested an hour after the Graduate Students Organizing Committee announced that a majority of graduate teaching assistants had signed a petition saying they wanted the group to be their union.The group, which is affiliated with the United Auto Workers, has been on strike for six months and is searching for new ways to pressure the university to grant union recognition. N.Y.U. says the strike has fizzled, asserting that only two dozen graduate teaching and research assistants are still participating, while the organizing committee insists that 200 are still involved.In 2000, shortly after the National Labor Relations Board reversed itself and ruled that graduate teaching and research assistants were essentially employees, not students, N.Y.U. became the first and only private university to grant union recognition to its graduate students.In a contract, the group won substantial improvements in compensation and benefits, but last August, N.Y.U. stopped recognizing and negotiating with the union. It did so after the labor relations board, which had become dominated by Bush administration appointees, reversed itself again and ruled that graduate assistants were students, not workers, and had no right to unionize.The group announced that the American Arbitration Association had certified that a majority of N.Y.U.'s more than 900 teaching and research assistants had signed a petition backing it as their union.'"

Perello, the president of the city's Marketing Development Corporation, resigned amid continuing criticism of a deal with Snapple to sell its beverages in city-owned buildings, but Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg maintained yesterday that he was satisfied with Mr. Perello's handling of the deal. The resignation was first reported yesterday by The New York Post.""I'm disappointed that he's chosen to go on,"" the mayor said. ""He's done a great job. Some of his things worked and parts didn't. In some programs, they all worked, and in some cases, they didn't work at all.""Mr. Bloomberg, who cited the example of Bloomberg L.P., the financial-information business he founded, said managers should be rewarded for innovation even when they fail. ""Risk-taking is something that we appreciate and that we want to encourage, and we will continue to do that, and I'm sorry that Joe is leaving,"" the mayor said.Kimberly D.

It is a gateway to Maryland's Eastern Shore, and house prices -- already high -- have really started to soar.GUILFORD, CONN. Less than an hour south of Hartford and about 15 minutes east of New Haven, Guilford has one of the prettiest village greens in Connecticut. From the center of Guilford, it's about five minutes to Stony Creek and the little launch that transports you around the Thimble Islands. But buying a shorefront cottage or an 18th-century center-chimney colonial on one of the quiet side streets of the town has almost as much cachet as a house on one of the islands -- and it's so much easier to get to in winter. Plenty of New Yorkers have weekend houses in Guilford, too -- it's only about a two-hour drive from Times Square.GALVESTON ISLAND, TEX. If you're a fisherman, Galveston is just the right place for spending a relaxing day at the end of a pier -- with dozens of fellow enthusiasts. But this island -- popular long before Houston was, and just a hair less than an hour away -- is a place for partying, too. The town plays host to the annual Beach Party Weekends (with its 32 miles of beaches, it's not hard to find an empty spot). The island has a choice of rambling Victorians and spanking new condominiums.LAKE MINNETONKA, MINN. A quick 50-minute ride from downtown St. Paul, Lake Minnetonka has been a vacation spot since the mid-19th century, hitting its heyday in the 1880's and 1890's, when steamboats plied its waters and women in huge feathered hats walked its boardwalks and checked into the grand lakeside hotels. Today, the area is full of moccasin shops, but also music and poetry festivals and lake cruises. There are many lakeside communities, including the delightfully named Wayzata, Excelsior, Long Lake and Mound -- with houses of every description and price.NAPA, CALIF. If San Francisco, with its streetcars and famous hills, is too exciting to spend seven days a week there, take a 45-minute drive to your minichateau in the southern part of the country's most famous wine district.

Carmine Covino, a waiter at a restaurant on Pacific Avenue, said that until recently, when he heard people compare Atlantic City unfavorably to Las Vegas, he would defend his hometown by saying: ""They don't have a board game, do they? They don't have Miss America.""""Well, I guess we don't have that anymore either,"" Mr. Covino, 19, said on Thursday.When Monopoly was devised in the 1930's, Atlantic City was chosen because it epitomized the kind of glittering tourist destination that many Depression-era Americans could only fantasize about visiting.Charles B. Darrow, an unemployed salesman, sketched the prototype board game on a tablecloth at his home in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, using 21 street names from Atlantic City. (The final space, Marvin Gardens, was a name taken from the neighboring community of Margate City, where it is spelled Marvyn.)The Parker Brothers game company rejected Mr. Darrow's proposal, so he went to a printer and began selling it himself. It caught on so quickly that Parker Brothers eventually reversed itself. It began mass-marketing Monopoly in 1935, and that year it became the world's best-selling board game. Pat Riso, a Hasbro spokeswoman, said it decided last year to poll fans to see how they might recast the game if it were to be developed today. So the ""here and now"" version will replace railroads with airlines. Utilities will be updated (Ms. Riso would not say with what, but allowed that Internet providers is a good guess.) Rents will rise, along with the cost of bail and the $200 payment for passing ""Go.""In one uncharacteristic bow to the past, free parking will remain free. The company says it would not be swayed by Atlantic City's campaign to be included in the updated version.""We love their passion, we think that's fabulous,"" Ms. Riso said. ""But at this time, we are not planning on changing the online vote.""Many residents of Atlantic City -- where a plaque honoring Mr. Darrow was erected at the intersection of Park Place and the Boardwalk -- said they would continue trying to pressure the company into changing its decision. But Carole Rodriguez, who lives on Vermont Avenue, said that whether or not the campaign succeeded, she and her husband would remain loyal to the version of Monopoly that made her neighborhood known around the globe.""Whenever we play, we would buy Vermont and we would laugh,"" said Ms. Rodriguez, 28, who works in the Borgata casino. ""We said we were going to kick everybody out and have the whole block to ourselves.""Correction: May 3, 2006, Wednesday An article on Friday about Hasbro's decision to eliminate Atlantic City as the setting of its flagship version of Monopoly misstated the cost of putting a hotel on Ventnor Avenue and referred imprecisely to another property, Marvin Gardens. A hotel on Ventnor costs $750 ($150 each for four houses and another $150 for the hotel), not $400. Marvin Gardens was the final property created by Charles B. Darrow, the man who devised the game for Parker Brothers in the 1930's; the final space on the board is Boardwalk. The article also misspelled the name of the neighborhood in Margate City, N.J., that inspired Marvin Gardens. It is Marven Gardens, not Marvyn.'"

"'06-04-29,'0','Stock options have long been used to link managers' interests to those of shareholders and have been a main driver in the escalation of executive pay. During the market boom of the 1990's, boards handed out piles of incentives to top managers that turned into mountains of cash.But less well known was the use of discounted options at dozens of companies, where a spike in the stock price was not required for executives to reap big rewards. A profit was already baked in.Today, stock options in general are falling out of favor, as markets are more subdued and accounting rules require companies to book them as an expense. And tough new tax rules are quickly causing discounted options to become extinct.Yet while regulatory changes have stopped most companies from issuing thousands of new discounted options, executives have continued to benefit as previous awards vest.Grants of discounted stock options are yet another way some top executives have insulated themselves from the market forces affecting their equity pay. When share values fell as the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, many boards repriced their managers' options to ensure that they could still profit. Others just awarded huge amounts of new ones at lower rates.The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting a broad inquiry to see whether options at many companies were backdated around the same time to give executives an extra profit, possibly violating securities rules.Discounted stock options have been around since at least the 1987 stock market crash, when pay consultants promoted their use at companies like Digital Equipment as a way to keep executives motivated as share prices fell.Throughout the 1990's, discounted stock options were hailed as a good management-retention incentive for troubled companies or small start-ups that were short on cash. Until recently, many compensation experts considered them a more attractive alternative than restricted stock.In many ways, they worked like ordinary options on steroids. Instead of granting stock options at the market price, the company set the exercise price — typically 10 to 50 percent below the price its shares traded at the grant date — to create a built-in gain.A company, for example, could grant 100,000 stock options that immediately vested with an exercise price at $7. If the market price was $10, the discount automatically gave the executive a $300,000 paper profit.If the share price rose, the executive would collect even more money. And if the share price plummeted? So long as it did not drop below $7, the executive could still cash the options out.While most ordinary investors rarely paid attention to the stock option exercise price, discounting was known among compensation consultants as a trick of the trade.For some companies, its purpose was to defer compensation. From 1998 to 2002, for example, Dell let Michael S. Dell and several of his top lieutenants choose to receive their pretax cash bonuses in the form of a large discounted option grant. Until last year, OfficeMax directors were eligible to be paid that way for several years, too.Lionel Menchaca, a Dell spokesman, said the company ended the practice in 2002, but the built-in spread from the discount was justified because the executive was placing his cash bonus at risk if the stock went down. William Bonner, an OfficeMax spokesman, did not reply to a request for comment.Other companies tried discounted options as an executive-retention tool. From 1997 to 2003, Swift Transportation, a national trucking company based in Phoenix, granted its executives stock options at a 15 percent discount in exchange for unusually long vesting cycles of 5 to 10 years. But David Berry, a Swift spokesman, said the board ultimately determined that the discounted options ""had not provided the desired retention incentive."" In 2004, the company switched to shorter-vesting conventional ones.Still other companies chose discounted options instead of issuing more regular options or restricted stock. In 2000, Hewlett-Packard granted many of its executives thousands of stock options at a 25 percent discount so long as certain performance hurdles were met. But the program was quietly halted after shareholders complained. Ryan J. Donovan, a Hewlett-Packard spokesman, declined to comment.Of course, most companies avoided discounted option awards. Accounting and tax rules made them less attractive than their conventional cousins, and the built-in profits made the pay-for-performance links of discounted options far more tenuous. Companies worried that shareholders might see discounted options as a sign of lost confidence in the stock. And corporate governance advocates considered it an outrageous extra on top of already outsize pay.Consider Paul S. Pressler, the chief executive of Gap. He was a superstar theme park executive at the Walt Disney Company when the retail chain hired him away in 2002.According to his employment contract, Gap's directors gave him a $1.5 million salary. They guaranteed him at least a $1.88 million bonus for the next 18 months. And they paid him an $885,000 signing bonus.Then the board gave him an unusual grant of five million stock options that vested over 10 years: Mr. Pressler would be able to buy 1.5 million shares at Gap's $11.83 market price at the time of the grant. He would be able to buy another 1.5 million options at a premium price of $14.79 to $20.70 a share.The remaining two million options would be available at half their market value, or $5.92 a share. So long as Gap's stock price remained flat, Mr. Pressler was guaranteed more than $11.8 million, or $2.37 million annually for his first five years at Gap.Last November, Gap eliminated the discounted option program after a 2004 change to the tax code placed Mr. Pressler in the cross hairs of a 20 percent penalty tax.To avoid it, Gap paid Mr. Pressler $2.56 million to cover the built-in spread on his remaining discounted options. Then, in accordance with the new rules, it issued new stock options with a buy price of $11.83, its 2002 market price, when Gap shares were selling for $17.62 in December 2005. That, in effect, gave Mr. Pressler a $5.79-a-share head start.Greg Rossiter, a Gap spokesman, said the discounted option awards were intended to attract and retain top executives and the exchange was made to ensure that the promised pay package stayed the same. ""We think the incentives were long term in nature, as opposed to a front-end sign-on bonus,"" he said.Still, corporate governance advocates said the practice left the door open for abuse. ""It is stealth wealth,"" said Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard Law School professor and the co-author of ""Pay Without Performance.""""The camouflage element is not the amount, as is the case with pensions,"" he explained. ""Rather, it is the camouflaging of performance sensitivity, or the extent to which pay is decoupled from performance.""Not everyone agrees. Supporters argue that discounted options are simply a milder form of restricted stock — essentially an option with a 100 percent discount itself — which has often been criticized as an executive giveaway. And pay specialists say they can work better, too.""The good thing about discounted stock options is that they hurt the executive when the price falls,"" said Kevin J. Murphy, a finance professor at the University of Southern California who studies executive compensation. ""Options provide better incentives when they are in the money rather than out of the money.""Denny's introduced the discounted stock options after it overhauled its executive pay practices based upon the recommendations of Hewitt Associates, a human resources consulting firm hired by the board.According to public filings, a 2004 Hewitt study of 18 restaurant and hospitality companies concluded that while executive salaries and bonuses at Denny's were ""generally in line with the market, long-term incentives and target benefits"" were not.Soon after, Denny's rolled out an equity award program, consisting of both discounted stock options and restricted stock awards, as a fix. Mr. Marchioli, the chief executive, was granted $4.2 million worth of long-term cash and stock incentives so long as he stayed at the company for at least five years.He was also granted a million discounted stock options in mid-November 2004, halfway through the company's fourth quarter, when Denny's shares were trading at $4.22. He would start receiving them over the next three years, provided Denny's met a performance goal of increasing 2004 fourth-quarter sales at restaurants open more than a year.So long as Denny's stock price stayed the same, Mr. Marchioli was guaranteed to make at least $1.8 million over the next three years. If the stock rises above $4.22 by 2014, he could earn substantially more. Of course, if it falls, he would earn less. (It does not appear that Mr. Marchioli has exercised any of the options to date.)Mr. Gilmore, Denny's controller, explained that the pay package was intended to ""attract, motivate and retain leadership."" The company used discounted options to make up for its inability to issue equity when its share price was lower amid a major revamping. This was ""the vehicle that we determined worked the best,"" he said.That may be so. But Hewitt did work not only for the directors on Denny's compensation committee. Denny's executives awarded it consulting contracts worth more than $400,000 over the last few years to help manage the company's main pension plan.'"
"'06-04-29,'0','Stanley Dearman, who was editor of The Neshoba Democrat from 1966 to 2000, said: ""There was a lot of animosity toward her for being so outspoken. She had threats against her life, anonymous midnight phone calls, and people driving by her house throwing bricks and shouting obscenities. But she had a lot of moral courage and conviction and was not shakable.""In his foreword to her book, Turner Catledge, a former executive editor of The New York Times, who grew up in Philadelphia, wrote of her: ""What a witness! She witnessed with her eyes, her ears and her heart. She saw, she heard, she felt and through her own involvement she bore witness to qualities of courage and goodwill that all but evaporated in the climate of passion that flowed from an unreasoning fear of change.""Florence Mars, a diminutive woman barely five feet tall, seemed an unlikely candidate for the defiant role she assumed. She was born on Jan. 1, 1923, to Adam Longino Mars, a lawyer, and Emily Geneva Johnson Mars, known as Neva.She graduated from Philadelphia High School and attended Millsaps College in Jackson, Miss. She graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1944, and then worked as a reservations agent for Delta Air Lines in Atlanta. In the 1950's, she lived in New Orleans, where she photographed jazz musicians. In 1962, she returned to Philadelphia, raising cattle and owning and running the Neshoba County Stockyards.She also stepped into the forefront of the battle for civil rights in her town. She allied herself with the Council of Federated Organizations, a consortium of groups like S.N.C.C., CORE and the N.A.A.C.P.One of her more frightening encounters with the Klan occurred late one night in July 1965 when she was driving home from a party at the Neshoba County fair and was picked up by the sheriff, Lawrence A. Rainey, on trumped-up charges of drunken driving. He dragged her out of her car and jailed her. A member of the Klan, Mr. Rainey was later tried on charges of violating the civil rights of the three young civil rights workers killed outside Philadelphia, and was acquitted.In June 2005, Miss Mars was in the courtroom in Philadelphia when Edgar Ray Killen, by then 80, mastermind of the ambush of the civil rights workers, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison. (The verdict is being appealed.)Miss Mars was vindicated not only by her friends but also by her foes. At her funeral service on Thursday, Mr. Dearman said, ""People said, 'Florence was right.' People who don't remember how they acted.""'"
"'06-04-29,'0','This year, after the evacuation of the city and the dispersal of its population, New Orleans's music seems more precious than ever. Although the most heavily visited sections of the city were largely spared, the music's historic breeding grounds -- and the community that nurtures musicians and knows all the right responses -- were greatly diminished.Many local styles are maintaining a presence here through sheer persistence. Brass bands that used to simply cross the city for a weekly gig at a local bar have to drive in from places like Texas and Georgia. But they do.This year's Jazzfest looks familiar to anyone who has attended before. It is in its usual home, the New Orleans Fairgrounds, which is dotted with stages and criss-crossed by stands of crafts and food vendors. The gospel tent is there, full of unknowns with magnificent voices; the pheasant, quail and andouille gumbo is available by the cup. But like New Orleans itself, it had to be remade virtually from scratch.The actual fairgrounds were extensively damaged. Three weeks ago electricity was still being installed. Some of the carpenters who had built stages and stalls in past years were living on the festival grounds during the construction.Jazzfest, usually planned well in advance, had no guarantee it would take place until early this year, when the Shell Group which has its headquarters in New Orleans, provided overall sponsorship. The festival is not only a cultural event but also a profit center for the city. In past years, the festival -- which takes place on two successive weekends, through May 7 this year -- has generated an estimated $250 million in tourism revenue for the city; 400,000 people bought tickets last year. This year there have been more than 100,000 advance ticket sales so far; in the past much of the festival's business has been sales at the door, depending on the weather.Getting the stars was one of the easier parts, said Quint Davis, the festival's producer and director. Headliners like Paul Simon, Dave Matthews, Herbie Hancock and the country singer Keith Urban were eager to do something for New Orleans. But this year's festival also raised the quotient of local musicians to 92 percent. The festival books about 4,000 musicians; half of them are gospel singers in large choirs. This year, however, many of the formerly local musicians needed hotel rooms; they too were visiting the city for the festival.The festival includes its own versions of the street parades that are integral to New Orleans culture, with brass bands and the suited, strutting neighborhood associations called social aid and pleasure clubs. ""The festival can be a good catalyst and incubator for that,"" Mr. Davis said. ""But the culture is not really back until it's back in the streets.""Still, there were signs of New Orleans persistence. Creole Wild West, a tribe of Mardi Gras Indians -- African-Americans who parade in handmade feathered costumes on Mardi Gras Day -- were onstage in gaudy splendor, including a child in a full suit. When Andrew Hall's Society Brass Band played one of its second-line struts, parasols sprouted in the audience and the aisles filled with dancers.No one at the festival, even those playing the happiest good-time music, pretended that the hurricane hadn't happened. Anders Osborne sounded at first as if he was singing a breakup song when he played a rolling rhythm-and-blues shuffle during his set this afternoon. ""Talk about wrecking a perfectly happy home,"" he sang. ""You took me and shook me, then you left me all alone in the dark."" And then came the chorus: ""Oh, Katrina. ""'"

"'06-04-29,'0','Changes in the way oil is traded have contributed their part as well. On Nymex, oil contracts held mostly by hedge funds -- essentially private investment vehicles for the wealthy and institutions, run by traders who share the risks and rewards with their partners -- rose above one billion barrels this month, twice the amount held five years ago.Beyond that, trading has also increased outside official exchanges, including swaps or over-the-counter trades conducted directly between, say, a bank and an airline. And that comes on top of the normal trading long conducted by oil companies, commercial oil brokers or funds held by investment banks.""Five years ago, our futures exchange was a small group of physical oil players,"" said Jeffrey Sprecher, the chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange, the Atlanta-based electronic exchange where about half of all oil futures are traded. ""Now there are all sorts of new investors in trading commodity futures, much of which is backed by pension fund money.""Such trading is a 24-hour business. And more sophisticated electronic technology allows more money to pour into oil, quicker than ever before, from anywhere in the world.In the Canary Wharf business district of London, for example, the trading room of Barclays Capital is filled with mostly young men in identical button-down blue shirts, staring intently at banks of computer screens where the prices of petroleum products -- crude oil, gasoline, fuel oil, napthene and more -- flicker by.Occasionally a trader breaks from his trance to bark instructions to a floor broker a couple of miles away, delivering the message through a black speaker box. Above them is a television screen, where President Bush this week was telling America to ""get off oil.""Experienced oil traders are in heavy demand, and average salary and bonus packages are close to $1 million a year, with top traders earning as much as $10 million.The rush of new investors into commodities has meant a rash of new clients for banks like Barclays.Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse have recently beefed up their oil trading teams to compete with market leaders like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.""Clearly the big attraction of commodity markets like oil is that they've been going up,"" said Marc Stern, the chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, a New York wealth manager with $45 billion in assets. ""Rising prices create interest.""This year alone, oil prices have gained 18 percent; they were up 45 percent in 2005 and 28 percent in 2004, a performance far superior to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, whose gains in these years have been in the single digits. And to some extent, the rising price of oil feeds on itself, by encouraging many investors to bet that it is likely to continue doing so.""The hedge funds have come roaring into the commodities market, and they are willing to take risks,"" said Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, an investment firm in New York.Energy funds make up 5 percent of the global hedge fund business, with about $60 billion in assets, according to Peter C. Fusaro, principal at the Energy Hedge Fund Center, an online research community.The gains on the oil market have attracted a fresh class of investors: pension funds and mutual funds seeking to diversify their holdings. Their investments have been mostly channeled through a handful of commodity indexes, which have ballooned to $85 billion in a few years, according to Goldman Sachs. Goldman's own index holds more than $55 billion, triple what it was in 2002.Pension funds have been particularly active in the last year, said Frédéric Lasserre, the head of commodity research at Société Générale in Paris. These investors, seeking to diversify their portfolio, have added to the buying pressure on limited commodity markets.While all this new money has contributed to higher prices, by some estimates perhaps as much as 10 percent to 20 percent, the frantic trading ensures that even the biggest players -- including the major oil companies -- cannot significantly distort the market or tilt it artificially in their favor. It also makes oil markets more liquid, meaning a buyer can always find a seller.""The oil market has been driven by speculators, by hedge funds, by pension funds and by commodity indexes, but the fact of the matter is that it's mostly been driven by the fundamentals,"" said Craig Pennington, the director of the global energy group at Schroders in London. ""Prices are supported by the fact that there is no spare capacity.""The inability to increase output fast enough to keep up with global demand accounts for most of the oil price rise over the last three years, analysts say. And until more investments are completed in oil production and refining, markets will remain on edge, with the slightest bit of bad news likely to push prices up further.""The reality is that the world has no supply cushion left,"" said Edward L. Morse, an executive adviser at the Hess Energy Trading Company, a New York oil trading firm.Political strife and circumstance played major parts as well. A crippling strike in Venezuela's oil industry in 2002, the invasion of Iraq, civil unrest in Nigeria, and last summer's hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, among other things, have all contributed to pinching supplies.""If we didn't have politics,"" said William Wallace, a trader on the Nymex for Man Financial, ""we'd be like corn.""According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy consulting firm owned by IHS, Iraq is 900,000 barrels a day below its prewar output; Nigeria has shut 530,000 barrels a day; Venezuela is still 400,000 barrels below its prestrike production; and the Gulf of Mexico remains down by 330,000 barrels a day. In all, this amounts to more than two million barrels of disrupted oil, Cambridge Energy estimates.The latest reason for gains on energy markets is the growing fear that the diplomatic standoff between the Western powers and Iran over nuclear technology will get out of hand.""All the risk,"" said Eric Bolling, an independent trader on Nymex, ""has been on the upside.""One characteristic of today's futures market is the sharp increase in volatility, which industry insiders largely attribute to hedge funds and other speculators looking for a quick profit.""It is the case,"" complained BP's chief executive, Lord Browne, ""that the price of oil has gone up while nothing has changed physically.""In the end, supply and demand call the tune.""The idea that speculators can systematically push the price up or down is wrong,"" said Robert J. Weiner, a professor of international business at George Washington University and a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan think tank. ""But they can make it more volatile. They can't raise water levels but they can create waves.""Not all bets have turned out to be profitable. Veteran commodity market traders have been stymied by the high prices of oil, which have exceeded their expectations, and many now predict a steep decline in prices is ahead. But they have been wrong so far.""We found the last 18 months difficult,"" said Russell Newton, director of Global Advisors, a New York and London hedge fund with $400 million in assets under management that had a down year in 2005.In one often cited example, the Citadel Investment Group, a Chicago-based hedge fund, lost tens of millions of dollars after betting oil prices would fall just before Hurricane Katrina struck.""Everybody is jumping into commodities, and there is a log of cash chasing oil,"" said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a consultant and a former senior adviser on energy policy at the Treasury Department.""The question is when does the thing stop. Eventually they will get burned.""'"
"'06-04-29,'0','Beneficiaries face a May 15 deadline to sign up for drug coverage. People who miss the deadline will generally not have another opportunity until November and may then face higher premiums as a penalty for late enrollment.John K. Gorman, a former Medicare official who is now a health care consultant, said:""UnitedHealth, through its alliance with AARP, and WellPoint are winning on brand recognition. Humana and another company, MemberHealth, are winning on price. The AARP brand is a license to print money. When seniors are confused and scared about making the wrong choice, brand recognition and trust go a long, long way.""When Congress created the drug benefit in 2003, lawmakers had no idea how many insurers would enter the market. By March 2005, it was clear that many companies saw an opportunity, with the aging of the population. In addition, they said, federal subsidies minimized the financial risks for insurers in the first few years of the program.About 13.9 million of the 42 million Medicare beneficiaries are now in prescription drug plans. UnitedHealth has 3.8 million subscribers, or 27 percent of the total. Humana has 2.4 million, or 18 percent, and WellPoint has 1 million, or 7 percent.Companies with the next largest shares are MemberHealth, with 924,100 subscribers (7 percent); WellCare Health Plans, with 849,700 (6 percent); and Coventry Health Care, with 596,100 (4 percent).UnitedHealth has the largest enrollment in 29 states, including California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.Humana has the largest enrollment in 13 states, including Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota.Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans have the largest enrollment in Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey and Oklahoma.Most of the companies that sell stand-alone drug coverage also offer managed-care plans, known as Medicare Advantage plans, which provide comprehensive health coverage, including drug benefits. Insurers say that the Medicare Advantage business is more profitable and that they hope people who sign up for drug plans will move into managed care.About 5.9 million people are in Medicare Advantage plans with drug coverage, the Bush administration reported on Friday. UnitedHealth had the most beneficiaries, 1.2 million, 20 percent of the total.The UnitedHealth numbers include people who signed up for products offered by PacifiCare, which merged with United in December.Other big participants in this segment of the market include Kaiser Permanente, with 821,500 subscribers, accounting for 14 percent of all enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans; Humana, with 792,500 subscribers (13 percent); Highmark, with 226,400 (4 percent); Health Net, with 167,400 (3 percent); and WellPoint, with 133,800 (2 percent).Medicare officials said they expected to see some consolidation of the market for drug coverage next year, as insurers drop out of the business or gobble up competitors.Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has said he expected to see fewer drug plans in the market next year.Comparatively small numbers signed up for the stand-alone drug plans offered by two large insurance companies. Aetna got 286,900 subscribers, or 2 percent, while Cigna got 170,900, or 1 percent.'"

One of the Rottweilers attacked the boy relentlessly, biting his head, scratching his face, and biting his torso and buttocks, the police said.The boy was taken to the Nassau University Medical Center, and last night his condition was listed as serious, said Officer Joan Eames, a Nassau police spokeswoman. She said that the dogs had escaped from their owner. The dogs were found and later confiscated by a local animal control unit.It was unclear last night whether the owner would face any charges.What prompted the attack, if anything, was also unclear. But the police said that the dogs zeroed in on the boy, leaving his grandmother and baby sister alone.At one point, as the dogs were biting the boy, his grandfather scooped him up and tried to run inside his home, but the dogs chased after them and knocked the pair to the ground.Moments later, the man got inside his home with his grandson, but the dogs continued chasing them and barged inside. The police said that the grandfather suffered chest pains during the attack and was also taken to the hospital.'"

In large cities, for example, gasoline cost more than $3 a gallon, and there were reasons to worry that prices could stay high. Gasoline demand continued to rise, although at a slower pace than expected. And inventories of both gasoline and crude oil fell 5.6 percent last week.High prices are inflating oil company profits, leading federal officials to reconsider $2 billion in tax breaks that Congress approved in August. And prominent Democrats pushed for repealing oil and gas tax breaks worth more than $10 billion over the next five years.The Federal Trade Commission is completing an investigation into whether businesses used Hurricane Katrina to manipulate gasoline supply and prices last fall. It is scheduled to deliver its report to Congress by May 19.PAPER TRANSACTION -- The McClatchy Company, which bought the 32-newspaper Knight Ridder chain last month, turned around and sold 4 of the papers to the MediaNews Group for $1 billion. McClatchy will use the cash to pay down the $4.5 billion cost of acquiring Knight Ridder.MediaNews bought two of the newspapers, The San Jose Mercury News and The Contra Costa Times, directly. It acquired the other two, The Pioneer Press in St. Paul and The Herald in Monterey County in California, in cooperation with the Hearst Corporation. In exchange, Hearst will acquire an interest in the 40 papers that MediaNews owns outside of the Bay Area.McClatchy is still negotiating to sell eight other former Knight Ridder papers, analysts say.

The pleas came just weeks before the men -- Sanjay Kumar, the former chief executive, and Stephen Richards, its former top salesman -- were to go on trial.Mr. Kumar and Mr. Richards admitted to a wide-ranging conspiracy to inflate the company's sales in 1999 and 2000 and to interfere with a federal inquiry into the fraud by lying to their lawyers and to federal investigators. Mr. Kumar even authorized paying $3.7 million to buy the silence of a potential witness, according to the indictment.Judge I. Leo Glasser is scheduled to sentence the men on Sept. 12. Obstruction of justice carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, while each fraud charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years.A PIONEER RESIGNS -- After helping to start Sun Microsystems and then running it for 22 years, Scott G. McNealy stepped down as chief executive of the company, a Silicon Valley fixture that has recently fallen on hard times.Mr. McNealy chose Jonathan Schwartz, 40, the company's president and a former software entrepreneur as his successor. Mr. Schwartz joined Sun in 1996. Mr. McNealy's record of recognizing talent is well known. Among the leaders who worked under him are Edward J. Zander, now the chief executive at Motorola; Carol Bartz, chairwoman of Autodesk, the engineering software firm; and Eric E. Schmidt, chief executive of Google.In an effort to reverse sliding sales of its workstations and servers, Sun is using microprocessors made by Advanced Micro Devices in addition to its custom Sparc processors. It is also selling hardware that can run either Linux or Windows software easily.COURTROOM DRAMA -- Enron's founder and former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, lost his cool on the witness stand in his criminal fraud trial in Houston. Under cross-examination by a prosecutor, John C. Hueston, Mr. Lay accused a cabal of former Enron executives, investors and journalists of precipitating the company's collapse in late 2001.Mr. Lay acknowledged that he had violated Enron's code of ethics by investing in Photofête, a company run by a woman who was then the girlfriend of his co-defendant, Jeffrey K. Skilling. He also acknowledged that he had tried to meet with some of the witnesses against him, an effort Mr. Hueston characterized as attempted witness tampering.The cross-examination of Mr. Lay will continue on Monday.MOST POPULAR -- Following are the most-viewed business news articles on nytimes.com from April 22 through April 28:1.

"'06-04-30,'0','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, April 29 (Reuters) — Pakistan test-fired a nuclear-capable missile on Saturday, an act that seemed part of its effort to maintain the balance of power with India, its nuclear-armed rival.Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz watched as the surface-to-surface Hatf VI (Shaheen II) missile, which has a range of 1,250 miles, was fired at an undisclosed location.""Pakistan's strategy of credible minimum deterrence is fully in place and is a guarantee of peace in the region,"" he said. ""We will continue to pursue vigorously our security and energy needs from all sources, including nuclear.""Pakistan and neighboring India tested nuclear weapons in 1998, provoking economic penalties from the United States and other countries that have been lifted over the years.The two countries started a peace dialogue two years ago to try to ease almost six decades of tensions that have produced three wars. But Pakistan is concerned about the recent agreement by the United States to provide assistance to India's civilian nuclear program, fearing that it could also help India build its military capability.'"
"'06-04-30,'0','When Amanda Early, a junior at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., accepted a four-day-a-week summer job in public relations near the campus, she did not realize it would amount to a sentence of spending an entire summer in New Jersey. Ms. Early had planned to drive home to Connecticut every weekend, but she said gas prices would force her to remain in New Jersey in the house she shares with four other girls.""This is a college town,"" Ms. Early said, ""and it is nowhere near as much fun in the summer.""A sophomore at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who declined to give his name because he did not want to risk angering a prospective employer, said he might turn down a summer job delivering prescriptions for a pharmacy in a Boston suburb. The $10 hourly wage was acceptable, he said, but not the requirement that he drive his own car and pay for gas.John C. Felmy, the chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, the main trade association for the oil business, sounds frustrated.As an undergraduate at Pennsylvania State University, he said, he drove to Boston with his debate team during the Arab oil embargo. More than 30 years later, he can recite the topic for 1973-74 without hesitation: ""Resolved, the federal government should control the supply and utilization of energy in the United States.""On the drive back, Mr. Felmy recalled, his group was almost stranded in Connecticut because no gas was available, a result, he said, of government misallocation. Government, Mr. Felmy said, can make energy problems worse.""I thought we'd learned from bad energy policy by now,"" he said, although there are days when he is not so sure. Those are the days when his computer flashes with hate e-mail from people who blame the American oil industry for the rise in oil prices.""People just simply don't know the facts,"" he said, ""but they accuse you of everything you can imagine.""Mr. Felmy's organization has been arguing to anyone who will listen that over the long haul, oil company profits are almost identical to the average for manufacturers in the United States, and that since 1982, the price of petroleum products is up less than the price of pulp and paper or lumber, and only about one-third as much as drugs and pharmaceuticals. But it has been tough going, with the public and with legislators, he said.""The politicians are reading all the polls, they know how concerned consumers are, and they are trying to figure out what to do about it,"" he said. ""Some are lashing out, attacking the industry, using information that is simply inaccurate.""Mr. Felmy said he was proud of what he did for a living, and he called institute members ""honorable companies.""""They're doing what they should do, what is legally required for their shareholders, unlike other companies you've heard about in the news,"" he said. ""They are managing their business properly, keeping fuels flowing to consumers, even though we're operating in places where sometimes people are shooting at us.""His industry, Mr. Felmy said, is ""1.4 million Americans working to keep your gas tank full 24 hours a day.""Few drivers feel the pain of soaring gas prices as acutely as the New York City cabbie stuck behind the wheel of a Crown Victoria sedan with a thirsty, overworked eight-cylinder engine.At the entrance to the Checker Management taxi depot in the Long Island City section of Queens is a trio of old, battered pumps where returning cabbies refill their bottomless tanks after their 12-hour shifts.The old pumps offer only regular unleaded, and for the very modern price of $3.15 and nine-tenths of a cent per gallon. It is still lower than prices in Manhattan, where most of these cabbies go through a full tank of gas lurching and screeching around traffic-clogged streets for 12 hours.Back at the depot, they replenish their tanks, shaking their heads in disgust as the pumps' rusty digit counters spin.""We drive 12 hours a day, so we feel it more than anyone,"" said one driver, Peter Lee, 54, who began driving cabs in New York in 1972. He pointed to the depot's fleet of Fords, mostly Crown Victoria sedans.""These things get about 10 miles per gallon in the city, 8 miles if the customer wants the air-conditioner on,"" he said, adding that gas mileage was made worse by the choppy gas-brake-gas-brake driving style required in New York City. ""New York people are always late and telling you to drive fast, so you have to keep gunning the engine and then braking, which uses more gas.""The drivers at the depot, just across the East River from Midtown, are almost all immigrants, and all kinds of languages, dialects and accents can be heard in the tight locker room. They wolf down home-cooked meals — whether couscous, curry or rice and beans — before their shifts. With the Manhattan skyline looming to the west, they gather in the parking lot and grouse about gas prices.Drivers often log 150 miles a shift and spend almost $50 in gas, Mr. Lee said, about $20 more per day than a year ago. He recommended that the city order a 50-cent surcharge for each fare to compensate cabbies for price increases.Most drivers at the depot rent their cabs for 12 hours at a time, usually paying more than $100. They pay up front in cash and get a key to a cab with a full tank of gas; they must refill it when they return the cab.""Compared to a year ago, I pay $15 more a day in gas,"" said Miguel Gonzalez, 67, of Queens. ""I only take home $100 a day, so that's my lunch and dinner right there.""""That's $100 a week,"" he said. ""That's your grocery bill.""These are happy days for an ethanol man.The price of grain-alcohol fuel is up sharply as demand has surged, and Colorado's newest ethanol plant is almost ready to open after four years of preparation and sweat by Dan R. Sanders and his family.""It's great for us,"" said Mr. Sanders, 28, as he watched one of the first loads of corn — ethanol's main ingredient — arrive on Friday morning from a farm in northeastern Colorado.When Mr. Sanders's company, Front Range Energy, begins shipping next month from this $60 million factory in Windsor, Colo., an hour north of Denver, it will just about double Colorado's ethanol production, adding 40 million gallons a year to the pipeline. And at least two other plants around the state are in planning.Ethanol, which is essentially identical to the old corn liquor of moonshine fame, is increasingly blended with gas to reduce emissions and replace other additives like MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, which is a suspected carcinogen.But more and more vehicles are also able to burn commercially available ethanol fuels like E85 — 85 percent grain alcohol — and kits can also be bought that allow cars to burn an even higher percentage of ethanol. All this has further increased the demand, and the price. In most parts of the country, E85 sells for 30 cents to 60 cents a gallon less than regular unleaded gasoline, but most cars get fewer miles to the gallon burning ethanol.Ethanol has its critics. Some economists say that farm subsidies blur the fuel's real cost, making it a less than perfect long-term alternative in thinking about the world after oil.But here in Colorado, people like Mr. Sanders say the economics make more sense than ever. Until recently, ethanol could only make money if distilled close to its fuel source, he said. That is why corn-country Iowa dominates the nation's production.Increasing demand is shattering that boundary, making factories feasible closer to where the product gets sold. About half of Front Range's output, Mr. Sanders said, will go no further than Denver.The Sanderses have also lined up local buyers for the waste. The left-over corn mash will be sold as cattle feed, while the carbon dioxide produced by fermentation will be made into dry ice and sold in the Denver market.But operations like this are still small potatoes by the scale of big oil. On a day when the Chevron Corporation was announcing $4 billion in profits, Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jana, and their 2-year-old daughter, Ellie, were watching the corn arrive. And Ellie was not even very interested.Jeremy Cole looks at the black numbers on the blue Marathon Gas sign in Kirtland, Ohio — $2.87 for a gallon of regular — and thinks of his broken vow.For two years, Mr. Cole, 19, had given his girlfriend a gift on the 25th of each month, to commemorate the day they met — Jan. 25, 2002 — at Willow Hill Baptist Church in Willoughby, Ohio.But for the past three months he has missed the date as gas prices have risen.This month, Mr. Cole bought her a rose and a pink wind chime, because she loves to hang pink things from the ceiling of her bedroom.The fuel warning light in his 1993 Honda Accord was glowing. It was a 25-mile drive to her house in Chardon, and Mr. Cole, who studies computers at Lakeland Community College and earns $8.18 an hour working in a factory that heat-treats metal, did not have money for gas. So he stayed home.""I won't be able to see her till I get paid,"" he said. ""Ever since gas prices went up, it's like I'm barely able to see her.""Until this year, Mr. Cole said, he always filled his tank. On one recent day, though, he bought only five gallons for $14.35, barely enough to drive to school, work and straight back home.A guitar lies across his back seat, and his trunk is filled with amplifiers. Mr. Cole plays in a band called In All His Ruin. Before gas prices jumped, band members drove separately to practice at the drummer's house in Chesterland, 15 miles away. Now they all meet at Mr. Cole's house and carpool, squeezing themselves and their equipment into a different member's car every week.On the way home, Mr. Cole used to stop at Wendy's and order the No. 6 combo meal: spicy chicken sandwich, medium Dr. Pepper, medium fries. Now he orders junior hamburgers from the dollar menu.""It's not a gourmet meal anymore,"" he says. ""French fries are an extravagance now. It makes me angry that I have to change my whole life because of gas prices.""Cheap gas prices are in the eye of the beholder.At the Flying J Travel Plaza in Casper, Wyo., a gallon of regular unleaded gas sold this week for $2.39, about as low as anywhere in the country and more than $1 less than some places in California and Hawaii.But gratitude at the pumps? Forget it.""Gas prices don't seem low to me,"" said Dick Gilbert, a tow truck operator, who was out $170 filling his vehicle's two tanks. ""And they just keep going higher.""Mr. Gilbert was preparing to burn most of the gas on a 250-mile round trip to retrieve a broken-down truck. He will charge his customer $2.50 a mile, but even so, he said rising gas prices were eating into his profits.In an adjoining gas lane, Cindy Wright spoke of the pain high gas prices cause the single mothers who make up many of the clients at the public health clinic in Torrington, where she is a nurse.""They can't afford to drive,"" she said. In another sign of the times, Ms. Wright said, a relative who owns an auto repair shop arrived at work one morning recently to find that thieves had siphoned gas from vehicles left there overnight.Pity the people who sell gas in San Francisco or lease franchise stations from the oil companies. No, really. As if working around fumes and grime were not enough, now customers are rude — even hostile — about the sudden escalation in gas prices, which in San Francisco are among the highest in the country.""Someone today threw the money down, and said, 'This is ridiculous,' "" said Stella Liu, 51, who leases a 76 gas station from Conoco and runs an adjacent automotive repair business. Other customers scream at her cashier before jumping into their cars and tearing away from the station.Ms. Liu, though, is sympathetic. She too has to buy gas to fuel her 50-minute commute (one way) from the suburbs. ""If I were making the money, I wouldn't be here,"" she said, ""We are all in the same boat.""Prices may fluctuate, Ms. Liu said, but even when gas is $3.36 for a gallon of regular, as it was on Friday at her station in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, her profit is unchanged because she is paying more to her supplier.""It's the same for me as it is for the customer, maybe worse,"" she said. Business is down because people are buying less gas — choosing a quarter or a half a tank — and then paying by credit card. ""We have to pay insurance and workers compensation, the rent,"" she said. ""We are making the same money we did years ago. Only now, it barely covers the cost of our overhead.""Many customers understand the dealers are not at fault, but others simply rage at the nearest target.""I tell people, I'm just the dealer. I have no control over the price. I don't even know why the price is going up.""Trying to Share the PainIn a region where buses advertise that ""Gas isn't expensive if you don't buy any,"" Matt Mulholland of Lynwood, Wash., assumed it would be easy to arrange a carpool for his daily commute, especially as gas approached — and passed — $3 a gallon.""Let's save time and gas!! yes yes YES please,"" Mr. Mulholland wrote on the Craigslist Web site.A month later, Mr. Mulholland, 32, still drives alone. No one responded to repeated pleas to share the 40-mile round trip from his home north of Seattle to Bellevue, a city east of Lake Washington. He is disappointed, not least because, with a passenger, he could zip into Interstate 405's high-occupancy vehicle lanes and prune his hourlong commute.""I look at cars around me and they always have one person,"" said Mr. Mulholland, who works as an estimator for an auto body company. ""I thought I'd probably have more chance of getting somebody interested now, when they're talking about prices peaking at $4 by the end of the summer.""But so far, the shock of $3 gas has not persuaded many commuters to change their behavior.There has been no increase in registration for the Rideshare program, which arranges carpools and vanpools for the county that includes Seattle and Bellevue, said Cathy Blumenthal, the program's coordinator for King County Metro Transit.By contrast, 5,000 people — a 62 percent increase over the previous year — signed up to share rides last fall after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita drove local gas prices toward $3.While Mrs. Blumenthal wonders if people are waiting — either for prices to surge or recede — before they alter their driving habits, Mr. Mulholland is more pessimistic.Complaints about gas prices are ""hype, a hot button,"" he said. ""People talk without doing anything.""This article was written and reported by Kirk Johnson in Windsor, Colo.; Corey Kilgannon in New York; Jessica Kowal in Lynwood, Wash.; Christopher Maag in Kirtland, Ohio; Carolyn Marshall in San Francisco; Doug McInnis in Casper, Wyo.; Matthew L.

"'06-04-30,'0','When President Bush proposed several steps last week meant to curb the rise in energy prices, his decision to suspend purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve got the most attention. But he also said he would ask the Environmental Protection Agency to use its ""available authority to grant waivers that would relieve critical fuel supply shortages.""What would that mean?John Millett, an E.P.A. spokesman, said the president was referring to an existing program under which states can apply to the agency to suspend temporarily regulations requiring the sale of cleaner-burning gasoline under ""extreme and unusual fuel supply circumstances.""Under the Clean Air Act, urban areas with the worst smog must sell only cleaner-burning fuel, at least during certain times of the year. Currently, the most affected areas are in California and along the East Coast between Washington and Boston.The fuel, generally known as reformulated gasoline, has additives that allow for more complete combustion, leading to less ozone and other pollution. But those additives make gasoline more complicated to produce, and more costly.Allowing the sale of a dirtier-burning blend, in place of a cleaner-burning one, might alleviate a supply bottleneck that is contributing to high prices. Such a substitution would give the industry time to make cleaner fuel, Mr. Millett said.'"
"'06-04-30,'0','More and more leaders of nonprofit groups are dismissing donor fatigue as a myth. They note that the $5 billion that was donated last year to relief efforts for Katrina and the tsunami in Indonesia amounted to less than 2 percent of the total donated to charity in 2004.""I'm not aware of any data that support the concept,"" Michael Clark, president of the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, said, alluding to fears that charitable donations had fallen off.""I just don't know what the evidence for it is,"" said Mr. Clark, whose group represents more than 1,400 charities in the New York metropolitan area.Diana Aviv, president and chief executive of the Independent Sector, a trade organization representing some 550 nonprofit organizations, went even further.""I think some of the nonprofits worrying about donor fatigue are simply crying wolf,"" Ms. Aviv said. ""Often in the charitable sector, good news is hard for us to live with. It's easier for us to feel we're fighting many demons, including a funding demon.""In a recent survey by the Conference Board, a research company in New York, 89.4 percent of the 5,000 respondents said their donations for hurricane relief were in addition to, rather than in lieu of, the other charitable gifts they planned to make.The tax break for charitable giving allows donors who made cash gifts from Aug. 28 through Dec. 31 to deduct an amount equal to virtually 100 percent of their annual adjusted gross income, twice the normal limit.Mr. and Mrs. Cheney, for example, showed an adjusted gross income of $8.82 million on their 2005 income tax report, but most of the money was not taxable because they set aside $6.87 million in proceeds from stock options for charity. As a result, the Cheneys' taxable income was $1.96 million. The couple paid $2.5 million in taxes through withholding and estimated tax payments and are due a refund of about $1.9 million.Legislators said they passed the tax break out of concern that the flood of contributions pouring into relief organizations was diverting money from charities that were not involved in the hurricane and tsunami recovery efforts, and they cited what happened to charities after Sept. 11.A number of respondents reported a decline in fund-raising in 2002, according to the Association of Fundraising Professionals' survey for that year. But 60 percent said fund-raising had remained consistent or had improved from 2001. There has been a debate ever since over whether the charities that experienced declines did so because of donor fatigue or the economic downturn that followed the terrorist attacks.""There might have been a little fatigue right after Katrina, like what we saw after 9/11, but in short order after both those events, giving got right back on track,"" Ms. Maehara, the association executive, said.Fund-raising experts said it was unlikely that the tax break accounted for the success reported in the association's survey because many charities did not know about it in time to capitalize on it.""That was a sideshow,"" said Robert F. Sharpe Jr., a fund-raising consultant.Mr. Sharpe said higher interest rates and stock market gains, which affect the older people who are the biggest donors, were the biggest factors.Delane Butler, the vice president of marketing at the United Way of the Plains in Wichita, Kan., said his organization probably benefited from coverage of the philanthropy directed at Hurricane Katrina.""We were seeing that it was actually raising more awareness for the needs that are out there,"" Mr. Butler said. He added that fund-raising was up by an average of 12 percent at 296 -- or about a third -- of the companies where the United Way ran workplace campaigns.The group still saw a decline in fund-raising, but Mr. Butler said the falloff had more to do with changes in ownership and management of several large companies whose employees contribute to the organization. The Boeing Corporation, for instance, spun off part of the operations of a plant that was one of the area's biggest employers.The organization raised $14.1 million last year, a 9.8 percent drop from 2004. ""I think if it had anything to do with donor fatigue, the decreases we saw would cut across all companies and not be limited to certain groups of companies,"" Mr. Butler said.Similarly, the Union Gospel Mission in Seattle saw a $300,000 budget shortfall looming in September after Hurricane Katrina hit. But the organization saw a turnaround after it mailed a special appeal to its regular donors, raising about $14 million and exceeding its goal, according to Herb Pfiffner, its executive director.""Donor fatigue, as the press is calling it, may be a factor, but it's only one of many and not a particularly big one, I think,"" Mr. Pfiffner said. ""A bigger factor is that everyone is trying to do more in the way of fund-raising. There is a real and significant increase in appeals and competition for discretionary funds.""Correction: May 3, 2006, Wednesday An article on Sunday about a study by the Association of Fundraising Professionals showing that hurricane relief efforts had not cut into other charitable giving misattributed a more comprehensive study, Giving USA, which is to come out in June. It is published by the Giving USA Foundation, not the Association of Fundraising Professionals.'"

"'06-04-30,'0','At the opposite end of the table, a young woman executive, whom Mr. Cowell had identified in his head as the ""lippy second-in-command,"" seemed to be calculating whether or not this truly was the end of the presentation.""And what exactly do you think we're supposed to be doing for you?"" the woman said, dismissively.""Well, actually, sweetheart,"" Mr. Cowell replied, applying just a dash of acid, ""it's more a question of what I could be doing for you.""Again a terrible silence fell. Then the woman piped up: ""Well, we'll get back to you.""Mr. Cowell said he had heard that line before -- too many times for it to bother him during his sojourn in the United States trying to spark some American interest in this hot idea. He and Mr. Fuller and a third partner, yet another Simon -- Simon Jones, an executive with Thames Television -- had paid calls to the broadcast networks, to MTV and to other cable networks. Every one of them had a free shot that April at landing the show that the three Simons were putting on offer. No one showed the least interest, and many of the network executives offered shoulders so cold that Mr. Cowell could have chilled his wine on them. Uniformly, they had been, Mr. Cowell was convinced, the worst, most appalling meetings of his life.The contrast with how ""Pop Idol"" had been sold in Britain could not have been sharper. Mr. Cowell and Mr. Fuller met with representatives of the British network ITV, spent what Mr. Cowell estimated was no more than 30 seconds describing the idea, and they had a deal. But, of course, the two Simons had enormous reputations in the British entertainment world, and they were entering a market that had already embraced music-oriented reality shows.In Britain, ""Pop Stars,"" a show that was originally developed in Australia and traced the formation of a singing group, had engrossed the nation. Another music show, ""Fame Academy,"" had also done extremely well.Mr. Cowell had been invited to be a judge on the first edition of ""Pop Stars,"" and, at first, had accepted. But he quickly had misgivings about being a person who ran a music label going on television to demonstrate how to put together a group. Mr. Cowell thought it was ""like a magician showing how you saw somebody in half."" He bowed out.When Mr. Cowell got a first glimpse of ""Pop Stars,"" however, he knew he had made a mistake. The show looked like a piping hot hit to him -- though he had an instant insight. To him, the attractive part of ""Pop Stars"" was the round of auditions to select the band members. He thought that, as constituted, ""Pop Stars"" had no ending. With Mr. Fuller he conceived a show built around seasonlong tryouts with the winner announced at the end.What Mr. Cowell told ITV was this: ""It will have all the fun of 'Pop Stars,' but we can do it better. We can do it a lot harsher than on 'Pop Stars,' and the public will vote and choose the winner. And we won't be relying on the music to make the show successful: it will be a soap opera.""Mr. Cowell also volunteered himself as a judge, knowing that he had the precise expertise called for in selecting a singing star. Mr. Fuller and his company, 19 Entertainment, owned the show along with Fremantle Media, a big European production company. Mr. Cowell took no ownership stake, but he did get royalty rights for his label, Syco Records, a part of the BMG Music Group, on every recording released by an ""Idol"" performer worldwide. That was the essence of the show's appeal for Mr. Cowell.All he was concerned with was that the right person would win, so that he would get access to a good artist. If the show was a hit, so much the better; Mr. Cowell's new artist was more likely to sell a lot of records that way.When Mr. Cowell started shooting ""Pop Idol"" in England in the summer of 2001, the production plan called for four judges to sit in an audition room while contestants trooped in, one by one. The judges would discuss each singer after he or she left the room. Nothing more specific was spelled out.The first auditions took place in Manchester. But by the time five or six singers had walked through, sung and then had their performances rehashed by the judges after they had left the room, Mr. Cowell was almost crawling up the walls.""I'm dying in here,"" he told the producers. ""This is not like a real-life audition."" He turned to one of the other judges, the veteran British pop producer Pete Waterman, and said: ""We have to actually tell the performers to their faces what we thought. We've just got to tell these boys and girls the truth. They're rubbish.""Mr. Cowell had invited Mr. Waterman to work as a judge, expecting him to be what Mr. Cowell described as the ""nasty"" one. But Mr. Waterman got more emotional on the show than Mr. Cowell expected. (It was published in the British press that he actually teared up at one performance). Mr. Cowell, meanwhile, acted no differently on the air than he did at real auditions -- he was cold and distant. And his comments reflected that.As the show took off after its premiere that October, the British press concentrated on Mr. Cowell and his barbed comments. He was the nasty one, the ""mouthy"" one. The show quickly began to revolve around Mr. Cowell and his withering appraisals of the wretched talent being brought before him.""Pop Idol"" was the hit of the year in Britain. The two finalists both released albums after the show concluded and sold millions of copies. Mr. Fuller had two new hit artists to manage; Mr. Cowell's label had two huge-selling albums. Their collaboration was a ringing success -- and they were just getting started.Alix Hartley, a British-born talent agent with an expertise in music, who worked for the Creative Artists Agency, the heavyweight Hollywood talent agency, was a natural to represent Mr. Fuller in the challenge of going back to the networks in the fall of 2001 and finding ""Pop Idol"" a home on American television.Given how both ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" and ""Survivor"" -- both conceived by British producers -- had emerged as hits on American television in the summer months, C.A.A.'s strategy was to pitch ""Pop Idol"" around as a perfect new reality programming vehicle for the summer of 2002. It was light, entertaining and not very expensive to produce. As an added advantage, having started a 15-week British run in October, it would have fully executed weekly editions on tape to serve as the template for the American version.ANDREA WONG, who ran the reality-programming department for ABC, was an ideal target for the C.A.A. pitch. She was aggressively seeking reality programs and had been closely watching the British market in the wake of her network's failure to secure ""Survivor"" when it had twice been in ABC's clutches.But C.A.A. and the producers of ""Pop Idol"" ran into a problem that ""Survivor"" never had to face. Music had already failed in the United States in reality formats on two networks, one being ABC.That network tried a show in 2000 called ""Making the Band,"" about assembling a boy-band singing group. Though it had a small following, mostly among pubescent girls, the show simply could not cross over into a wider audience. The music format was blamed. Music had become just too stratified, the argument went, to ever build a wide-enough appeal in the United States to succeed on the scale that an American network television show required.The WB network, which was mainly the network of pubescent girls, tried a similar format the next season with a show that the network called ""Pop Stars,"" a format derived from the Australian and British models of the same name -- only with an-all girl group. It, too, found only a niche audience.Ms. Wong knew all of that when C.A.A. came in touting ""Pop Idol."" She passed. C.A.A. next met with NBC's reality executives. They passed. The agency never set up a formal meeting with CBS's reality division, feeling as though an initial phone call to CBS had fallen utterly flat.That left Fox. The British producers had gotten nowhere in the spring when they tried to interest Fox's reality division, headed by Mike Darnell, in ""Pop Idol."" But C.A.A. made a new effort anyway. This time Ms. Hartley of C.A.A. and Mr. Fuller -- without Mr. Cowell this time -- went in to see Mr. Darnell himself.Mr. Fuller pitched his idea with fervent passion, and that impressed Mr. Darnell. He really liked the notion that the format would essentially be all audition, complete with a lot of really woeful early performances. Mr. Darnell had never liked the band-making shows once they got past the auditions. Here was a format in which the auditions, replete with people making cringe-inducing fools of themselves, would rule.Mr. Darnell, thinking of summer budgets at Fox, wanted to know if the show had sponsorship attached. Ms. Hartley told him that C.A.A. was working on that very angle. Mr. Darnell told Ms. Hartley and Mr. Fuller that they should bring up the idea with Sandy Grushow, the head of entertainment for Fox, and his chief lieutenant, Gail Berman.When Mr. Grushow and Ms. Berman heard the pitch, both had the same reaction: tepid. A talent contest did not sound like inspiring television in the 21st century -- or like a breakout hit, for which Fox had an increasingly searing need at that point.But both executives knew that the network could also use something that might pass for fresh summer programming. The problem was, Fox was out of money. The program budget for the year was exhausted, bone dry.Mr. Grushow told the C.A.A. representatives that Fox was simply not going to pay a license fee for this program -- if it was going to get on the air, it would have to be as a fully sponsored broadcast. ""We don't know much about this show,"" Mr. Grushow told them. ""But if we can get it for nothing, it's sort of a no-brainer.""C.A.A. indicated that, of course, it could line up sponsors. Fox said: Come back to us when you do.By this point, early in winter, ""Pop Idol"" had become the talk of Britain. Fox had made no effort to secure the show, so C.A.A. went back to Ms. Wong from ABC, armed with those mighty ratings from the British run. She asked to see a tape of the British show. That was encouraging. A tape was delivered. Ms. Wong watched it -- and passed again.The impasse with Fox continued. C.A.A. heard nothing from Mr. Darnell. Ms. Berman and Mr. Grushow continued to press for a fully sponsored show; nothing was happening, despite the fabulous success in Britain.But even as talks with Fox dragged on, C.A.A. was trying to exploit a connection that some at the agency believed might play out to their advantage. Back in October, several C.A.A. executives had met with Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of Rupert Murdoch, the founder and chief executive of the News Corporation, which owns Fox. The meeting took place at Mipcom, the international television programming festival in Cannes, France. A blossoming relationship took hold there.With the talks about ""Idol"" stalled in Los Angeles, the C.A.A. representatives at one point mentioned the show in a conversation with Ms. Murdoch, who ran the News Corporation's most important television operation in England, the BSkyB satellite channel. She, of course, was witnessing the phenomenon of ""Pop Idol"" firsthand, on her home TV set.Fortunately for C.A.A., Ms. Murdoch flat-out loved the show. Hearing that her father's American network had yet to act on making a deal for the United States rights, she decided to give the process a helpful nudge. She called her father and told him how much she loved ""Pop Idol"" and how big the show was becoming in England. She urged him to buy the rights for Fox.Mr. Murdoch put in a call the next day to Peter Chernin, his No. 2 at the News Corporation and the top decision-maker on all the biggest moves made by the Fox network. ""What's going on with this show 'Pop Idol,' Peter?"" Mr. Murdoch asked Mr. Chernin. ""It's a big hit in England. I spoke to Liz and she says it's great.""Mr. Chernin was familiar enough with the situation to report that Fox's network people had been talking about it with the agency, discussing potential advertising backers. ""We're still looking at it,"" he said.Mr. Murdoch shot back: ""Don't look at it. Buy it! Right now.""With those marching orders ringing in his ears, Mr. Chernin followed up quickly, calling Mr. Grushow and Ms. Berman. He asked them the status of ""Pop Idol."" They told him that they were still waiting for the advertiser sponsorships to come through.""Just close the deal,"" Mr. Chernin said. He explained the call from Mr. Murdoch.Mr. Grushow said, ""We'll get it closed today.""The actual order for the series suddenly changed as well. Instead of an eight-episode summer order, Fox began asking C.A.A. for the rights to broadcast 15 episodes -- the same duration as the show in Britain. The C.A.A. agents concluded that one of the Murdochs, or maybe both, had insisted that the show be done exactly as it was in England.That did not mean that Fox would import the British hosts and judges. Fox fully expected to hire figures from the American music industry for those jobs. But after the deal was concluded, and Mr. Grushow finally was able to watch a tape of the British version, he told Ms. Berman that he was taken by the nastily charismatic figure on the British judging panel. ""I think as part of the deal, we should insist on bringing this guy over as a judge,"" he said. At that point, he could not remember Simon Cowell's name.""Pop Idol"" made Mr. Cowell one of the most talked-about cultural figures in Britain in the winter of 2002. He was a tabloid newspaper's dream: seen by millions every week on television, saying something outrageously quotable (""You're a disaster""), doing something unconscionably cruel (several young women left the auditions convulsed in tears after hearing his corrosive assessments of their talents) and tirelessly promoting his program (by doing every sort of interview in print and on television and radio).Mr. Cowell said he was pleased when he heard that the show had finally sold in the United States but mildly shocked when he learned that Fox was requesting that he come along to be a judge on the American version. He had not planned on turning himself into an international television star; he said he wanted only to make the show a hit for the benefit of his record label.At first he had doubts about whether he knew enough about American music to judge American singers. He was also concerned because of the way American television executives functioned during those hideous meetings in the spring. He expected that some genius at the American network was bound to try to water down the show, and especially his honestly acerbic comments. He would have no interest in a sweetened version of ""Pop Idol.""Then Kevin Warwick, one of the producers of the British show, called. ""Look, Simon, we're going over to produce the show in America,"" he said. ""I will look after your back again. You won't have to compromise what you do. You can be yourself.""Mr. Cowell asked, ""So I can really be the same as I was in England?""Mr. Warwick assured him that he could.A few weeks later, Mr. Cowell arrived in Los Angeles for his first round of meetings with Fox and the American producer, Brian Gadinsky. At first they considered rechristening it ""America's Idol."" Mr. Darnell thought that made it sound as if it might be about a New York fireman, so he suggested ""American Idol."" (Nobody wanted ""pop"" in the title because nobody in the music business in the United States ever used the word ""pop"" anymore -- with the exception of Michael Jackson -- and because ""Pop Stars"" had been a failure for the WB network.)Mr. Murdoch, as he often did, sat in on a meeting that winter to go over the full development slate for the network. When it came time to talk about reality programs, he jumped right in and asked about ""Idol."" Mr. Darnell was ready with his plans for how to execute the format. ""Here's what I want to do,"" he began.Mr. Murdoch cut him off. ""You don't change a thing,"" he said, according to one of the Fox executives in the meeting. ""This show works in England. And you're going to make the same show they made in England. The problem with you Hollywood people is you always want to change things and you ruin everything.""Mr. Murdoch had not likely studied the structure of the British format to determine that it was flawless. But he did know that the network would not have ""Idol"" had he not insisted on it.No one would think of challenging Mr. Murdoch's views, but some Fox executives really did believe that the British format had some obvious flaws. For one thing, it had two hosts, which surely made the show seem unnecessarily cluttered. And the four-judge panel invited trouble because it was an even number. If the judges split two to two, the format called for Mr. Cowell to break the tie, but that seemed actually to reduce the number of judges to one.FOX had not signed Mr. Cowell to a contract -- at his insistence. He told the Fox executives, ""I'll do one season and see how it goes."" That was music to the ears of the Fox group, still worried about the expense of this little summer show that had suddenly grown to 15 episodes. Nobody really knew how the show would do. Mr. Cowell was still emphasizing that he was in it not for the fame or the salary, but for the money that would come from having yet another hot artist for his label. He did not even acquire an American agent -- not right away.The whole Fox network operation impressed Mr. Cowell because there was never a hint of an attempt to censor him or to turn him into a sweetheart of a guy. Fox seemed to him to be bravely acknowledging that the American audience, like the British audience, was ready to rebel against what Mr. Cowell called ""the terrible political correctness that invaded America and England.""To Mr. Cowell, it looked as if Fox was going to allow the audience to see something that wasn't sanitized for a change. They would embrace the fact that with Mr. Cowell doing the talking, ""lots of useless people were going to be told that they were useless.""The selection of the other judges went relatively smoothly. When Fox brought in Randy Jackson, the onetime bass player for the band Journey who became a successful producer and talent manager for Columbia Records, Mr. Cowell liked him immediately. When Mr. Cowell heard that Paula Abdul would also be named a judge, Mr. Cowell thought that she was also a solid choice, given her long music career in the United States.Mr. Cowell did not meet Ms. Abdul until the first round of auditions for the show, which took place in Los Angeles. At that point, no one at Fox had ever even seen the three judges interact with one another. A fourth judge had still not been chosen, but given how much time the auditions were expected to take, the idea was to start with three and, if a fourth was found, to add him or her later.Almost nothing was said among the judges before the first auditions rolled. Ms. Abdul seemed quiet and polite to Mr. Cowell; Mr. Jackson was affable. The first singers came in. They had already been screened, of course, and included a healthy mixture of respectable warblers and tone-deaf screechers.This was teed up for Mr. Cowell, who unleashed his lash on every offending wannabe. He told one girl to get a lawyer and to sue her vocal coach. Others he labeled with such terms as wretched, horrid, pathetic. When one kid said he would someday regret all the hearts he was breaking, Mr. Cowell dismissed him with the line, ""You're a loser.""The chorus of put-downs was clearly not what Ms. Abdul had been expecting. Several times during the first day, she looked over at Mr. Cowell in shock. He took notice. Apparently, Ms. Abdul had been anticipating the kind of audition that American kids usually got: ""Oh, you were great! Thanks, we'll let you know."" Instead, they were leaving either angry or in tears.After the taping, Mr. Cowell cornered the producers. ""I think Paula is going to walk,"" he told them. ""I don't think she's going to want to continue to do the show."" Ms. Abdul did not quit, but the relationship between her and Mr. Cowell was instantly tense. Their fractiousness on the air in those early shows was definitely not a put-on, Mr. Cowell said.As the auditions moved on to a second round, Mr. Cowell remained concerned about how Ms. Abdul was going react to his give-no-quarter style. Just before the taping was to begin, one of the newer American producers came up to him with a long sheet of paper in his hand. He offered it to Mr. Cowell.""What is it?"" Mr. Cowell said.""We've written a script for you today,"" the producer said.""What do you mean a script?"" the befuddled Mr. Cowell said.""We've written put-downs for you, more put-downs,"" the producer said.""What do you mean, you've written me put-downs?""""Well, you're scripted, aren't you?"" the producer said.""No, I'm not scripted,"" Mr. Cowell said, now more appalled than surprised.""Well, do you want these?"" the producer said, offering the list again.""No!"" Mr. Cowell said, utterly indignant at the insult. Apparently these people were accustomed to everything being scripted.AFTER the auditions, Mr. Cowell flew home to London. He was confident that the show would make great television. He had no idea if it would break through and be a hit, because he felt that he could not predict American tastes the way he could British tastes. But he was more than satisfied with how the auditions had gone. He would return for the live-performance shows just after the first few editions of ""American Idol"" went on the air.Mr. Cowell was back at his day job in London on June 11, 2002. He had music artists and selling records on his mind, not ""American Idol."" The fact that the show had gone on the air the previous night in the United States had slipped his mind.About 3 p.m. London time, he got a call. It was one of the ""Idol"" staff members in Los Angeles. When Mr. Cowell picked up the phone, the guy on the other end was so excited that he could hardly get the words out.""Simon, this is amazing; it's a hit,"" the voice said.Confused for a moment, Mr. Cowell said: ""What are you talking about? What's a hit?"""" 'American Idol.' We opened last night, and the ratings are going through the roof.""The report was only a slight exaggeration. ""Idol"" was the most-watched show on American television, with 10 million viewers, on the Tuesday when it had its premiere; the next night it eclipsed 11 million. Both ranked even better among the young viewers whom Fox coveted, beating all competition in the 18-to-49 age group and, even better, finished first and second for the week among viewers 18 to 34.Mr. Cowell immediately embarked on a round of publicity, doing 50 interviews with American radio stations in one day alone. Of course, the phenomenon that would soon dominate American pop culture -- and ignite Fox on a spectacular ratings run toward real competitive balance with the other three networks -- was only beginning. Within a matter of weeks, Fox was making arrangements to bring ""Idol"" back in the regular season, starting the following January.""American Idol"" would not be only the ""game changer"" that Mr. Grushow and Fox had been searching for.It would be a business-changer for all of network television.'"

"'06-04-30,'0','However, I did none of these things.Instead, I acted as if I had done this on purpose.I showed no emotion; if anything, I may have yawned. I casually shook my paper plate from side to side, distributing the red pepper across the slice; using my index finger, I spread the remaining grains of pepper so that the entire piece was unilaterally coated with one-eighth of an inch of red pepper. I then proceeded to sit near the counter and hungrily chomp away at this monstrosity, which now tasted like the inside of an arc welder. My core temperature increased by 17 degrees. Perspiration rolled down my nose, but I ignored it completely. There was a copy of The Daily News on the table, and I started leafing through its pages with intense interest, even though I had never read this publication before and probably never will again. As far as everyone else in the restaurant was concerned, this is the way I live.When I walked toward the 11th Street Bar a few minutes later, I started wondering why I had done this. Was it because I was humiliated? Actually, no; all the people in the establishment were random, unimportant strangers I would never see again. I wasn't the least bit embarrassed. Was it because I was trying to convince myself that I actually did prefer pizza that was 60 percent pepper? Again, the answer is no; I expected to hate every bite and felt no regret. The fact of the matter is this: There was no reason. I wanted this episode to have no meaning whatsoever, because eating pizza seems as if it should be a meaningless act. If I had somehow assigned a motive to this decision, it would have made the details of this meal into some kind of metaphor for who I was as a person, which was precisely what I did not want.Very often, I don't know why I do the things that I do; it is my assumption that many people feel this way pretty much all the time. But whenever you do something especially idiotic, and if your reaction to such an event is especially unreasonable, you're forced to question (a) the motivations that drive your behavior and (b) whether such motives even exist.I had turned the pizza episode into a metaphor despite myself, just by desiring the opposite. And I started to wonder how much the rest of life is like this; I started to wonder how often I do things that make no sense and have no purpose simply because I presume my life is supposed to feel normal; because they seem like the things I always do, even though I have no idea why and could never justify the rationale, even to myself.When I eventually got to the tavern, I told this anecdote to Phoebe, who responded like a normal person. ""That must have tasted terrible,"" she said.""Well, of course,"" I responded. ""However, that's not the point. You see, that pepper represents conformity. I was oppressing myself. I am oppressed, and I don't even need an oppressor."" But Phoebe did not take this sentiment seriously. We began a different conversation, which I think was about the Stations of the Cross. And that was good; that, I suppose, was abnormal in a way that I didn't even notice.THE FUNNY PAGES: II: TRUE-LIFE TALES Chuck Klosterman is a contributing writer.

"'06-04-30,'0','While these returns are substantial for just four months, some mutual fund analysts say that the main reason to invest in the funds would be for diversification in portfolios that don't already have a big stake in foreign stock or bond funds. ""Someone with most of their investments in domestic assets has a lot of their risk concentrated in the dollar,"" said Jeet Dutta, a fund analyst at Morningstar, who likened investing in foreign currency funds to buying insurance against a big decline in the dollar.But Mr. Dutta said he could not see a reason for buying shares of one of these funds if you also owned a longer-duration foreign bond fund. Axel Merk, the manager of the Merk Hard Currency fund, described it as a stepping stone to international investing.""It's diversification with less risk,"" Mr. Merk said. ""Because you're just taking on the currency risk rather than also the business risk with foreign stocks or the interest-rate risk with foreign bond markets.""Both the Franklin Templeton and the Merk funds primarily buy bonds denominated in so-called hard currencies -- those like the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar, from countries where the economics and politics are widely viewed as stable. But there are differences in the funds' approaches.The Franklin fund emphasizes Asian currencies, for example; the Merk fund holds none of them. Recently, about 45 percent of the Franklin fund was in Asian currencies, but none of that was in the Japanese yen.""We're primarily looking at currencies we think have the best value versus the dollar, but within that space, we're trying to pick the currencies we think have the best yield,"" said Michael Hasenstab, who has been a manager of the fund since 2001. He said that the yen was unlikely to appreciate much against the dollar, and that the yield on Japan's short-term bonds was practically zero.The fund does have some Asian holdings that Mr. Hasenstab said he would not classify as hard currencies. In December, slightly more than 8 percent of the portfolio was in the South Korean won, while just over 5 percent was in the Thai baht.For his part, Mr. Merk said that he was avoiding Asian currencies because ""they're for the speculator, whereas the hard currencies that I pursue are more for the people who are concerned about the dollar.""More than 63 percent of the Merk fund is invested in four European currencies: the euro, the British pound, the Swiss franc and the Swedish krona. Most of the rest is divided between the Australian and Canadian dollars, with a small portion in the New Zealand dollar.Finally, a little more than 9 percent of the Merk fund is invested in a gold exchange-traded fund, because gold has often fared well when the dollar has been under duress; the Franklin Templeton fund has no commodities exposure. The Franklin fund has an initial sales charge of 2.25 percent and charges 1.19 percent a year for expenses. The Merk fund has no sales charge and has annual expenses of 1.3 percent.OTHER currency mutual funds introduced last year by ProFunds and Rydex make wagers on the dollar. ProFunds Falling Dollar and Rydex Weakening Dollar both bet against the currency; the Rydex fund uses leverage to rise twice as much as the dollar falls. (If the dollar rises, that fund will lose twice as much as the dollar gains, while the ProFunds version is designed to mirror the dollar's movements.) Two other funds -- the ProFunds Rising Dollar and Rydex Strengthening Dollar --aim to rise when the dollar is rising.Andrew Clark, a senior fund analyst at Lipper, said he thought that the Rydex funds were appropriate only for speculators, because the use of leverage meant that losses could be drastic. This year, the ProFunds Rising Dollar fund has lost 3.6 percent, while the Rydex Strengthening Dollar fund has lost 8.2 percent.On the other hand, Mr. Clark said he saw a lot of potential in yet another alternative for investing in foreign currencies that was introduced last year: the Euro Currency Trust, an exchange-traded fund that began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in December. Unlike mutual funds, E.T.F.'s can be traded throughout the day, and Mr. Clark said that this could be an advantage in a fast-changing monetary crisis. Another distinction of E.T.F.'s is that investors can short -- or bet against -- them. That way, Mr. Clark said, investors who thought that the dollar might rise could bet against the euro without taking on the two-for-one leverage of the Rydex funds.Shorting the E.T.F. may also be a way for investors to hedge their currency risk if they have a lot of money in foreign stock or bond funds that do not already hedge, Mr. Clark said. But he pointed out that it could be tough for investors to know whether their foreign stock or bond funds hedged their currency risk, or by how much.Mr. Dutta of Morningstar said that the Franklin Templeton or Merk funds might be useful for some individual investors, but cautioned that most people would be wise to keep such holdings as a small part of their portfolios and to treat them as long-term assets, rather than to jump in and out of them to place quick bets against the dollar.""It's difficult to get currencies right,"" Mr. Dutta said. Even if, for example, ""you can see that there's a clear macroeconomic case for the dollar to go down,"" he said that such arguments were more likely to hold true for the long term. No one gets short-term currency moves right all the time, he said. ""In the short term,"" he said, ""it might well go against what the experts say.""'"

"'06-04-30,'0','Still, for years, police officials often complained that the F.B.I. did not share basic information, a concern that took on new weight after the Sept. 11 attacks.Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, who navigated the federal bureaucracy in his years as a Treasury undersecretary and customs commissioner, reorganized the department after the attacks in an effort to prevent or prepare for another terrorist strike.But some of those measures, including posting detectives overseas and dispatching some outside New York City's jurisdiction , were initially seen by some at the F.B.I. as an intrusion into the bureau's duties.The Police Department began talking with Mr. Coleman after he retired in 2004, officials said.But the department ultimately offered him a position under Mr. Cohen, whom he had met in 1996 and who took over the force's Intelligence Division after 35 years at the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Coleman agreed, the officials said. He filled out the paperwork and a start date in January was chosen for the job, which paid about $86,000.Before that, however, he attended the December meeting with Mr. Cohen and others, the officials said.At the meeting, the officials talked about ongoing and planned activities, including some outside New York City and outside the jurisdiction of the F.B.I.'s New York office, said one official.At some point, Mr. Coleman suggested they talk to officials at the New York Joint Terrorist Task Force, which is made up of federal agents and local police, the official said. But Mr. Cohen then singled out a particular F.B.I. official, a former boss of Mr. Coleman's, for criticism and the meeting became unpleasant, the official said.It was then that Mr. Coleman decided that the Police Department job was not for him, the official said.""New York is a place of strong personalities, whether you are with the F.B.I. or the N.Y.P.D.,"" said John J. Miller, an F.B.I. assistant director.""That said, the important thing to keep in mind is that the relationship between the two organizations is an old one and a strong one, ""and that communications between the two departments and their leaders is going very well,"" he added.Recently, police and F.B.I. officials have sought to put what they say is their markedly improved relationship on display. On Wednesday, the director of the F.B.I., Robert S. Mueller III, came to New York to give a speech saying terror attacks are as likely to originate locally -- from individuals or groups who raise money from street crime -- as they are from overseas. Bureau officials, in announcing the event, highlighted that Mr. Kelly would attend and that after Mr. Mueller's remarks, both men and the head of the F.B.I.'s New York office, Assistant Director Mark J. Mershon, would talk to reporters.The department's recent attempts to hire former F.B.I. officials did not end with Mr. Coleman, who was credited with gaining cooperation from an important witness in the bombings of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in 1998, who later testified in the case.Two former F.B.I. officials, Sidney J. Caspersen and Ed Curran, have worked in the Intelligence Division for Mr. Cohen for about a month, Mr. Caspersen as assistant commissioner for intelligence programs and Mr. Curran as director of liaison operations overseeing relations on international, national and local levels.Last year, while Mr. Caspersen was director of New Jersey's Office of Counter-Terrorism, he was at the center of a controversy over the way his agents had filed their reports to a statewide database. At issue was whether the names of people were entered because of affiliations with Muslim groups.Earlier this month, a state police official accused one of his superiors of manipulating intelligence to create the impression that Mr. Caspersen's agency had been racially profiling Arabs, according a report in The Record, of Bergen County, N.J.'"
"'06-04-30,'0','But most of all, the three-and-a-half-minute trip from one island to another offers a rare chance to live purely in the moment in New York, no small achievement. Step off concrete and onto a slightly lurching floor as the tram waits in dock. The doors slide closed. A moment of anticipatory stillness and then a push into open space, sailing over Second Avenue and on to parts unknown. Or so it seems. ""Hold on while the car is in motion,"" the mostly silent tram operator advises.During daytime trips, the world is very much present. Cameras flash as tourists capture New York from yet another angle. There is desultory talk as one islander spies another and a murmured travel bulletin or two via cellphone to family on the other side. The passing tram offers unique views of luxe furniture behind the wraparound windows of Upper East Side high-rises. Racing dots chase after one another in the dog run far below at the edge of the East River.To the south, the United Nations quietly wrests attention from the upstart Trump World Tower. Tugs and barges chug and glide up and down the river, while high overhead an occasional helicopter buzzes by, wasplike. The bridge is a Richard Scarry jam of nervous cars and trucks.And yet. You can have taken the trip for years and still feel the strangeness of the insubstantial airborne ""ground"" beneath your feet. The peeling bridge still looms and recedes in high winds like a large, tipsy dowager exasperatingly intent on conversation. For all the details of everyday life that press in from below, nothing is quite real or as it seems. You are alone in space, helpless, really, but riding as high and triumphantly free as the seagulls of Roosevelt Island, though a great deal more slowly.The mystery of those moments suspended in reality is even more potent at night. ""Oh, what a beautiful city!"" as the old hymn goes. Conversation on the tram tends to be muted, except at theater-emptying time. The landmarks have largely disappeared, replaced by streams of traffic headlights on the avenues below and by the necklaces of lights lacing the many bridges that are now more visible in the night-sky panorama. The cars crossing the Queensboro Bridge are now intimate, unknowable little worlds in distant motion. The dark river seems almost nonexistent.The world falls away. The silence becomes immense and enveloping. There is just you and black air and earth, and sometimes not even that. The air is more liquid than the river, a distillation of peace and the sense of old skin falling away. Is fear more manageable here in the dark? ""Everybody get out and push,"" a blithe young tram operator suggested one night years ago as the tram ground to a halt in midair.THEN Roosevelt Island lies ahead, growing larger slowly. Are men and women staring out from the windows of their new apartments to the north, wondering at the glittering nightscape before them? Have the daytime fishermen been replaced by lovers or drug dealers to the south, at the edge of open land on the island's southern tip that is almost Hebridean in its water-fringed green sprawl? Do mice, or shadow cats, or a lumbering Canada goose up late feast in peace on the remains of a sandwich left for them by a kindly orderly at the nearby hospital? You will never know. Or care, perhaps.The comparable experience, someone suggested, is riding the Staten Island Ferry. Much closer is leaving the heightened life of the stage and heading into the dim no-man's-land just beyond. Ahead lies a backstage crowded with familiar shadows and the prosaic halls that lead to dressing rooms and the stage door out. But for those few moments in between, a dim blue bulb the only light, you have stepped beyond the fairy-tale mirror, into the tunnel down the rabbit hole. Then, ""Hold on as the cabin docks,"" a gruff, bored voice intones as the tram bobs down to land. And you are back in Kansas.'"
"'06-04-30,'0','Even as more and more movies and television shows are being shot in New York, the city that turns up on the screen is far more likely to be the teeming, terrifying, exhilarating, unforgiving New York of the popular imagination. Kevin Lima's coming film ""Enchanted,"" for example, is about a peasant girl who is banished from her fairy-tale world to a New York that is both gritty and romanticized. As Mr. Lumet put it, ""If a director comes in from California and doesn't know the city at all, he picks the Empire State Building and all the postcard shots -- and that, of course, isn't the city."" To many filmmakers, the postcard is all that's left.David Thomson, author of The New Biographical Dictionary of Film, said: ""There's been a sea change. I can remember well into the 70's films where there is the terrific sense of New York as being this adventurous place. Certainly if you go back to the 30's and think of a film like 'My Man Godfrey,' New York is a great, dangerous playground. Those films really had a sense of how jazzy and exciting it was to be in New York. I can't think of the last film I've seen that had that feeling.""Paul Mazursky, the Brooklyn-born director of New York films like ""Next Stop, Greenwich Village"" (1976) and ""An Unmarried Woman"" (1978), echoed this view: ""I'm trying to think of the last good New York movie."" (He's still thinking.)For Mr. Sanders, the essential challenge facing today's filmmakers is: ""Can you make character stories in a city without character? There is a sense that the city is an ordinary place.""To a large extent, the driving force behind the flood of productions is less creative than pedestrian: New York offers competitive logistics and cost efficiencies. There been a big expansion of studio space, thanks to facilities like Silvercup Studios in Queens and Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, and the state and city offer tax rebates of 15 percent to filmmakers who shoot at least 75 percent of their movies in New York City.These new economies have opened the door for films that might have been shot elsewhere in the past, notably in Toronto, which has long been a cheaper substitute for New York City exteriors. In fact, the stories nowadays don't even have to be specific to the city: Martin Scorsese, a quintessential New Yorker, let the city stand in for Boston in some scenes for his next movie, ""The Departed."" (And some recent films set squarely in New York have been shot elsewhere, as when Peter Jackson used technical wizardry to reconstruct Depression-era Manhattan in New Zealand for ""King Kong"" and Oliver Stone repaired to a set near Marina del Rey in Southern California to shoot ground zero for his coming 9/11 project, ""World Trade Center."")Even now, though, shooting a big-budget movie is still expensive enough that most filmmakers need a good reason to shoot in the city. Robert Greenhut, who has produced more than 20 Woody Allen films and is currently an executive producer of Kirsten Sheridan's ""August Rush,"" said that reason is often the city's character, which endures, even in muted form.""New Yorkers' personalities are different than Chicago,"" he said. ""It's a different kind of hard-edged. There's a certain kind of vibrancy and tone that you can't get elsewhere.""Mr. Greenhut, who recently presided over a scene in Irving Plaza that featured 300 extras, added: ""The labor pool is more interesting than elsewhere -- the salesgirl with one line, or the cop. That's who directors are looking for.""Traditionally, one of the most cinematically exploitable aspects of New York has been its reputation as a cauldron of organized crime, corruption and narcotics. The author and screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi (""GoodFellas"") said Hollywood reflected, or at least dramatized, this reality in the 30's with gangster films like ""The Roaring Twenties."" In the 50's, he said, it was ""the corrupt city exemplified by 'Sweet Smell of Success,' "" with its malevolent gossip columnist, J. J. Hunsecker. In the 60's, ""narcotics arrive and the city becomes a horrendous place."" The director William Friedkin memorably hammered home this point in 1971 with ""The French Connection,"" in which the hero cop, played by Gene Hackman, is nearly as corrupt and brutish as the criminals he's chasing.Eventually Mr. Friedkin and other filmmakers were deprived of much of this subject matter (unless they were making period movies) by, among other things, the success of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Of course, there's still plenty of New York crime, especially on television. ""Law & Order"" and the proliferation of ""Law & Order"" spinoffs are all shot in the city, but Mr. Sanders emphasized that the word ""order"" in these titles suggests that ""crime is treated as an aberration, and it's corrected.""""Order"" had another meaning in the New York of the 60's and 70's. It also referred to the social order, which was seen as threatened by crime and by transit, newspaper and garbage strikes. A slew of films, many of them black comedies, documented this period: ""Midnight Cowboy"" (1969), ""Little Murders"" (1971), ""Death Wish"" (1974), ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (1975), ""Taxi Driver"" (1976). As the film critic Pauline Kael wrote in The New Yorker in 1971, ""I doubt if at any other time in American movie history there has been such a close relationship between the life on the screen and the life of a portion of the audience.""The city, of course, has since prospered, as has much of the audience. As Mr. Pileggi put it, Ratso Rizzo, the slimy hustler in ""Midnight Cowboy,"" ""wouldn't be hanging around those Disney joints"" in Times Square. Still, Mr. Sanders said, living in Manhattan has always been a struggle, at least for some people, and on-screen characters have been squabbling for ages about certain subjects -- like New York rents. "" 'Rosemary's Baby' opens up with a discussion that they can't afford the apartment,"" Mr. Sanders said of the Roman Polanski film from 1968. But it's worth noting that the most visually aggressive recent exploration of the subject, Chris Columbus's ""Rent,"" was shot in no small part on a soundstage in Burbank; a fable about the eternal battle between bohemians and the bourgeoisie found its look on the Warner lot.Certainly some local directors -- in particular Spike Lee, most recently with ""Inside Man"" -- continue to make movies that display an intimate knowledge of New York. And independent filmmakers, who have a long pedigree in the city dating back to John Cassavetes's first film as a director, ""Shadows"" (1959), have stepped in to tell small stories about daily life, or about figures too marginal to merit the big-studio treatment (""Basquiat,"" for example, and ""Pollock,"" both about New York artists). The directors Noah Baumbach (""The Squid and the Whale"") and Dylan Kidd (""Roger Dodger,"" ""P.S."") have continued the tradition of depicting quirky, neurotic New Yorkers. The Tribeca Film Festival, which closes May 7, has an entire series consisting of 13 independent films about New York.But many filmmakers have to burrow deeper or look farther afield for fresh perspectives on New York life. Mr. Mazursky has devised an idea for a New York film about, he said, ""this old guy, somewhat like me, who goes back to New York and can't find it; he meets his old friends, who are doddering wrecks, and their kids, some of them doing well, some of them not.""Mr. Sanders foresees a new crop of filmmakers who will chart new territory in movies about the crosscurrents emanating from ethnic neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. ""We are going to see the story of a Pakistani kid meeting the Hindu kid,"" he said. In fact, he added, because the very nature of the city forces people into close contact with one another, New York still transcends the malls, the box stores and the coming of Trader Joe's. ""There is no rival for the life of the street,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""You run into lovers, ex-lovers. There are so many ways for different kinds of people to meet each other. That has never changed.""'"

"'06-04-30,'0','To be sure, not many professional investors or analysts think that stocks are expensive right now. Consider the price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The P/E ratio is the most widely used method of valuing stocks; for the S.& P., the ratio has fallen to 18 from more than 28 in the summer of 2003, according to Ned Davis Research.""From the standpoint of valuations, things look pretty good,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's.Stocks also continue to look cheap relative to bonds, based on the so-called earnings yield. To calculate the market's earnings yield, take the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio. In this case, the S.& P.'s earnings yield would be 1 divided by 18, which works out to 5.6 percent. Because 10-year Treasuries are still yielding less than that, stocks are said to be the better buy, according to many market watchers.But the problem isn't that the market's P/E ratio is too high. It's that the market may push that ratio even lower in coming months.If enough investors fear rising interest rates, for example, they may decide that stocks are too expensive, even at today's relatively modest ratios. That would drive down equities, reducing the price in the price-to-earnings equation.""The main determinant of the P/E ratio will be interest rates,"" said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. With rates rising, he added, those ratios are unlikely to rise, because higher interest rates tend to slow corporate profit growth while making higher-yielding bonds a more attractive alternative to equities. History shows that P/E multiples fall significantly during periods of rising long-term bond yields.Ned Davis Research recently studied this relationship going back to 1954, looking at periods when 10-year Treasury yields have risen. At the beginning of such periods, the S.& P. 500's price-to-earnings ratio was 18.1, on average. At the end of those periods, the average was 14.2. Conversely, P/E ratios tend to rise -- noticeably so -- during stretches when 10-year Treasury yields fall.Equally important is why long-term interest rates are rising. If they're climbing because of growing inflationary pressures -- and the recent report on consumer prices showed a bigger-than-expected jump in core retail inflation -- this could be even worse for equities because there is an inverse relationship between stock market valuations and inflation.Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Company, recently studied market valuations in various inflation climates. When inflation has been running at an annual pace of less than 2 percent, Ms. Sonders found, the average price-to-earnings ratio for the S.& P. 500 has been 23.4, dating back to 1960.But when inflation climbs to 3 to 4 percent, the average ratio falls to 17.6. And when inflation jumps to 4 to 5 percent, the ratio drops to 14.8, on average.""One of the reasons why the market has had a tough time making its way out of this trading range is the uncertainty surrounding interest rates and inflation,"" Ms. Sonders said.Not everyone thinks that price-to-earnings ratios are likely to decline. Mr. Kleintop at PNC, for example, said that there was a decent chance that those ratios could rise modestly so long as the economy continued to grow at a healthy pace. But whether the ratios rise or fall, he added, investors need to be mindful of valuations.Mr. Kleintop says he believes that health care and technology are among the sectors that are likely to perform best in the current environment, because their P/E ratios have already fallen significantly. The average ratio for the information technology sector of the S.& P. 500, for example, fell to 22 last year from more than 40 in 2003.Of course, picking stocks based solely on valuations doesn't always work. Many market strategists point out that even if a stock's price-to-earnings ratio is low, it can always drop further. But while valuations may not be a ""valid timing tool for investors,"" Mr. Stack said, they can still be used to reduce risk in one's portfolio.Ms. Sonders agreed. She suggested that investors shy away from equities that are trading at higher valuations relative to their historical norms -- as they have the most room to decline if price-to-earnings ratios fall. She said that these would include utilities stocks. The P/E for that industry's stocks in the S.& P. 500 climbed to 16.4 last year from 13.5 in 2003.Investors may also want to take some profits off the table for their small-capitalization stocks, whose P/E ratios have had similar climbs. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks, which has outperformed the shares of many large, blue-chip companies for more than five years, is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.7, well above the average of 22.6 going back to December 1978.Small-cap value stocks have enjoyed even greater P/E expansion in recent years. The Russell 2000 Value index, for example, currently trades at a multiple of 23.2, versus its historical multiple of 18.1.STUDYING market valuations ""isn't going to tell you how to generate fantastic returns,"" said Stephen P. Wood, portfolio strategist at the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash. ""But it will point out places in the market where you can avoid outsized losses,"" he added.""In my experience observing investor behavior,"" he said, ""avoiding large losses is one of the main engines that drives long-term performance.""FUNDAMENTALLY Paul J.
