"'11-02-01,'1','The company hired her as an understudy, over the objections of the music director, Georg Solti, but in June 1963 she had a career breakthrough when she replaced an indisposed Teresa Berganza as Cherubino.She developed her luminous upper register and gradually moved into the soprano repertoire under the guidance of James Lockhart, the conductor and accompanist with whom she had a long professional and personal relationship.She sang her first Verdi role, Nanetta in “Falstaff,” in Wales in 1969, the same year she made her American debut in San Francisco as Pamina in “The Magic Flute.” She sang for the first time in Cologne as Donna Anna in “Don Giovanni” in 1971, the beginning of several happy years when her career was based there.In 1973 Ms. Price made her debut at the Paris Opera, where she sang two of the roles that would become her trademarks: Desdemona in Verdi’s “Otello” and the Countess in “The Marriage of Figaro.” She performed both parts in the company’s acclaimed 1976 American tour.She made a belated debut at the Metropolitan Opera, as Desdemona, in 1985, and returned as Elisabetta in “Don Carlo” in 1989. She spent much of the later years of her career in Munich, where she lived and where the Bavarian State Opera gave her the title “Kammersängerin,” honoring her service to the company. She was made a dame of the British Empire in 1993.Despite her success in opera, her great love was lieder, and she released classic recordings of songs by Brahms, Schubert, Mahler and others. She preferred piano accompanists to conductors, whom she called “my pet hates,” but she worked closely with some of the century’s greatest, from Otto Klemperer, who cast her in the small role of Barbarina in his 1970 recording of “The Marriage of Figaro” and as Fiordiligi in his 1972 “Così Fan Tutte,” to Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti. And long after he expressed reservations about her in those first Covent Garden auditions, Georg Solti collaborated with her on several performances and recordings.In 1982, Carlos Kleiber cast her against type as a radiant Isolde in his recording of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde,” which became one of her best-loved performances, though she never attempted the role onstage. Indeed, Ms. Price chose her parts carefully and retired them promptly when she outgrew them.She left her core repertory — the Mozart heroines and four or five Verdi roles — only for Adriana Lecouvreur and Strauss’s Ariadne. The single role she regretted never trying was Lady Macbeth, and a Covent Garden “Norma” in 1987 was a rare misstep.Ms. Price leaves no immediate survivors; her younger brother died several years ago. A shy, down-to-earth woman, she retired in 1999 to the Welsh coast, where she taught a few students and bred golden retrievers.She professed not to miss singing at all, and was unsentimental when reviewing her career. Though Mr. Kleiber asked her to do it, she never sang the nostalgic Marschallin in Strauss’s “Rosenkavalier.” “That whole thing about turning the clock back,” she called it with mock disgust. She could never identify with that kind of regret.'"
"'11-02-01,'1','Dr. Ernest A. McCulloch, a father of the stem cell research that scientists say holds promise for the treatment of many ailments, died on Jan. 20 in Toronto. He was 84.His death was announced by the University of Toronto, where he was an emeritus university professor.Dr. McCulloch died two weeks short of the 50th anniversary of the publication of a groundbreaking paper he wrote with Dr. James E. Till in the journal Radiation Research. The paper had an important role in research that the two began in the 1950s and that earned them an Albert Lasker basic medical research award in 2005 for “setting the stage for all current research on adult and embryonic stem cells.”Such stem cells are nonspecialized but can give rise to specialized cells like those in the brain, heart and other organs and tissues. Stem cells derived from embryos can develop into any cell type, whether in the heart, lung or another body part; stem cells derived from adult cells have already differentiated by body part and can develop only into the type of cells related to them.Many scientists now contend that with years of continued research, stem cells may help treat, if not cure, spinal cord paralysis, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, damaged hearts, kidneys and livers, and many other ailments.Dr. McCulloch and Dr. Till were a study in contrasts; where Dr. McCulloch was short, stocky and rumpled, Dr. Till was tall, trim and elegantly dressed. Yet they were the perfect research pair, balancing each other’s personalities, said Dr. Alan Bernstein, a former president of the Canadian Institute of Health Research, an organization analogous to the National Institutes of Health in the United States.'"
"'11-02-01,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is further tightening its control of the App Store.Some application developers, including Sony, say Apple has told them they can no longer sell e-books within their apps unless the transactions go through Apple’s system. Apple rejected Sony’s iPhone application, which would have let people buy and read e-books from the Sony Reader Store.Apple said on Tuesday that it was still allowing customers to read e-books they bought elsewhere within apps.  For example, a Sony app could still access books the customer bought earlier from Sony’s store.But Steve Haber, president of Sony’s digital reading division, said on Monday that Apple had told his company that from now on, all in-app purchases would have to go through Apple.“It’s the opposite of what we wanted to bring to the market,” Mr. Haber said. “We always wanted to bring the content to as many devices as possible, not one device to one store.”Apps like the Kindle app from Amazon.com and the one that Sony submitted open up a browser window when a user wants to buy something. This allows the app makers to argue that technically the purchase is happening on the Web, not within the app.'"
"'11-02-01,'1','Late Friday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York sent a radical bill to cap property taxes to the State Senate. It would devastate school districts in the state. The bill, which exempts New York City, was passed by the Senate on Monday.But Democrats in the Assembly are rightly startled by a provision that would require a 60 percent majority vote for local property tax increases that exceed 2 percent. That would give people who oppose school spending more voting power than people who support it. It would also leave struggling school districts with no increase if voters rejected an increase twice within a given year.The bill would also do away with the traditional school budget vote and require districts to simply ask voters to support a tax increase. That would make new school financing virtually impossible in many of the poorest communities. Unlike New Jersey’s tax cap, this one does not have exemptions for health care, pensions, debt service or increased enrollment. Mr. Cuomo has said he wants to change state law to lift these onerous and costly requirements for local districts. That should come first.The governor’s motives for bringing out this bill now are unclear. Does he want political points for introducing a tough bill that can never go anywhere? If so, that is one of the oldest ploys in Albany and certainly at odds with Mr. Cuomo’s promise of a new New York.Does he want to force Democrats in the Assembly to approve the bill after he and the Senate have given their approval. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who can stall or block anything if he wants, should not be talking about compromise, as he has been. But, rather, he should block any Senate bill along these lines.The entire charade fails to focus on the real hazards tucked in the 74-page bill. A property tax cap, by any standard, is a blunt instrument. It mainly squeezes poorer districts where schools lose teachers or advanced programs because voters reject a tax increase. Wealthier districts more often vote for property-tax increases to pay for better schools or other services, thus widening the gap between schools in poorer or richer areas.'"
"'11-02-01,'1','WASHINGTON — The Haitian government has agreed to issue a diplomatic passport to former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, his lawyer said Monday, potentially dropping a major hurdle that has prevented Mr. Aristide from returning home after seven years in exile.The lawyer, Ira Kurzban, said he was notified of Haiti’s decision last week. He said he sent a letter to Haitian authorities on Monday requesting that Mr. Aristide’s passport be “issued immediately, and that plans for his return commence immediately.”A senior Haitian official told Reuters that Haiti’s Council of Ministers, under the direction of President René Préval, agreed to issue Mr. Aristide a passport if he asked for one. That decision was a significant reversal for Mr. Préval, who had refused Mr. Aristide’s request for a passport for years, partly in response to international pressure.Mr. Aristide, the firebrand slum priest who became this country’s first democratically elected president in 1990, was ousted from power twice. The last time was in 2004, under intense pressure by the United States and the threat of invasion by armed insurgents.Since then, Mr. Aristide and his supporters have made numerous public appeals asking officials to allow him to return to Haiti. Those appeals intensified two weeks ago when the former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier managed a surprise return home, ending 25 years in exile.Last week, Mr. Aristide’s supporters took out a full-page ad in The Miami Herald demanding his return. The ad was signed by prominent supporters including Dr. Paul Farmer, the deputy United Nations envoy to Haiti. Since then, rumors have swirled across Haiti that Mr. Aristide had flown to Cuba or Venezuela to plot his own surprise return. Mr. Kurzban said that Mr. Aristide remained in South Africa, where he has lived in exile.The State Department did not comment Monday on Haiti’s decision.The United States and several other countries, including France and Canada, which provide millions of dollars in support to Haiti, the Western hemisphere’s poorest country, have expressed concern that Mr. Aristide’s return could destabilize the country as it struggles to resolve a hotly contested presidential election.'"

(AP) — Nassau County officials filed a lawsuit late on Monday challenging the legality of a state oversight board’s vote to take control of the county’s finances.John Ciampoli, the Nassau County attorney, said the suit was filed in State Supreme Court in Mineola. It questions whether the board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, was within its purview last week when it voted to take control of the finances of the county, which is on Long Island.The authority cited a deficit of $176 million in Nassau’s 2011 budget of $2.6 billion. It has given the county until Feb. 15 to rewrite its budget.Edward P. Mangano, the first-term county executive, insists there is no deficit. Other county officials contend that the authority’s actions are politically motivated. The authority’s chairman, Ronald Stack, denies that.'"
"'11-02-01,'1','Sharpening a confrontation with Republicans over Southwest border enforcement, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on Monday that crime and illegal crossings had dropped sharply along the border, and she accused lawmakers who say violence is out of control there of trying to “score political points.”One week after Republicans in the House of Representatives held the first of a series of hearings to criticize the Obama administration’s record on immigration enforcement, Ms. Napolitano fought back in a speech at the University of Texas at El Paso. She said that arrests by the Border Patrol, an indication of illegal crossings, had fallen 36 percent in two years and that crime rates in many border cities remained low despite surging drug violence in Mexico.“None of us can stand silent when the public dialogue dishonors the memory and service” of Border Patrol agents, including one agent who was killed in December, “by misstating the facts and unfairly politicizing border issues,” Ms. Napolitano said.Her speech came as Homeland Security Department officials were also fending off criticism that they were too tough on illegal immigrants. In a report, the Migration Policy Institute, a research organization in Washington, found that a national program of cooperation with state and local police was not meeting priorities set by the department to focus primarily on deporting immigrants who committed serious crimes.The report, the first broad study by an independent group of a federal program known as 287(g), found that about half of the immigrants detained for deportation under the program had committed minor crimes or traffic violations. The official goal of the program is to identify and deport immigrants who commit the most serious felonies.'"

"'11-02-01,'1','Mrs. Gil-Rosas travels to Mexico several times a month to buy food, herbs, crafts and statues that are snapped up by a homesick clientele back in Brooklyn. “This comforts us,” she said. “It’s a spiritual duty we Mexicans have. We do not want to forget our roots, so I try to make sure we stay close to the traditions.”This is one of the busiest times of the year for Mrs. Gil-Rosas, who started her business, Las Gemelas (the twins, after her daughters Norma and Sonia) on the Feast of Candelaria in 1990, before Mexicans were a big presence at the market. But word soon spread among the area’s expanding Mexican community, fueling a steady growth.Today, the stall is crammed to the ceiling with dozens of plastic boxes of assorted herbs for teas and home remedies. Display cases feature saints in all sizes, and lotions for a variety of ailments, while the counters are topped with baskets holding peppers, roasted pumpkin seeds coated with lime and salt, candies and earthenware mugs.“The water gets cold just pouring it in the mug,” said Arcelia Gil, Mrs. Gil-Rosas’ sister, who helps at the shop. “And the seeds have a different flavor. Not like the ones made here.”Because made-in-Mexico authenticity is especially important for religious items, the store’s inventory changes regularly to stock necessities for various feasts, from decorative flowers for the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe in December to candies and baked goods for the Day of the Dead in November.“Whatever it is,” said Alyshia Galvez, an assistant professor of Latin American and Puerto Rican studies at Lehman College, “it has more value coming from Mexico, because it has the aura of the original place.”For the statues of baby Jesus — el niño Dios — the divinity is in the details. Preparations for the feast can be as intricate as those for a child’s baptism, in some cases complete with a godmother.By custom, Mrs. Gil-Rosas said, a family’s statue is placed in a manger at home on Christmas Eve, but handed over the next morning to a trusted friend or relative — the godmother — who has the honor of safeguarding the statue, dressing it and taking it to church on Feb. 2.The first year, the statue is clad in white, as if for a baptism. In later years, it can be dressed in more colorful robes, usually representing different manifestations of Jesus — like Santo Niño de Atocha — and outfitted with sandals or crowns. After Mass, the clothed statue is seated in a tiny chair and placed in a spot of honor back home, where a small feast ends the day.“Sometimes people have even put perfume on the child,” Ms. Gil said.Candelaria takes its name from the traditional blessing of candles in Catholic churches, an observance that still occurs that day, though the church emphasizes the feast’s scriptural origins as the presentation of Jesus.Ms. Galvez, who has studied Mexican devotional practices, said the custom of the statues echoes indigenous rituals that marked an infant’s surviving its first critical weeks. It also has parallels to more recent customs in which couples from Mexico bring their child to church for a blessing seven weeks after birth.Such practices assume greater importance among those far from home, making these church rituals a unifying experience. “A lot of people said they never went to church before,” Ms. Galvez said, “but when they came here they learned that was where the action was.”Eager customers were pacing around the market on Friday when Mrs. Gil-Rosas arrived, hauling several plump plastic bags filled with merchandise. As her daughter plucked out tiny folded robes, she discussed prices for refurbishing or clothing statues.Wanda Monserrate stood nearby with her statue — its hair chipped and fingers broken — nestled against her chest. She explained how she wanted it repainted, before showing the purple robes she planned to drape over it.“It looks like he has a rash,” Ms. Monserrate said. “Paint it all. But don’t touch his face.”Although she is Puerto Rican, she adopted the devotion from a close friend from Mexico. She has stayed loyal for more urgent reasons.“This is a promise,” she said. “My grandson almost died twice when he was born. My daughter got cancer. After she finished the chemo, I found out I got cancer. I’m praying for my whole family now.”Dolores Perez arrived to pick up a tiny figurine that had broken into three pieces. She paid $10, and gently cradled it in the palm of her hand. “I’m going to dress him like a newborn,” she said. “To me, it’s a way of remembering what it’s like to be innocent, like a child.”Like many Mexicans in New York, she finds the time to go to church on Candelaria, no matter how tired or overworked she may feel.“If you look around at church that day, you will see an infinite number of people,” she said. “Even in such a big city like New York, we make sure to be at church with the child.”'"
"'11-02-01,'1','SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, a founder of PayPal and chief executive of Tesla Motors, already has a NASA contract for delivering cargo to the space station, and says that it can easily add up to seven seats to its Dragon cargo capsule to make it suitable for passengers. Boeing is also designing a capsule, capable of carrying seven passengers, under the corporate-sounding designation of CST-100.But Boeing and SpaceX are not the only competitors seeking to provide space taxi services, a program that NASA calls commercial crew. Last year, in the first-round financing provided for preliminary development, Sierra Nevada Space Systems won the largest award: $20 million out of a total of $50 million.In December, another space company, Orbital Sciences Corporation, announced it had submitted a similar bid for a space plane it wants financed during the second round. NASA is to announce the winners by the end of March, and they will divide $200 million.About half of NASA’s $19 billion budget goes toward human spaceflight — the space shuttles, the International Space Station — and $200 million this year is just a small slice.“If this is indeed the path to do this work, it’s probably not what they should be putting into it,” said Mr. Sirangelo, who is also chairman emeritus of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group. “But on the other hand, it’s a lot more than we had before. And it’s an acknowledgment there’s momentum in the industry and what we’re trying to accomplish. So that’s good.”After the second round, NASA would like narrow its choices down to two, maybe three, systems to finance.“We think this is in effect a one-year race to see who gets the furthest,” Mr. Sirangelo said, “and at the end of that, presumably the next two years of the authorization bill gets funded, and then you compete for that pot of money.”The blueprint for NASA, passed by Congress last year and signed into law by President Obama, calls for spending on commercial crew to rise to $500 million each year in 2012 and 2013.Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who was one of the primary architects of the blueprint, as the authorization act was called, has said the intent was to provide $6 billion over six years.But what Congress puts into the budget could be far less.“They’re not getting $6 billion over six years for commercial crew,” said a Senate aide who was not authorized to speak for attribution. “That’s never going to happen.”The aide estimated commercial crew might receive half that much.In addition, Congress has not passed the final 2011 budget, and Mr. Obama wants to freeze spending at many federal agencies. Whether the freeze includes NASA will not be known until the president’s 2012 budget request is released in two weeks.While Sierra Nevada has the lowest profile of the companies seeking commercial crew business, it is not new. The parent company, the Sierra Nevada Corporation, is a privately held defense electronics firm founded in 1963, and a few years ago, it bought several space companies and rolled them into the space systems subsidiary.The space systems subsidiary, located outside Denver, is the largest manufacturer in the United States of small satellites, Mr. Sirangelo said. The satellites, used for communications and other purposes, cannot do everything that large ones can do, but what they can do, they do more cheaply and more efficiently.The Dream Chaser embodies the same philosophy. “There are some tasks that can be done by smaller, cheaper vehicles that used to be done by very expensive vehicles,” Mr. Sirangelo said.Mr. Sirangelo said the company had invested its own money into the Dream Chaser — indeed, more than the $20 million that NASA has provided. Over the past year, the company has done a test-firing of the engines it plans to use on the Dream Chaser, and it dropped a scale model of the spacecraft from a helicopter to verify the aerodynamics.But it is a jump from making spacecraft components and small satellites to building a crew-carrying space plane, and where Sierra Nevada lacks in skills and experience, it has brought in other companies and institutions. Its Dream Chaser partners include Draper Laboratory, which has been designing spacecraft guidance systems since Apollo; NASA’s Langley Research Center, which did much of the development that the Dream Chaser is based on; Boeing, which has also worked on space planes; and United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin that builds the Atlas V rocket that the Dream Chaser would ride atop.Virgin Galactic, the spacecraft division of Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin empire, signed on as a strategic partner in December. Among the possible roles that Virgin could play is selling seats on the Dream Chaser. (Virgin signed a similar agreement with Orbital.)The design of the Dream Chaser also has a long lineage, inspired by a Soviet spacecraft. In 1982, an Australian reconnaissance airplane photographed a Russian trawler pulling something with stubby wings out of the Indian Ocean. It turned out to be a test flight of a space plane called the Bor-4, and the craft captured enough curiosity that engineers at NASA Langley copied it.NASA called its version the HL-20, and for a while in 1991, it looked to be the low-cost choice for taking astronauts to and from the space station. Then the NASA administrator who liked it, Vice Adm. Richard Truly of the Navy, left, and the man who replaced him, Daniel S. Goldin, thought it was not cheap enough and ended the work.The Dream Chaser design keeps the exact outer shape from the HL-20 — a decision that allows Sierra Nevada to take advantage of years of wind tunnel tests that Langley had performed — while modifying the design within. The biggest change is the addition of two engines, which reduces the number of passengers to seven from 10, but adds maneuverability. To finish developing the Dream Chaser would require less than $1 billion, Mr. Sirangelo said, and it could be ready to fly an orbital test flight in three years.He imagines that one flight could combine a number of tasks — taking astronauts to the space station and then stopping on the return trip to repair or refuel a satellite. “This vehicle is perfectly designed to do all that,” Mr. Sirangelo said.Officials at Orbital Sciences — a company in Dulles, Va., that builds and launches rockets and satellites for everything from television broadcasts to scientific research — say they are excited by the possibilities of commercial crew, but they are more cautious. Orbital, founded in 1982, was a survivor from the last boom-and-bust in commercial space.Its space plane design is a refinement of the HL-20. Following in the pattern of tapping Greek mythology for the names of its spacecraft, Orbital calls its plane Prometheus. Orbital says development of Prometheus would cost $3.5 billion to $4 billion, which would include the cost of upgrading the Atlas V rocket and two test flights.With enough financial support, David W. Thompson, chief executive of Orbital, is sure that his company can build and operate Prometheus. But he is less sure that his industry is at a tipping point for spaceflight to become much more common, driving down prices and opening up space to new businesses.“I think it depends on what the demand curve really is,” Mr. Thompson said. “I would say I’m highly skeptical.”'"

"'11-02-01,'1','It helps that winter is a slow travel season in Europe, meaning that some commercial carriers and others had idle planes available for quick lease to charter operators. Air Partner, for example, said that it flew 800 clients out of Cairo from noon on Sunday to late Monday afternoon, and was continuing to add charter capacity for its corporate and government clients, including companies in the United States.“We have a lot of high-profile clients who rely on us, and we have to say, ‘Well, it’s all subject to conditions on the ground,’” Mr. Mathews said. “But as of Sunday night, we were able to bring out everybody that wanted to get out” among the company’s clients, he said. On Sunday, Air Partner was using six leased airplanes, including two leased Boeing 737s, an Airbus A320 and an A319, and a large Embraer business jet, on what Mr. Mathews called “basically shuttle flights” between Cairo and London or Dubai.By Monday, demand for any available airplane in Europe and the Middle East was ferocious. Cairo International Airport, meanwhile, limped along under a curfew, its operations severely limited. But charter operators said that as of Monday evening, Cairo time, charter flights were managing to get in and out without major delays.“We have flights booked through tomorrow, and we’re planning into Wednesday,” Mr. Mathews said Monday. “Maybe people who were sitting tight are thinking now, ‘It’s time to get moving.’”Thousands of business travelers remain stranded in hotels or were running into daunting obstacles as they tried to negotiate a perilous maze as the civil unrest turned routine business trips into dangerous ordeals.Most business travelers have heard how important it is to be prepared and to have a plan when on the ground, especially in foreign places where public order can suddenly disappear. But I thought it might be a good time to review some of the basic tips that might at least mitigate the dangers that can appear without warning.The tip I hear most from crisis management experts is this: When civil unrest is brewing, head to the nearest money machine and get cash. A Twitter message from Cairo on Monday underscored that. “No A.T.M.’s making life hard,” it said. “Most Egyptians use cash.”And International SOS, the global medical evacuation and security company, offers these tips: Remain in a secure location, if possible. Plan any movements carefully. Avoid public gatherings, and don’t stop to take pictures of trouble. Fully use local resources, including hotel concierges and local business hosts.The company also recommends not upsetting the local police. “Security forces’ sensitivities may be heightened at this time,” it said. “Do not cross military or police cordons without the express permission of the authorities, and treat members of the security forces you encounter with patience and respect. Carry photographic identification and follow all instructions promptly.”And look out for each other. Flight crew members on layovers abroad have long been advised to know where their colleagues are and how to reach them.In some foreign locales, “There’s long been a policy that you stay together or stay in touch with other crew members, and with the company, on a daily basis,” one longtime international flight attendant for a United States-based carrier told me.'"
"'11-02-01,'1','One Medical Group doctors see at most 16 patients a day; the nationwide average for primary-care physicians is 25. They welcome e-mail communication with patients, for no extra charge. Same-day appointments are routine. And unlike most concierge practices, One Medical accepts a variety of insurance plans, including Medicare.The group’s founder and guiding spirit is Dr. Tom X. Lee, a physician and entrepreneur best known as a co-founder of Epocrates, the online medical reference program popular among physicians.Dr. Lee, 42, trained as a general internist at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and quickly grew disillusioned. “As I went through my training,” he said, “I saw a growing chasm between the ideals of medicine and what’s actually practiced.”The time and financial pressures of primary-care medicine are alienating many young physicians just out of medical school. By some estimates, there will be a shortage of 45,000 primary-care physicians in the next 10 years as demand grows, and Dr. J. Fred Ralston Jr., president of the American College of Physicians, said that “those primary-care physicians already in practice are under such stress that they are looking for an exit strategy.”In 2005, with Epocrates already a success, Dr. Lee set out to reverse that trend. He began One Medical Group as a solo practice in a small office in San Francisco.Two years later, Dr. Lee, who has a master’s in business administration from Stanford, approached venture capitalists to help him expand; the Silicon Valley firm Benchmark Capital invested several million dollars, its first investment in health care services.Some experts say it remains to be seen whether Dr. Lee’s experiment is sustainable — in particular, whether he can continue to recruit physicians and deliver the same level of care without relying on new venture capital.Nor are they sure the One Medical model can be replicated on a broad scale.“I envision a small number of organizations that will be successful using models like this, and in general I think it’s great,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, an associate professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health. “But whether such models can scale to cover a large swath of the population that is in greater need of health care is unclear.”Still, the wiry and intense Dr. Lee remains bent on reversing what he calls “bizarre habits that have been ingrained” in the world of primary care.When he started One Medical Group, he said, “it was very clear that health care organizations were lacking both the service hospitality mind-set of hotels and the operational efficiency you’d see in manufacturing industries.”Indeed, a One Medical waiting room could be mistaken for a lobby at a boutique hotel or day spa. Patients are greeted at a large, open reception desk, and phones have been relegated to an office in the back.“The people who greet you don’t seem frazzled,” said Bruce Dunlevie, a general partner at Benchmark Capital, “and there aren’t four people sneezing on you.”One Medical physicians say their jobs are like what they envisioned when they first went into the field — before they got their first job in a typical family practice, with its long waits and blizzards of paperwork.Dr. Andrew Diamond, a One Medical physician in San Francisco, says he now sees 16 patients a day, compared with 24 in his previous practice.“The most important thing you can do with that amount of time is build a rapport and make people feel at ease,” he said. “It’s when people are at ease that they can give you get the critical information you need to make a diagnosis.”In his old job, he went on, “when I’d finally see the patient, I would get this very frustrated vibe, which completely got in the way of caring for them.”Dr. Lee’s practice is not the first to offer more personalized primary care. Dr. Richard Baron, a former chairman of the American Board of Internal Medicine, runs Greenhouse Internists in Philadelphia, a practice with seven physicians that offers much of what One Medical offers, but without the fee.And in Portland, Ore., GreenField Health charges a sliding fee based on age (from $195 to $695) that is far below the typical concierge rate, which ranges from $1,000 to $5,000 a year. GreenField’s physicians split their time evenly between office visits and consultations by e-mail or telephone.But One Medical is the first to try to carry out such a model on a large scale. It now has several thousand patients and a growth rate of 50 percent a year, fueled largely by word of mouth. Dr. Lee said he planned to open a third office in Manhattan next month and expand to a third large city next year.Dr. Baron said One Medical had found “a sweet spot for $200 a year, because there has been a failure on the part of the insurance system and the primary-care community to meet this need for patients.”Dr. Jha, at Harvard, wonders just how large the sweet spot is. “One Medical could potentially scale by getting more and more younger people who are relatively healthy,” he said. “But it gets much harder when you have 85-year-olds with multiple medical problems.”Dr. Lee remains confident that his approach is broadly applicable. “We’ve designed the model so that on average we’ll do fine, no matter how often people come in,” he said. “Independent of the people we see, our cost structure is lower, and because it’s lower we can care for any demographic.”To keep overhead low, he has automated wherever he can. Where most primary-care offices have at least four administrative employees per physician, Dr. Lee has cut that ratio in half. Using the One Medical Web site or a new iPhone application, patients can schedule appointments and refill prescriptions, and, in limited cases, originate new ones.Tests can be unnecessary and expensive, and Dr. Philip Baird, who works at One Medical Group in New York, says he orders fewer than he used to. A woman in her 40s came in recently with a terrible headache, unlike any she had ever had. After examining her, Dr. Baird said, he doubted it was serious, but was prepared to order a CT scan to rule out a tumor.As the conversation continued, the woman told him her mother-in-law had just been given a diagnosis of brain cancer. “She admitted she was just really scared,” he said. “She saw I was taking the time, and taking her seriously.”He did not order the scan, and the patient is fine.Mark Hurst, 38, who runs a consulting firm in Manhattan, joined One Medical as a patient after months of having trouble reaching his longtime physician. At One Medical, someone answers the phone right away — even at lunchtime. And no one is put on hold.“I cannot go back to the kind of practice I was at before, that looked, felt, sounded and smelled so different,” he said.Mr. Hurst never told his doctor there that he was leaving, he said: “I wasn’t able to get through to him.”'"
"'11-02-01,'1','For example, in September, the commission, along with the Food and Drug Administration, warned parents not to use sleep positioners intended to keep babies on their backs. Some sleep positioners were marketed to parents as reducing the risks of sudden infant death syndrome, but in fact, the agencies said, the products had caused the suffocation death of 12 babies over the last dozen years or so.Then, in October, the commission warned parents about the dangers of baby monitor cords and urged them to keep the cords away from cribs, bassinets and play yards. Since 2004, the commission has received six reports of babies being strangled by the cords.In December, the commission approved the first new mandatory standards for cribs in nearly two decades. The new rules banned existing designs for drop-side cribs, which have been blamed for entrapping and killing at least 32 babies since 2000, and required more rigorous testing on all cribs.In addition, day care centers will be required to replace over the next two years any cribs that do not comply with the new regulations.Nancy A. Cowles, executive director of Kids In Danger, a nonprofit organization that monitors the safety of children’s products, said the new crib standards were “a huge leap forward,” after years of relative inaction by the safety commission.“It’s the safest in the world,” she said of the new standards.The crackdown on baby sleep products was brought about by a confluence of factors. After an influx of contaminated products, including toys from China, Congress passed the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act of 2008 which gave the commission — long criticized as toothless — more money and authority.As part of the new law, Congress mandated that the commission issue mandatory standards for more than a dozen baby products, including strollers, bassinets, high chairs and cribs, replacing voluntary guidelines that had been the norm. News reports documenting baby deaths from unsafe products, particularly in The Chicago Tribune, put additional pressure on the commission.Since 2007, more than 10 million cribs have been recalled, and Inez Tenenbaum, who was named chairwoman of the commission by President Obama in 2009, said she had made the safety of baby sleep products a top priority, or what she calls the “Safe Sleep” campaign.In an interview, Ms. Tenenbaum said that when she became chairwoman she put together a team of experts to review 10 years of injury and fatality data on cribs. The result was 19 crib recalls and expedited regulations, actions which she says have “cleaned up the marketplace.”She said the commission had also tried to educate parents about how to keep a sleeping baby safe, distributing a video to pediatricians’ offices and hospitals.In the next year, Ms. Tenenbaum said her agency would be writing new regulations for bassinets and toddler beds. She declined to comment on why the commission had not taken more forceful action sooner.Even with a renewed focus on the safety of baby sleep products, Ms. Tenenbaum and others acknowledge that obstacles remain.Though the commission has ordered the recall of millions of cribs and other sleep products, many of them are still being used by parents. In addition, some parents and caregivers continue to put babies to sleep on their stomachs; experts recommend that babies be put to sleep on their backs to prevent against suffocation or sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS.And for all the attention on defective products, the majority of deaths of sleeping infants are caused by suffocation from pillows and other bedding that crowds a crib.A commission report from July found that 531 deaths from 1992 to May 2008 were associated with pillows or cushions, an average of 35 deaths a year. In a vast majority of the cases, the babies were placed to sleep on their stomachs. In half the cases, the infants were put to sleep on top of a cushion or pillow.There also remains some debate about what is safe for babies and what isn’t.Several small manufacturers offer products that promise to reduce the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome, though medical experts and regulators remain dubious. Indeed, the F.D.A. says products that claim to prevent SIDS would be considered medical devices and therefore would require agency approval.For instance, the Web site Eve’s Best claims that the BabeSafe mattress cover it sells has been “100 percent successful in preventing SIDS (crib death) for over 12 years.” The cover is promoted as preventing toxic gas from leaking out of the mattress, one controversial theory for the cause of SIDS.“As a parent, I can tell you that the opinions of ‘government regulators’ as well as the A.A.P. mean absolutely nothing to me,” said Evie Maddox, who runs the Eve’s Best Web site, referring to the American Academy of Pediatrics. She said the cover was so safe that babies could sleep on their stomachs. “There are many well-educated parents out there who feel the same,” she said in an e-mail late last year.Manufacturers of baby products, meanwhile, have challenged allegations that their products are unsafe. Michael Dwyer, executive director of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, said critics frequently claimed that a product was unsafe based on emotion, whereas his members relied on science-based facts.After federal authorities warned parents not to buy sleep positioners, the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association suggested that parents could continue using them, as long as they used them properly.And the association disputes the Dr. Thach’s findings on crib bumpers. Mr. Dwyer said the association commissioned its own study and found that it was often unclear what caused the babies’ death since there were other things crowded in the cribs, like pillows or soft toys. The association recommends that crib bumpers be firm, rather than pillowlike, and be removed from the crib when a baby is able to stand.“Whereas bumpers may have been mentioned as being present in the crib, we really challenge whether the bumper was the cause,” he said.For his part, Dr. Thach said he remained available to talk to regulators and industry officials about his findings. He noted that it was nearly impossible to buy bedding for a crib without bumpers.“They are still selling them,” he said. “People see these in stores and assume they are safe.”'"
"'11-02-01,'1','“This solid report sheds further light on the negative consequences for the E.U. industry of these U.S. subsidies and provides a timely element of balance in this long-running dispute,” said John Clancy, a spokesman for the European Union’s trade commissioner.The W.T.O’s ruling is subject to appeal. But it could bring a protracted battle over aircraft subsidies to a climax and help shift the competitive landscape.Nefeterius Akeli McPherson, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, would not discuss the findings. But she said officials in Washington remained “confident that the W.T.O. will confirm the U.S. view that European subsidies to Airbus dwarf any subsidies that the United States provided to Boeing.”In a case decided last June, the W.T.O. found that Airbus had benefited from four decades of improper subsidies to vault past Boeing to become the top jet builder.That ruling concluded that Airbus had received $15 billion in loans from European governments at below-market interest rates and several billion dollars in grants to produce its six best-selling models, including the A380 superjumbo. It also concluded that it “would not have been possible for Airbus to have launched all these models, as originally designed and at the times it did,” without the subsidies.The ruling on Monday was on a countersuit by Europe contending that Boeing had received nearly $24 billion in research subsidies from federal space and military agencies and in tax breaks from three states.American officials have said the subsidies found to be improper amounted to less than $5 billion.An Airbus spokeswoman, Maggie Bergsma, said the company estimated it had lost as much as $45 billion in sales to Boeing from 2001 and 2006 as a result of the subsidies.Boeing, meanwhile, has asserted that low-interest loans to Airbus have yielded benefits to the European plane maker valued at as much as $200 billion in today’s dollars.Both sides have strained to calculate the largest numbers they can in terms of economic harm. The W.T.O. has not quantified the damages.European officials have focused on contracts that Boeing received from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Defense Department since the late 1970s to research lightweight carbon composite materials similar to those used in the 787 Dreamliner.About half of the 787’s structure is made of the fuel-efficient materials, more than on any other jetliner.With 847 orders worth $90 billion to $100 billion, the 787 — despite a series of manufacturing hiccups — is the fastest-selling plane ever. Boeing is counting on it to move back ahead of Airbus in total sales.The Americans have said that only $2.6 billion of the NASA research money was found to have involved subsidies, compared with $10 billion claimed by Europe.But one person in Europe, who would speak only anonymously since the findings were confidential, said the latest report singled out eight NASA programs and about 130 contracts from 2001-6 as involving some form of illegal subsidies.The bulk of those contracts could be connected to the 787 development program, the person said, though many were also linked to Boeing’s 777 and 737 models.The trade panel pegged the value of the tax advantages from Washington State, Kansas and Illinois at $400 million, though Boeing was to receive more later. Both sides said the panel reiterated an earlier finding that Boeing had received $2.2 billion in export-related aid under a program canceled in 2006.'"
"'11-02-01,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — Intel said on Monday it had stopped shipping a new chipset after discovering a design flaw that might cause 5 percent of the chips to fail over the next three to five years.The loss in revenue and the fixing of the nearly half a million laptop and desktop computers that contain the chipset are expected to cost Intel $1 billion.Intel said that the Series 6, or Cougar Point, chipset, which controls the movement of data to hard drives, DVD drives and monitors, has a failure rate of 5 percent over the typical three- to five-year lifespan of a computer. Over time, some of the connection ports on the chipset can degrade, potentially blocking consumers from reaching their stored data. However, Intel said that the problem did not delete the data and that consumers would still be able to get to it by moving a hard drive to another computer.Computers with the flawed chip, which is for use with second-generation I5 and I7 quad core processors, started shipping on Jan. 9. By the time Intel identified the flaw and stopped production, it had already shipped eight million chipsets, not all of which had been placed in new computers.A modified version of the chipset will start shipping late this month, Intel said. Full production is expected in April.'"
"'11-02-01,'1','Oil prices have been steadily creeping up in recent months to over $90 a barrel, settling on Monday at $92.19. The turbulence in Egypt has made traders skittish about the possibility of shortages of supplies if the Suez Canal is somehow blocked or political tensions spread to nearby Saudi Arabia. But natural gas prices, which are increasingly important to big oil companies, which have been increasing their gas investments in recent years, remain depressed.Oil and gas prices rose again on Monday, with developments in Egypt serving as a reminder that the energy markets were vulnerable to political events in such vital producing countries as Nigeria, Iraq and Iran, which did not suffer major production interruptions in 2010.Rising political tensions mixed with continued growth in economic demand usually means higher energy prices. But the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries still has the capacity to produce more oil in the event of a slowdown in traffic in the Suez Canal or interruptions in production in one or two producing countries.Exxon Mobil’s profit in the quarter was $9.25 billion, or $1.85 a share, compared with $6.05 billion, or $1.27 a share in the period a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.63 a share. Total revenue in the quarter was $105.2 billion, up from $89.8 billion in the quarter a year earlier.For the year, Exxon Mobil made $30.46 billion, or $6.22 a share, compared with $19.28 billion, or $3.98 a share, for 2009. Revenue for 2010 rose to $383 billion from $310 billion the previous year.Exxon Mobil said its production increased 19 percent in the quarter. Gas production in the United States has tripled as a result of the company’s acquisition of XTO Energy and other purchases of companies with shale field operations around the country. Gas now accounts for almost half of the company’s production, up from 43 percent a year ago.Earnings from the company’s upstream business, which includes oil and gas production, rose to $7.48 billion in the quarter from $5.78 billion in the period a year earlier.The company’s refining and marketing business reported earnings of $1.15 billion after a loss a year ago, driven by higher refining margins.“Exxon Mobil remains well positioned to maximize shareholder value,” said David Rosenthal, vice president for investor relations, during a conference call.Shares of Exxon Mobil rose $1.69 , or 2.1 percent, to $80.68 on Monday. Most other oil companies also gained.Chevron, the No. 2 American oil company, reported on Friday that fourth-quarter earnings were 72 percent higher than the preceding year’s. The third-largest, ConocoPhillips, reported that its quarterly profit climbed 46 percent. The earnings reports have been overshadowed by the developments in Egypt, which have caused a sharp upturn in oil prices over the last week.Egypt is not a major oil producer, and rising domestic demand in recent years has converted the country into a net importer.But 1.8 million barrels pass through the Suez Canal every day, and the Sumed pipeline carries another 1.1 million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. The canal is also a major transit route for liquefied natural gas to Europe. There has been no disruption of gas or oil flows so far.Several Western oil companies operate in Egypt, including BP and Apache, contributing to the country’s production of more than 650,000 barrels a day. The most vulnerable is Apache, a middle-size Houston-based oil and gas producer that relies on Egypt for as much as a fifth of its oil production. But so far, the unrest has had little impact on exploration and production since the oil fields are far away from major population centers.“Our people are safe, and we are monitoring the situation,” William A. Mintz, an Apache spokesman, said.'"
"'11-02-01,'1','“We had the initial pullback,” Mr. Bentz said. “But obviously things are still uncertain in the region even though there has been no loss of output or crude movement in the region. The market is building the fear premium back into prices. We had an early correction but prices have rebounded.”Companies affected by the Middle East — like those related to shipping, energy operations and emerging markets — monitored events closely. But sentiment appeared to be in a holding pattern.“The situation is going on still in Egypt, and at least right now shipping continues unabated with shipping through the Suez Canal and Sumed pipeline,” Mr. Bentz said, referring to the Suez-Mediterranean pipeline.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.23 points, or 0.58 percent, to 11,891.93.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed 9.78 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,286.12.The Nasdaq composite index gained 13.19 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,700.08.Energy stocks climbed more than 2 percent, pulling up the broader market.Shares of Massey Energy, the coal company, registered the largest gain, soaring 9.84 percent, or $5.63, to $62.86. Alpha Natural Resources announced on Saturday that it would buy Massey for about $7.1 billion in cash and stock. Shares of Alpha declined 7.17 percent, or $4.15, to $53.73.Exxon Mobil reported a 53 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profit, helped by an improving economy that has lifted demand and crude prices.Profit in the quarter was $9.25 billion, compared with $6.05 billion in the period a year ago. Shares of Exxon rose 2.14 percent, or $1.69, to $80.68.Chrysler said Monday that it ended 2010 with a $199 million loss in the fourth quarter, but it said it would to return to profitability this year with the help of new products.Intel cut its first-quarter revenue forecast by $300 million on Monday because of costs associated with correcting a design flaw that it discovered in a chip. Intel said it did not expect the problem to have a material effect on full-year revenue.Shares of Intel dipped more than 1 percent after the announcement but ended the day unchanged at $21.46.The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose 0.7 percent in December, and nominal personal income rose 0.4 percent, in line with forecasts. Wage and salary income increased by 0.3 percent.While the data was essentially a sideshow to the global events, investors were still watching for signs of whether tentative improvements in the United States economy could be sustained.“You have to keep your eye on it,” said Jason D. Pride, the director of investment strategy for Glenmede. “The U.S. economy has officially transitioned from recovery to expansion.”The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 13/32, to 93 26/32.

"'11-02-02,'1','Until recently, News of the World maintained that the hacking had been limited to a single “rogue reporter,” the paper’s former royals editor, Clive Goodman. Mr. Goodman was jailed in 2007, along with a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, after both pleaded guilty to illegally intercepting the messages of members of the royal household.But the paper’s assertion was undermined last month when it dismissed Ian Edmondson, the paper’s assistant editor for news, after he was apparently linked to phone hacking in court papers in a lawsuit brought by the actress Sienna Miller, who also alleges that her messages were illegally intercepted.Also late last month, Mr. Edmondson’s former boss, Andy Coulson — News of the World’s editor when hacking seems to have been at its height — resigned as Prime Minister David Cameron’s communications director, saying that continued speculation about his possible role in the scandal was interfering with his job. Mr. Coulson continues to say he knew nothing about the hacking.Chris Bryant, a Labour member of Parliament who believes his phone was hacked and has sued to force a judicial investigation of the police’s handling of the case, predicted that with more cases coming up, there would be a flood of new information. “I think there’s a massive scandal still to unfold,” Mr. Bryant said.Ms. Phillips’s lawsuit is just one of many. Among the celebrities suing or considering suing are Ms. Miller; her stepmother, the interior designer Kelly Hoppen; the actor Steve Coogan; a sports agent named Skylet Andrew; and Chris Tarrant, the host of Britain’s “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.” At least a half-dozen more public figures have consulted lawyers and are said to be preparing suits.After being accused of dragging their feet, the Metropolitan Police have reopened their criminal inquiry, and prosecutors are formally investigating the police’s initial response to the case.For years, some reporters at other newspapers have been suspected of hacking messages, but in recent years, only News of the World has been sued by hacking victims.A hearing is scheduled for later this month for Ms. Phillips’s lawsuit. Like her case, the other cases beginning to wend their way through the courts bolster the perception that hacking cellphones was a regular part of News of the World’s news gathering operation, something its executives have denied for the past five years.Evidence in Ms. Phillips’s case also suggests that Mr. Edmondson, the former news editor, had a central role in the hacking operation. The name “Ian” appears in court papers on several photocopied pages from the notebooks of Mr. Mulcaire seized by the police in August 2006.The new documents, people familiar with the case say, support allegations that Mr. Edmondson specifically directed Mr. Mulcaire to gain access to Ms. Phillips’s phone — and may have hacked her phone himself.Mr. Mulcaire and Mr. Edmondson are named as co-defendants in Ms. Phillips’s suit, along with News Group. Reached by telephone, Ms. Phillips, 30, refused to comment or to disclose any details of the suit, saying she did not want to jeopardize her court case.Mark Lewis, the lawyer for Ms. Phillips, also refused to discuss the particulars of the case.Mr. Edmondson, speaking through his lawyers, has denied any wrongdoing.“We’re not making any comment on the current litigation,” said a spokeswoman for News International, speaking on the condition of anonymity according to company policy. Referring to Mr. Edmondson, she added, “News International reiterates that, if presented with evidence of wrongdoing, we will take swift and decisive action — as demonstrated by last week’s dismissal of a senior staff member.”In 2006, when she says her phone was hacked, Ms. Phillips worked for Max Clifford Associates, press agents who mediate between people peddling stories — the sexier the better — and papers willing to pay for them.Such checkbook scoops are the bread and butter of Britain’s sharp-elbowed tabloids, and News of the World, with its deep pockets and aggressive methods, is among the most eager consumers. But at the time, Mr. Clifford was not doing business with the paper, which had angered him by writing unflattering articles about one of his clients.So when Ms. Crisan, a blond, buxom Romanian singer, came forward to talk about how Mr. Fiennes had cheated on his girlfriend with her, Ms. Phillips took the scoop to News of the World’s competitors. She negotiated a deal with The Sunday Mirror and The Mail on Sunday, which together spent £35,000, or about $62,000, for exclusive access to Ms. Crisan.The money bought many titillating details. “He Stripped Me Slowly and Then Said, ‘Keep Your High Heels On,’ ” was the headline in The Sunday Mirror.The Mail on Sunday related how Ms. Crisan irritated Mr. Fiennes by revealing that “Maid in Manhattan” was the only movie she had seen him in. When she then rented “The End of the Affair,” she said, she found to her dismay that Mr. Fiennes had used the same lovemaking techniques with her that he had used with Julianne Moore in the movie. “It made me wonder how genuine it was when he did this with me,” she told the paper.Unbeknown to The Mirror and The Mail, News of the World already had the story, without paying for it. The suit alleges that News of the World found out about Ms. Phillips’s negotiations by hacking into the messages on her phone and on the phones of her contacts, including reporters for The Mail and The Mirror, Ms. Crisan and Mr. Clifford. (News International agreed to pay Mr. Clifford £1 million after he filed his own hacking lawsuit.)Mr. Mulcaire’s notes reveal that News of the World also listened to personal messages left by and for Ms. Phillips and her friends.News of the World managed to track down Ms. Crisan on a train from London to Edinburgh in time to publish an article on the same day as the other papers. The headline in its story, under the bylines of Holly Jarvis, Neville Thurlbeck and Neil McLeod, was “Another Fiennes Mess.”The suit also reveals how in Britain’s dog-eat-dog tabloid world, ethical reporters buy stories, but unethical ones steal them.Brendan Montague, a former freelance journalist who often sold stories to News of the World, claims that the paper hacked into his voice mail messages to spoil his efforts to sell the story of a sex scandal involving a celebrity chef to one of its rivals — thus depriving him of a £30,000 fee.Last year, he said he was not surprised by the hacking, but was stunned by “the fact that this process is so simple, swift and apparently routine,” he wrote in the newspaper The Guardian.'"
"'11-02-02,'1','“It was terrific,” he said, “until the day of the disaster.”Since the day of the disaster — Mr. Madoff’s December 2008 arrest for orchestrating a $65 billion — Mr. Wilpon’s relationship with Mr. Madoff has been generally acknowledged but not well understood. Mr. Wilpon and his family have offered scant details about the friendship, except to indicate they felt deeply betrayed by the scam and were harmed financially.Now, however, a lawsuit against Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz brought by the trustee for victims of Mr. Madoff has suggested the relationship — financially and personally — was deeper than anyone might have suspected. The trustee, , has alleged that the two men’s dealings with Mr. Madoff were extensive and longstanding, and that they went on even after suspicions about Mr. Madoff’s operation were raised, according to two lawyers involved in the case.As a result, according to the lawyers, Mr. Picard has asserted that Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz either knew or should have known that Mr. Madoff’s operation was a potential fraud. Mr. Wilpon, Mr. Katz and their lawyers have refused to comment on the lawsuit, which was filed under seal in December in federal bankruptcy court in .But interviews with current and former associates of Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz, as well as former employees of the club, former employees of Mr. Madoff and others, make it clear that the relationship was substantial and that the role Mr. Madoff played in the financial life of the ball club and the Wilpon and Katz families was pervasive.“The relationship between Fred and Bernie became closer and closer because Bernie was returning more and more to Fred in terms of his investments while Bernie is getting exposure from Fred and Saul,” said Jerry Reisman, a lawyer in Garden City, N.Y., who has represented 10 or so commercial real estate investors who lost a total of some $150 million to Mr. Madoff.“They both relied on one another,” he said. “It was reciprocal, symbiotic. They both relied on each other for money, and Bernie also relied on Fred for contacts.”One former executive with the Mets recalled how it could work:“I remember vividly Madoff’s name being brought up a lot when” the team “would negotiate contracts, particularly with deferments,” said the former executive, who would not be identified because he did not want to harm his career in baseball. “That money would be turned over to Madoff.“And as part of friends and family of the Mets, they offered people the opportunity to invest in Bernie. There was talk about Bernie averaging like 15 percent for the Wilpons. It just seemed too good to be true, but then you think the owner has vetted it.”Frank Cashen, the former general manager of the Mets who built the team that won the 1986 World Series, said it was his understanding that several million dollars of his deferred compensation had been invested with Mr. Madoff, but that he had been paid. Asked whether it was Mr. Wilpon or Mr. Katz who was more likely to push the idea of investing with Mr. Madoff, Mr. Cashen, who stepped down as general manager in 1991, said, “To me, they operated in unison.”The Madoffs and the Wilpons raised their children in Roslyn, N.Y., and their sons were friendly. They traveled together occasionally, according to mutual friends and associates. And the three men — Mr. Wilpon, Mr. Katz and Mr. Madoff — came to support and involve themselves in a number of the same philanthropic endeavors.When Mr. Madoff moved his offices from Manhattan’s financial district, he took up office space in a Midtown building owned in part by Mr. Wilpon’s real estate company.Three days before Mr. Madoff’s arrest, there was a meeting of the board of the Gift of Life, a bone marrow donor registry. It was held in Mr. Madoff’s office, his former secretary said. Mr. Wilpon was there.“There was always Fred Wilpon,” said Eleanor Squillari, Mr. Madoff’s longtime secretary. Mr. Katz, she said, was even more of a presence. And Mr. Wilpon’s son Jeff would stop by to visit with Mr. Madoff’s son, Mark, or call and joke with her on the phone. Mr. Madoff, she said, went to Japan with the Mets in 2000. He brought her back a kimono.Still, Ms. Squillari thought Mr. Madoff was a little more formal around Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz.“Bernie acted differently with Fred than he did with his closer circle of friends — the Shapiros, the Blumenfelds, the Picowers,” she recalled. “They weren’t as chummy. Fred wasn’t part of that clique. Bernie was more businesslike with Fred and Saul.”She and others interviewed said they were convinced Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz did not know about Mr. Madoff’s criminal enterprise. But others interviewed, including two former employees of the Mets, said they were struck, both years ago and in hindsight, by the outsize confidence Mr. Wilpon had in Mr. Madoff. The employees would not be identified because they did not want to embarrass their former bosses, whom they continue to admire.“It was almost like Fred and the others were marveling over it,” one former employee of the club said. “But it was unclear how Madoff would make the returns or where he would park the money.”Another former employee said he was offered a chance to invest with Mr. Madoff by Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz. He said he asked them, “How does Bernie do it?”“He’s smarter than everyone else,” he said he was told. “I remember hearing the conversations about how Bernie returned 18 percent. And the answer was that he was a very smart guy who was creative and knows where to make plays. Fred was expressing admiration for Bernie.”Indeed, the breadth and depth of investing done with Mr. Madoff by the Wilpon and Katz families and their financial holdings, including the Mets, are remarkable. The trustee, in his lawsuit seeking hundreds of millions of dollars from the men, takes aim at roughly 100 accounts held by Mr. Wilpon, Mr. Katz, their families or business operations.According to an analysis of the list of Mr. Madoff’s 15,000 clients, done by Jamie Peppard, a former financial auditor who has studied the Madoff case, more than 500 accounts can be tied to Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz. Mr. Wilpon had at least 17 accounts just under his name, according to her analysis.The former employees of the Mets said substantial aspects of the club’s financial operations seemed to flow through, or wind up with, Mr. Madoff — set up for players, cash generated by sponsorship deals, and more. The team regularly discussed investing deferred money from long-term player contracts in Madoff accounts. was among the players who had their deferred money put with Mr. Madoff, one former employee said.In those cases, the players would agree to take less money up front and be paid over a number of years, earning interest. It appears the Mets would be able to keep any money earned over that agreed rate, and Mr. Madoff regularly produced returns that outdid prevailing interest rates.And when the costs of spiked, the former employee recalled, the Mets began to self insure. They did it by investing premiums with Mr. Madoff, he said.“He was an investment vehicle that existed for Fred and the organization,” one former employee said. He added, “I always wondered why Bernie was smarter than everyone else.”'"
"'11-02-02,'1','The Mets’ hierarchy took its problems to the office of Commissioner Bud Selig on Tuesday, meeting with him to review the tenuous state of the club’s finances.Fred Wilpon, the team’s principal owner; Saul Katz, an owner and the team president; and Jeff Wilpon, Fred’s son and the chief operating officer, met with Selig in a session that had been scheduled before the Mets announced last Friday that they were seeking minority partners to ease their financial burden.Fred Wilpon and Katz are being sued for hundreds of millions of dollars by the trustee representing the victims of Bernard L.

"'11-02-02,'1','Frances Allen, chief marketing officer of Denny’s, said consumers in focus groups were not calling Denny’s a family restaurant.“People think of the brand as a diner, with great comfort food at a great price, and they feel that incredible warmth and incredible connection to the servers,” Ms. Allen said. “There’s a soul to a diner that is very authentic, very warm, very accepting.”Denny’s will spend an estimated $50 million to $60 million in 2011 for the campaign, the first for the brand by Gotham, an agency that is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Denny’s spent $61.1 million on advertising in the first nine months of 2010, compared with $118.8 million spent by Applebee’s, one of its competitors, according to the most recent data available from Kantar Media, a unit of WPP.To play up the diner theme, the “dinersodes,” as the agency refers to the spots, feature counters more prominently than booths, and depict friendly strangers interacting.In another spot, which like others highlights value-menu items costing from $2 to $8, a young man explains to his friend on the next stool: “So we have $10. We can get one thing for $8 and one thing for $2, or one thing for six and one for four.”“Or you could get two things for $4 and one for two,” interjects a man on a nearby stool, gesturing to his plates.“Or five things for two,” says a man at another stool, with five plates.“Or one for six and two for two,” adds a mother with two small children from a booth.The camera returns to the young man who draws his opening hands away from his ears, as if his head were exploding.The new slogan, “America’s diner is always open,” is meant to connote not merely the kitchen never closing, but also to “open being our attitude and philosophy,” said Peter McGuinness, chief executive of Gotham. Actors in the spots represent a broad swath of ethnicities, ages, and socioeconomic classes.“We’re open to whomever you are, and we greet customers with open arms and have an open mind,” said Mr. McGuinness.Harold Butler first opened Danny’s Donuts in Lakewood, Calif., in 1953, changing the name six years later to Denny’s because another chain was called Donut Dan’s.Its signature breakfast combination plate, the Grand Slam, was first introduced in an Atlanta Denny’s in 1977 as an homage to Hank Aaron, who had broken Babe Ruth’s home run record while playing for the Atlanta Braves three years earlier.Today there are more than 1,600 locations across the United States and internationally, with 15 percent owned by the company and the remainder by franchisees.In 2009 and 2010, Denny’s announced in Super Bowl ads that they would serve free Grand Slam breakfasts on a given day the following week. Both years, about two million customers crowded into the restaurant for the free meals, but the chain will neither advertise during the Super Bowl this year nor offer the giveaway.This is not the first time Denny’s has evoked diners. In the late 1990s, it adopted the slogan “America’s original breakfast diner,” and encouraged franchisees to remodel restaurants with stainless steel exteriors, chrome interiors, neon lighting and checkerboard tile floors.When many balked at the cost of such renovations, the company suggested a less expensive option with flourishes like jukeboxes and outfitting servers in bowling shirts. By the end of 2000, 342 Denny’s had adopted this approach, while another 64 made the switch to the steel exteriors, according to Denny’s 2000 annual report.That report projected “systemwide remodeling of Denny’s” to the diner concept “over the next few years,” but the chain abandoned the plan, along with the slogan, a few years later. Today, 55 retro Denny’s diners with the steel exteriors remain, all but one owned by franchisees.Mr. McGuinness, of Gotham, stressed that for the new campaign there is nothing nostalgic about the ads.“We’re talking about a diner not in the physical sense per se but in a much larger sense, more as a symbol and metaphor,” he said.Michael Stern, co-author with his wife, Jane Stern, of “Roadfood,” a guide to local eateries across the country, and co-founder of Roadfood.com, said there was a time when, far from having positive associations, restaurateurs avoided the word “diner” at all costs.“In the ’20s, ’30s, and ’40s, for any restaurant that strove to serve better food the term ‘diner’ was anathema,” Mr. Stern said. “It meant greasy food and the dark and dirty side of eating out.”As for whether the term suited Denny’s, Mr. Stern was dubious.“For most people who think about food at all, when they think of a diner, they think of a place with a unique personality,” Mr. Stern said. “And obviously by definition that cannot be a chain restaurant because it’s not unique.”'"
"'11-02-02,'1','Pfizer, the drug maker, announced plans Tuesday to slash its research spending by as much as $2.9 billion in the next two years, including closing the English labs that invented Viagra.The company stock soared 5.5 percent on Tuesday, to $19.22, helping lead the Dow Jones industrial average 1.25 percent higher, to 12,040.16.Analysts praised Pfizer’s cutbacks and a $5 billion stock buyback plan announced by Ian C.

"'11-02-02,'1','When you see people flipping through e-books on iPads or iPhones, there is a good chance they bought the books through Amazon.com, not Apple.Now, Apple wants to change that.Apple confirmed Tuesday that it would require app developers that sell e-books outside of their iPad and iPhone apps — through a Web site, for example — to also sell the books inside those apps. And purchases that originate in the app must be made through Apple, which keeps a 30 percent cut.Apple said it was newly enforcing an existing rule, one that will force Amazon, Sony, Google and other e-book sellers to change the way their apps work.“We are now requiring that if an app offers customers the ability to purchase books outside of the app, that the same option is also available to customers from within the app,” Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said in a statement.Amazon makes Kindle reading apps for the iPad and iPhone, and those apps now send readers to a Web browser window to make book purchases from Amazon, dodging the Apple fee. Sony said on Monday that Apple had rejected its reading app, which worked the same way.'"
"'11-02-02,'1','The report is a review of an earlier decision denying compensation to the employee, who is not identified. The Workplace Compensation Board of British Columbia, citing privacy laws, would not give information about the worker or his settlement.The dogs were owned by Howling Dogs Tours Whistler, a company controlled by Outdoor Adventures. Ms. Moriarty said that her inspectors had investigated other complaints about Howling Dogs’ treatment of its animals over the past few years. In the period leading up to the Olympics, she added, the company expanded its operations, moving to Whistler from a smaller town.Exactly what prompted the killings in April is not clear from the report.Ms. Moriarty speculated that without the Olympic tourists, Howling Dogs found that it could not afford to carry 300 animals. Graham Aldcroft, the director of operations for Outdoor Adventures, denied that was the case in an e-mail, but he did not offer another explanation.According to the report, a veterinarian refused to kill healthy dogs. Attempts to find them other homes were unsuccessful. Ms. Moriarty said that because sled dogs usually spend their entire lives outdoors, primarily in the company of other animals, they “are not highly adoptable.”The killing went on for two days, and several of the deaths were grisly, the compensation board’s report said. When an initial shot failed to kill a dog that was the mother of the employee’s family pet, she ran around with her “cheek blown off and her eye hanging out” until she was felled by a rifle with a scope, according to the report. The bullet also penetrated another dog, which was not supposed to be part of the kill and which suffered for about 15 minutes before dying.Another dog, left for dead for 20 minutes, emerged from a mass grave only to be shot again, the report said. The employee said he eventually wrapped his arms in foam padding after the frightened dogs began attacking him.Under Canadian criminal law it is not illegal to kill dogs using a gun, provided it is done without undue suffering. Ms. Moriarty’s officers may dig up the mass grave after the spring thaw.Outdoor Adventures said in a statement that it had known about the cull, “but it was our expectation that it was done in a proper, legal and humane manner.” The company said that it learned otherwise only on Friday, when it received a copy of the compensation board’s report. The company said that new policies were introduced several months ago to prevent another mass shooting.The man who shot the dogs remains an employee, the company said.'"
"'11-02-02,'1','ACROSS the United States, artisanal pizza joints are opening faster than Natalie Portman movies. But inside those imported ovens, pepperoni — by far America’s most popular pizza topping — is as rare as a black swan.In these rarefied, wood-fired precincts, pizzas are draped with hot soppressata and salami piccante, and spicy pizza alla diavola is popular. At Boot and Shoe Service in Oakland, Calif., there is local-leek-and-potato pizza. At Paulie Gee’s in Brooklyn, dried cherry and orange blossom honey pizza. At Motorino in the East Village, brussels sprouts and pancetta. But pepperoni pizza? Geddoutahere!What, exactly, is pepperoni? It is an air-dried spicy sausage with a few distinctive characteristics: it is fine-grained, lightly smoky, bright red and relatively soft. But one thing it is not: Italian.“Purely an Italian-American creation, like chicken Parmesan,” said John Mariani, a food writer and historian who has just published a book with the modest title: “How Italian Food Conquered the World.” “Peperoni” is the Italian word for large peppers, as in bell peppers, and there is no Italian salami called by that name, though some salamis from Calabria and Apulia are similarly spicy and flushed red with dried chilies. The first reference to pepperoni in print is from 1919, Mr. Mariani said, the period when pizzerias and Italian butcher shops began to flourish here.Pepperoni certainly has conquered the United States. Hormel is the biggest-selling brand, and in the run-up to the Super Bowl this Sunday, the company has sold enough pepperoni (40 million feet) to tunnel all the way through the planet Earth, said Holly Drennan, a product manager.Michael Ruhlman, an expert in meat curing who is writing a book on Italian salumi, doesn’t flinch from calling pepperoni pizza a “bastard” dish, a distorted reflection of wholesome tradition. “Bread, cheese and salami is a good idea,” he said. “But America has a way of taking a good idea, mass-producing it to the point of profound mediocrity, then losing our sense of where the idea comes from.” He prefers lardo or a fine-grained salami, very thinly sliced, then laid over pizza as it comes out of the oven rather than cooked in the oven.But some of the most respected meatheads in the country are beginning to take pepperoni seriously.“I can’t make salami fast enough as it is, and now the pizza chefs are begging me for pepperoni,” said Paul Bertolli, founder and self-proclaimed “curemaster” of Fra’ Mani, the salumi specialist in Oakland. Mr. Bertolli is in a research-and-development phase on a pepperoni, because of demand from expert pizzaiolos like Chris Bianco of Bianco in Phoenix and Craig Stoll of Delfina in San Francisco. “There’s nothing quite like that spicy, smoky taste with pizza,” he said.Mr. Bertolli believes that pepperoni’s smokiness, beef content and fine grind are more characteristic of German sausages like Thüringer, suggesting a possible Midwestern connection. “I’ve never seen a smoked sausage anywhere in Italy,” he said.Normally, Mr. Bertolli confines himself to products and processes that are almost painfully traditional, and a nose-to-tail ethos that he applies to the pasture-raised, antibiotic-free pigs he buys. (Except the ears; Mr. Bertolli says they have too much crunch even to be used in headcheese.) For Mr. Bertolli’s pepperoni, he will avoid the nitrites used by commercial producers in favor of celery juice, an effective and natural preservative, though it does not produce the same appetizing color in the finished product as the chemical versions.No one is claiming that pepperoni is difficult to find. Large producers like Volpi, Patrick Cudahy (makers of the No-Char line used by many pizzerias in the Northeast), Columbus and Ezzo are considered top-of-the-line among pizzeria owners. Opinion is divided on whether a slice of the stuff should curl when cooked, or lie flat. Some say that the little cups of cooked pepperoni perform an important job: confining the spicy, molten fat from pouring out over the surface of the pizza.'"

"'11-02-02,'1','“I often think of extramusical things,” Ms. Wolfe said of her approach to composing, “but I rarely think so much about narrative. Part of the reason I got interested in music is because it was beyond words. When I got this commission from the Munich Chamber Orchestra, I thought, ‘Great — it’s the next step after the string quartets.’ And a few weeks later, they called and said, ‘Could you make this go with a folk tale or a fairy tale?’ It was a foreign concept for me, so I said, ‘Let me think about it.’“I was going to be open-minded, but I didn’t want to be boxed in. And while I was thinking about it, I remembered this song that I heard in college, a track from a Pentangle album. And I wound up, to my surprise, not just using the gestalt of the song, but really following the emotions and the arc of the story.”Both “Cruel Sister” and “Fuel” are couched in the rhythmically propulsive post-Minimalist style that drives most of Ms. Wolfe’s music, though both also have haunting dramatic touches. It is easy to hear the influence of Steve Reich in her work, as she happily admits. Mr. Reich suggests that these days the influence goes both ways.“I get a general feeling that what she and Michael and David have done was certainly influenced by what I did earlier on,” Mr. Reich said of Ms. Wolfe and her Bang on a Can colleagues, Mr. Gordon and Mr. Lang. “But what’s interesting is that they’ve come up with techniques I haven’t thought of, and which I sometime may steal from them. I was listening to ‘Cruel Sister’ and admiring her use of the open strings of the fiddle, which give the piece a kind of folk feeling. And when that open-fifths sound is replaced by extreme clusters, it’s very effective. I wouldn’t do that. I mean, I haven’t done it. But you know what? I’ll put it away for a rainy day.”Since “Cruel Sister,” Ms. Wolfe has looked to other folk songs for inspiration. In “Steel Hammer” (2009), composed for the Bang on a Can players and the Trio Mediaeval, the (mostly) early-music vocal group, she drew on dozens of variants of “John Henry” and included some of the instruments she played during her years as a college folk singer in the scoring: a mountain dulcimer, for example. This time she quoted from the melody’s refrain but only obliquely. “With a Blue Dress On” (2010), for a singing violinist and eight recorded fiddle tracks, is also based on a folk tune, and she said that the piece she is writing for Ethel will have folk roots too.Synthesizing popular and classical influences has always been part of Ms. Wolfe’s style. She came to it naturally and almost by accident. Though she played the piano growing up in a small town in Pennsylvania, Ms. Wolfe had gravitated toward rock and folk music by the time she enrolled at the University of Michigan. She had no intention of studying music formally. But a friend talked her into taking Creative Musicianship, a class taught by Jane Heirich, who changed her life.“She was an amazing teacher, who played us all kinds of things: Dave Brubeck, Terry Riley, you name it,” Ms. Wolfe said. “She was very open and didn’t categorize things. It was all music. And that was a wonderful way to start looking at all kinds of new ideas. That was freshman year. And after that I took almost nothing but music courses.”After completing her bachelor’s degree in Michigan, Ms. Wolfe continued her studies at Yale, where she studied with Martin Bresnick, and at Princeton. She met Mr. Gordon during a visit to New York in 1982, and they married in 1984. By then Mr. Gordon had introduced her to Mr. Lang, and in 1987 the three composers formed Bang on a Can and presented the first of their marathons, which for a time grew into a short new-music festival.The Bang on a Can All-Stars began after the organization started getting invitations to present concerts outside New York. The composers oversee the ensemble’s programming and occasionally write for it. And now and then the three collaborate on a score, usually a full-evening staged work. So far, the joint projects include “The Carbon Copy Building” (1999), “Lost Objects” (2001), “Shelter” (2005) and “Water” (2008).“I remember telling friends, in the late ’80s or early ’90s,” the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen said in a recent telephone interview, “that of the founders of Bang on a Can, Julie looked the most quiet and polite, but her music was actually the sharpest and most aggressive of the three composers.”Her relationship with her colleagues, she said, is noncompetitive: a good thing, since she is married to one of them, and they have two children.“When Michael and I were younger,” she said, “we would attend performances of each other’s works, and it was weird, because when we’d meet people, one of us would be the composer, and the other would be the spouse. It would happen both ways, and neither of us is hugely egotistical, so it didn’t bother us. But that doesn’t happen often now. I love being married to another composer. We’re always playing each other music and giving each other feedback. In that sense, it’s a real friendship, a friendship about music.”'"
"'11-02-02,'1','Over the last five years, on the other hand, paid a total tax rate of just 4.5 percent, according to Capital IQ. paid 6.3 percent. And the list goes on: paid 7 percent; , 7.6 percent; , 14.3 percent.Economists have long pleaded for an overhaul of the corporate tax code, and both and Republicans now say they favor one, too. But it won’t be easy. Companies that use loopholes to avoid taxes don’t mind the current system, of course, and they have more than a few lobbyists at their disposal.The official position of the Business Roundtable, one of the most important corporate lobbying groups, is telling. The Roundtable says it supports corporate tax reform. But it actually favors only a reduction in the tax rate. The group refuses to say whether it also favors a reduction of loopholes. In effect, the Roundtable wants a tax cut for its members regardless of how much the tax code is simplified — or whether the budget deficit grows.The tax filings of companies, like those of individuals, are confidential. In their public reports to investors, however, companies are required to list something called “cash taxes paid” — the total amount of corporate income tax they paid that year, be it to foreign governments, the United States government or state and local governments.This number varies significantly from year to year, depending on how many loopholes a company qualifies for. So looking at a single year’s number is often misleading. But in a 2008 academic paper, three accounting professors — Scott Dyreng of Duke, Michelle Hanlon of and Edward Maydew of the — suggested a new method for analyzing corporate tax avoidance.It compares cash taxes paid over several years — like five, as in the analysis for The Times — to pretax earnings over that same period. The accounting experts I interviewed called it the best available method for looking at corporate taxes.Some obvious patterns emerge. Companies that lost large amounts of money in previous years can subtract these subsequent losses from their initial profits and avoid taxes until they’re turning a consistent profit. Yahoo falls into this category. Of all the reasons to have a low tax rate, this one may be the most defensible, economists say.Other companies are able to avoid taxes by spending large sums on new equipment or buildings. Such spending can often be deducted. Southwest Airlines, for instance, has bought a lot of planes in the last five years. Several energy companies with tax rates below 2 percent, like NextEra, Xcel and , have likewise been expanding.A third group of companies simply seems to have become expert at avoiding taxes. When the three accounting professors analyzed more than 2,000 companies, they found big variations in tax rates within almost every subset of companies. Companies in the same industry often paid very different rates, even when they were similar in size.G.E. is so good at avoiding taxes that some people consider its tax department to be the best in the world, even better than any law firm’s. One common strategy is maximizing the amount of profit that is officially earned in countries with low tax rates.Carnival pays so little tax partly because of a provision that lets some shipping companies legally incorporated overseas ( , in Carnival’s case) avoid taxes. The fact that Carnival’s executives sit in and or that many passengers board in , , Miami, New York and doesn’t matter. Nor does the fact that Carnival isn’t paying much tax in Panama.Companies that pay relatively high rates tend to be those that are not expanding rapidly and that are not as ingenious as G.E., at least on taxes. The average total tax rate for the 500 companies over the last five years — again, including federal, state, local and foreign corporate taxes — was 32.8 percent. Among those paying more than the average were , , , , , and .The problem with the current system is that it distorts incentives. Decisions that would otherwise be inefficient for a company — and that are indeed inefficient for the larger economy — can make sense when they bring a big tax break. “Companies should be making based on their commercial potential,” as Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at , says, “not for tax reasons.”Instead, airlines sometimes buy more planes than they really need. Energy companies drill more holes. Drug companies conduct research with only marginal prospects of success.Inefficiencies like these slow economic growth, and they are the reason that both conservatives and liberals criticize the corporate tax code so harshly. , the Republican Senate leader, says it hurts job creation. Mr. Obama, in his State of the Union address, said that the system “makes no sense, and it has to change.”A lot of economists agree. Then again, any system that creates as many winners as this one won’t be changed easily.'"
"'11-02-02,'1','BAGHDAD — Iraqi security forces controlled directly by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki continue to hold and to torture detainees in secret jails despite his vows last year to end such practices, according to a statement from Human Rights Watch released Tuesday.The statement renewed longstanding criticism of Mr. Maliki that he has violated the Constitution by having some security forces in charge of pursuing terrorists report directly to his office. About 280 detainees are being held at Camp Justice, a military base in northern Baghdad, with no access to lawyers or their families, according to the report. They are being held by brigades that are supposed to report to the Defense Ministry, it said.After the disclosure of a secret prison last year, Mr. Maliki said the detainees would be transferred to the Ministry of Justice, under which they were expected to receive proper legal representation. But Human Rights Watch, citing internal government documents and interviews conducted in Iraq with government officials and detainees, said that this has not occurred. An official for the Minster of Justice, Busho Ibrahim, disputed that assertion.“This news is incorrect, and all the prisons in Camp Justice belong to our ministry and under our authority as well,” Mr. Ibrahim said. “This false news is to discredit the reputation of Iraqi government.”He added: “Why would Maliki have special prisons? Isn’t he the leader of Iraq? The information is incorrect and there no forces or detainees being tortured.”'"
"'11-02-02,'1','The tally for 2010 is about the same, with a total of 19 deals signed in eight buildings, including three at 510 Madison.But many of those deals took place late in the year, reducing the inventory of available space by 23 percent in buildings that Jones Lang LaSalle considers “trophy” properties — and potentially capable of capturing rents of $100 or more per square foot. Those 52 Midtown buildings tend to be located around the Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue, in what is known as the Plaza district, and many have views of Central Park.They may seem more like country clubs than workaday office buildings, with grand lobbies and elevators, tight security and amenities like upscale restaurants to attract financial companies for whom image and high profit margins go hand in hand.Those 52 buildings had a vacancy rate of 10.1 percent, compared with 13 percent in 2009, and are poised to outperform the office market in general this year, said Cynthia Wasserberger, a managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle.Much of that has to do with the recovery of the financial sector and its endless race to trade up into more prestigious office space, she said. With office rents still well below their 2008 peak, landlords are still offering concessions to offset the cost of moving. That may encourage financial tenants looking to upgrade, Ms. Wasserberger said.“It sounds kind of funny to say tenants would be taking advantage of a $100 rent,” she said, “But a lot of tenants with leases up for expiration may find it justifiable to say, ‘I’d rather lock in today at $100 a foot, knowing this building was leasing at $150 or $180 a foot in 2008, so it’s a relative bargain.’ ”Several towers were developed or rehabilitated in the market frenzy to achieve steep rents, but 510 Madison is the only new office building in the Plaza district.“It’s an extremely central and rare location to be able to build a brand-new building,” Mr. Amrich said. “That alone sets us apart.”While 510 Madison’s Central Park views are limited to the top floors on the northwest side, the tower, which was designed by Mr. Macklowe, SLCE Architects and Moed de Armas & Shannon Architects, has column-free interior space, which allows financial companies to create trading floors, as well as 10-foot ceilings with floor-to-ceiling windows in a glass facade.Newer buildings can be built with amenities that draw financial companies. For instance, 510 Madison will have a top-notch fitness club with a 50-foot pool, a large landscaped and furnished terrace, a private dining area for tenants and their clients and a generator that can provide power in a blackout.Boston Properties paid $287 million for the 350,000-square-foot office tower and acquired a junior loan on the property for $22.5 million. Besides the three leases signed in 2010 with Senator Investment Group, Chieftain Capital Management and Valinor Capital Partners, Boston Properties also managed to retain the Jay Goldman & Company hedge fund, which Mr. Macklowe signed in 2007 at $135 a foot, at the same rent but on a higher floor. Floors 25 through 28 have been leased, with the exception of 6,000 square feet still available on the 27th floor, Mr. Amrich said.The hedge funds, private equity groups and wealth management firms that typically seek expensive space tend to be smaller companies, requiring perhaps 5,000 to 25,000 square feet as opposed to 100,000 square feet or more, Ms. Wasserberger said. For that reason, if 510 Madison continues to lease as anticipated, it may account for many more leasing deals of $100 or more per square foot in 2011.“If the numbers were 19 deals in 2010, I bet we see closer to 40 in 2011,” she said. “The reason is 510 Madison is now open for business. It’s a 30-story building, and those are going to be some partial- and single- and double-floor tenants, so that could account for a sizable number of deals.”Of course, the higher the floor the higher the rent, brokers said.“There’s always that premium for the tower view,” said Alan Desino, an executive managing director of the commercial brokerage Colliers International. “Is there a building right now anywhere in Manhattan that on the base floor you’re going to pay $100 a foot? Probably not.”A large part of 510 Madison’s allure is its location in the Plaza district. Another banner office tower developed speculatively, 11 Times Square, was also hoping for $100-per-foot rents, but its location on Eighth Avenue near the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has been a detractor, Mr. Desino said. So far, the law firm Proskauer Rose is the building’s lone large tenant.Still, the right kind of building — for example One Bryant Park on Avenue of the Americas, known as the Bank of America tower — delivered at the right time can create a desirable submarket around it, even driving up rents in neighboring buildings, he said.“One Bryant Park is a phenomenal building,” Mr. Desino said. “Just due to the efficiency and space you have floor-to-ceiling and, let’s face it, the views are phenomenal. It’s been able to achieve $100 rents in an area that, three years ago, I would have said, not a chance.”One Bryant Park also happens to be certified by the United States Green Building Council, as does 11 Times Square, and 510 Madison is pursuing that certification. A recent study by the CoStar Group, a real estate information company in Washington, showed landlords could achieve an average premium on rents of 5 to 10 percent nationally if a building was certified as environmentally friendly.Even if it does not guarantee higher rents, that certification carries a certain cachet, said Christopher Macke, a senior real estate strategist at the CoStar Group. “Maybe you don’t get the premium rent, but you get the tenant, and the other guy doesn’t,” he said. “Put another way, in a green building, you have a higher absorption rate than one that’s not green.”'"
"'11-02-02,'1','Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said last week that inflation that reflects rising prices for imported commodities “can no longer be ignored.”The rhetoric has worked, so far. The euro has risen 7 percent against the dollar since Jan. 19 as investors read statements like Mr. Bini Smaghi’s to mean that the central bank could strike sooner than expected. A stronger euro blunts the effect of rising prices for oil and other commodities, which are traditionally priced in dollars.But most analysts doubt that the European Central Bank would dare to raise rates before September, and perhaps not until next year.“They are just trying to sound tough so as not to have to raise rates,” said Marie Diron, an analyst in London who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young.“It would be a mistake for the E.C.B. to raise rates anytime soon,” Ms. Diron added. “The economy is still very fragile and they recognize that themselves.”Mr. Trichet has blamed the spike in inflation on higher energy prices. He has said that he expected the pressure to let up later this year. European factories are still not operating at capacity, and unemployment in most of the Continent remains above levels seen before the financial crisis. In addition, demand by companies for credit remains weak.All those factors mean that the European Central Bank can leave rates where they are for the time being. “There is still a lot of slack in the economy,” said Eric Chaney, chief economist at AXA, a French insurance and investment management company.The central bank will come under much more pressure, though, if higher prices for food or fuel feed into prices of other goods, prompting workers to demand higher wages. There are already signs of a tighter labor market in Germany. The number of unemployed people fell by 270,000 in January from a year earlier, to 3.35 million, the Federal Labor Agency said Tuesday. While German wages have not started rising to alarming levels yet, Mr. Chaney said, “this is something that is on the radar screen.”The central bank’s other big problem is that it continues to prop up ailing European banks by providing unlimited low-interest loans. The European Central Bank is also granting de facto aid to Greece, Portugal and Ireland by buying their bonds on the open market as a way of stabilizing prices.Mr. Trichet has maintained that these so-called nonstandard measures are separate from interest-rate policy and do not preclude a tighter monetary policy. But analysts are skeptical, saying that the European Central Bank will have to wind down the measures before it can risk a rate increase.Mr. Cailloux of the Royal Bank of Scotland questioned whether a rise in official interest rates would have much effect on market rates at the moment. The special measures upset the usual mechanisms that the European Central Bank uses to control market rates.Last week, the central bank bought no government bonds, possibly a sign it was trying to end the purchases, which it began in May to prevent a sell-off of Greek debt. Before last week, the central bank had spent 76.5 billion euros ($105.8 billion) since May to buy bonds.The central bank is also expected to announce steps in coming months to wean banks from their dependence on cheap central bank loans. Both steps would give it more leeway to raise rates.MADRID — Standard & Poor’s affirmed Spain’s AA credit rating Tuesday, reflecting the government’s resolve to cut its deficit and enact measures to make its struggling economy more productive.S.& P. said, however, that Spain’s rating, a high investment grade, would remain under pressure for months to come from the high level of private sector indebtedness and 20 percent unemployment. There is the “possibility of a downgrade if Spain’s fiscal position deviates materially, in our opinion, from the government’s budgetary targets for 2011 and 2012,” said Marko Mrsnik, an analyst for S.& P.'"
"'11-02-02,'1','“You know what, he’s the president,” Vegas said, laughing. “He does whatever he feels like. I just got to focus on being a golfer and doing my thing.”Several years ago, Chávez closed three courses in the Vegas family’s home state, Monagas. All were essentially clubs for workers in the nation’s wealthy oil industry. Vegas’s father, Carlos, who at one time worked as a caddie and later became a food concessionaire to two of the clubs, decided his son would have to leave Venezuela if he were to pursue golf seriously.Vegas was 17 and spoke no English when he was separated from his parents and three brothers. He was eventually placed in the care of Franci Betancourt, a Venezuelan golf pro, and his wife, Alba, who had settled in Houston. Under the tutelage of the Betancourts and Kevin Kirk, a prominent golf instructor in Texas who had been taught by Franci, Vegas learned the language and American culture, and he worked on his game. He went on to graduate from the University of Texas with a degree in kinesiology, to make the second-tier Nationwide Tour and ultimately to reach the PGA Tour.“All of a sudden, his father didn’t have a job; the kids didn’t have anywhere to play golf,” Jonathan Coles, an eight-time Venezuelan national champion golfer who is from Cambridge, Mass., said of Vegas’s departure. “Everything in their family that had been built around golf was just taken away from one day to the next.“The old man told me that when he told Jhonattan, the kid thought it was totally impossible,” continued Coles, the retired chairman of the Venezuelan food company Mavesa who also served as minister of agriculture from 1990 to 1993 under President Carlos Andrés Pérez. “He didn’t speak a word of English and thought he was going to have a terrible time going to school.”Vegas acknowledged that his transition was not an easy one. There were days, he said, when school, golf and English studies took him well into the night.The long climb to the verge of stardom has seemingly fashioned Vegas into a golfer who is mentally tough and outwardly cheerful, a single-minded, focused individual who appreciates his good fortune and makes time for just about everyone he meets.“He is a very special kid,” said Betancourt, who had been the head pro at two of the courses closed by Chávez. “He is unique.”Vegas has ramrod-straight posture, which makes him look taller than his 6 feet 2 inches. His shoulders are wide and thickly muscled, and when he throws them back as he walks, he creates an imposing presence even heftier than his 230 pounds.Embracing the made-for-Hollywood sobriquet Johnny Vegas, he exhibits the kind of joy that the young, unburdened Tiger Woods, his third-round playing partner Saturday at Torrey Pines, used to bring to the course.The similarities between Woods and Vegas are striking. They share a love of competition, of playing under intense pressure and of shotmaking. The differences are obvious, too. Vegas smiles his way around the course, makes more eye contact and sometimes even laughs after the occasional mis-hit. Last weekend he waved to his fans in the gallery from South America and Venezuela.“It’s because he’s enjoying the game, even when he hits it bad,” Betancourt said. “That’s not common. I would say that’s one attribute that is something that is really personal. You can see it in the way he walks between the ropes. He has that look that says: ‘Well, sir, here I am. I guess I belong here.’ ”Vegas had no trouble making a case for his belonging on the Tour during the pressure of the final round Sunday when, stalking Watson, he tried to read a long, difficult putt at the sloping green at the par-3 11th. Needing to bleed his first putt to the very edge of a slope, Vegas did not hit the ball hard enough and left it sitting on the ridge an embarrassing 8 feet from the hole. He smiled playfully and shrugged, then went on to miss the par putt, a crucial three-putt at that juncture. And yet the smile said much about his appreciation for the breaks of the game, good and bad.“I’ve been playing great golf,” he said. “I’m enjoying the moment, and enjoying everything about the PGA Tour so far. It’s been a dream come true.”As he said this, the ripples had barely cleared from the pond in front of the 18th green, where his ball lay in the depths. Trailing Watson by a stroke, he had tried a high-risk shot from the rough with a 5-iron from 217 yards. The shot very likely cost him second place and maybe $300,000.“Even when I hit the ball in the water on 18, I went, Oh well, let’s see if we can make it now,” Vegas said.This ability to refocus calmly impressed Kevin Sutherland, who played alongside Woods and Vegas on Saturday. After praising every aspect of Vegas’s game, Sutherland stopped, turned and said, “What I liked best about him was his demeanor.”The demeanor did not change even when Vegas talked about having spoken with Chávez, and what he hopes will come about as a result of the chat: perhaps a friendlier attitude toward the sport in the presidential palace so that some Venezuelan youngster playing baseball might think of switching to golf, as Vegas did when he was 12 and a power-hitting third baseman.“The president congratulating me; that means a lot,” Vegas said, adding, “Just to have the support of your country, it’s huge.”That support was in evidence at Torrey Pines. An all-sports television network came here from Caracas to video the star who Mike Perez, the executive producer, said was “right there with Omar Vizquel and Andres Galarraga,” the baseball players. Another television personality, Jeanette Vargas Lovelle of Hoyo 19, who did a three-part series on Vegas before the season, said in an e-mail, “In effect, Jhonattan is becoming a kind of a national hero.”That is a long way from a scared 17-year-old who immigrated to Houston nine years ago. If the country he left is leaning that way about a golfer, can the president be far behind?'"
"'11-02-02,'1','Mr. Oravec offered a basic lesson in meteorology to explain weather that transcends the word “inclement.” A cold air mass from Canada has become entrenched across the north-central United States, while storms in the Mississippi Valley have been drawing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Cold air plus moisture equals snow, and ice, and a new year that we are still ringing in with shovel scrapes against pavement.For the first part of Tuesday, much of the country girded. In Illinois and Missouri, for example, the Ameren utility company shifted into what it called “storm mode,” preparing for downed power lines by assembling more than 2,300 external linemen from other states; there were more than 35,000 power failures in Illinois by late Tuesday afternoon. And in Chicago, emergency-management workers braced for a storm that might rival the blizzard of 1967, when 23 inches of snow paralyzed the city for days.Chicago and St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit and hundreds of other communities prepared for what they knew was coming, based on reports coming out of Tulsa, where City Hall shut down, the Hard Rock Casino experienced a partial roof collapse and firefighters had to rescue people from stranded public buses. The fast-falling snow and the strong winds transformed parts of the city into a municipal parking lot.“There are hundreds and hundreds of cars stranded in the city, from private to emergency vehicles,” Paul Strizek, of the city’s Public Works Department, told The Tulsa World. “Even with four-wheel drive, people are having difficulty getting around.”The Tulsa World, meanwhile, announced that it would not be able to deliver the newspaper on Wednesday — for the first time since it began publication in 1905. “We could print it, but we can’t deliver it,” said Joe Worley, the executive editor.Mr. Worley said that the paper’s Web site would continue to be updated throughout Wednesday, but added, “We’re just not used to snow over a foot deep.”In Kansas City, Mo., people spent the day the way people do when trying to decide whether to believe reports of imminent bad weather. They cleaned out the Home Depot of salt, scrapers and shovels, stocked up on milk and debated the trustworthiness of weather forecasts.Near downtown, two bundled-up homeless men emerged from under a bridge, carrying their possessions in plastic bags. One said he planned to sleep outdoors again on Tuesday night; the other man said he was not so sure.By dusk, though, a heavy and steady snowfall blanketed Missouri, ending any debate about the storm’s impact and raising the hope that the two homeless men had found proper shelter.Conditions became so hazardous that the Missouri Department of Transportation took the unprecedented step of shutting down the state’s entire stretch of Interstate 70, the 250-mile main artery that runs from St. Louis to Kansas City.“I can’t tell you how many slide-offs we’ve had,” said Capt. Greg Kindle of the Missouri State Patrol. “We’re at the point where we’re not towing them out. We’re just giving them a ride and leaving the car till it clears up.”By midafternoon the storm had made it to Chicago, a city that tends to see snowstorms as inadequate tests of its stoicism. In this case, at least, the city benefited from the advance warning. Almost organically, the evening rush hour moved up a few hours. Restaurants and parking garages closed early, and the working denizens of downtown fled with the giddiness of schoolchildren granted early recess and anticipating a day off on Wednesday.Everywhere, cabs were packed, although their drivers were not always calm.Mahrous El Gamal, whose windshield wipers could not keep up with the slushy snow, said the anxious chatter of passengers desperate to get home had convinced him to call it a day.“They’re saying it’s going to be remembered for the rest of our lives?” he said. “They scare the hell out of me with that. That’s it. I’m done.”'"
"'11-02-02,'1','AMMAN, Jordan — King Abdullah II of Jordan fired his government on Tuesday after weeks of demonstrations challenging his regime, part of a wave of demands of public accountability sweeping the Arab world that has brought throngs of demonstrators into the streets of Egypt.The royal palace announced that the king had dismissed Prime Minister Samir Rifai and replaced him with Marouf al-Bakhit, who has served before in the post and is a former general and a onetime ambassador to Israel and Turkey widely viewed as clean of corruption.Changing cabinets is not new for King Abdullah. In his 12 years on the throne, he has done so eight times. But this was the first time that he had done so in reaction to public pressure, seeking to undermine a growing protest movement across a broad spectrum of society and to pre-empt further unrest. It came after four weeks of unusual public demonstrations.The palace statement said Mr. Bakhit would have the task of “taking practical, swift and tangible steps to launch a real political reform process, in line with the king’s version of comprehensive reform, modernization and development.”In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Bakhit added that his main objective would be to “take tangible steps to social, political and economic reform and give priority to dialogue with all segments of society.”His predecessor was criticized as dealing primarily with technocrats and business leaders, while failing to consult with trade unions and the Muslim Brotherhood and to address the concerns of citizens.With tens of thousands of Egyptians packing city squares daily to demand that President Hosni Mubarak end his nearly 30-year autocracy, the message was spreading across the region.In Yemen, the government, fearing new protests, offered concessions to the opposition, which promised to call a demonstration every Thursday until March, when it will evaluate whether its demands have been met. In Syria, calls for a “day of rage” this weekend against the government of President Bashar al-Assad were spreading on Facebook, which is banned in the country, and on Twitter.And in Tunisia, the country that set off the regional unrest after protests toppled the government, the army was called in to calm fears of chaos.Gangs had been rampaging through schools in the capital, Tunis, and a synagogue was set on fire in the southern city of Gabes, according to news agency reports. A United Nations mission sent to Tunis to investigate the violence reported that at least 219 people had been killed in the unrest and 510 had been injured, The Associated Press said.The main Syrian protest page on Facebook urged people to protest in Damascus on Feb. 4 and 5 in “a day of rage,” whose goal was to “end the state of emergency in Syria and end corruption.” Various political factions issued statements calling for change.“Oh, Syrian people, isn’t it time for you to shout a big no?” the Muslim Brotherhood said. “No to oppression, corruption, theft and humiliation. No to poverty, hunger and unemployment.”The democratic Islamist movement, in calling for participation in Saturday’s protest, said, “We don’t want a chaotic revolution; we want a peaceful uprising in which you raise your voice peacefully and in a civilized way.”About 200 students in Sudan protested outside Al Nileen University in Khartoum, but were beaten back by squads of police officers, Reuters reported. Opposition figures blame the government for rising food prices and a crackdown on press freedom.And the emir of Qatar, scheduled to visit South America later this month, postponed his trip because of regional tensions, a statement from his office said.In the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority announced it would hold local elections, postponed last year, “as soon as possible.” The Palestinian cabinet, led by Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, said in a statement that elections would take place simultaneously in the West Bank and in Gaza, and that the government would set a date at its meeting next week. It was not clear whether the government’s rival Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza, would cooperate.The authority blamed Hamas for upsetting planned local elections last June, but critics of the authority said the reason for the cancellation was disarray within Fatah, the faction that dominates in the West Bank.In an interview in his office in Ramallah, Mr. Fayyad said the sense that Palestinians, like Egyptians and people in the rest of the region, wanted to move ahead quickly on democratic reforms had helped spur the setting of elections.In Jordan, the reaction to the change of government was mixed. Many said they were relieved, but the Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, rejected the move as insufficient given the need for greater political freedom.Jordan is a highly literate and largely stable country, with well-developed security and intelligence operations. But it has a fundamental vulnerability in the large number of Palestinians here. Refugees arrived in large numbers from the West Bank and Jerusalem after the war in 1967, and more arrived from Kuwait after President Saddam Hussein of Iraq invaded that country in 1990. They and their descendants make up nearly half the country’s population of six million.Recent demonstrations in Jordan were the first serious challenge to the rule of King Abdullah, a crucial American ally who is contending with his country’s worst economic crisis in years.Last Friday, thousands took to the streets in the capital, Amman, as well as several other cities shouting, “We want change!” Because direct criticism of the king is banned, the focus has been on his government. Banners decried high food and fuel prices and demanded the resignation of the prime minister, appointed by the king.In recent months, journalists, former generals and students have attacked corruption, lower subsidies and lack of democracy in Jordan, especially recent reductions in freedom of expression. The marchers have been a mix of Islamists, trade unionists and leftists. To counter the criticism, the king recently announced an increase in civil service pay and $125 million in subsidies for basic goods and fuel.After Tuesday’s announcement of a new prime minister, some protest leaders were cautiously positive. Nahed Hattar, a leftist activist, said in a telephone interview that he considered the change a good move but that he wanted to see the government program before rendering judgment.Ali Habashneh, a retired general who had participated in public protests, said the appointment was “wise,” adding, “He is the right man to lead the country at this time.”But Zaki Saad, head of the political bureau of the Islamic Action Front, said Mr. Bakhit was “a very bad choice.” Mr. Saad said the new prime minister was “not a man of dialogue,” although he said he would wait to see if Mr. Bakhit had changed.Mr. Bakhit, 63, served as prime minister from 2005 to 2007. He is close to the king and has been deeply involved in the peace treaty with Israel.While King Abdullah has detractors in Jordan, there seems at the moment to be little push to end the monarchy. The pressure has been focused on economic issues and government accountability. But given the growing regional rage, it was difficult to predict the level of danger to his rule.The pressures in neighboring Syria were harder to gauge because it is a more authoritarian regime. President Assad told The Wall Street Journal in an interview this week that he was in a stronger position than other regional leaders because of his anti-American and anti-Israeli stands. But last month, he also raised heating oil allowances for public workers.'"
"'11-02-02,'1','“2011 will be a year of recovery and consolidation,” Mr. Dudley said. “But it will also be a year in which we have the opportunity to reset the company, adjusting the shape of our business, and focus on growing value for shareholders.”BP also said it would pay a dividend of 7 cents a share for the fourth quarter of last year. Earnings for the period rose 30 percent to $5.6 billion from $4.3 billion a year earlier, helped by higher oil prices. BP had suspended its dividend payments, which were most recently 14 cents a share, following the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf. The BP chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, called the dividend level “prudent.”Despite the positive quarter, BP posted a  loss for 2010 -- its first in almost 20 years.  The company lost $3.7 billion last year, compared with a profit of $16.6 billion in 2009.BP’s share price has not returned to its pre-explosion level, but it has risen 60 percent from the low it sank to last July. The shares dropped in London on Tuesday after BP said it expected production to decline this year as a result of asset sales.To improve BP’s safety record, Mr. Dudley set up a new division last year to monitor safety. BP recently suspended some operations in Alaska and the North Sea after the projects failed to meet the new safety standards, Mr. Dudley said Tuesday, without giving further details.Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, said Monday that its profit in the fourth quarter rose 53 percent to $9.25 billion, the highest for a quarter in more than two years. It cited increased energy demand from a recovering global economy. Chevron and ConocoPhillips have also reported higher earnings for the quarter.BP set aside an additional $1 billion in the fourth quarter for expenses related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, bringing the total charge to almost $41 billion. BP said it did not expect to be able to give an exact figure for the total costs for a while. A plan to sell $30 billion in assets by the end of 2011 to help pay for costs related to the oil spill was “on track,” BP said.Texas City, BP’s largest refinery in the United States, was the site of an explosion in 2005 that left 15 dead and 170 others injured. The U.S. government imposed a record $50.6 million fine on the company last August.It and Carson, which supplies about a quarter of Los Angeles’s gasoline, account for about 28 percent of BP’s current total refining capacity. BP said it planned to sell them before the end of 2012. The company plans to continue to invest in its other U.S. refinery operations in Cherry Point, Washington; Whiting, Indiana; and Toledo, Ohio.Jason Kenney, an analyst at ING in London, said PetroChina or other national oil companies might be interested in the assets. PetroChina agreed Monday to buy half of Ineos Group’s European oil-refining operation for $1.02 billion.Mr. Dudley also said that he plans to forge more alliances with national oil companies to ensure a presence in key oil and gas basins. In his first major deal since the Gulf of Mexico accident, Mr. Dudley agreed in January to a share swap with Russia’s Rosneft to form a partnership to explore the Arctic.But the $16 billion deal almost immediately faced opposition from BP’s partners in its existing joint venture in Russia, TNK-BP, which argued the Rosneft deal would violate their agreement.TNK-BP’s Russian shareholders asked for an injunction at a London court to stop BP’s deal with Rosneft. The High Court ruled Tuesday that the case would go to an arbitral tribunal that is to settle the matter by Feb. 25. BP said it welcomed the court’s decision.'"

"'11-02-03,'1','Frank Partnoy is correct when he argues that the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission has proved to be a pale imitation of the original Depression-era Pecora hearings (“Washington’s Financial Disaster,” Op-Ed, Jan. 30). Those hearings captivated the country and created the political climate necessary to pass the New Deal’s reforms of the financial industry.Mr. Partnoy argues that Congress should try again, but I am doubtful that such an effort would be successful. Perhaps we could find another lawyer with Mr. Pecora’s immense talents and willingness to go after the rich and powerful. What we cannot do is recreate Mr. Pecora’s impeccable timing.Mr. Pecora took over the struggling investigation in January 1933. By the time the hearings were over, nearly every bank in the country was closed as governor after governor declared statewide bank holidays.Mr. Pecora’s performance was remarkable. The financial machinations and lavish compensation he revealed shocked the country. Still, the hearings probably would not have had the lasting impact that they did had they not occurred in the throes of the worst financial crisis this country ever faced.It was the Washington equivalent of a perfect storm — the precise combination of scandal and crisis necessary to pass substantial financial reform legislation.If we are to have any chance of repeating Mr. Pecora’s success, we will likely have to wait for the next major panic to sweep the financial markets.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','It is 1981, and I am standing in Tahrir Square, Cairo, on an unusually hot September day, about to begin my graduate work in Islamic art and architecture at the American University in Cairo.It is the beginning of what will become, for me, a cherished and wonderful relationship with a land priceless in its art and architecture, a land whose people — so good-natured and giving — live in some of the most grinding poverty imaginable. This is glorious Egypt.The precarious events that are now unfolding in Egypt are both riveting and familiar. A month into my studies, on Oct. 6, my Yemeni roommate and I were hiking outside of Cairo and inadvertently strayed into a restricted zone adjacent to the route of a military parade that President Anwar el-Sadat was reviewing when he was assassinated earlier that day.My passport and camera were immediately confiscated, and we were detained, interrogated and kept incommunicado by the army for two very long, very unnerving days. Sadat’s vice president, Hosni Mubarak, assumed control that day and has held it, by various means, ever since.The world, particularly the West, adored Sadat and mourned his death; his people did neither.

"'11-02-03,'1','Although price-fixing by an electricity company may have cost New York customers nearly $300 million, the federal government can close the books on the case by collecting a penalty of just $12 million, a judge ruled on Wednesday.KeySpan Energy Corporation, a wholesale electricity generator, artificially raised the price of electricity from May 2003 to March 2008 by making a complicated deal that gave it a stake in the profits of a competitor, the Astoria Generating Company, according to the Justice Department. The department and the company agreed to a settlement of $12 million, which would go to the federal treasury, but in court filings, Consolidated Edison, the New York State Consumer Protection Board and others objected, saying that the settlement was too small and that the money should go back to ratepayers.Judge William H. Pauley III of Federal District Court in Manhattan said in a decision that the sum to which the damages should be compared was not the estimated penalty to customers, which economists said could run as high as $300 million, but revenue under the improper scheme, which was probably closer to $49 million. But this was a settlement, not a judgment, and thus the government should expect to settle for less, he said. “Full damages cannot be expected,” Judge Pauley wrote.He ruled that the $12 million represented “disgorgement,” or return of ill-gotten gains. Its purpose was not to compensate customers who had been harmed, but to recover profits wrongly gained, he wrote. He said that payment to consumers might be “optimal” but that giving the money to the government served the public interest, and was simpler. The judge said this was the first instance of the government’s seeking disgorgement under the Sherman antitrust law. Electricity experts said that his ruling had probably set a precedent that would allow use of that law in future cases.Contacted on Wednesday afternoon, both Con Edison, which had alerted regulators to the manipulation, and the New York State Consumer Protection Board said they were studying the decision and had not decided if they would appeal. Legal experts said that whether or not an appeal was possible, a new lawsuit against KeySpan by an aggrieved customer was possible.Michael S. Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Edison, said: “We are very disappointed that the settlement won’t be going to the ratepayers who were overcharged, and that the amount doesn’t approach the nearly $300 million involved. We do believe our efforts, however, have led to corrections in the capacity markets that will help to prevent similar abuses in the future.”'"
"'11-02-03,'1','Andrew D. Hamingson has resigned as executive director of the Public Theater after only two and a half years as the company’s top financial executive, he and the Public’s board chairman, Warren Spector, announced on Wednesday.No official explanation was given for Mr. Hamingson’s sudden departure beyond the “personal reasons” cited in a Public news release. In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Hamingson declined to elaborate, although he did say that his health was fine.Asked if disagreements with other leaders of the Public about business or artistic affairs prompted his departure, Mr. Hamingson said he would let his statement in the news release “speak for itself.”In that statement, he called the Public “one of the greatest not-for-profit theaters in the world,” and he praised Oskar Eustis, the theater’s artistic director, and other employees there as “the greatest staff in the American theater.” He added, “I am proud of the work we all have done together.”The Public has retained Mr. Hamingson as a consultant for the next two months to help with the administrative transition. As executive director, Mr. Hamingson was deeply involved in helping to raise money for transfers of Public productions to Broadway, where his record was mixed.This season, despite his early optimism, Mr. Hamingson was unable to raise the Public’s share of the capitalization for transferring its musical “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” to Broadway, leaving the Public’s commercial partners, led by Jeffrey Richards, to come up with extra money. (“Bloody Bloody” closed on Jan. 2 after a three-and-a-half-month run, at a loss to investors.) But Mr. Hamingson and the Public were able to raise money to transfer another of its critically acclaimed productions, the Al Pacino-led “Merchant of Venice,” which has recouped its full capitalization on Broadway and is turning a profit during a brief extension this month.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','Visa said on Wednesday that its quarterly profit rose 16 percent in its most recent quarter as debit card use continued to grow and consumers returned to using credit cards.The company said net income for the period rose to $884 million, or $1.23 a share, from $763 million, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier.Revenue in the period, which ended Dec. 31 and was the first quarter of Visa’s fiscal year, rose across all of its main businesses, gaining 14 percent, to $2.24 billion from $1.96 billion.Visa said its growth was driven by higher payments volume both in the United States and globally. The total number of transactions handled in the quarter rose 15 percent, to 13 billion.The results topped Wall Street’s expectations. Analysts were expecting profit of $1.20 a share and revenue of $2.22 billion, according to data provided by FactSet.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','If you like authentic, there is nothing like a paperweight made out of an actual spider web, silvered (O.K., aluminum-ed) and preserved in an orb of glass. ABC Carpet & Home, in Manhattan, has been selling them for the past few months, for $45 to $110.But who, we wondered, was the light-fingered adventurer who brought them back so finely preserved? Web sleuthing turned up Emil Fiore, known as Rocky, a contractor of all trades who sells spider-web products on his site, Whirledwidewebs.com. Mr. Fiore, who is 58 and stalks his prey primarily in New Jersey, talked to us last week from his home in Dumont, N.J., where he was recovering from hernia surgery. And yes, he said, he had delayed the surgery until the web-hunting season (i.e., warm weather) was over.How did you develop an interest in spider webs?I read about how to catch a web when I was just a kid, I think in a little Golden Guide — they had crafts for kids. They suggested you spray the web with hair spray and dust it with talcum powder. I held the concept in my head for years.What was it that fascinated you?Just that ordinarily the web lasts for a matter of hours.Really? Just a few hours?Most spiders take the web down and rebuild it every day. They eat it — they’re the original recyclers.A cobweb is something different. I don’t catch cobwebs. A cobweb is an obscure mass of silk that has no form or format or style; it’s just strands. A spider web shows some form of architecture or style. They’re called spider webs or orbs. Both are used to ensnare prey.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','Ms. Simmons has spent much of her time writing locally produced plays, like one about the Louisiana Purchase called “Whose Land Is It Anyway?” But she also has a botany degree from Auburn University, a useful background for the camellia identification project, which is expected to take several years.Like many of Mr. McIlhenny’s descendants, Ms. Simmons lives on Avery Island, which remains family owned.“We’re a commune,” said Cathy Thomason, 61, Ms. Simmons’s cousin, who is also involved in the camellia project. Ms. Thomason, who keeps a bottle of Tabasco in an engraved sterling silver sleeve on her dining table, became interested in camellias while participating in garden clubs in New Orleans, where she lived until she and her husband, Chuck, retired to Avery Island in 2003.“We all come back eventually,” she said.The two cousins enlisted the help of Mr. Brechter because Mr. McIlhenny had supplied many of the camellias now growing at Bayou Bend. Another key adviser on the project is Florence Crowder, a former nursery owner from Denham Springs, La., and a founder of the Great Gardens of America Preservation Alliance, established in 2008 to preserve rare and disappearing species of azaleas and camellias.Camellias are native to the Far East but were exported in the 18th century to Europe, where they were grown in the greenhouses of royalty and aristocracy in France, England, Spain and Germany. In the United States, the heyday of camellias arrived in the 1930s and ’40s, when wealthy and notable Americans like Mr. McIlhenny, Henry du Pont, William Randolph Hearst, Pearl Buck and Eudora Welty began breeding and cultivating them.With more than 17,000 varieties of camellias known today, identifying the ones on Avery Island will be difficult. During the January gathering, the identification process essentially involved Mr. Brechter, Ms. Crowder and assorted other volunteers crowding around a blossom and debating what it was. Nomenclature books, which are volumes that list botanical terms, were brandished, and occasionally heated arguments ensued.At one point, listening to the bickering, Ms. Thomason dryly drawled, “I sometimes think whoever talks the loudest wins.” But usually, the disagreements ended with a notation of the plant’s location and the snapping of a picture of the bloom to send to other experts for their opinions.“We’re all committed to this project because these plants are a part of our history,” Ms. Crowder said. “Many of the camellias are named after real people or places or events, so if you figure out the names of your camellias you can figure out your past.” There are camellias named for figures like George S. Patton, Pope John XXIII and Angela Lansbury, and, because it was considered a measure of social standing in the South to have a camellia named for you, there are countless varieties that honor former debutantes.The Avery Island effort is being closely watched by camellia enthusiasts, a group that is reportedly increasing. “I think more people are getting into growing camellias these days because they remember them in their parents’ or grandparents’ yards,” said Douglas Ruhren, a horticulturist with the American Camellia Society in Fort Valley, Ga. “They are like your grandmother’s china: you love it because it’s what she had.”Some nurseries, like Cam Too Camellias in Greensboro, N.C., have seen a doubling of camellia sales over the last five years. Tommy Alden, the owner of Country Line Nursery in Byron, Ga., which sells camellias nationwide primarily to retail nurseries and landscapers, added, “Camellia sales have been the one bright spot in an otherwise down market.”Besides nostalgia for grandma’s garden, experts say, the attraction of camellias is that they can bloom from November through March, when other plants are bare, and they are drought-tolerant and require very little maintenance. Indeed, the camellias on Avery Island have survived a half-century of benign neglect since Mr. McIlhenny’s death, not to mention multiple hurricanes.And, said Mr. Alden, “There are also a lot of new varieties, some with blooms as large as dinner plates and others that will survive the cold.”Indeed, camellias have traditionally fared poorly in hard freezes, growing well mostly in the South and on the West Coast. But now landscapers in the Northeast and Midwest are incorporating the new cold-hardy camellias into their projects.“We’re getting a lot of oohs and ahhs over the camellias,” said Mark Butler, owner of Butler Landscaping in Atlantic Highlands, N.J., whose favorite varieties are Spring Promise, which has coral flowers, and April Snow, with stark white blooms.Also popular are the sinensis varieties of camellias, the source of green and black tea. “People dry the leaves in the sun or in a 200-degree oven and then brew it,” said Cindy Watson, an owner of Cam Too Camellias. “We’ve seen a jump in sales I think because green tea is in everything now, even shampoos and lotions.”Camellias are also in high demand among Asian immigrants in the United States and Canada, who often give the red blooming varieties as gifts. “We ship a lot to New York and California for Chinese New Year’s,” Ms. Watson said.Back on Avery Island, Ms. Thomason interrupted the experts as they diligently examined the camellias in Jungle Gardens. “There’s a bee on a bloom over here if you want to get a picture,” she said.“We’re not here for that sex stuff,” Ms. Crowder said. “We’ve got work to do.”If the Bloom Is Off the Rose for YouCamellias, native to Asia, have become fixtures in the West ever since their introduction in the 1700s. Their leaves are dried to make traditional green or black tea, and many gardeners plant them for their showy winter blooms, which have a wide range of colors. Camellias thrive in temperate regions, but there are now also cold-hardy varieties that have expanded the growing range as far north as Canada.Florence Crowder, a founder of the Great Gardens of America Preservation Alliance, said that although camellias have beautiful flowers like roses, “only camellias are easy to care for, don’t have thorns and aren’t ugly when they aren’t blooming.”There are countless species in the genus camellia, but these three species (or hybrids of them) are the most common:C. JAPONICA The most common ornamental species, it has large showy blooms, like a cabbage rose or a peony. The flowers fall off like a wilted pompon when spent, rather than shedding their petals one at a time.C. SASANQUA Another ornamental, but its blooms look more like an antique rose with fewer petals than C. japonica and a prominent yellow stamen. The petals fall to the ground singly.C. SINENSIS Also known as the tea plant, this species is the source of traditional black, green, oolong and white teas. It is squat and has small, fragrant white flowers.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','AOL on Wednesday reported sharp declines in quarterly advertising sales and dial-up subscriptions, driving overall revenue down 26 percent.Tim Armstrong, AOL’s chief executive, has been trying to transform the company into a media and entertainment powerhouse. He said on Wednesday that he expected AOL to show growth in its display and branding advertising sales later this year.He declared that 2011 would be “the year we stop working on the turnaround and start working on the comeback,” saying the sales team had been built up to a point that “will allow us to get to second-half growth in 2011.”But Mr. Armstrong has found it difficult to win over investors, who pushed the stock down 5 percent on Wednesday, to $22.64. AOL reported fourth-quarter earnings of $66.2 million, or 61 cents a share, as it lowered expenses. In the period a year ago, it earned $1.4 million, or a penny a share. That period included $106 million in reorganization costs.Excluding items, AOL’s earnings were 70 cents a share, stronger than the 46 cents a share Wall Street had forecast, largely a result of lower-than-expected expenses and a more favorable tax rate, analysts said.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan’s new prime minister began consultations with key political groups, including the Muslim opposition, on Wednesday. The talks came a day after King Abdullah II, caught in a regional wave of discontent, sought to stave off growing public unrest by firing his government and vowing reform.Even before meeting with the prime minister, Marouf al-Bakhit, leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood here condemned him as a poor choice because of his ties to the military and because what they want is more democracy rather than a change of personnel. But other vital constituents, including former military officers and tribal leaders, were pleased by his selection, and that seems to have been the king’s first concern in a country where tribal ties to the monarchy are central. Many here said the king had calmed an important part of public anger and won time for changes.“This Friday will be the first in a month that we will not go out into the streets to demonstrate,” Salem Daifallah, a colonel active in the High National Council for Retired Military Men, representing some 160,000 people, said in an interview. “We will bide our time and see what the new cabinet looks like.” The Muslim Brotherhood and leftists are expected to demonstrate again this week, but most predictions are for smaller turnouts than in recent weeks.The former army officers, like other so-called East Bankers, meaning the original Jordanians, have been upset over privatization and economic changes that have reduced their standard of living. The security services are almost entirely made up of East Bankers. Recent government efforts to reduce the role of the state in the economy and link Jordan to the global marketplace have thus ended up alienating the king’s most loyal subjects. Responding to the anger, the king recently reversed some changes at great state cost — increasing fuel and food subsidies and civil service pay. Changing his cabinet was part of the same effort.Mr. Bakhit, 63, has served as prime minister before and is also a former ambassador to Israel and Turkey and considered a reliable, conservative selection by many East Bankers. He said he would select his cabinet only after days of consultations with various groups. Cabinet changes occur in Jordan on an average of every year and a half, but this was the first time in Abdullah’s 12-year rule that a shift had been forced on him by public pressure, which grew as demonstrators in Tunisia and Egypt created major political change. But the public here is divided on the changes it wants, meaning a revolutionary shift is unlikely.Analysts, diplomats and average Jordanians make the point repeatedly that Jordan is not Tunisia or Egypt. It is a monarchy, and thus far the legitimacy of Hashemite family rule here remains largely unchallenged. Moreover, the two groups that make up the country’s six million people — the East Bank tribes on one hand and Palestinians on the other — have distinctly different interests, meaning the king is not expected to face a unified movement for change.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','LOS ANGELES — Guy walks into a bar. Maybe you already have enough material for a movie at South by Southwest .Actually, “Girl Walks Into a Bar,” written and directed by Sebastian Gutierrez, with Carla Gugino, Danny DeVito and Josh Hartnett among its stars — about people in 10 bars in Los Angeles — is not the least elaborate of the 130 feature-length films set to screen at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., next month.A roster of festival films announced Wednesday includes several that are downright minimalist.In the narrative competition “A Year in Mooring,” directed by Chris Eyre, with Josh Lucas in the lead, is about a guy on a boat. “American Animal,” written and directed by Matt D’Elia, with Mr. D’Elia co-starring, and also in competition, is a small-scale story about roommates. Yet another competition film, “Charlie Casanova,” written and directed by Terry McMahon, is mostly set in a bar and hotel.Janet Pierson, who produces the festival’s film portion, which runs March 11 to 19, said she was struck by the number of films that did much with relatively little this year.“There’s an economy of means at play,” Ms. Pierson said in a telephone interview. “With the slightest of means, they can grip you.”Other films in the festival’s narrative competition are “96 Minutes,” written and directed by Aimée Lagos; “Fly Away,” written and directed by Janet Grillo; ""Happy New Year,"" written and directed by K. Lorrel Manning; “Natural Selection, written and directed by Robbie Pickering; and “Small, Beautifully Moving Parts,” written and directed by Annie J. Howell and Lisa Robinson.Earlier the festival announced some of its higher-profile events, including a premiere of “The Beaver,” which is directed by Jodie Foster and stars Mel Gibson as a troubled executive who gets back in touch with his life through a beaver hand puppet.Feature documentaries on a competition list announced Wednesday are “A Mouthful,” directed by Sally Rowe; “Better This World,” directed by Katie Galloway and Kelly Duane de la Vega; “The City Dark,” directed by Ian Cheney; “Dragonslayer,” directed by Tristan Patterson; “Fightville,” directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein; “Kumaré,” directed by Vikram Gandhi; “Last Days Here,” directed by Don Argott and Demian Fenton; and “Where Soldiers Come From,” directed by Heather Courtney.Of 1,792 feature-length submissions, the largest chunk, Ms. Pierson said, was made up of films about conflict-oriented sports: wrestling, boxing and such. But only one of those, “Fightville,” about hand-to-hand combat, made the cut.In keeping with the festival’s freewheeling approach, several films carried titles with explicit or implied obscenities. “The Other F Word,” as it turns out, is not one of them. The title refers to “family,” and its unexpected role in the lives of aging punk rockers.“Something Ventured,” a film showing in the festival’s “Spotlight Premieres” category, brings something almost as unexpected from the normally critical documentary world: a sympathetic eye for the achievements of big business.Directed by Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine, “Something Ventured” looks at investors and entrepreneurs who backed companies like Apple, Intel, Genentech and Cisco.“They show what it meant to grow these companies,” Ms. Pierson said. The film, she added, startles with its reminder that venture capitalists and their ilk in just a few years have fundamentally altered things as basic as, say, communication.“You see how we were all doing these things before,” she said.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','THE publication in 2000 of a monograph that showcased the work of the Swiss photographer Karlheinz Weinberger — gritty images of Zurich teenagers who appropriated the look of the American rebel with intricately customized jeans and denim jackets — became something of a fetish for fashion designers.Steven Meisel fashioned a Versace Jeans campaign after the style, and Martin Margiela showed oversize belt buckles like those seen in the photographs, many of which were festooned with images of Elvis Presley. But Mr. Weinberger and his art have remained on the fringe of the broader cultural consciousness, a status his supporters are hoping will improve this month with the publication of a second monograph by Rizzoli, called “Rebel Youth,” and two exhibitions opening next week in Manhattan.Mr. Weinberger’s subjects, mostly young men photographed in the ’50s and ’60s, interpreted American style in ways both fascinating and bizarre. The zippers of their jeans were ripped out of the crotch and replaced by crudely placed chains, corseted laces or, in one instance, nuts and bolts. It was a look so incongruous that John Waters begins an essay in the new book asking, “Karlheinz Weinberger was from Switzerland??! You gotta be kidding me.”The first exhibition, opening Wednesday at the Swiss Institute at 495 Broadway, will present an overview of Mr. Weinberger’s work along with some of the jackets and jeans seen in the images. A second show, opening Feb. 11 at the Anna Kustera Gallery at 520 West 21st Street, will include posthumously printed color images, which are being shown publicly for the first time.Also opening just in time for New York Fashion Week, on Feb. 10 at the Dorian Grey Gallery at 437 East Ninth Street, is a show of sketches and drawings by the designer Stephen Sprouse from 1974 to 1988. Mr. Sprouse, who died in 2004, was known for his pop and punk sensibility and his association with singers like Debbie Harry and Patti Smith. They appear frequently as subjects in the sketches, alongside notations that offer a vivid window into Mr. Sprouse’s thinking as he started in fashion.One includes a to-do list written in the margins. “Give Mary McFadden portrait,” it begins. “To be able to afford NYC, to become self-sufficient, to live with someone.”'"

The ensuing scandal shook what had been India’s most stable government in decades and raised questions about whether the nation’s rapid growth could be at risk because of rampant corruption. Mr. Raja and several associates were arrested on Wednesday.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','While Joe Santana does not presume to understand all of the latest climate science, he has his own opinions about global warming . But as head of operations at Mi Rancho , a family-owned tortilla producer in San Leandro, Calif., he understands the importance of saving money.After attending a series of workshops on sustainable business practices, Mr. Santana recently put into action a number of energy-efficiency and waste-reduction measures that he estimates will save Mi Rancho about $100,000 a year and pay for themselves well within the first year. “And if that’s good for the planet,” he said, “all the better.”“Sustainability” and “going green” are buzzwords that get overused, but many business owners are discovering that looking at their operations through a green lens can help them reduce costs, rethink long-held business practices and open doors to new opportunities.Here are some tips on getting started.START AT THE TOP The commitment to make a business greener has to come from top management, said Dan Bramblett, an executive at Estes Heating and Air Conditioning, a contractor based in Atlanta: “There are many things employees can do to start the process, but driving this through the company culture must start at the top.”At the same time, he added, “engaging employees is key to getting everyone on board.” Mr. Santana advised setting up internal green teams, consisting of volunteers from management and staff who meet on a regular basis. At Mi Rancho, the sustainability group meets once a month to review strategy, check progress and identify energy-saving actions. Some of the best ideas come from the front lines.TAKE INVENTORY To begin, Mr. Bramblett said, analyze the business operations with an eye toward reducing energy consumption and waste: “Look at those places where you spend the most money.” Common areas to consider are lighting, powering your equipment, heating, air-conditioning, transportation and water use.For Estes, the company’s biggest expense after personnel costs was transportation and fleet maintenance. As part of its energy audit, Estes learned that eight of its full-size trucks were assigned to sales people who did not need them to make business calls. The company started to swap out the trucks for Ford Fusion hybrid sedans, increasing gas mileage to 40 miles a gallon from 18 miles a gallon, and saving money in the process.Look also at the waste produced by the business. Disposing of this material often incurs a cost. For example, Estes typically generates hundreds of pounds of scrap cardboard and metal at each job site. Before starting its green initiative, the company would pay for a Dumpster to hold the waste. This was an expense, and the material generally ended up in a landfill. Now Estes works with a recycling contractor that hauls the material away without charge — saving the company about $1,000 a month, according to Mr. Bramblett’s estimates.At the end of this planning process, establish a baseline of your energy use and costs, said Tom Bowman, president of Bowman Design Group, a design firm based in Signal Hill, Calif. Most utility companies will come to your property to perform an energy audit, or you can use the information from your utility bills. “Having a well-defined starting point allows you to track and measure your progress,” he said.DO THE EASY STUFF Find steps you can accomplish almost immediately, said Mr. Bowman, and then build from there with actions that cost nothing or very little to apply. As an example, you might shut down electronics at night, turn off overhead lights during daylight hours and open windows to get natural ventilation instead of running the air-conditioning. These steps, he said, are “largely about educating employees and changing old habits.”Adam Prochaska, a partner at the law firm Harding & Shultz in Lincoln, Neb., is trying to change some old habits by getting his colleagues to reduce their paper use. Mr. Prochaska has calculated that his firm buys 1,600 reams of copy paper each year. A portion of that paper is used to print e-mails, which are stored in client files. He and a handful of other lawyers have started to store those e-mails electronically instead. He figures that if all of the lawyers in the firm were to adopt this practice, they could save at least $8,000 a year in paper, printing, labor and storage costs.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','The agency said it would take three or four years to complete the regulations.“While we’ve put in place standards to address more than 90 drinking water contaminants,” Ms. Jackson said Wednesday in testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, “there are many more contaminants of emerging concern, which science has only recently allowed us to detect at very low levels.”Perchlorate can occur naturally, but high concentrations have been found near military installations where it was used in rocket testing and around places where fireworks, flares and solid propellants are made. Researchers have found that it may impair the functioning of the thyroid, potentially stunting the growth of fetuses, infants and children.The military contractors who use the chemical have balked at tighter regulation, saying that substitutes are more expensive. But environmentalists and officials of some municipal water services have been calling for years for tighter rules on perchlorate and a number of carcinogenic chemicals, including industrial and dry-cleaning solvents.The environmental agency has found measurable amounts of perchlorate in 26 states and two United States territories that it says could contaminate the drinking water of anywhere from 5 million to 17 million Americans. The Food and Drug Administration found the substance in more than half the foods it tested, and health researchers have found traces of it in samples of breast milk.The agency did not establish an actual limit on the amount of perchlorate allowable in drinking water, but set in motion a rulemaking process to set a standard.Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, chairwoman of the environment committee, and some environmental advocates welcomed the announcement as a strong step for public health and welfare.But Rena Steinzor, a law professor at the University of Maryland and president of the Center for Progressive Reform, was critical of the E.P.A. for taking so long to decide to regulate perchlorate and for what she called a “leisurely” timetable for issuing a final rule. The agency said it would publish a proposed regulation within two years and issue a final rule 18 months after that.“Regulating perchlorate should not be seen as a long-term, we’ll-get-around-to-it goal, but an urgent public health priority,” she wrote in a blog post on Wednesday.Industries that use perchlorate said the E.P.A.’s decision was not warranted because potential exposures to the chemical were too low to threaten human health. The Perchlorate Information Bureau, representing Lockheed Martin, Aerojet and other industrial users, said that 13 states, spanning most of the sites of perchlorate contamination, had already enacted some control policy, making a national standard superfluous. The group said that a regulatory rule-making process would be expensive and time-consuming, with little or no public health benefit.The E.P.A. also said on Wednesday that it would develop a single rule governing a group of volatile organic compounds used as solvents, including trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, and a number of other unregulated contaminants. By grouping them together, the environmental agency can move more quickly and provide simpler guidance to officials responsible for overseeing water supplies, agency officials said.'"
"'11-02-03,'1','Time Warner, the media company, raised its dividend on Wednesday and reported stronger results for the quarter and the year.The company attributed the increase to higher revenue at its television networks, including Turner Broadcasting and HBO, and its filmed entertainment property, Warner Brothers.Net income for the fourth quarter rose to $769 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with $631 million, or 53 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 67 cents a share. On that basis, analysts had expected 62 cents a share.The company’s board also voted to raise its dividend by 11 percent.In a statement on Wednesday, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, described the results as “outstanding” and said the company would continue an aggressive push in 2011.“We’ll increase our investments in programming, production and marketing even more than we did last year,” Mr. Bewkes said. “We’ll keep pushing to accelerate new business models. We’ll keep expanding our presence in the most attractive international territories. And we’ll do all of this while keeping a rigorous focus on our operating and capital efficiency.”'"

"'11-02-04,'1','Substituting sex for suspense and pop music for ideas, the director Christian E. Christiansen drags “The Roommate” — a bloodless ripoff of Barbet Schroeder’s deliciously trashy 1992 thriller, “Single White Female” — from limp beginning to lame conclusion. And while Mr. Schroeder could conjure knife-blade tension from an episode of “Antiques Roadshow,” Mr. Christiansen succeeds only in conjuring monotony.Set at the fictional U.L.A., where the library and showers are conveniently deserted and pouting is an entrance requirement, the movie introduces Sara-from-Iowa (Minka Kelly) to her new dorm-room buddy, Rebecca-from-Beverly Hills (Leighton Meester). But Rebecca’s friendliness seems a little clingy, and soon Sara’s problems — including a creepy design professor (who’s creepier than Billy Zane?) and a persistent ex-boyfriend — have mysteriously disappeared. Pausing only to bed a scrunchy-eyed drummer (Cam Gigandet) and style another edgy hat-and-scarf ensemble, Sara decides to investigate her new BFF.We could not possibly care less. “Single White Female” barreled along on Howard Shore’s icicles-and-tinfoil score and Jennifer Jason Leigh’s transfixing portrayal of the psycho pal. By contrast, the bland faces, undifferentiated personalities and “Gossip Girl” wardrobes of too many of today’s young actresses suggest mini-Stepford Wives — a blur of uniformity.Zooming in on goggling eyes and perfect veneers, the director of photography, Phil Parmet, fails to ape the shadow-striped cinematography of the original film, while Mr. Christiansen dredges the slasher canon for setups. A moratorium on “Psycho”-inspired shower scenes, however, is long past due: isn’t it enough to insult one filmmaker at a time?“The Roommate” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A ripped belly button, a slashed stomach and an air-dried kitty.'"

"'11-02-04,'1','Texas retained the right, when it joined the Union, to split into as many as five states, but actually seceding? That was settled by the Civil War. After Mr. Perry’s early flirtation, he has stayed out of secession conversations with reporters, toning down his rhetoric after a wave of national news and news jabber.But the germ of the idea remained, growing into the anti-federalist talking points that fueled Mr. Perry’s re-election campaign last year and provided the outline for his book “Fed Up!”The governor will make his State of the State speech to the Legislature next week, and it’s likely to be a central theme.It’s in the fight over federal health care reform and what it does and doesn’t require of state government and Texas taxpayers and insurance customers. Texas is among the states that won a round against “Obamacare” in Florida federal court this week. The issue was featured in Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst’s re-election ads. Attorney General Greg Abbott has been outspoken on both the political and legal fronts.They’re not leaving home, just yelling at their parents.It’s in the fight over who should regulate the state’s environment, the subject of another lawsuit that the state has filed over the Environmental Protection Agency’s moves into regulatory territory that it had delegated to the state, in North Texas gas fields, in industrial areas in the Houston region, in definitions and rules about greenhouse gases. That one is spun as a battle between economic development and careful flexibility on the state’s part versus overreaching federal environmental regulators who don’t even follow their own rules. The E.P.A. jumped in strong, its supporters say, because the state put a little too much emphasis on encouraging business and too little on regulating air and water.You’d think they had ordered the state to clean up its room.It’s in the conversation here and elsewhere in the United States about Medicaid and how much leeway the federal government should allow along with all of the money it provides for that program, about the strings attached to other federal money, like the requirements Texas refused to adopt for its unemployment insurance program in 2009, forfeiting $556 million, or the state’s decision against applying for $700 million in federal Race to the Top money for education.Medicaid is the one to watch here. State officials would like to have the money with more flexibility; Mr. Perry has talked for a while about turning it into block grants with fewer rules. It’s a cost runaway that could bust the budget, which gives teeth to the argument for forbearance. He’s talked to other governors, to enlist them in the cause.The state’s independent streak doesn’t go all the way, as it did (and for vastly different reasons) 150 years ago. One problem for writers of the state’s next budget is that they used one-time federal stimulus money for continuing expenses in the current budget. The plug is gone, but the hole it filled remains. And while the state can yell, it can’t afford to go it alone. The Texas government will get almost 40 percent of its money from the federal government over the next two years — $70.2 billion, against a total of $177.8 billion, according to the state comptroller.'"
"'11-02-04,'1','Two miles from the site of Super Bowl XLV, inside the University of Texas at Arlington’s new 234,000-square-foot multi-disciplinary research building, Mario I. Romero-Ortega, an associate professor of bioengineering, investigates how robotic arms could be more reliable and lifelike for amputees returning from war.Down the hall, Vassilis Athitsos, an assistant professor of computer science, tinkers with new technology for building interactive sign language dictionaries.The two, who would probably not have crossed paths before the new facility opened, are discussing a collaboration on communications tools for people with cerebral palsy.James D. Spaniolo, the president of U.T.-Arlington, said his university is committed to increasing its engagement with research that “could change the quality of life of many, many people.” But, Mr. Spaniolo said, cuts in state financing would slow that momentum.The university already cut $8.3 million from its budget after Texas officials called for a 5 percent reduction in state spending in 2010. Mr. Spaniolo warned that further reductions would compromise its commitment “to provide a high-quality academic environment” and, more specifically, threaten progress toward becoming a national research, or tier-one, university.In 2009, a bill written by Representative Dan Branch, Republican of Dallas, gave U.T.-Arlington and six other universities incentives to increase their research output with that goal in mind. California has three times as many universities recognized among the nation’s top universities for research as Texas.'"
"'11-02-04,'1','The gulf states are still living with the destruction wrought by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which swept away more than 70,000 units of affordable rental housing.Fewer than a third of those units, which are crucial to housing the poor, the elderly and the disabled, have been rebuilt. The 5,000 or so that are still on the drawing board might never be constructed unless Congress extends a program that encourages businesses to invest in housing by providing them offsets for tax liabilities.Congress tried to remedy the problem late last year by passing a one-year extension of the program. But investors insist that they need another 18 months to get the deals done, the units built and the tenants in place. If the projects come in late, the tax credits become invalid.Congress allotted more than $300 million in credits to the gulf states after Katrina and Rita, requiring that the projects be ready for tenants by the end of 2010. The credits sold well while the economy was thriving. But demand fell off during the recession when corporate investors had small tax liabilities.The appetite for tax credits has picked up, but investors are still shying away from the gulf out of fear that any credits they purchase might expire before they can be used. Unable to raise capital, some developers have walked away from projects that seemed certain to get built before the onset of the recession.A Senate bill introduced by Mary Landrieu, a Democrat of Louisiana, with the support of several Republicans, would extend the program for an additional year. The bill, which still needs a sponsor in the House, deserves to pass as swiftly as possible. Without it, the gulf states are unlikely to get the housing they need.'"
"'11-02-04,'1','As it has done periodically for years, the New York State Legislature will consider a proposal this year to open secret judicial-discipline hearings to the public. Some supporters of the measure predict that it will get more attention this time than it has in decades.Judicial-discipline hearings are public in 35 states. But the proceedings of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct have been secret under state law for more than 30 years. Many judges insist that keeping them closed is essential.But the commission, which is fighting claims by a Manhattan lawyers’ group that it has been unfair to judges, will make opening its hearings a top legislative priority, said its administrator, Robert H. Tembeckjian. With a new focus in Albany on government ethics reform, Mr. Tembeckjian said, “The time is also right to open the process of disciplining judges.”The Manhattan lawyers’ group, the New York County Lawyers’ Association, persuaded the New York State Bar Association last week to call for changes in state law that it said would make commission proceedings fairer to judges. But the Manhattan group did not mention making the hearings public in its sweeping proposal to restructure the commission, give judges earlier notice of charges and limit the scope of investigations. Most of those charges are based on complaints from litigants, lawyers and other judges.John L. Sampson, the leader of the Democratic State Senate minority, said that he would reintroduce legislation to open the hearings. Mr. Sampson, who proposed a similar bill last year, said that it was even more necessary now because of the recent criticism of the judicial conduct commission. He said open hearings would foster confidence in the procedures for policing judges, adding, “Who will watch the watchers?”'"

"'11-02-04,'1','The F.A.O. price index, which tracks 55 food commodities for export, rose 3.4 percent in January, hitting its highest level since tracking began in 1990, the report said. Countries not dependent on food imports are less affected by global volatility. Still, food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 3 percent in the United States this year.Four main factors are seen as driving prices higher: weather, higher demand, smaller yields and crops diverted to biofuels. Volatile weather patterns often attributed to climate change are wreaking havoc with some harvests. Heavy rains in Australia damaged wheat to the extent that much of its usually high-quality crop has been downgraded to feed, experts noted.This has pushed the demand and prices for American wheat much higher, with the best grades selling at 100 percent more than they were a year ago, Mr. Abbassian said. The autumn soybean harvest in the United States was poor, so strong demand means stocks are at their lowest level in 50 years, he said.Brokers are waiting to see how acreage in the United States will be divided between soybeans, corn and cotton, with cotton fetching record prices, Mr. Abbassian said.Sugar prices are also at a 30-year high, he said. Prices for cereals are rising but still below their April 2008 peak. Oils and fats are up and close to their 2008 level, and dairy is higher but still below its 2007 peak, the report said. Even positive news, like good rains in Argentina and a strong harvest in Africa, has failed to keep prices from rising.“Food prices are not only rising, but they are also volatile and will continue this way into the future,” said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the World Bank managing director.Changing diets around the world stemming from higher incomes, especially in places like China and India, mean a greater demand for meat and better grains. Although it takes time for that to translate into higher prices globally, it does buoy demand, the experts said.In 2009, the richest nations pledged more than $20 billion to aid agriculture in developing countries, including $6 billion for a food security fund housed at the World Bank. Just $925 million of those pledges has been paid, Ms. Okonjo-Iweala noted, because of financial problems in the donor countries. That will bring consequences, she said, as one billion people already go without sufficient food daily.Derek Headey, an economist with the International Food Policy Research Institute, noted that in 2007 and 2008 many African countries were hit hard by soaring import bills, as were nations spread across the world, like Afghanistan, Pakistan and Ecuador.But some of the world’s largest and poorest countries experienced rapid economic growth and only modest food inflation, so the number of people facing food insecurity in nations like China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam actually went down at that time, he said.“This time around there is still strong economic growth in these countries, but inflation is much more of a problem,” he said. “So it is possible that the impact could be worse in 2011, especially if food prices stay high.”It will take some months for those figures to emerge, he added.'"
"'11-02-04,'1','The drugmaker Merck & Company said on Thursday that it lost $531 million in the fourth quarter as a result of nearly $4 billion in charges, including write-offs and restructuring costs from its acquisition of the Schering-Plough Corporation.Almost half the charges, $1.7 billion before taxes, were to account for the diminished prospects of the anticlotting drug vorapaxar, which had been considered a potential blockbuster. The company last month announced that because of a dangerous side effect, it would halt one late-stage study of the drug and remove some patients from a second study that continues.Merck also issued an earnings forecast for 2011 that was lower than Wall Street expectations and withdrew its long-term forecast. It cited pricing pressures from health care reform in the United States and cuts in European government health programs, as well vorapaxar’s link to increased bleeding in the brains of patients who had had strokes.Merck, the world’s second-biggest drugmaker behind Pfizer, said the fourth-quarter net loss amounted to 17 cents a share. A year earlier, Merck earned $6.49 billion, or $2.35 a share.The restructuring and other charges amounted to $1.05 a share, or $3.95 billion before taxes. Excluding the charges, Merck would have made 88 cents a share.'"
"'11-02-04,'1','Sales growth this year will probably slow to 8 to 10 percent, Mr. Thomas said, partly because the company’s craftsmanship model of business does not allow for rapid increases in production and partly because of potential problems in the global economy.“If there is trouble ahead, like the bankruptcy of a state, then consumers will be more shy,” he said.The company, which started in 1837 in Paris as a harness maker, has a full range of luxury products, including leather goods and home furnishings, scarves and clothing. It said pretax profit would show more than a 40 percent increase from 2009 when it releases its full results on March 4, and said its operating margin, a measure of profitability, rose by three percentage points from last year. It did not provide a figure for net profit.The dominant shareholders, descendants of the founder, Thierry Hermès, have strongly resisted Mr. Arnault’s approach. LVMH announced in the autumn that it had used derivatives contracts to build a stake of more than 17 percent in Hermès. Mr. Arnault said in December that he had acquired an additional 3 percent by buying stock on the open market.Mr. Thomas said that Hermès had not changed its position about LVMH and that nothing should be read into the decision to pay a dividend. “I think the family has clearly said that Mr. Arnault must withdraw,” he said.“We had a very good year,” Mr. Thomas added. “There is nothing more behind it. There is no specific plan to reward the family or other shareholders.”With most of the shares tied up by the family or Mr. Arnault, there is no reason to consider using the cash reserves for a buyback, he said, nor is there reason to consider luxury sector acquisitions. “We have huge internal growth potential,” he said.Mr. Arnault, now by far the largest individual shareholder in Hermès, insists that his approach is amicable. But skeptics in the French business community, and there are many, point to Mr. Arnault’s record of exploiting internal rifts in family companies, perhaps most prominently with his 1990 coup to gain control of LVMH.To counter his intentions, the Hermès family, already protected by a limited partnership structure, has created a holding company to group more than 50 percent of its shares.A shareholder advocate has appealed a regulatory ruling allowing the formation of the holding company, arguing that it created disadvantages for minority shareholders.'"
"'11-02-04,'1','But the process became deadlocked as rival leaders vied for the job, none able to muster the required majority vote. Lawmakers failed in 16 previous votes to choose a winner. Thursday’s breakthrough came after the Maoist political leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, unexpectedly withdrew from the race and threw the Maoists’ support behind Mr. Khanal.Mr. Khanal, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), won with 368 votes out of 601 in Nepal’s Constituent Assembly, defeating Ram Chandra Paudel, a leader in the Nepali Congress Party. Mr. Khanal’s party had formed a coalition government with the Maoists after the 2008 national elections but then formed a new alliance with the Nepali Congress after the Maoists left the government.It is unclear what sort of power-sharing agreement will exist between Mr. Khanal and the Maoists, or what the new government will look like. Mr. Khanal’s challenges are enormous. For one thing, politicians are still fighting over how to integrate former Maoist fighters into the nation’s security forces. In the interim, more than 19,000 former Maoist combatants are living in camps around Nepal.There are also stark differences between the Maoists and other parties over the constitution, with some rival politicians accusing the Maoists of trying to subvert the process to weaken institutions that would support a multiparty democracy. The Maoists have denied such charges and blamed other parties for trying to maintain their grip on power at the expense of the country’s poor.Before Thursday, the Nepalese public was growing increasingly angry with the protracted stalemate. Last month, a man slapped Mr. Khanal in public and blamed him and other political leaders for depriving the nation of a functioning government. The Maoist leader, Mr. Dahal, cited this incident in announcing the withdrawal of his candidacy in Parliament.“People have started slapping leaders, and I now fear that people will throw shoes at us if we fail again to elect a new prime minister,” he said.Mr. Dahal, noting that Nepal is now facing a May 28 deadline to complete the constitution, sounded an optimistic note after his withdrawal.“The peace process and the constitution writing will now have momentum,” he predicted. “This has laid the foundation for success.”'"
"'11-02-04,'1','Holden, 25, will also very likely figure prominently in the plans of another coach, Bob Bradley of the United States national team, as he retools, first for this summer’s Concacaf Gold Cup and then for qualifying matches leading to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Holden, in fact, is seen by many as the heir apparent to Landon Donovan, the national team mainstay whose goal in added time against Algeria moved the Americans into the knockout round of last summer’s World Cup in South Africa.“It’s flattering,” Holden said of the comparison, “because Landon has been such a big player in my eyes.”Until Wednesday’s victory, which knocked Wolverhampton to the bottom of the 20-team league, Bolton (8-8-9) had been less than impressive since Holden’s return. It was routed by Chelsea last week, 4-0, in a game in which Holden was the team’s man of the match, then played Wigan, 19th in the Premiership, to a scoreless draw Saturday in an F.A. Cup game. Bolton, in eighth place, has managed 4 points in its last five league games heading into Saturday’s showdown at formidable Tottenham Hotspur.His smile and easygoing demeanor are all the more remarkable considering that Holden has faced an unusually harsh series of setbacks and disappointments in his six-year professional career.Born in Scotland and raised in Sugar Land, Tex., he played at Clemson before signing with Sunderland, a Premier League team from Northern England, in 2005. While his brother was visiting him in nearby Newcastle, Holden was attacked outside a bar as he waited for a taxi.“All I remember was getting punched and going down,” Holden said.The attack broke his left eye socket, and he soon sustained an ankle injury and was dropped from the team.Holden returned to the United States to rebuild his career with the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer, making 103 appearances from 2006 to 2009. It was there that he caught the eye of Coyle, who was watching a playoff game and noticed a young player with a shock of blond hair darting about the field.“Everywhere the ball was, Stuart seemed to be,” Coyle said. “There was this unbelievable energy.”In January 2010, Coyle asked Holden if he would be interested in a tryout. Holden had several other offers — solid ones, in fact — including one for four years from Sporting Braga in Portugal and another from his hometown team, Aberdeen. Still, he said yes immediately.“He wanted to prove himself at the highest level, which I love about him,” Coyle said. “The question was whether he could transform that form into the Barclays Premier League, which is the best league in the world.”For Holden, turning down the best deal for only a tryout in England’s cold, rainy north was an easy decision.“If it was most money, I’d be in Portugal now,” Holden said, adding that Bolton was “where I wanted to be, if I had the opportunity.”Holden turned that one-week trial into a six-month contract, joining his fellow United States internationals Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard in making an impact in the top tier of the fast-paced English game.“In the M.L.S., when the ball’s gone out of play, you usually get a chance to catch your breath,” Holden said. “Here, the goalie smashes it forward, the ball’s over my head, and I have to start running again. Every tackle, every pass, everything is so quick.”Holden’s most recent serious injury occurred last March. He was playing for the United States in an exhibition against the Netherlands when his right leg was broken on a tackle by Nigel de Jong, now infamous for kicking Xabi Alonso of Spain in the chest during the World Cup final last year.“It came at such a bad time because I’d just come into the team and I was playing some of the best football of my career,” Holden said.He worked hard to recover, going to the gym every day to become fit enough to make the World Cup team.“There were days when you couldn’t pick yourself up, I would be so tired,” he said, “and the physios would remind me, ‘Imagine stepping on the field in South Africa.’ ”Holden did make it there, though he played only a few minutes in one game as a late substitute. He now has set his sights on Brazil in 2014.“I want to make a big impact with the national team going forward,” he said.Holden plays with a taped wrist. Underneath the tape is a LiveStrong bracelet that belonged to his father, who lost his six-year fight with pancreatic cancer in 2009. Holden credits his father with keeping him grounded. “In all those little setbacks I had along the way,” he said, “he was always the first one to pick me up.” In memory of his father, Holden said, he never takes the bracelet off and has established a children’s cancer foundation, Holden’s Heroes.Coyle, who had so much faith in Holden that he gave him a long-term contract even though he was still injured, is quick to lavish praise on him as a player and as a person.“He brings a desire, a hunger and a willingness to be the best he can be,” he said.During an interview conducted near the practice field, Holden was interrupted several times by his teammates.“What, he’s only just come back!” striker Kevin Davies said.“Blah blah blah,” goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen chimed in mockingly as he rushed out of the locker room.Holden, clearly enjoying his second chance at the Premier League, said, “It’s a great atmosphere here, can you tell?”The small, unglamorous surroundings suit him. The cars outside are not all Lamborghinis and Ferraris, and the players treat members of the support staff as if they were family. They are in competition to see who can have the most followers on Twitter.After the juggling drill, the players moved into short drills that emphasized speed, coordination and passing — qualities that Coyle has added to his reinvented team.“His teams are known for passing and keeping the ball on the ground, and that’s the type of player I am,” Holden said.During the drills, as Coyle watched, two players chased the ball while the others passed it in a circle. Two touches, maximum, the clock ticking. “Hunt down the ball!” Coyle screamed.Holden was quickest to the ball almost every time, his hunger and joy to be playing again pouring off him like sweat.'"
"'11-02-04,'1','Food prices have been rising around the world, a result of weather problems in many countries, like the unusual heat wave in Russia last summer. High food prices have been among the many reasons for protests in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world.But even a prolonged drought in China appears highly unlikely to cause acute food shortages. China has spent years accumulating very large government reserves of grain and also has $2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, giving it virtually unlimited ability to import food as long as major grain producers do not limit exports.When commodity prices last surged in 2007 and 2008, however, at least 29 countries sharply curbed food exports in attempts to prevent domestic food prices from rising as quickly as world prices. And if China does become a large importer of wheat — it imports a lot of soybeans but tries to be essentially self-sufficient in rice and other grains for national security reasons — then it could push up world prices and make it harder for poor countries to afford food imports.Gary Blumenthal, chief executive of World Perspectives, a Washington-based agriculture trade consulting company, noted that wheat was grown in many countries and said that Chinese purchases would not necessarily result in a sustained jump in already high world prices. “The wheat market can restore any imbalances more readily than perhaps other grains,” he said.China’s wheat imports have risen to 893,700 metric tons in 2009 and 1.2 million metric tons last year from just 31,900 metric tons in 2008, according to figures from Global Trade Information Services, a data company in Columbia, S.C.But those totals are small compared with global output that according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reached 682 million metric tons in 2009, the most recent year for which figures are available. China accounted for one-sixth of global wheat production that year, which could make a broad failure of the Chinese crop hard to replace immediately.Higher food and energy prices are spreading to other parts of China’s economy, contributing to broader inflation. Prices rose 4.6 percent last year, according to the consumer price index, but Chinese and Western economists say that the index understates the true extent of inflation because of methodology problems. The National Bureau of Statistics has said that it is trying to improve the index.The government has cushioned the effects of rising food prices by encouraging provinces and cities to sharply raise the minimum wage, which has been climbing 18 percent a year in Guangdong Province, in southern China.Accelerating inflation in China is starting to show up in the prices that American companies pay for imports from China. After years of showing little change, a United States Bureau of Labor Statistics index of average import prices suddenly jumped 0.3 percent from September to October, then jumped the same amount in November and again in December.As many Chinese exporters demand double-digit percentage increases for the renewal of contracts this year, American buyers have delayed signing contracts, producing a hiccup in trans-Pacific trade. Shipping lines are discounting rates and canceling some sailings this spring while waiting for exporters and buyers to reach deals.But imports from China are equal to only 2 percent of American economic output, so most economists expect inflation in China to have a limited effect on broad price indices in the United States.'"
"'11-02-04,'1','Live television images were so difficult to transmit that by the afternoon, the Fox News Channel anchor Shepard Smith was showing viewers exactly what his control room in New York was seeing — blank screens from The Associated Press and Reuters television feeds.Jon Williams of the BBC said via Twitter that Egyptian security forces had seized the news agency’s equipment at the Cairo Hilton “in an attempt to stop us broadcasting.” Both CNN and the BBC relied on taped footage of the square.Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya, which have provided some of the most extensive network coverage of the revolt, said their journalists had been hounded from the street and from vantage points above the square where their cameras had been placed. In the absence of live pictures, the networks relied on grainy amateur video taken on the streets.Another Arab network, Al Hurra, had what it described as one of the only live feeds from the square.The Committee to Protect Journalists said it had received nearly 100 reports of damage to news organization property or of individuals being detained or attacked.The intimidation tactics were condemned at the highest levels of the United States government. The White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, rebuked the Mubarak government and its supporters, calling the harassment “completely and totally unacceptable.” Speaking to reporters traveling with President Obama, he said that “any journalist that has been detained should be released immediately.”Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the attacks on journalists were an affront to the most basic principles of international law. “It is especially in times of crisis that governments must demonstrate their adherence to these universal values,” she said.A reporter for Al Arabiya was beaten by a group of pro-Mubarak demonstrators on Wednesday. His injuries were significant enough that he remained in the hospital, though his condition was not critical, said Nakhle el-Hage, the network’s director of news.The attacks were aimed at other independent observers, too, including representatives of groups like Human Rights Watch. The Egyptian security police also raided the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, detaining as many as 16 people, including some of the country’s most prominent human rights advocates and several foreign researchers.Al Arabiya broadcast a plea to the Egyptian Army to intervene after the network’s headquarters in Cairo came under sustained attack from pro-Mubarak demonstrators who were wielding sticks and knives. “They destroyed some equipment outside the building, and they said they would come in and destroy everything,” Mr. Hage said in a telephone interview from Dubai.He said the army initially responded by deploying more soldiers to secure the building, but the troops soon left. “The message we got from the army is that ‘you’re left on your own,’ ” he said.Al Arabiya’s staff was forced to flee a nearby hotel as the pro-Mubarak mob broke into the network’s office. Four of its journalists stayed at the hotel to report, while others continued to work from their homes or from friends’ homes.Two employees of Al Jazeera were dragged out of their car on the road from the airport to central Cairo and were detained; in the early evening, the network said that, over all, three of its journalists were still in custody. A spokesman for the network also said that its Web site had faced “security issues.” The site was not available in Egypt or the United States early Thursday, though it appeared to return online later.Two reporters working for The New York Times were released on Thursday after being detained overnight in Cairo.The attacks started almost as soon as the violent clashes began near Tahrir Square on Wednesday. “It’s clearly a bad situation these last two days — a stark contrast to the days before that,” said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, which has several journalists in Egypt, including a local translator who was assaulted, detained and later released.The government has sought to control the information coming out of Egypt since large-scale protests against Mr. Mubarak and his subordinates began in late January. But before Wednesday, the harassment of reporters had been scattered, and attempts to control the gripping images and narratives from Cairo had mostly failed.“We’ve never witnessed something like this in the Middle East,” said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, program coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa at the Committee to Protect Journalists. “That is not to say that Saddam Hussein’s Iraq or Muammar Qaddafi’s Libya were friendly places for journalists. There were massive amounts of harassment, intimidation and reporters put on trial. But you don’t see this level of physical violence against journalists in this kind of sustained fashion and coordination.”'"

Digital now accounts for 26 percent of the company’s total advertising revenue. Circulation revenue fell 3.6 percent.Total revenue for the company’s News Media Group, which includes its newspapers, was $626.5 million in the quarter, down 2.9 percent, and $2.3 billion for the year, down 2.7 percent. For the quarter, the group posted an operating profit of $110.3 million, compared with $81.4 million in the fourth quarter 2009.Revenue fell 3 percent at About.com in the quarter, to $35.2 million, because of lower cost-per-click rates on ads and display advertising.Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive, said that while advertising revenue in the fourth quarter started strong, it eventually turned downward. “The advertising marketplace was volatile during the quarter,” she said in a written statement. “The progress we made on the print advertising front in October and November was not sustained in December due to a combination of difficult year-over-year comparisons and advertiser caution about the economy and consumer spending.”Print advertising in January started out soft and strengthened as the month progressed, the company said.The Times Company reduced expenses in the quarter by 5.3 percent from the last three months of 2009 — including depreciation, amortization and costs associated with severance packages for employees. These reductions came amid rising newspaper costs.The company ended the year with about $597 million in net debt compared with $732 million at the end of 2009.“In 2010 we demonstrated further progress toward our long-term strategy of re-engineering our company,” Ms. Robinson said in a statement. “We maintained our relentless focus on managing costs to mitigate the effects that the ongoing transformation of our industry and an uneven economic recovery had on our operating performance.”The company ended the year with $400 million in cash and short-term investments, leaving it with enough flexibility to continue with plans to pay back a $250 million loan from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helú in early 2012, three years ahead of its due date.Alexia S. Quadrani, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, said there were positives and negatives in the Times Company’s earnings report for investors. She said the market would most likely see the higher-than-estimated earnings per share as a plus but view the declining print revenue as a reason to be wary.'"
"'11-02-04,'1','In Sony’s gaming unit, lower production costs for the PlayStation 3 game console and higher unit sales of software like the latest game in its popular Gran Turismo car racing series helped increase profit.But its liquid-crystal display TV business is struggling amid strong competition from rivals like Samsung, LG and Panasonic that is driving down prices. As a result, operating profit from Sony’s TV business decreased even though unit sales increased.Sony slashed its forecast for TV sales for the full year through March to 23 million units, down from a previous forecast of 25 million. It kept its forecast for PlayStation 3 game console sales intact at 15 million units.Sony Pictures also struggled to increase profit despite hit movies like “The Social Network,” which is loosely based on the story of Facebook and its co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. Although performance at the movie unit has been strong, it could not beat revenue from the previous year, which included the theatrical release of “This Is It,” the documentary on Michael Jackson.Sony said sales for the quarter fell 1.4 percent, to 2.21 trillion yen, primarily because of a strong yen, which erodes the value of overseas earnings in the home currency. The company lowered its full-year revenue forecast to 7.2 trillion yen, from 7.4 trillion yen.In the last three months of 2010, the yen was almost 9 percent stronger against the dollar and 19 percent stronger against the euro compared with a year earlier.Sony’s chief financial officer, Masaru Kato, stressed that the effects of the strong yen were masking what he called a strong recovery in the company’s main electronics business. Sony plunged to losses of over 200 billion yen after the financial crisis as global demand for Japanese electronics evaporated.“The strong yen continues, but I think we are seeing quite a strong rebound in electronics,” Mr. Kato said at a news conference.Overtaken by rivals in areas it once dominated, including TVs and portable music players, Sony has in recent years sought to return to the cutting edge with an online strategy that would better marry its universe of gadgets with its extensive catalog of music, video and gaming content.The company introduced a successor to the PlayStation Portable game console at an event in Tokyo last week and said it would also open up its catalog of PlayStation games to selected smartphones. That was a much-anticipated move that could help Sony fend off increasing competition from the likes of Apple, which has made rapid inroads into gaming with its App Store, packed with games that can be downloaded onto the iPhone and iPod Touch.'"

"'11-02-05,'0','To make the charts easier to understand, the figures were changed to show the amount above or below 50 reported in each month. The top charts show the trend in the overall index, as well as two components of the index, for Britain, the euro zone and the United States over the last three years. What is remarkable is how close to each other they are. They plunged during the financial crisis, came back strongly in early 2010 and then dipped. Now they are rising again.At the bottom are the current results for two components of the index that are particularly sensitive. The first indicates the proportion of companies that say the level of new orders rose over the previous month. The other shows the proportion of companies that say they are adding workers, as opposed to firing them or keeping employment constant.The figures on new orders are often the first to signal a change in the business climate, while the employee statistic changes later because companies typically wait to see whether a trend is real before hiring workers or letting them go.The glaring exception to the trend is Greece, where both orders and employment are still falling. The country is in a deep recession, in part because it has been forced to tighten its budget and in part because inflation over the years has sapped its competitiveness in export markets.But there are positive signs in other areas in the euro zone that have faced problems. Italy’s numbers are strong, and even employment there seems to be rising.While the overall numbers are highest in Britain, the United States reports the highest figures for both new orders and employment. Manufacturing companies in the United States are hiring again, something that had not happened for years. The last time the employment index was as high as it is now was in 1973.Manufacturing is not as important to developed economies as it once was, and similar surveys have shown non-manufacturing companies coming back more slowly. But the reports for January showed improvements in most countries, with the United States index at the highest level since 2005.'"

"'11-02-05,'0','The city approved the project in 2008. It will include office and retail space, a small hotel, cultural space and 800 apartments, 600 of which will be set aside for low-, moderate- and middle-income families.The first phase of the construction — a 49-unit residential building at the southeast corner of 125th Street and Third Avenue — is nearing completion.Many of the business owners knew that a large stretch of the area was included in a 150-block urban renewal effort that was approved in 1968 but never quite materialized. But property owned by at least three of the businessmen was not included in the renewal zone, at least not until 2008, when the Bloomberg administration added those parcels to the mix.At the time, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hailed the creation of jobs and housing, and the city justified taking the private property by declaring the area “blighted” — a description that Mr. Bae and the other business owners found galling.The city owned most of the land, allowing it to sit fallow for decades while turning down Mr. Bae and other business owners who wanted to buy parcels to expand their operations.In a recent decision by a panel of judges at the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, Justice James M. Catterson agreed. He said the city’s claim of blight and underutilization were “nothing but a canard to aid in the transfer of private property to a developer.”But he said he was forced to concur with the court’s decision to dismiss the lawsuit brought by Mr. Bae and other property owners because recent rulings by the Court of Appeals had “made plain that there is no longer any judicial oversight of eminent domain proceedings.”The battle against eminent domain in East Harlem has received less attention than similar disputes at Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn, Willets Point in Queens and the Columbia University expansion in West Harlem. But in each case, longtime businesses were pushed out to make way for large developments.Jacob Toledo, the owner of Cycle Therapy, runs the city’s largest motorcycle dealership in a refurbished five-story building on East 127th Street. Rows of new and used Triumph, BMW, Honda and Yamaha motorcycles and scooters line the neat shop, while the smell of oil hangs in the air. Mr. Toledo says he may be forced to close his business permanently if the city takes his land.Five years ago, he said, he crisscrossed the city looking for a new location after he was pushed out of a site on the West Side of Manhattan by new zoning and rising real estate values.Only days after buying the orange-colored building in East Harlem, Mr. Toledo said he learned that the property might be condemned.“I don’t think we can find any place in the city that can fit my business,” he said.Evan Blum, another local businessman, is not part of the lawsuit to stop eminent domain on 125th Street, but he is very much opposed to it. This is his third encounter with eminent domain, he said.“The city makes it so hard for the small businessman to exist,” Mr. Blum said. “I’m not politically connected. Small businesses can’t make contributions to politicians. So the big guys always win.”Mr. Blum owns the building housing Demolition Depot on the south side of 125th Street, between Second and Third Avenues. Celebrities, billionaires, restaurant owners and brownstone dwellers make their way to Demolition Depot for that must-have claw-footed bathtub, or for gargoyles, stone lions and chestnut doors.However, a building he leases across 125th Street, stocked with four floors of marble, wood and stone fireplace mantles, is threatened by the condemnation effort.Nearby, Gary Spindler, the owner of Uptown Auto Repair, also says he worries about the future of his business if the property is condemned. He bought the business in 1999, attracted to its location near the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge, formerly known as the Triborough. “I thought I was buying an opportunity to run our business and have the property appreciate in value,” he said.Proponents of the project argue that the property owners should have known that someday their property could be subject to eminent domain because it sat within the old urban development zone. But both Mr. Spindler and Mr. Bae said title records indicated that their properties were not part of that plan when they bought them.“Our properties were carved out of the urban renewal plan,” Mr. Bae said.The business owners say they remain in limbo while the court case plays out.“Now I don’t know if I’ll be here next year,” Mr. Bae said. “I’m afraid to make an investment in my business.”'"
"'11-02-05,'0','DALLAS — The N.F.L. and the players union will hold three negotiating sessions in the next week starting Saturday with one month to go before their collective bargaining agreement expires.During his annual state of the league address Friday, Commissioner Roger Goodell reiterated the familiar talking points from the last 18 months, defending management’s push for an 18-game regular season and saying the revenue split with players had swung too far in the union’s favor.The deal expires on March 3. Goodell would not say definitively that owners would lock players out if that date passed without an agreement. But Jeff Pash, the lead negotiator for the owners, said the sides would have to make significant progress by then before they could extend the deadline. Goodell reiterated that he believed it would be more difficult to complete a new deal if the deadline passed, because the N.F.L. anticipates losing revenue from sponsors and season ticket holders.The Pittsburgh Steelers chairman emeritus Dan Rooney said he thought that the $9 billion the N.F.L. generates annually was enough to satisfy everyone. The New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said Friday he believed a new deal could be reached in a week, and called it “criminal” if one was not completed.Pash said: “It’s time to stop the public events. It’s time to stop the pep rallies. It’s time to stop the Congressional visits. It’s time to stop the litigation. Tell the litigators to stay home. Tell the lobbyists to stay home. Tell the public relations spin doctors to stay home. Let’s get into negotiations and let’s spend as much time negotiating as we’ve spent litigating.”Questions about labor dominated the 45-minute news conference that served as a precursor to the first full negotiating session since Thanksgiving. Goodell and the union chief, DeMaurice Smith, have spoken regularly and smaller groups of officials have met, but the sides agreed to increase the frequency of meetings in coming weeks.Owners and union leaders are expected to meet for at least two hours Saturday at a Dallas hotel, amid an NFL Network report that union officials have discussed with player agents the possibility of having their clients boycott the scouting combine later this month or draft activities in April. The combine is a showcase for college players hoping to improve their draft stock by working out for — and more important, submitting to interviews by — coaches and general managers. The draft will be held as scheduled in April, even if there is no new labor deal by then.Goodell took issue with a contention made by Smith that the share of revenue going to players has gone down since the 2006 deal was struck. Players receive nearly 60 percent of revenue after owners receive a $1 billion cost credit for operating expenses, which is deducted from the revenue pool.“If you want to deal with facts, the president of the union, just in the last week, said that the players got a great deal in 2006,” Goodell said, referring to a statement by Kevin Mawae. “And that clearly is indicating that the pendulum has shifted too far in one direction. You want to make sure that it’s fair to the clubs. You want to make sure it’s fair to the players, but allow our great game to grow. Since 2006, we have not built a new stadium, and that is an issue for us.“This agreement needs to be addressed so we can make the kinds of investments that grow this game and make it great for our fans.”'"
"'11-02-05,'0','In order to view this feature, you must download the latest version of flash player hereAbout 10 minutes into a question-and-answer session with the news media Thursday, DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association, was asked to elaborate on his recent comments comparing player-owner labor negotiations to war.The question seemed to catch the normally glib Smith off guard.For a few moments, Smith, who turned 47 Thursday, searched for words that might justify equating the physical and emotional scars of war with millionaire football players and even richer owners fighting over a portion of a $9 billion annual pie.Smith first evoked the memory of the 1987 strike, when players tried to stop replacements from crossing their picket lines. Then he said that in the privacy of a meeting among player representatives, blunt talk was often required.“We talk about what’s going to be expected of us as leaders — when we pretty much huddle around and have that locker room to talk about the business of football — I’m not sure that any of the guys that I continue to talk to shy away from blunt language,” Smith said.“Look, our job is to get a C.B.A. done as quickly as possible,” he added, referring to the collective bargaining agreement. “A lot of that, if not all of that, depends on the leaders that you see here. There is not a day that I’m ever going to apologize for the leaders that we have. There is never going to be a day where I don’t believe in the vision or leadership of the people that came before us. Make sense?”Of course not.Smith never properly answered the question, and in the process missed an opportunity to lay out for a puzzled public the nature of the conflict between the players and the owners.The truth is, the issues in the emerging labor conflict reflect some of the casualties that are seen in a real war, though relatively benign versions of them.Concussions, early-onset Alzheimer’s, routine joint replacements and emotional disorders have all been exposed as part of the dark side of an industry that runs on young bodies.Smith used the wrong metaphor, but he struck the necessary tone.Instead of uncharacteristically tiptoeing around the issue, Smith should have said — after apologizing to real soldiers — that he wanted to convey the seriousness of the predicament in which 1,900 pro football players find themselves.Five years ago, Gene Upshaw, who led the union for 25 years, used the war analogy during a conversation before Super Bowl XL. In 1987, Upshaw took on the owners in a valiant but ill-fated confrontation. He was concerned that a generation of players was not prepared to take to the streets.“We’ve had labor peace for so long that I’ve been preparing in the event that we have to fight,” Upshaw said in 2006. “For every generation, there should be a war, so children will know how to fight one. I’m not going to make a deal that does not make sense, where we don’t get our fair share.”A month later, Upshaw and the commissioner at the time, Paul Tagliabue, reached an agreement that gave players a whopping 59.5 percent of profits. The deal was supposed to last through 2012, but it so favored the players that the owners exercised an opt-out clause in 2008.The owners want players to give up an additional $1 billion of the gross revenue. They want to add two games to the regular season, and they want to impose a rookie wage scale.The players are adamant in contending that an 18-game schedule is unacceptable.How, they say, can a league that pushes player safety — to the extent that it changes rules in midseason and can fine a players tens of thousands of dollars for an improper hit — insist on two additional highly competitive regular-season games?Long-term health benefits are critical. In fact, vested N.F.L. players, more than any other group of professional athletes, should insist on a form of lifetime health insurance, because most of the maladies they face begin to show up long after their playing days have ended.The union must articulate more effectively why a public that has been ravaged by the economy should identify wealthy athletes as fellow workers.“Our fans don’t want to hear us whining about health coverage and free agency,” said Kevin Mawae, the union president. “They don’t care. They just want football on the field next year, and we as players want to play football.”The larger question for Smith is, how strongly do players believe in this cause? Even, is there a cause?Indeed, the players are content; it’s the unhappy owners who would be doing the locking out, if it came to that.Do players who stand to lose millions have a commitment to remain united and locked out until a suitable deal is worked out?The Jets free-agent cornerback Antonio Cromartie has complained about the apparent lack of urgency on both sides, given all that is at stake, especially for players. You can bet that Cromartie is not alone.“Our players have always understood the importance of the situation,” Mawae said. “We understand that this game is built on the shoulders of those guys who struggled in 1987, and our players certainly understand the importance of losing health care, and losing your benefits and not having the game to play that they love and losing their salary and having to make ends meet. Our players understand that.”We’ll find out in a month if they really believe it.'"
"'11-02-05,'0','A student production of “Joe Turner’s Come and Gone” that overcame the objections of a school superintendent in order to proceed has been temporarily halted by Mother Nature. The Waterbury Arts Magnet School in Waterbury, Conn., had planned to perform that August Wilson play this week, but postponed the performances after the recent heavy snowfalls in the Northeast. Dana Manning, the school’s fine arts coordinator, told The Republican-American newspaper of Waterbury that the bad weather had prevented rehearsals. Additional performances planned for next week were also likely to be rescheduled and new dates were not immediately announced. The Waterbury Board of Education said in January that the school’s production of the play, set in 1911 at a Pittsburgh boardinghouse where several freed slaves reside, could proceed, overruling an earlier decision by the superintendent, David L. Snead. Mr. Snead, who is black, had sought to cancel the play because the word “nigger” appears multiple times in its dialogue. During the board meeting at which the decision was announced, the production was defended by the high school students in its cast, as well as by James Bundy, artistic director of Yale Repertory Theater, where “Joe Turner” and other Wilson plays were developed.'"
"'11-02-05,'0','More than 40 percent of residents walk to work, Ms. Berger said.The Federal Reserve Bank is still in Lower Manhattan, as is Deutsche Bank. Goldman Sachs recently built a new headquarters for thousands of employees. Oppenheimer Funds, Dow Jones and Commerzbank, whose leases expire soon, are expected to remain in Lower Manhattan. Morgan Stanley, whose headquarters is in Times Square, is looking for more space there.Still, the very institutions that symbolize the citadel of capitalism are moving or changing in ways that will continue to transform the old financial district. With an ever-increasing percentage of trading conducted electronically at both the New York Stock Exchange and the Commodities Exchange, financial firms no longer feel that being located near those institutions is necessary.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation moved to the Empire State Building from Lower Manhattan last year, and next year, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which clears and trades securities for many brokerages and banks, will move the bulk of its operations and 1,400 employees to Jersey City.Both American International Group and Merrill Lynch, once among the largest employers in the area, are shrinking. So the loss of Deloitte, and possibly Nomura, is a blow to Lower Manhattan, some real estate executives say, especially with at least two skyscrapers being built at ground zero.“The situation with Nomura and Deloitte isn’t the end of the world,” said Peter G. Riguardi, president of New York operations for Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate broker. “But it’s disappointing, a setback.”Since the 1960s, financial firms have been moving from the area to more modern buildings in Midtown, where they could be closer to clients and to the homes of their workers. Concerned about costs, banks began shifting their data operations to the office towers sprouting on the Jersey City waterfront 20 years ago. Fidelity, like its rivals Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, also moved there to reduce costs.But for many city officials, landlords and real estate executives, the idea that Deloitte and Nomura would remain in the financial district was a foregone conclusion.Last August, the Bloomberg administration agreed to provide Deloitte with up to $21 million in tax breaks to expand its payroll, with the understanding that it would enlarge its presence at the World Financial Center. It would take as much as 630,000 square feet as it moved its world and United States headquarters from Midtown to Lower Manhattan.But in December, Deloitte began to focus on Rockefeller Center, which offered more prestigious, but older and presumably more expensive office space in Midtown. Real estate executives familiar with the negotiations said that many Deloitte partners preferred being in Midtown, closer to their competitors and to Grand Central Terminal. Since the deal is not yet finalized, no one involved is willing to discuss it. But city officials told Deloitte that they would be far less generous with tax incentives if the company left the financial district.Real estate brokers said that Deloitte’s move to Rockefeller Center would be dependent, in part, on the law firm Chadbourne & Parke’s vacating its offices there. The brokers said that the law firm is talking to Boston Properties, which was hoping to build a new billion-dollar office tower at Eighth Avenue and 55th Street.Nomura had also nearly renewed its lease at the World Financial Center when the bank opened talks with the owner of Worldwide Plaza, an office tower on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. Nomura’s current landlord, Brookfield Office Properties, is still battling to keep the bank downtown.“Downtown’s success cannot come just from financial services,” Mr. Riguardi said.The loss of both Deloitte and Nomura, more than 1 million square feet combined, would increase Lower Manhattan’s already rising vacancy rate. But officials contend that the neighborhood, where rents are about 30 percent lower than in Midtown, will be increasingly attractive.Also, the city’s two newest and most technologically advanced skyscrapers are expected to open in 2013 at ground zero. Condé Nast, which was negotiating to bring its stable of chic magazines to the first tower, would draw an increasing range of companies to the area, brokers said.Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city’s Economic Development Corporation, said that financial services must remain an important part of that area’s economy. But, he added, “We’re encouraged, though, by the complementary evolution that has been taking place in the area, evidenced by the explosive growth of its residential population and the arrival of new and growing industries.”'"

"'11-02-06,'0','Chicago has largely been brought to us on fictional television through the defibrillator. So many pulses were revived over so many years on “Chicago Hope” and “ER” that the city came to seem like some sort of Lourdes for secularists. “Chicago,” you could envision a tourist slogan saying, “the place to be when you need an emergency triple bypass.” Natives must have hungered for a more expansive evocation of their hometown, one that explored the dirty genetics of a place that gave rise to both Al Capone and Rod Blagojevich. Citizens were possibly even irritated when Baltimore received rich dramatic excavation in “The Wire” before their own city had even been skimmed. Chicago taught Baltimore everything it knows.In some sense “The Chicago Code” (beginning Monday on Fox) seeks to redress past slights. It is a drama about good cops and bad politicians, the gung-ho efforts of driven law enforcers to plug the drain of the city’s cash-for-favors economy. In the last 36 years, according to one report, 31 former or sitting Chicago city aldermen have been convicted of corruption or other crimes. Bribes, kickbacks, suspiciously well-compensated construction companies, organized-crime alliances — this is the stockpot in which the series stirs its wooden spoon. For the most part the flavors blend well.It takes a while, though, for the show to settle in, to knock off the checklist of pandering network mandates. “The Chicago Code” comes to us from Shawn Ryan, creator of “The Shield,” the great FX narrative of police corruption, which ran for seven seasons without succumbing to the cheap, rapid panning shots and cloddish exposition this new venture bestows in the first hour.Presumably, if “The Chicago Code” had been on cable, we would not be reminded with alarm-clock regularity that the city’s new police superintendent is a woman, a billboarding that is doubly superfluous given her arrival in the form of Jennifer Beals. On cable we might also have received a police superintendent with the creased skin and poor muscle-to-fat ratio to actually look like a bureaucrat. At 47 Ms. Beals remains ageless and stunning, but her placid beauty could not suit the character, Teresa Colvin, any less than if producers had scoured juice bars looking for a pretty server of antioxidant smoothies. It is hard to endure as Ms. Beals tough-talks her way to the appearance of managerial self-confidence and harder still to bear witness to a Chicago accent she can neither master nor even momentarily sustain.Did she grow up in Dallas? No, Ms. Beals, alas, is from Chicago. Whether she once spoke with flat A’s and ditched them at Yale, where she studied in the ’80s, is hard to know, but there seems little hope of her ever authentically retrieving them. In Colvin she is made to deliver her labored annunciations in service of playing a working-class girl motivated to take down venal big-city bosses because they essentially ruined her father’s life. The only relationship she seems to have is with her former partner, a volatile ace detective named Jarek Wysocki (played by the wonderful Jason Clarke of “Brotherhood”). Though Wysocki seems to possess a bottomless well of loyalty, other cops voice antipathy at Colvin’s brusque manner and imperiousness.'"

"'11-02-06,'0','That and comptroller are down-ballot contests, and because those offices have little or nothing to do with state policy on family planning and abortion, Ms. Combs’s views on those matters didn’t really come into play during those campaigns. She hasn’t faced a Republican opponent since that first statewide election in 1998.Ms. Hutchison was the last abortion-rights Republican to win a high-profile primary, taking the G.O.P. nomination for United States Senate in 1994, but that was an unusual situation. She had won a special election to the seat in 1993, and the six challengers were relative pipsqueaks. Ms. Hutchison got 84.3 percent of the vote and hasn’t faced a re-election primary since.She had a primary, though — the 2010 gubernatorial primary contest between Mr. Perry, who won; Debra Medina, a political newcomer; and Ms. Hutchison, who brought in less than a third of the vote.It wasn’t the key point in the race, but Ms. Hutchison’s answer on whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned during one of the debates sunk her with the anti-abortion faction. “What concerns me about that is that we would then have some states that would allow abortion as the baby is coming out of the birth canal,” Ms. Hutchison said. “I would never support that. I have voted against it, and I would not want that to be the situation in any state in our country.”The same issue bedeviled her in the 1993 campaign. “I’m not for abortion,” she said then. “It makes me very uncomfortable. I would never have one. I value life very much. The question is, Should I make that decision for you, and that’s where I come down on the other side.”That’s the position Ms. Combs took in her first election for the House in 1992. Since then, anti-abortion groups have not endorsed her or her opponents. Texas Right to Life’s voter guides in 2006 and 2010 skipped the comptroller’s race. The 2010 version included endorsements in six of the seven statewide nonjudicial races — all except for comptroller.Joe Pojman at Texas Alliance for Life said that Ms. Combs had never filled out the group’s questionnaires and that he did not remember ever giving her the group’s support. Mr. Patterson and Mr. Staples, among others, got that group’s backing as well as that of Texas Right to Life.Speaking of an abortion-rights Republican’s winning a big primary race, Mr. Pojman said: “It’s getting hard for that to happen. It’s very rare.”Ms. Combs said through an aide that she would not be available for an interview on her abortion stance until after the legislative session. Abortion-rights groups haven’t marked her as one of their own — she didn’t carry their legislation or overtly back their positions when she was in the House. Anti-abortion groups also haven’t claimed her.She’s got some time to make her choice.'"
"'11-02-06,'0','MIAMI (AP) — The United States should stop deporting Haitians who are seriously ill or who have family members in America, a human rights group said Friday.Deporting sick Haitians could jeopardize their lives, especially those who would be exposed to unsanitary conditions in Haitian jails because they have criminal records or are facing charges, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said in a statement.Twenty-seven Haitians were sent back to their country on Jan. 20, all but one of whom had been convicted of a crime in the United States. One of them died recently after suffering from choleralike symptoms in a Haitian jail.An outbreak of cholera in Haiti has killed at least 4,000 people since October and has sickened 200,000 others. The commission called for stopping deportations until conditions improve.The United States suspended deportations to Haiti in January 2010 after a catastrophic earthquake struck the nation, the poorest in the Western Hemisphere. In December, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced that it would resume deporting Haitians convicted of serious crimes in this country.Several legal and immigrant rights groups had asked the commission, which is based in Washington, to intervene. On Friday, they urged the federal government to heed the group’s recommendations.'"
"'11-02-06,'0','Without making any judgment on either side of these aspects of our American culture, it is important to note that China seems to have more of a monoculture, imbuing its people with a sense of being part of a collective whole. In the coming decade it will be interesting to see how its monoculture fares in the wake of growing economic prosperity, and how the United States economy fares in the wake of our eroding social fabric.I was glad to see you raise the issue of the “where are you from?” question. Those of us who look different (not white) are frequently asked this offensive question. Most who ask are innocently curious, but they don’t realize that by asking “where are you from?” in terms of racial heritage, they are implying that we aren’t “real” Americans.When someone asks me “where are you from?” I answer literally (the United States, Oregon or my hometown), prompting the lovely follow-up question “No, where are you from?” Obviously, I’m meant to realize that he or she is asking for my racial background, yet the phrasing sets me apart: not a real American, but someone in America originating elsewhere.I am an American of Japanese and European extraction. My mother’s family has lived here for more than 100 years, and my father’s ancestors fought against the British. And yet, every time someone asks those questions I am reduced to defending my right to simply be “American.”I have recollections of how Virginia’s racial laws affected my multiracial families — Hemings and Bolling.Up until 1910, if a person had less than one-quarter of Negro blood and was free, that person was legally white. When some of my Hemings family members were freed, they didn’t have to pass for white in Virginia because by law they were white.The Racial Integrity Law of 1924 deemed anyone with a single drop of nonwhite blood as being colored. But there was one exception to the law — often referred to as the Pocahontas exemption. Had this exemption not existed, some of my Bolling family members, like Rear Adm. Richard Byrd, the polar explorer, Edith Bolling Wilson, wife of President Woodrow Wilson, and many others, who claimed descent from Pocahontas, would have been classified as colored in Virginia.We noted that many of the biracial young people interviewed in your article were also binational, meaning born to parents of different nationalities.In our research on ethnic identity formation of binational and biracial young adult Americans, we found that having one foreign-born parent and thus a deep understanding of at least one other culture and worldview had a significant, positive impact on the participants’ understanding of themselves and their place in the world.Early on, these binational and biracial individuals learned that the meaning of race is contextual; their being biracial in America was a totally different experience from being biracial in other countries, especially in countries that use identity constructions for people of a mixed racial background. These young adults know, from personal experience, that racial identity is a fluid, culturally determined phenomenon, and that how they are seen, racially, and whether that perception carries positive, negative or neutral connotations, depends on where they are.Your article was excellent, but missed this significant aspect of the biracial experience in the United States.The writers are, respectively, associate clinical professor of epidemiology and population and family health, Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University; and clinical director, Psychological and Consultation Services, East Lansing, Mich.Oh, big deal! In 1947, as college students, we used to answer the race question with “human.” Each generation thinks it’s inventing the wheel!'"

"'11-02-06,'0','But the real breakthrough came with the extravagant addition of many multiple “expert” analyzers — more than 100 different techniques running concurrently to analyze natural language, appraise sources, propose hypotheses, merge the results and rank the top guesses. Answers, for Watson, are a statistical thing, a matter of frequency and likelihood. If, after a couple of seconds, the countless possibilities produced by the 100-some algorithms converge on a solution whose chances pass Watson’s threshold of confidence, it buzzes in.This raises the question of whether Watson is really answering questions at all or is just noticing statistical correlations in vast amounts of data. But the mere act of building the machine has been a powerful exploration of just what we mean when we talk about knowing.Who knows how Mr. Jennings and Mr. Rutter do it — puns cracked, ambiguities resolved, obscurities retrieved, links formed across every domain in creation, all in a few heartbeats. The feats of engineering involved in answering the smallest query about the world are beyond belief. But I.B.M. is betting a fair chunk of its reputation that 2011 will be the year that machines can play along at the game.Does Watson stand a chance of winning? I would not stake my “Final Jeopardy!” nest egg on it. Not yet. Words are very rascals, and language may still be too slippery for it. But watching films of the machine in sparring matches against lesser human champions, I felt myself choking up at its heroic effort, the size of the undertaking, the centuries of accumulating groundwork, hope and ingenuity that have gone into this next step in the long human drama. I was most moved when the 100-plus parallel algorithms wiped out and the machine came up with some ridiculous answer, calling it out as if it might just be true, its cheerful synthesized voice sounding as vulnerable as that of any bewildered contestant.It does not matter who will win this $1 million Valentine’s Day contest. We all know who will be champion, eventually. The real showdown is between us and our own future. Information is growing many times faster than anyone’s ability to manage it, and Watson may prove crucial in helping to turn all that noise into knowledge.Dr. Ferrucci and company plan to sell the system to businesses in need of fast, expert answers drawn from an overwhelming pool of supporting data. The potential client list is endless. A private Watson will cost millions today and requires a room full of hardware. But if what Ray Kurzweil calls the Law of Accelerating Returns keeps holding, before too long, you’ll have an app for that.Like so many of its precursors, Watson will make us better at some things, worse at others. (Recall Socrates’ warnings about the perils of that most destabilizing technology of all — writing.) Already we rely on Google to deliver to the top of the million-hit list just those pages we are most interested in, and we trust its concealed algorithms with a faith that would be difficult to explain to the smartest computer. Even if we might someday be able to ask some future Watson how fast and how badly we are cooking the earth, and even if it replied (based on the sum of all human knowledge) with 90 percent accuracy, would such an answer convert any of the already convinced or produce the political will we’ll need to survive the reply?Still, history is the long process of outsourcing human ability in order to leverage more of it. We will concede this trivia game (after a very long run as champions), and find another in which, aided by our compounding prosthetics, we can excel in more powerful and ever more terrifying ways.Should Watson win next week, the news will be everywhere. We’ll stand in awe of our latest magnificent machine, for a season or two. For a while, we’ll have exactly the gadget we need. Then we’ll get needy again, looking for a newer, stronger, longer lever, for the next larger world to move.For “Final Jeopardy!”, the category is “Players”: This creature’s three-pound, 100-trillion-connection machine won’t ever stop looking for an answer.The question: What is a human being?'"
"'11-02-06,'0','Last year, the situation would probably have unfolded very differently.Democrats would have tried to bring up the bill but then taken parliamentary steps to block amendments, to prevent Republicans from having an opportunity to make a political point. In retaliation, Republicans would have forced Democrats to assemble 60 votes just to get the bill to the floor. Then days, if not weeks, would have passed with nothing much transpiring as lawmakers looked for a way out of their procedural morass.Though the Senate still has to slog through a list of amendments to the Federal Aviation Administration bill, the end result could be a measure that both sides agree received a fair and ample hearing, even if no one is entirely pleased with the legislative outcome.“It is encouraging,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, who helped to negotiate rules changes intended to improve procedural civility.Democrats were not thrilled with the prospect of allowing Senate Republicans to force a vote on repealing the health care law. But Democrats figured that they had the votes to defeat the proposal and might as well get it over with since Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, was going to press the issue until he got his vote.In the end, Democrats found that allowing the amendment to come to a vote was somewhat like a trip to the dentist — it didn’t really hurt all that bad. Democrats who are not part of the leadership also have something to gain from a more open approach because it allows them a chance to offer amendments to measures, opportunities that they, too, were denied in the past.Republicans were also satisfied with the way things played out since they got the chance to at least have their say.“This is the way the Senate ought to work,” said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the third-ranking Republican. “An important bill got to the floor. It is getting a whole variety of amendments on everything from the Davis-Bacon Act to health care. We will end up passing a bill and take a step that we should have taken some time ago.“Truth is, it is not taking any longer than it used to because we were just sitting around doing nothing,” Mr. Alexander said.The new agreement is in its infancy and could easily collapse in the coming weeks. Across the Rotunda, the new House Republican majority has pledged a more open floor debate but has already found fulfilling the letter of its promise to be difficult.The Senate has gone the traditional route in the recent past. After Democrats expanded their numbers in the 2008 Senate elections, Mr. Reid began 2009 by opening the floor to more amendments. But the atmosphere quickly deteriorated in the fight over the economic stimulus and health care measures, and the result was that the Senate faced scores of filibuster fights over the next two years.But there are reasons the truce could hold this time. With the Senate more closely divided at 53 to 47, Democrats can no longer hope to pick off just one or two Republicans to reach the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster. They need more consensus to move bills, and a more open and equal floor process is one way to build that consensus.In addition, the Congressional agenda headed into a presidential election year is much narrower than it was in the first two years of President Obama’s tenure. Then, Democrats pushed the economic stimulus, new regulations governing Wall Street and the health care measure, to name just three of the more contentious bills. The Senate can afford to take its time on measures like the aviation bill.Whatever the reason, lawmakers said that the way the Senate is operating in its early weeks bodes well for the future, when more difficult subjects like deficit reduction await.“It is creating a better environment for dealing with the really tough issues we have coming,” Mr. Alexander said.'"
"'11-02-06,'0','But Nasdaq and market experts said there was an important distinction between the parts of the system that are connected to the Web, and thus more vulnerable, and the architecture for the trading platform, which Nasdaq says operates independently.The company said it had determined that a Web-based application on its servers called Directors Desk, on which corporations can store and share information, might have been affected. Nasdaq said the suspicious files “were immediately removed and at this point there is no evidence that any Directors Desk customer information was accessed or acquired by hackers.”“At no point was any of Nasdaq OMX’s operated or serviced trading platforms compromised,” the company said.The company’s Web site says Directors Desk has 5,000 users.A spokesman for the company said it discovered the suspicious files late last year.The fact that investigators discovered suspicious files suggests that the breach involved the installation of malicious software, or malware, said Ed Stroz, a former FBI agent who is co-president of Stroz Friedberg, a firm that investigates cyberattacks.In attacks on companies, Mr. Stroz said, hackers often plant malware that acts as a back door, which allows them to deliver other malicious programs to do other tasks, which could include copying sensitive data and delivering it to the intruder.Malware could have been installed any number of ways, including with an attack through the Web interface of Directors Desk or by infiltrating an executive’s computer by tricking him into opening an attachment or clicking on a link to a malicious Web page in an e-mail.Nasdaq now handles about 19 percent of stock trading in the United States, compared with 27 percent by the larger New York Stock Exchange and its electronic trading arm.In a statement, the New York Stock Exchange said: “We take any potential threat seriously and we continue working at the highest levels of security and integrity.” The N.Y.S.E. would not say whether there had been any attempts to breach its systems or whether it had been contacted by federal investigators.News of the breach was originally reported in The Wall Street Journal.Nasdaq said it had refrained from notifying its customers of the breach at the request of the Justice Department, “in order to facilitate the continuing investigation,” but that when the Journal article appeared it consulted with authorities and decided to send out notice.The Journal article said the investigation showed some evidence pointing toward Russia. One government official said investigators were specifically looking into that possibility, although the official said, “I don’t know what the basis for the belief is.”The stock exchanges and the trading that takes place on them have become increasingly computerized, potentially making them more vulnerable to manipulation or attack. Like Nasdaq, the N.Y.S.E. has also adopted more electronic trading. And in the last five years or so, other electronic exchanges like Direct Edge and BATS Exchange have arisen, intent on prying trading away from the two bigger markets. Direct Edge and BATS each handle about 10 percent of the market.A spokesman for the BATS Exchange said it had never had any hacking issue of this kind.A spokesman for Direct Edge, Rafi Reguer, said it was continually monitoring its systems but was not aware of any serious attempt to penetrate its computers.'"

"'11-02-06,'0','Afghanistan’s Constitution, established in 2004, guarantees that people are “free to exercise their faith.” But it also leaves it open for the courts to rely on Shariah, or Islamic law, on issues like conversion. Under some interpretations of Shariah, leaving Islam is considered apostasy, an offense punishable by hanging.Mr. Mussa, 46, is staring at the prospect of a death sentence.Mr. Mussa was arrested after a television station in Kabul broadcast images that it claimed showed Westerners baptizing Afghans and other Afghans praying at private Christian meetings. The broadcast stoked fears of proselytizing brought on by the influx of foreigners since the American-led invasion in 2001. Some lawmakers publicly declared that converts should die.Since his arrest, Mr. Mussa said, guards at one jail slapped him and beat him with sticks. At another, two prisoners who learned of the charges against him assaulted and raped him, urged on by Taliban inmates.“The Taliban were saying, ‘He is an infidel, he is filthy and he needs to be killed,’ ” he recalled.Mr. Mussa has not seen his wife and six children in months, since they fled to Pakistan for their safety. He is not even sure if he has a lawyer; he signed agreements with two, then never saw them again.His treatment has been better, he said, since the American Embassy intervened on his behalf about two months ago to have him transferred here to the Kabul Detention Center.Diplomats and Afghan officials, meanwhile, have tried to keep it out of the spotlight, fearing that publicity, particularly from the local news media, could set off an outcry from hard-line conservatives, endangering him and other Afghan Christians.Embassy officials have been quietly trying to find a political solution that could allow Mr. Mussa asylum in another country. But after months of intermittent measures by diplomats to free him, Christian advocates and members of Congress are growing frustrated, not least with the larger issue of underwriting an Afghan government that has not ensured religious freedom.“We cannot justify taxpayer dollars going to a government that allows the same restrictions on basic human rights that existed under the Taliban,” two Republican members of Congress, Representatives Trent Franks of Arizona, co-chairman of the International Religious Freedom Caucus, and Doug Lamborn of Colorado, wrote in a letter last fall to Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry, urging stronger action.In a sign of the case’s delicacy, officials with the Ministry of Justice and the Ulema Council, which advises the president on religious matters, refused to discuss it, even to talk in general about the law as it applies to conversion, which is not mentioned in the Afghan criminal code.A senior prosecutor closely involved in Mr. Mussa’s case, however, suggested that officials were feeling the weight of international pressure.“Based on Shariah law, whoever converts from Islam should be sentenced to death,” said the prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “But based on international agreements that Afghanistan has accepted and agreed with, Sayed Mussa has a chance to be released.”The Afghan government has not executed anyone for religious crimes since the Taliban’s fall, though at least one person has been sentenced to death: Parvez Kambakhsh, a journalism student, who in 2008 was condemned for blasphemy for distributing material found on the Internet questioning women’s rights under Islam. A court later commuted the sentence to 20 years before President Hamid Karzai pardoned him.Another man, Shoaib Assadullah Musawi, has been jailed in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif since November after being accused of giving the New Testament to a friend, who then turned him in.Afghan and American legal experts say such cases are rare. But in the handful that have emerged publicly, it has taken Western intervention to secure a release, leaving the central ambiguities in the Constitution unresolved.“The problem of not following due process and not properly defining constitutional limits and rights is across the board,” said Scott Worden, senior rule of law adviser for Afghanistan for the United States Institute of Peace. “It’s one of many signs that Afghanistan’s legal system has a long way to go before it can be considered up to international standards.”An ethnic Hazara, a minority group long oppressed in Afghanistan, Mr. Mussa grew up a Shiite Muslim in the central highlands around Bamian Province. He lost his leg to a land mine as a young man serving in the army of the Soviet-backed government. For the last 16 years before his arrest, he worked for the International Committee of the Red Cross, helping amputees get fitted with artificial limbs.He became intrigued by Christianity, he said, when a jet bombed a neighbor’s home in Kabul where he lived during the civil war that followed the Soviet withdrawal. The home’s owner, an impoverished porter with eight children, was at the market when the bomb hit, killing seven of his family members. But not long after, two foreign women drove up and helped dig through the rubble amid gunfire from factional forces.“When I saw these women and their compassion for my people, it affected me,” he said. “I asked people who they were and they said they are the followers of Jesus Christ.”In time he found another Afghan Christian in his neighborhood who gave him a copy of the New Testament, and later baptized him.He now spends his days at Kabul Detention Center, living in a corridor among a handful of other prisoners. He signed an agreement late last year with a foreign lawyer but then never saw him again. Unbeknownst to Mr. Mussa, a judge barred the lawyer, a South African, from representing or seeing Mr. Mussa.A second lawyer visited last month, Mr. Mussa said. But to him the lawyer seemed more like a prosecutor, asking him who converted him, who prayed with him and if he believed the Koran was the complete book of God.“If you go back to Islam, I can help you,” Mr. Mussa recalled the lawyer, Mohammad Mostafa, saying.Mr. Mostafa, who declined interview requests, works for the Legal Aid Organization of Afghanistan, which said he still represented Mr. Mussa. His boss, Mohammad Afzal Nooristani, said defense lawyers — a profession barely a few years old here — were loath to take apostasy cases, fearing reprisals from the authorities and the public.Mr. Nooristani has even heard mullahs broadcast ominous warnings during Friday Prayer. “They said people who represent infidels are also infidels,” he said.Mr. Mussa, meanwhile, longs to see his wife and children again. He wants either to be freed or to go to court, even if it means his execution. “Staying in here,” he said, “is like dying every minute.”'"
"'11-02-06,'0','“We don’t want to be like Afghanistan and the Taliban and remove things like that,” Ali al-Mousawi, a spokesman for Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, said, referring to the infamous destruction of the Buddha statues in Bamian, Afghanistan, “or to be like the Germans and remove the Berlin Wall.”“We are a civilized people,” he added, “and this monument is a part of the memories of this country.”The work is part of a $194 million beautification project ahead of the summit meeting of Arab League leaders scheduled for March in Baghdad.That meeting is already weighted with political significance simply because of its host: Iraq, a country at odds with many of its Arab neighbors before and after the war, but now seeking a pride of place in the international community. The turmoil sweeping the Arab world right now is likely to bring even more attention to the meeting.At a minimum, the Iraqis appear eager to polish a capital still scarred by war and decades of disrepair.In recent weeks, the government has begun rebuilding the road from the airport, not long ago a white-knuckled gantlet through insurgent badlands. Inside the heavily fortified Green Zone, where the monument is located amid embassies and government buildings, workers have removed many of the ubiquitous concrete blast walls erected to protect against mortar rounds and car bombs. It has planted flowers and trees along medians and traffic circles that Arab dignitaries are likely to pass.The impetus for preserving the monument itself, popularly known as the Crossed Swords, was the destruction of another monument built by Mr. Hussein after Iraq’s defeat in the Persian Gulf war in 1991.A concrete sculpture of clasped hands in western Baghdad — supposed to represent Arab unity after the war — was demolished last year to make way for a highway overpass, prompting angry protests that Iraq’s authorities were trying to rewrite all of the country’s past. Mr. Mousawi said that the prime minister, then in the middle of a re-election fight he ultimately won, ordered the Victory Arch to be preserved.Mr. Hussein ordered the arch built in 1985 in a letter later inscribed on a tablet near one pair of the swords. (It has since been defaced, his name and that of Iran’s revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, scratched out.)It was a propagandistic monument to a war against Iran that neither country won, despite savage losses on both sides. It was dedicated in 1989, barely a year before the invasion of Kuwait, another lost war and, in a way, the beginning of the end of his government.The crossed swords, said to be forged from the weapons of fallen Iraqi soldiers, bracket a parade ground and viewing stand, where Mr. Hussein reveled in the glory he felt was due to him. It is one of the largest public monuments ever built, according to Mr. Makiya’s book. At its dedication, Mr. Hussein rode a white stallion through it, passing over the helmets of Iranian soldiers that are cemented into the bases of the thrusting swords.Most monuments, murals and other manifestations of Mr. Hussein’s power were long ago removed, beginning with his statue in Firdos Square in April 2003. A committee reviewing monuments recommended dismantling the Victory Arch in 2007, but the work was aborted shortly after it began when some Iraqi and American officials complained. It has remained in limbo, however, weeds sprouting on the parade grounds between the arches and trash gathering in piles. Few ordinary Iraqis ever pass, let alone visit, because access to the Green Zone remains restricted.Mr. Mousawi, the spokesman, said that unlike other monuments, the Victory Arch was not inextricably linked to the abuses of Mr. Hussein’s Baath Party dictatorship. “It does not impact the freedoms and rights of Iraqis,” he said.For many, though, it remains an awkward subject.“Talking about this now raises questions for me,” Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, one of Iraq’s most famous sculptors, who completed the work after the original sculptor died, said by telephone from Amman, Jordan. Surprised by news of the restoration, he said he was ill and declined to discuss the matter further. “Excuse me,” he apologized.The work has proceeded largely unnoticed. Several lawmakers contacted about the restoration expressed surprise and in some cases anger. “It will bring back the bad memories to people,” said Samira al-Mousawi, a member of Mr. Maliki’s bloc in Parliament. “It is not acceptable to bring it back.”The political movement led by the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr once led the campaign to demolish the monument. A leader of the movement, Hakim al-Zamili, suggested last week that the swords were an Arab symbol and should be preserved, but that the hands of a reviled dictator should not.Mr. Makiya, who now lives in Cambridge, Mass., also expressed surprise, but satisfaction. “I am glad it is being restored, not because it is a great work of art but because it is such a perfect symbol of the Baathist experience,” he said in an e-mail. “It is vulgar, but vulgar in an unspeakably horrible, terrible — and therefore unique — way.”'"
"'11-02-06,'0','AgeLab, like a handful of other research centers at universities and companies around the country, develops technologies to help older adults maintain their health, independence and quality of life. Companies come here to understand their target audience or to have their products, policies and services studied.Often, visitors learn hard truths at AgeLab: many older adults don’t like products, like big-button phones, that telegraph agedness. “The reality is such that you can’t build an old man’s product, because a young man won’t buy it and an old man won’t buy it,” Professor Coughlin says.The idea is to help companies design and sell age-friendly products — with customizable font size, say, or sound speed — much the way they did with environmentally friendly products. That means offering enticing features and packaging to appeal to a certain demographic without alienating other consumer groups. Baked potato chips are just one example of products that appeal to everybody but skew toward older people. Toothpastes that promise whitening or gum health are another.Researchers at AgeLab are studying the stress levels of older adults who operate a hands-free parallel-parking system developed by Ford Motor. Although this ultrasonic-assisted system may make backing up easier for older adults who can’t turn their necks to the same degree they once did, the car’s features — like blind-spot detection and a voice-activated audio system — are intended to appeal to all drivers who enjoy smart technology.“With any luck, if I am successful,” Professor Coughlin says, “retailers won’t know they are putting things on the shelves for older adults.”THE first of about 76 million baby boomers in the United States turned 65 in January. They are looking forward to a life expectancy that is higher than that of any previous generation.The number of people 65 and older is expected to more than double worldwide, to about 1.5 billion by 2050 from 523 million last year, according to estimates from the United Nations. That means people 65 and over will soon outnumber children under 5 for the first time ever. As a consequence, many people may have to defer their retirement — or never entirely retire — in order to maintain sustainable incomes.Many economists view such an exploding population of seventy- and eighty-somethings not as an asset, but as a looming budget crisis. After all, by one estimate, treating dementia worldwide already costs more than $600 billion annually.“No other force is likely to shape the future of national economic health, public finances and policy making,” analysts at Standard & Poor’s wrote in a recent report, “as the irreversible rate at which the world’s population is aging.”The S.&P. analysis, called “Global Aging 2010,” warns that many countries are not prepared to cover the pension and health care costs of so many additional retirees; if those governments do not radically alter their age-related spending policies in the next few decades, the report said, national debts will grow to rival — or even more than double — gross domestic product.But longevity-focused researchers including Professor Coughlin, whose blog is called Disruptive Demographics, are betting that baby boomers, unlike generations past, will not go gentle into the good night of long-term care. In fact, a few research groups at institutions like Oregon Health & Science University, M.I.T. and Stanford, along with foundations and the private sector, are devising policies and systems for an alternate scenario: older adults living independently at home for longer periods, whether that home is a private residence or a senior community.Devices for I’ve-fallen-and-I-can’t-get-up catastrophes, they say, represent the old business of old age. The new business of old age involves technologies and services that promote wellness, mobility, autonomy and social connectivity. These include wireless pillboxes that transmit information about patients’ medication use, as well as new financial services, like “Second Acts” from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, that help people plan for longer lives and second careers.Together, those kinds of products and services are already a multibillion-dollar market, industry analysts say. And if such innovations prove to promote health and independence, delaying entry into long-term care, the potential savings to the health care system could be even greater.That’s the upbeat message that Eric Dishman, the global director of health innovation at Intel, has been trying to get across to policy makers and industry executives for more than a decade. A charismatic health policy wonk, Mr. Dishman has held audiences at TedMed conferences spellbound with his lecture on the subject, in which he carts around an old-school rotary telephone, a prop dramatizing the need to connect older adults and technology.In his office in Beaverton, Ore., he demonstrates some prototypes, like a social networking system for senior housing centers, that older Americans are already testing. Often, he says, field studies of his gadgets result in “success catastrophes” — the devices prove so popular that testers and their families are loath to return them. The people testing the social network devices, for example, asked for extra models for off-campus friends.“There is an enormous market opportunity to deliver technology and services that allow for wellness and prevention and lifestyle enhancement,” he says. “Whichever countries or companies are at the forefront of that are going to own the category.”Industry is beginning to hear his message. Last month, a group including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Aegon said it had formed the Global Coalition on Aging, to help governments and industries better handle the age boom. “Companies are starting to think about how they can be age friendly much the same way they have been thinking about how they could be environmentally friendly over the last couple of decades,” says Andy Sieg, the head of retirement services at Bank of America.THE Mirabella, a new $130 million high-rise in the South Waterfront section of Portland, Ore., may be the greenest luxury retirement community in the nation.The building has solar-heated hot water, a garage where valets stack cars in racks atop one another, sensors that turn off the lights when stairways are empty and platinum certification from Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, the group that sets national benchmarks for sustainable building.The Mirabella also aspires to be the grayest — by providing an opportunity to develop and test the latest home-health technology and design concepts for older adults.The building’s architects, Ankrom Moisan Associated Architects, turned on its head the idea of putting retirees out to pasture. This urban high-rise, conveniently located next to Oregon Health and Science University, enables residents to stay as healthy, engaged and socially connected as possible, says Jeff Los, a principal in the firm.“Historically, upscale senior housing has been a rural three-story entity spread over 30 acres,” he says. “This is a 30-story building on one acre with a streetcar stop at the front door.”The developers, Pacific Retirement Services, bought land from the university with the idea of encouraging research next door, at the school’s Oregon Center for Aging & Technology, also known as Orcatech. As part of that project, the company spent nearly a half-million dollars to install fiber optic cables so that Mirabella residents could be encouraged to volunteer for a “living laboratory” program in which wireless motion sensors, installed in their apartments, track their mobility and, by extension, their health status in real time.Older adults in other parts of the city are already participating in the program; researchers hope to prove that continually monitoring them can help predict and prevent problems like falls, or even social withdrawal, says Dr. Jeffrey Kaye, a neurology professor who directs Orcatech.And some residents may eventually want to modify the monitoring system so that they can download and make use of their own health data, Mr. Los says.In fact, even before Mirabella opened last fall, residents asked for adjustments to the building. They demanded space in the garage for their kayaks, recalls Mr. Dishman, who serves on the building’s steering committee.“Baby boomers are going to be very different seniors,” he says.ABOUT 30 older adults in the greater Portland area have volunteered to participate in the Orcatech living laboratory program.Dorothy Rutherford, 86, a petite redhead with a deadpan wit, is one of them. And she is a model for the kind of independent aging, abetted by technology, that the researchers hope to encourage.Her bone-colored earrings — a gift from a dentist who made them from denture material — dangle as she gives me a tour of the equipment that researchers have installed in her apartment. Sensors that monitor the speed and frequency of her activity dot the ceilings and cling to furniture, appliances and doors.“I have no worries about privacy whatsoever,” she declares, waving at the ceiling. “They are just sensors, not video cameras.”A wireless smart pillbox reminds her to take her daily vitamins. A computer on which she plays specific word and number games tracks her daily scores.But her favorite experiment so far involved an anthropomorphic robot from Vgo Communications, nicknamed Celia, that was equipped with a video screen. Mrs. Rutherford’s granddaughter and great-granddaughter in Wyoming could remotely operate Celia any time they wanted to follow her around for a video chat.Mrs. Rutherford, a retired waitress, already uses Skype to talk to family members. But Skype is stationary, she says, while the robot conveniently wheels itself from room to room.“When I saw Celia the robot, I thought there are all kinds of possibilities to get you set up at home,” she says. “Why would somebody go to a retirement community if they can figure out a way to keep people home longer?”Even so, the pilot program is not inexpensive: it costs about $1,000 to set up each participant with a computer and $6 sensors, plus $2,600 a year for technical support, Internet access and home visits from researchers. Monitoring costs vary. (The robot, which is not a regular feature of the program and which participants tried for about a week each, costs $6,000 plus a monthly $100 service fee.)The continuous monitoring of people like Mrs. Rutherford may point the way to more preventive health care — an alternative to the pattern of doctors seeing elderly patients on an infrequent basis, often treating them only after they have developed acute illnesses or had accidents. “What if there were thousands of homes around America that had these simple systems in place?” Dr. Kaye of Orcatech says about the monitoring system.The idea is to determine whether changes in daily habits — like walking speed, posture, sleep, pill taking, computer game scores — can accurately predict things like cognitive decline or balance problems, allowing doctors to intervene before someone falls and, say, breaks a hip.Intel and General Electric recently started a joint venture, Intel-GE Care Innovations, to develop technologies that help older adults stay independent. They are already marketing the Intel Health Guide, a home monitoring system that helps doctors remotely manage patients’ care.There’s just one obstacle: the marketplace for age independence technology is in its infancy. Because of ageism, Mr. Dishman says, many retailers aren’t ready to make space for such products and many companies don’t even want to develop them.“Life enhancement technology for boomers is a chicken-and-egg problem,” he says. Is “the market going to take the first plunge, or are companies going to create technologies without knowing whether we can sell it?”He has been on a mission, he says, to have Congress put the issue on the national agenda; he’d also like to see the White House establish a commission on aging. The European Union, he points out, has already committed more than one billion euros to study technology and aging.But so far, the officials he has met with have not taken up the cause, he says. In the laundry list of initiatives in his State of the Union address last month, President Obama pushed clean energy, not gray tech.Mr. Dishman asks: “What do we need to do for aging and gray technology to have the same urgency and investment that global warming” and green technology have?Americans have come to associate agedness with frailty and disability rather than with institutional memory and expertise.“People somehow assume that when we are young, we are vital,” says Ken Dychtwald, the C.E.O. of AgeWave, a research and consulting organization that focuses on population aging. “Then, when we pass 40, we are on a downward slope to death.”For more than a quarter-century, Mr. Dychtwald, 60 and thus himself a baby boomer, has been trying to rebrand aging as a positive phenomenon. He’s coined a word — “middlescence” — to convey later life as a transformative stage, like adolescence, in which people have free time and an increased interest in trying new experiences. He also came up with an antidote to retirement: “rehirement.”Now that the oldest baby boomers are turning 65, he says, their sheer numbers may attract industries that had earlier shied away. “If you are a Fortune 100 company, or an inventor in a garage, where are you going to find another demographic that is that large, that robust in spending power, that open to new possibilities, and that underserved?” he asks. “There’s nothing to rival it.”In 2009, for example, baby-boomer households in the United States spent about $2.6 trillion, according to estimates from AgeWave based on a consumer expenditure survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.But so far, he says, very few companies have applied creative intelligence to understanding older adults and developing game-changing technologies, services, experiences and even new careers for them.Imagine a new real estate sector, he says, that caters to the former hippies among baby boomers who want to form retirement communities with friends by buying six-bedroom communal penthouses in Chicago or farms in Vermont. Or Internet cemeteries, he says, that would preserve video libraries of people’s lives for their descendants to enjoy.“Rather than viewing maturity as an opportunity to sell people a golf membership or an arthritis medicine,” he says, “since a person who turns 60 has another 20 years, why not create educational programs whereby people can be motivated to go out, learn new skills and have an encore?”AGNES, the age empathy suit developed by the M.I.T. AgeLab, is calibrated to simulate the dexterity, mobility, strength and balance of a 74-year-old. My empathy has clearly deepened after a few hours of road-testing it. But, sheepishly, I still want to shed the suit and its instant add-on decades.Professor Coughlin started AgeLab in 1999 to address what he calls “the longevity paradox” — the idea that, while people in many developed countries now live several decades longer than those born a century ago, very few policy makers, institutions and industries are dedicated to helping people make those extra decades healthy and productive.More than a decade later, with boomers starting to turn 65, experts like Professor Coughlin hope to make gray the new green. Their job would be easier if it were fun to wear Agnes.'"

"'11-02-06,'0','To present James Miller’s “Examined Lives” as evidence that academic philosophy “still has much to say about real life” is to misrepresent the work done by those of us who “spend all day studying philosophy in a university classroom” (“Up Front,” Jan. 23). The questions that today’s philosophers study may at first seem unrealistic — for example, when a runaway trolley is heading toward five people tied to a track, should you flip a switch to divert the trolley to another track where only one person is tied? But this question actually allows philosophers to zero in on important notions like moral responsibility, to tease apart the way killing someone may differ from allowing someone to die, and to understand how harm that is intended may differ from harm that was foreseen but unintended. To suggest that in worrying about such abstruse cases, academic philosophers have lost sight of “real life” is like saying that physics has ceased to be concerned with ordinary matter because so many physicists work with particle accelerators, studying the behavior of subatomic particles under highly controlled, artificial conditions.MARC LANGE Chapel Hill, N.C.The writer is a professor of philosophy at the University of North Carolina.In his Jan. 23 essay, “Thinkers and Dreamers,” James Ryerson claims that “it says something about philosophy that two of its greatest practitioners, Aristotle and Kant, were pretty terrible writers.” I cannot defend Kant, but Ryerson’s complaint about Aristotle is unjust. Most of the writing we attribute to Aristotle is probably either lecture notes or early drafts. His philosophical dialogues have been lost, but they were famous in antiquity; Cicero described his style as “a flowing river of gold.”Susan Neiman, in her review of “All Things Shining” (Jan. 23), writes: “By the time they contemplate an application to graduate school, philosophy students have learned that it isn’t merely tacky to display an interest in questions about the meaning of life; it’s a major professional risk.” She should have consulted Thomas Nagel’s “Mortal Questions,” John Rawls’s “Theory of Justice,” Martha C. Nussbaum’s “Love’s Knowledge,” and many others. These authors have been associated with some of the foremost philosophy departments, and no philosophy student can get far without reading their work.J.

"'11-02-06,'0','In late November, I had met up with Nicolas in Bangkok, the city where I grew up, to join him for a weeklong loop through Cambodia, a country neither of us had seen but one that I had long hoped to visit.In the 1980s and 1990s, Cambodia was widely known as a place from which hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the killing fields of the 70s. In 1997, when I was an intern at The Associated Press’s Bangkok bureau, my editors asked if I would travel to help cover a coup there. I was living with my parents that summer, and they demanded that I turn down the offer, which I did.But in the last decade, Cambodia has emerged as a popular destination for travelers who have wearied of more developed countries in Southeast Asia. It is perpetually referred to in guide books and travel stories as “like Thailand 10 years ago.”And indeed, during our trip, I was struck by how reminiscent the country was of the Thailand of my childhood, before it was overrun with resorts, shopping malls and tour buses.Cambodia’s two-lane highways were well paved and relatively empty — the upside, perhaps, to the lack of a car culture. We most often shared the roads with those scooters and bikes. Every so often, we would spot farmers transporting rice, sugar cane and other produce on carts hitched to cows or to small diesel engines fitted with truck tires and long handlebars. The other cars on the road were mostly Land Cruisers or Lexus sport utility vehicles, most likely owned by the country’s small economic elite and organizations like the United Nations, which have been helping to rebuild the country.Some of this may soon change. Over the last few years, Cambodia, with the help of international organizations and China, has invested significantly in its roads, removing hundreds of land mines and thousands of rounds of ammunition to make way for miles of asphalt. But there is much more construction ahead and road culture is just beginning to catch up.Sari, a driver and guide whom we met at the Angkor Wat complex our second day, said he occasionally saw European overland travelers, but that few foreigners, including the neighboring Thais, drove into and around the country.We had another glimpse of this slow development at the Thai-Cambodian border, where we waited an hour for Cambodian customs officers to return to the office after lunch. They seemed utterly confused about the paperwork that Nicolas needed to bring his Land Cruiser into the country temporarily. He eventually took control, pointing out where they had to sign, stamp and tear the relevant documents — a successful example of his assertiveness.Elsewhere, we were greeted warmly — sometimes with a disconcerting attentiveness. In the southern coastal town of Kep, where we spent the night after our luckless afternoon at Bokor, we camped near a family that lived in a shack on the coast. We arrived after the sun had set and quickly started popping up the tent, a clever contraption that Nicolas had affixed to the top of his car, complete with a built-in ladder. We poured ourselves generous glasses of rum with lime juice and soda to help make the warm and humid evening more bearable. Mosquitoes and flies buzzed around our electric lanterns.As we worked, the men of the house stared at us and made comments to each other in Khmer, which neither of us understood. We tried to speak to them in English, but that proved unsuccessful.Their vigil over us became unnerving after a while and I tried to break the ice by offering them some of the Thai-style chicken and stir-fried vegetables I had cooked on Nicolas’s petroleum-powered stove. They happily accepted and took the food back to their shack; we ate at a folding table Nicolas carries in the car.Later, the family reciprocated in their own way. In the morning, when I started to head to the public toilet a few hundred yards away, the head of the family gave me a ride on his scooter.Almost everywhere we went, people were fascinated by Nicolas and his Land Cruiser, which he bought in Brooklyn for $6,000. When we stopped by the side of the road to heat up leftover spaghetti on our way to Phnom Penh, a group of children gathered and stared at us. When we turned around, waved and said hello, they ran away, shrieking and laughing.Nicolas says he hit the road because the financial crisis and recession had made New York, where he had lived for almost a decade, depressing. So, he quit his job as an art director at The Associated Press and drew down his savings to finance his trip. He estimates that he will spend about $50,000 on the trip. (He will likely arrive back in New York this month after driving cross-country from Los Angeles, where he has shipped his car from Asia.)After only a week as his travel companion, I doubted that I could do what he had done. I was already aching for the creature comforts that you have to forsake when you go on the road, especially in places like Cambodia.I couldn’t help but smile when we arrived at a small beach in Thailand 20 miles past the Cambodian border. We were greeted warmly by a family that ran a small restaurant. They showed us spots where we could camp and later in the evening they sold us beer and spicy papaya salad. Nobody eyed us suspiciously. They had seen many like us before.'"
"'11-02-06,'0','To deal with the disreputable wooden floor in the living room, he consulted a clerk at Home Depot, who recommended covering the offending surface with strips of laminate.“Then I watched a video on YouTube on how to laminate floors,” Mr. Ichida said. “It looked really easy — a piece of cake.” In fact, the task proved far more challenging than he had anticipated. “You have to snap together all the pieces, and the floor wasn’t totally level, and the edges were tricky.”In the bathroom, the problem was the walls.“They were horrible — layered with paint, wallpaper, and such a mess I couldn’t even scrape them” to make them smooth, Mr. Ichida said. In search of a solution, he drove to a company in central New Jersey called Bamboo and Rattan Works, bought 200 shoots of imported bamboo, and attached the shoots to the wall with lengths of twine.“The bamboo stays up,” he said, “but the job took a week, and it was much harder than I expected. There’s no YouTube video for how to tie pieces of bamboo onto your walls.”The tiny living room is made even tinier by the floor-to-ceiling plywood shelves that cover an entire wall and hold nearly 25,000 late-20th-century American prints. The collection was amassed largely by Mr. Ichida’s father, and includes work by artists like Marisol and Lynn Sweat, familiar from the Amelia Bedelia books.The son, who has added to the collection, is selling the prints through the Tokyo Arts Salon, a company founded by the father. The son is now president, and because he is still on leave, he has sufficient time to manage its affairs.Mr. Ichida loves the art, but he is particularly proud of the shelves. He designed and built them himself, inspired by shelves he saw at a shop in Dumbo called Rare Posters. “There are no screws, no nails, no glue,” he said. “It’s just gravity holding the pieces together.”And the shelves are hardly his only creation. From the ceiling dangles a mobile — “I got the idea from Calder,” he said — assembled from metal sheets, metal rods and a few paper clips from the stationery store around the corner. Using remnants from the shelves, which he had originally made too big, he built a lamp that he topped with a wooden wastepaper basket. He built another lamp using a large shoot of bamboo that he bought on Craigslist — three shoots for $10.Parts of old aquariums have been repurposed into works of art. Mr. Ichida doesn’t know how to sew, but he created pillows using pieces of orange leather he bought on eBay, stapling them together inside out, turning them right side out and pinning the openings shut.Unexpected touches abound. Rooms are separated not by doors but by lengths of bright fabric, much of it orange, Mr. Ichida’s favorite color. A human anatomy poster by a Japanese artist covers a hole that resulted when a leak caused part of the ceiling to crash down. Décor includes a 40-inch-tall earthenware jar shipped from Japan and sculptures in which newspaper clippings about the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 treaty on climate change, have been affixed to turquoise ceramic.The kitchen is dominated by a steel dining table so heavy that Mr. Ichida barely managed to haul it up to his apartment, even with the help of a friend. He bought the table for $75 on Craigslist, a Web site on which he is not ashamed to say he spends several hours a day.Not surprisingly, the bedroom has a Japanese theme. Mr. Ichida, who was born in Japan, came to the United States with his family at age 2, but starting in his teens he has returned frequently.A Lilliputian Shinto shrine, outfitted with miniature gilded furnishings and as adorable as a dollhouse, sits atop his dresser. A gold and black lacquer box from his mother holds the equipment needed for the traditional tea ceremony.There are antique and modern samurai swords, Japanese prayer beads, a Japanese flag that covers cracks in the ceiling and a museum-quality wooden statue of a samurai that dates to the 13th century. A box containing prayers is made of wood from a temple destroyed during the Second World War.The Japanese accents are understandable, but you have to wonder: How did Mr. Ichida become such a scavenger?“I hate seeing things go to waste,” he said. “Especially in a neighborhood like this, where so much nice furniture gets thrown away. I get a great deal of pleasure from saving it, changing it and making it more usable.”And his tasks are far from over.“I’m thinking about making a dresser for my bedroom,” he said. “But I don’t really know how to do it. It might turn out to be a little much.”'"
"'11-02-06,'0','As a genre of visual communication, the architectural rendering is underscrutinized. When we see one — in a business meeting, on a real estate sign, accompanying an article about a public-works project — we understandably focus on the merits of what’s depicted, not the depiction. Recently, however, I happened to spend a lot of time looking at such drawings, and found myself drawn to a recurring feature that, strictly speaking, had nothing to do with the suggested structures: the little human figures who inhabit the rendered world.The apparent purpose of these figures is to provide sense of scale — in fact one architect friend of mine refers to these figures as “scalies.” That is no weirder than the more-official names given to these denizens of hypothetical environs, including “people textures” and “populating images.” In general, they are a happy and healthy lot: they jog past environmentally responsible retail, stride in smart business attire toward gleaming office structures, hobnob in the former back alley magically converted to green space.But where did these uncanny little citizens come from, and what are they really up to? I figured I’d ask Geoff Manaugh, proprietor of the delightful Bldgblog.blogspot.com, devoted to such themes as “architectural speculation” and “urban conjecture.” In the past, Manaugh told me, people were often completely absent from architectural representation, so letting figures into the frame humanized and presented buildings in a social context. “The funny thing is how it has become its own subgenre,” he continued. “You can take the most random rendering and just stick in a few people — someone listening to an iPod, somebody reading a newspaper, maybe a couple holding hands, some guy playing an acoustic guitar. Suddenly it’s meant to make the entire building beyond critique; it’s already part of our city.”In a sense, then, people textures became a form of rhetoric, whether they seem drawn to the buildings they’re placed near or even if they seem oblivious to them in a way that suggests a new structure is a natural part of the streetscape. “You tend not to see people spraying graffiti or a homeless person sleeping in the alley,” Manaugh observed. “Or rats.” Every so often, student projects will play with the form — Manaugh recalls examples involving people textures in gas masks or having sex or urinating on the street. Obviously that’s rare in more-professional contexts, where the norm is an anonymous pedestrian with no attention-hogging features.There is a small people-texture industry. Realworld Imagery sells CDs containing, for instance, 104 “Business People,” for insertion into renderings, for about $150 a disc. A site in Britain, Falling Pixel, offers, among others, “120 Casual People” (which sounds like a passable indie movie) for about $70. Marlin Studios, in Arlington, Tex., also sells textures, and its founder, Tom Marlin, explained the business to me.He found his way into the field by way of creating video games and learning how to incorporate photo-realistic surfaces and textures borrowed from real life. Packaged digital bundles of images of trees and cars and the like turned out to be useful tools for architects who want to add pizazz to renderings. A developer trying to get financial backing for a shopping center, Marlin explains, might tell the architect, “I need to see the parking lot full of cars, and I want hundreds of people walking around.” His visualizations are two-dimensional moving computer animations, though soon Marlin plans to release three-dimensional figures who walk or gesticulate in repetitive loops. Many of the people textures he sells were created in long, single sessions in which scores of individuals in neutral day-to-day costumes (a blazer and tie; jeans and T-shirt) are photographed against a green screen and sign an all-purpose image waiver. While a certain amount of variety matters — scalies can be young or old and come from diverse ethnic backgrounds — the most important factor is making sure any individual isn’t so remarkable as to distract from the scene as a whole (or dressed in outfits that will quickly look dated). The idea is to sell the same scalies over and over.'"
"'11-02-06,'0','They purposely chose a needy dog. “Max was abused,” Ms. Tabatabai said. “I knew that before we adopted him.” The dog, who is affectionate toward his owners, barks often, especially at noises outside. “I am happy we are able to give him a good life,” she said, “because I’m not sure a lot of families would take him on.”At that point, their priority was a backyard for Max. So they moved to a ground-floor one-bedroom on West 51st Street for the space out back. The rent was $2,250 a month. “It was an impulse apartment,” Mr. Spevak said.From the beginning, they were unhappy with the busy, tourist-filled neighborhood. And their yard was a mess, filled with “weeds up to your shoulders,” Ms. Tabatabai said. After they cleaned it, they were left with dirt and concrete.Max romped happily out back. But even though the couple could just let the dog out when it was raining or snowing, they came to view the yard as a problem. “The yard was a muddy mess,” Ms. Tabatabai said. The dog tracked dirt everywhere.People peeked in from the adjacent parking lot. A mouse got inside the apartment, and so did a sparrow. In broad daylight, when Ms. Tabatabai was home and as Max barked wildly, the apartment above theirs was burglarized. After that, she was afraid to be home alone.They would move when their lease expired, the couple resolved. This time around, they would gladly forgo a yard. They preferred a place below 23rd Street.The building had to allow dogs, of course. Though places were advertised as pet-friendly, they sometimes imposed a weight limit for dogs, said their agent, Shannon Aalai of Citi Habitats, a friend of Ms. Tabatabai’s. Or they allowed one cat.The apartment needed to be Max-proof, too. That meant it should be in a low-traffic part of the building, far from stairs or elevators, to give him fewer occasions for barking.Their price for a one-bedroom topped out at $2,500. Ms. Aalai warned them, “The farther downtown you go, the tighter the market gets.”Most of the apartments they saw were small, dark and not quite big enough for Ms. Tabatabai, who works from home as a freelance sportswriter. For months, “nothing was good enough for me to actually make the move,” she said.If she did see a nice place, it would almost invariably be a top-floor walk-up. “Taking a dog out two or three times a day, it is not fair to my boyfriend because he is usually the one taking him out,” she said. “And I don’t know how it is for the dog’s knees, either.”The first possibility, for $2,600, arose in a nice elevator building on East 20th Street near the police academy. “I felt really safe,” Ms. Tabatabai said.The couple put in an application and asked that a temporary wall, which reduced the light and truncated the living room, be removed. They heard later that the apartment had been given to two roommates who wanted the wall and the second bedroom that it created.“I was so upset,” Ms. Tabatabai said. “Even though it was a little bit above the budget, I was willing to take it because of the added security.”A place on East 21st Street, renting for $2,400, was well kept. But Mr. Spevak was ambivalent about the loft bedroom, which to him seemed dormlike. Furthermore, the building was too close to his office at a small publishing company. After taking Max for an hourlong morning walk, “I want to take my time going to get an iced coffee or a coffee or whatever” before work, Mr. Spevak said.An apartment on West 21st Street was the nicest of all, with high ceilings, an open layout, a big kitchen, and even a counter with two stools. “You could eat there,” Mr. Spevak said, “and you normally have to eat at your coffee table.” French doors could be shut against hallway noise. The rent was $2,450 a month.Another application was pending. The couple asked the departing tenant, who was breaking her lease, how to get in touch with the landlord. They called, offered more money, and were able to rent the apartment for $2,550.“We took matters into our own hands,” Ms. Tabatabai said. “I felt it was our only option if we wanted to get this apartment.”The couple arrived late last fall. “It is a complete turnaround,” Ms. Tabatabai said. “I am so much happier.” Their home is sufficiently Max-proof, although the hallway steps are creaky, so when neighbors clomp up and down, Max sometimes hears them and barks.Still, “he is a lot better in this apartment than he’s ever been,” Ms. Tabatabai said. There is another dog in the building that barks a lot, she said, but you can only hear it from the stairwell.Barking doesn’t bother her. In a dog-friendly building, it happens.'"

"'11-02-07,'1','The Tradewise Gibraltar Chess Festival , which ended last week, is a popular tournament, attracting many strong players. And the World Open , which is held every year in the Philadelphia area around Independence Day, usually has more than 1,000 players between all its sections.But for sheer quality of competition, the annual Aeroflot Open, which starts on Tuesday, trumps them all.Sponsored by the Russian airline, the tournament is divided in three sections. The A group usually features many of the world’s top players, and this year is no different. Twenty-six of the world’s top 100 players are competing, and 73 of the 87 players in the top section are grandmasters. The top seeds are Gata Kamsky of the United States, who is ranked No. 19 in the world; Sergei Movsesian of Armenia, No. 26; Dmitry Jakovenko of Russia, No. 28; Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France, No. 31; and Nikita Vitiugov of Russia, No. 33.There are several reasons for Aeroflot’s success.It has a total prize fund of almost $170,000, which is substantial by chess standards. The first prize in the top section is more than $27,000.Aeroflot’s winner also receives an invitation to the prestigious tournament in Dortmund, Germany, later this year.Aeroflot also follows the Moscow Open, a less prestigious event. The back-to-back scheduling of the two tournaments make it more worthwhile for players to travel to Moscow to compete.Last year, four players tied for first in the Moscow Open, among them Le Quang Liem of Vietnam. Le’s result was a surprise, but it turned out to be an appetizer, as he won Aeroflot and subsequently ascended to No. 41 in the world rankings.The winner of this year’s Moscow Open, which ended on Monday, was even more unexpected than last year’s. Vladimir Belous of Russia, who is not a grandmaster or even an international master, took clear first with an astonishing score of 8 out of 9 points. He topped a field that included almost 50 grandmasters. Six grandmasters, including three with ratings over 2,600 (which places them among the top 200 in the world), and two international masters tied for second through ninth, each with 7.5 points. Zhou Weiqi of China was second on a tie-breaker, and Yu Yangyi, his countryman, was third.Belous will not be able to equal Le’s performance from last year, however, as he is entered in the B section of Aeroflot, not the top one.This year’s Moscow Open had several side events, including elite 12-player invitational tournaments for men and women. The men’s event was won by Boris Grachev of Russia, a half point ahead of two other Russians, Sergei Zhigalko and Sanan Sjugirov.Grachev started slowly with one win, one loss and four draws, but he then won four in a row before drawing in the last round against Robert Hess of the United States.Hess had a difficult tournament and ended tied for 10.The women’s event was won by Alexandra Kosteniuk of Russia, the former women’s world champion, on a tie-breaker over Batkhuyag Munguntuul of Mongolia.'"

"'11-02-07,'1','After disappearing in Egypt more than a week ago, leaving an ominous message on his Twitter account, Wael Ghonim, who leads Google’s marketing efforts for the Middle East and North Africa, is expected to be released by Egyptian authorities to his family on Monday afternoon, a friend of the Ghonim family said Sunday night.“We are not confident, but we are hopeful,” said Habib Haddad, a Boston-based businessman and a close friend of Mr. Ghonim who has been helping lead efforts in recent days to help locate his friend, among many in Egypt who have gone missing in the two-week-old revolt there. “At this point in time, it is important to be hopeful and confident but not to call for celebration yet.”Egypt’s state-run Nile TV reported on Sunday that Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq had called the network to announce that Mr. Ghonim would be released on Monday afternoon. Earlier in the day, Naguib Sawiris, a prominent Egyptian businessman who was among several others meeting with Vice President Omar Suleiman over the weekend, said that he had been assured Mr. Ghonim would be released on Monday afternoon.Before his family lost contact with him on Jan. 28, Mr. Ghonim made one of his last posts to his @ghonim Twitter page that troubled friends and family, raising concerns about his whereabouts: “Pray for #Egypt. Very worried as it seems that government is planning a war crime tomorrow against people. We are all ready to die #Jan25.”His friends and family initially searched area hospitals for him while human rights activists became convinced he was being held by the authorities because he was believed to have inspired some of the young digital-savvy Egyptian political organizers to use technology, including Facebook and YouTube, to help raise awareness about abuse by the police and other human rights issues in Egypt.Soon after Khaled Said, an Egyptian businessman who had evidence of police corruption, was killed at the hands of officers on June 6, 2010, in Alexandria, a Facebook page was created and YouTube videos were uploaded that human rights advocates said helped build an online community of more than 450,000 people and inspired the protests that began on Jan. 25. It is unclear what role, if any, Mr. Ghonim had in the social media effort to raise awareness about the case of Khaled Said.After his disappearance, members of the April 6 Youth Movement, which began in 2008 to use a Facebook group to help gather support for human rights causes, told Egyptian authorities on Friday that they had designated Mr. Ghonim their spokesman.'"

"'11-02-07,'1','The heaviest toll is in El Paso, where many residents cross the border regularly to conduct business or visit family.In early November, for instance, four American citizens were killed in separate crimes over one weekend, including a 15-year-old boy. All of the victims were ambushed and shot to death while visiting Ciudad Juárez, which has become one of the most murderous cities in the world because of a battle between the Sinaloa cartel and the remnants of the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes gang.“We know that many of our winter Texans enjoy traveling to Mexico, but they should understand that we cannot guarantee their safety after they cross the border,” Steven C. McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said in a warning issued after Ms. Davis’s death.Relatives described Ms. Davis as an ebullient and devout woman who loved working with people in rural Mexico. She was a registered nurse and had worked as a midwife in Mexico, in addition to teaching Bible classes. She also composed religious songs on the piano and sewed her own prairie-style dresses.For decades, she and her husband had run a charity — the nondenominational Gospel Proclaimers Missionary Association in Weslaco, Tex. — that raised money to build churches, hold revivals and distribute Bibles in poor Mexican villages, mostly in the states bordering Texas.About a year ago, Ms. Davis and her husband moved their base of operations from a small Mexican town in Nuevo León State to their house in Monte Alto, Tex., where they had raised their two grown sons. They had also curtailed their trips to Mexico in recent months after having some close scrapes involving highway robbers, said Melody Reynolds, a niece of Mr. Davis’s.But last week the couple had received a message from the pastor of one of the churches they had established during their 30 years of missionary work, Ms. Reynolds said.The pastor said the church was in financial trouble and needed cash. The couple generally drove an older model car while in Mexico to avoid attracting carjackers, but that vehicle was in the shop, so they took their 2008 Chevrolet pickup truck. The police in Pharr say they think that choice made them a target.The trip took three days, and the couple were on their way home when a group of men brandishing guns began tailing them, Ms. Reynolds said.They were just outside San Fernando, 87 miles south of the border. It is a region that has been plagued over the last year by battles between the Gulf cartel and the Zetas.Mr. Davis decided to run for it, but the truck behind him caught up. Several miles later, two other trucks tried to block the road, but Mr. Davis managed to get past them, Ms. Reynolds said.The Pharr police chief, Ruben Villescos, said the motive for the attack remained a mystery. He said the men in the three trucks followed Mr. Davis for miles and boxed in his pickup to force him off the road. Several shots were fired, and Ms. Davis was hit in the back of the head.One slug went through the passenger side window and through the windshield near Mr. Davis, Ms. Reynolds said.“He says to this day he doesn’t know why he’s alive,” she said. “He got shot at. Apparently it wasn’t his time to go.”'"
"'11-02-07,'1','DALLAS (AP) — Patriots quarterback Tom Brady on Sunday became the first unanimous choice for the Associated Press N.F.L. most valuable player award since The A.P. began using a nationwide panel of news media members who cover the league.Brady received all 50 votes, surpassing the previous best — his own. In 2007, when Brady won his first M.V.P. award, he received 49 votes; one voter went for Brett Favre.“It is always flattering to be chosen for such a prestigious award,” Brady said. “But I also look at it as a team award, as nothing in football gets accomplished without the mental toughness and determination of every player and coach associated with that team.”Although he did not set passing records the way he did in 2007, Brady led New England to a 14-2 record, the best in the N.F.L., had a record streak of 335 throws without being intercepted and passed for 36 touchdowns with only 4 interceptions.Brady and Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning have split the last four M.V.P. awards. Brady followed his previous M.V.P. year with a lost season, tearing left knee ligaments in the first half of the 2008 opener. His return in 2009 was solid, although hand and rib injuries slowed him.'"
"'11-02-07,'1','PARIS (Reuters) — France’s economy minister, Christine Lagarde, said on Sunday that the euro zone’s package of rescue money was enough to stave off future crises.Germany and France last week proposed far-reaching plans to deepen integration among the 17 nations that use the euro. Those proposals included placing limits on debt levels written into national laws and a minimum corporate tax rate.Many European countries were quick to criticize the proposal, but analysts said that the Franco-German move potentially was an important turning point, one that could lead to the euro nations agreeing to more of their economic policies in a unified bloc.The proposal was also intended to strengthen the rescue fund by allowing it to lend all its 440 billion euros, and perhaps use the money more flexibly.France and Germany want euro zone leaders to sign off on a “comprehensive package,” including changes to the European Financial Stability Facility, the bailout fund’s formal name.'"
"'11-02-07,'1','Though those behind OpenLeaks are at pains not to criticize Mr. Assange, and have repeatedly made it clear that they do not see themselves as his competitors, their aims address many of the barbs leveled at him, the man who has defined a new era of online mass leaks.It is partly run by Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a precise programmer from Berlin who was once Mr. Assange’s deputy. Since he left WikiLeaks in September, he has been working on a book which he promises will reveal “the evolution, finances and inner tensions” inside WikiLeaks.At a recent gathering of the Chaos Computer Club, a hacker community in Berlin, Mr. Domscheit-Berg said OpenLeaks would be neutral and would not rely on secrecy as WikiLeaks does. Those who seek transparency, he said, should “stand in the sunlight ourselves and enjoy that we are creating a more transparent society, not create a transparent society while sneaking around in the shadows.”The new site must not, he added, “contain any politics and personal preferences or personal dislikes about whatever you’re going to publish or what you must not publish.”OpenLeaks is not the only site inspired by the success of WikiLeaks. Dozens of smaller leaking sites — some focused on specific topics, like the environment, or particular regions — have sprung up in recent months with the aim of encouraging whistleblowers.It is, perhaps, the realization of a vision Mr. Assange outlined on his blog in 2006, the year he founded WikiLeaks. He imagined a world where “mass leaking” left unjust governments “exquisitely vulnerable to those who seek to replace them with more open forms of governance.”But the emergence of OpenLeaks may have taken a toll on its predecessor.In private, Mr. Assange has told reporters that the spate of defections shut down the complex computer systems WikiLeaks uses to process new information and make it hard for governments and corporations to trace its source. At a January news conference in London, he said that trouble with the site’s “internal mechanisms” had rendered it no longer open “for public business.” He said the site would continue to accept material in other forms, like computer disks.Beset by legal difficulties, working on a book for which he has signed a deal he says is worth as much as $1.7 million and managing his newfound celebrity, Mr. Assange has had less time to focus on repairing the systems, friends have said.But his struggles, lending him the status of a martyr figure, may paradoxically provide him a better platform from which to leak damaging information, said Evgeny Morozov, a researcher on the political effects of the Internet and author “The Net Delusion,” a book that is skeptical of the power of the Web to change governments for the better.“The reason WikiLeaks has been able to function operationally,” he said, “is that they have managed to monopolize public attention. If anything happens to them, it is a big story.”The challenge for OpenLeaks, and others who hope to imitate it, Mr. Morozov said, is to make the Internet infrastructure for leaking secrets more robust. “If anything,” he said, the recent blows to WikiLeaks have “revealed how easy it is to silence a publisher in the Internet age, and how little pressure you need to put on an intermediary to slow it down.”Late last year several companies, like Amazon, PayPal, MasterCard and the Swiss bank Swiss Post decided to stop providing financial and computer services to WikiLeaks in the wake of its controversial releases.While traditional publishers in many countries have well-established legal protections against governments who wish to stifle information, he said, sites like WikiLeaks and OpenLeaks operate in uncharted territory.Speaking of such challenges in a recorded speech played to a large rally in his adopted hometown, Melbourne, Australia, last week, Mr. Assange compared the struggles of WikiLeaks to those of African-Americans who fought for equal rights in the 1950s, of protesters who sought an end to the Vietnam War in the 1960s, to the feminist movement and to environmental campaigners today. “For the Internet generation,” he said, “this is our challenge, and this is our time.”Mr. Domscheit-Berg, in his speech to the Berlin hackers, studiously avoided such soaring rhetoric about OpenLeaks. But, he said, “I think it’s going to be a more effective process, a more efficient process.”'"
"'11-02-07,'1','“Cambodians always open fire first,” Colonel Sansern said. “We will cease fire when the Cambodians stop firing at us.”It was not clear how seriously the temple, Preah Vihear, had been damaged. A Unesco World Heritage site, the temple was slightly damaged by shelling in the last serious clash a year ago.“A wing of our Preah Vihear temple has collapsed as a direct result of the Thai artillery bombardment,” a Cambodian military commander was quoted as saying in a statement by the Quick Reaction Unit of the Cambodian Council of Ministers.The statement also quoted the unidentified commander as saying the Thai side had used “gas shells” as it fired 130-millimeter rounds at Cambodian soldiers, but it did not elaborate.The dispute involves conflicting century-old maps and a ruling in 1962 by the International Court of Justice awarding the temple to Cambodia. New tensions were set off in July 2008 when Unesco named the temple a World Heritage site and placed it inside Cambodia.Tensions along the border have become entwined in Thailand’s political disputes, with the faction known as the yellow shirts accusing the government of failing to defend Thai sovereignty.The issue has become a rallying cry in recent weeks for the yellow shirts, who have begun a sit-in near the prime minister’s office.On Sunday, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva of Thailand said the government wanted a peaceful resolution, but would defend national borders. “If our sovereignty is violated, we have to protect it ultimately,” he said.Anger was stoked last week when a Cambodian court sentenced two Thai nationalists to prison terms of six and eight years on a charge of trespassing and spying in the border region.Passions had already been aroused in Thailand this year after the Cambodian side erected a plaque near the temple that read, in English: “Here! is the place where Thai troops invaded Cambodian territory on July 15, 2008, and withdrew at 10:30 A.M. on Dec. 1, 2010.”Responding to Thai demands, the Cambodians removed the plaque, but replaced it with another that read: “Here! is Cambodia.”Following more Thai complaints, that plaque was also removed and photographs of the shattered red and yellow tablet were displayed in the Thai press.'"
"'11-02-07,'1','“Since then we’ve been playing cat and mouse,” said Heather Allan, the head of news gathering for Al Jazeera English. Remarkably, the network has managed to transmit live from Cairo much of the time since then.Many observers believe that by televising the uprisings, Al Jazeera is influencing them — and tilting the Middle East toward a version of democracy in the process.Wadah Khanfar, director general of Al Jazeera, acknowledged that covering the protesters around the clock “gives them some momentum.” He said that the network’s mission statement supported democracy, but added, “we’re not adopting the revolution.”Similarly, Mostefa Souag, news director for the Arabic service, conceded that protesters might gravitate toward Al Jazeera’s cameras, well aware of the worldwide power of the images. But, he added, “we’re not here to create events. We’re here to cover events.”The Arabic and English news services measurably spent more time last week showing and interviewing voices opposed to President Hosni Mubarak, but they gave time to other points of view, as well. When the Arabic service was slow to go live to a press briefing by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, Mr. Souag rushed out of his office to ask the producers, “Why aren’t we taking him?” (It took a few minutes for the translator to get into position.)The Arabic- and English-language operations work in tandem, sharing materials, bureaus and an “editorial spirit,” said Al Anstey, the English managing director, while maintaining separate staffs and newsrooms. Last week, they also shared Egypt theme music and a graphics package that had as its dominant image a “Down with Mubarak” sign clutched by a protester.By midafternoon on Friday, the crowds in Tahrir Square were swelling, and news anchors on Al Jazeera were batting around crowd estimates — guesses, really — in the millions. That same afternoon, an executive producer told those in the newsroom responsible for booking guests: “Don’t make any more calls on Iran.”Salah Nagm, the English-language news director, had decided to halt segments about the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s speech on Friday praising the protesters in Egypt. To praise Egyptian protesters after having cracked down on protests in Iran was a “double standard,” Mr. Nagm said. And, he added, when the news anchor diverts from the events in Egypt, “viewers lose concentration.”In the newsroom, updates from Cairo were indicated by red flashes on computer screens. When a correspondent spotted several hundred supporters of President Mubarak on a bridge near Tahrir Square, she phoned a producer, who announced the development in a mass e-mail transmission. Moments later, the news was shared with television viewers.Meanwhile, Ms. Allan was on the phone praising Andrew Simmons, one of the Al Jazeera correspondents who had been detained and interrogated by the Egyptian authorities a day earlier. “Even with a bonk on your head,” she told him, “you made it make sense.”A moment later, after conferring with colleagues about the status of efforts to obtain reporter visas to enter Yemen and Algeria, she sighed. “We’ve been trying to get into Algeria now for two and a half weeks.”The staff in Cairo and Doha has effectively been on a war footing. At times last week, it was so dangerous in Cairo that Al Jazeera’s correspondents there were not identified by name, an approach the network has usually found necessary only in Myanmar. There were widespread reports that pro-Mubarak protesters were singling out Al Jazeera news crews.“It’s practically impossible for us to do our jobs anymore,” one of the anonymous correspondents said on the air on Thursday.As with other TV networks, much of Al Jazeera’s equipment in Cairo has been confiscated. The network, which has tried not to divulge how it has managed to transmit pictures from Egypt, has supplemented its own images with those from amateurs.In the Arabic newsroom, a group of volunteers scoured Facebook and YouTube for newly uploaded material. The uprising in Tunisia, where Al Jazeera was not allowed to have a bureau, resulted in the “biggest use yet of citizen video” by the network, Mr. Souag said.In a separate interview, Mr. Khanfar went further, saying the protests in Tunisia were “broadcast to the entire world through Al Jazeera, so there was a sort of partnership between those people on the ground and Al Jazeera.”“In my opinion, this is a new ecosystem emerging in media, between the so-called traditional media and the new media,” he said. “And this new ecosystem is not based on competition and who is going to win, it’s based on complementing each other.”Mr. Khanfar continued, “When our correspondents were banned, we had thousands of correspondents through these activists.”Mr. Khanfar said he sensed that a “technical war” had been under way against Al Jazeera in Egypt. All week, the Arabic network’s satellite signals were disrupted, leading about a dozen other broadcasters in the region to simulcast the signal. On Friday morning, he said, its Web site was attacked by hackers.Since its inception in 2006, Al Jazeera English has been fighting for access to American viewers. Distributors have been unwilling to carry the service, but Mr. Anstey, the managing director, said in an interview that renewed talks with the major distributors were now under way. “There’s a growing call for Al Jazeera. That’s clear,” he said.Al Jazeera English has contacted Comcast, for instance, and a meeting has been scheduled for later this month.In an indication that perceptions of Al Jazeera may be changing, one of its correspondents in Washington reported on Thursday that people there “are all of a sudden very welcoming” to the network. “We’re on TVs all across the city.”There remains a deep suspicion of Al Jazeera’s motives, however, particularly with regard to its recent protest coverage. In an essay that appeared on The Huffington Post, Marc Ginsberg, a former United States ambassador to Morocco and a former contributor to Fox News, accused Al Jazeera of acting “more and more like a ‘Wizard of Oz’ type instrument for social upheaval in the region — whether or not it brings to power Salafi extremists is immaterial to its mission.”There is little disagreement, however, that Al Jazeera’s zoom-lens live coverage of Tahrir Square can affect what happens there.In an essay last week for Foreign Affairs, Sheila Carapico, a professor of political science at the University of Richmond and the American University in Cairo, wrote: “We should not forget that news stations based in Britain, Qatar and the United States are active participants in events rather than mere bystanders recording events. In the first televised revolution, the medium is part of the message.”Several people at Al Jazeera suggested the live coverage was providing the protesters some protection from widespread harm.What is happening now in the Middle East, Mr. Khanfar said on Friday, is a readjustment between the voices of governments and the voices of their people, with the people being heard more loudly. Ten minutes later, as Mr. Khanfar and his colleagues ate dinner in a conference room, they stopped and listened intently as Al Jazeera reported that giant screens showing the network’s coverage had been set up at a protest site in Alexandria, Egypt.As the protests in Cairo showed no signs of winding down, dinner was delivered for the newsroom. Just after midnight, a female producer wearing a traditional head scarf dozed at her desk, headphones still firmly in place. Meanwhile, the protesters kept chanting and the anchors kept talking.'"
"'11-02-07,'1','Rajon Rondo scored 11 of his 26 points in the third quarter Sunday as the Boston Celtics capitalized on Orlando’s cold shooting to take charge and go on to a 91-80 win over the visiting Magic.Boston led, 46-43, at halftime and stretched that to 70-55 with 3 minutes 36 seconds left in the third quarter. By that point, the Celtics had made 9 of their 10 field-goal attempts in the period and the Magic just 4 of 18.“If we’re going to come in on the road and play the Boston Celtics, you’ve got to have guys playing at a very high level,” Magic Coach Stan Van Gundy said. “We didn’t have a single perimeter guy have a good game.”Paul Pierce added 18 points and Kevin Garnett had 16 for the Eastern Conference-leading Celtics, who improved to 23-4 at home. Dwight Howard had 28 points and 13 rebounds for the Magic, which lost for the fifth time in eight games.“The Miami Heat and Boston are rolling right now,” Howard said of the top teams in the East. “We’ve got things we’ve got to work on.”'"
"'11-02-07,'1','The Knicks moved the ball better, a point Coach Mike D’Antoni emphasized before the game, and they shot a season-high 59.7 percent and made 11 3-pointers. The Knicks held Philadelphia to 28 rebounds, the lowest by an opponent this season, in part because the Knicks left few to grab.Ultimately, however, there was a bittersweet edge to the afternoon. Stoudemire received his 14th technical in the third quarter from the official Bob Delaney. Stoudemire had poked the ball loose from Spencer Hawes but fouled him. Stoudemire raced up the court in protest, a relatively mild act, but Delaney assessed the technical. The N.B.A. is trying to curtail player complaints.With 32 games left in the regular season, Stoudemire is two technicals away from an automatic one-game suspension.“I hope they look at it and I hope they rescind it,” D’Antoni said. “I don’t know. To me, I don’t know how you play the game without any emotion whatsoever.”The Knicks season’ is chugging along in a rickety pattern of winning streaks and skids. With less than three weeks left until the Feb. 24 trade deadline, the Knicks are in the process of determining whether to try to obtain Carmelo Anthony now, or later through free agency.The latest discussions involve the Minnesota Timberwolves as a facilitator in an Anthony deal, according to two people involved with the talks, who voiced skepticism that it would develop much further. In the proposal, Anthony would go to the Knicks from Denver and the Nuggets would receive Wilson Chandler from the Knicks and Corey Brewer and a first-round draft selection from Minnesota, which would import Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry’s expiring contract.Minnesota’s possible involvement was first reported by ESPN. It is just the latest in season-long speculation involving Anthony.Any discussion involving Anthony can drag on, as the Nets could attest, and nothing will probably happen until near the trade deadline.“I don’t think we have anything going, but at least we’re getting a feeling of possibilities, let’s put it that way,” Donnie Walsh, the Knicks’ president, said. He added that he was not feeling more confident about a deal, but “we have a better feeling for what’s going to happen.”Anthony’s greatest strength is his scoring. On Sunday, the Knicks needed no such help as six players scored in double digits. Their defensive efforts lapsed again, though, and Philadelphia shot 54.2 percent.The Knicks led throughout the second half, but the 76ers sliced the deficit to 6 points entering the fourth quarter. Chandler and Toney Douglas stretched it back out with 3-pointers. Stoudemire shot 5 for 5 in the fourth quarter, part of his 9-of-10 second-half performance. Fields made three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter.“He either stopped the bleeding or put us ahead,” D’Antoni said. “He’s been playing good all year.”With the Knicks struggling of late, D’Antoni started center Timofey Mozgov for the first time since Nov. 16, when the Knicks had plummeted to 3-7. D’Antoni acknowledged that he had rushed Mozgov into a starter’s role and reduced him to a sometime part-time and often no-time player.Mozgov had 8 rebounds and 3 points in 30 minutes Sunday.“We would like to get to the point where we have a big lineup out there with Mozgov,” D’Antoni said.Ronny Turiaf did not play because of a sprained right ankle he sustained on Friday. Turiaf has had myriad mild injuries this season and is considered day to day.'"

"'11-02-08,'1','Efrosini Katanakis is a mother of two who fought four years in the courts to win her heart’s desire — the $44-an-hour job of painting New York City’s bridges and towers in all kinds of weather, high above the city’s less adventurous throngs.She, and three other women, finally won in September when Judge William Pauley III of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that the city ran bridge painting as a “de facto boys’ club” that turned away ambitious women in “unvarnished sex discrimination.” He ordered that painters be chosen based on a civil service exam.Hooray for Ms. Katanakis, but now comes the hard part. Applications are being accepted for the new, unbiased — and hugely challenging — civil service test in April. Applicants must climb 50-foot-plus towers, calmly amble across scaffolded aeries, lug paint pails of up to 65 pounds, rig lines and tackles for gravity-defying boatswain chairs and clamber atop swooping bridge cables. And mix and apply the right colors of zinc paint.If that sounds too daunting, the private sector already has about 30 outdoor female painters experienced in high-wire challenges, and Ms. Katanakis is one of them. When Judge Pauley found the city engaged in “intentional appeasement” of its bridge-painting fraternity and their lewdly plastered lockers, he awarded $125,000 to each of the offended women.Three of them moved on to other endeavors, but not Ms. Katanakis. At last report, she was aiming to ace all tests and be up this summer scraping and painting the Brooklyn Bridge. “O harp and altar, of the fury fused,” is the way Hart Crane described the bridge, as if anticipating her ascent.'"
"'11-02-08,'1','The Spartans have lost two straight — by 20-plus points for the first time since Izzo’s debut season as head coach — and five of six to fall out of the Associated Press poll after being ranked No. 2 in the preseason.Izzo said “a perfect storm” of problems have jeopardized the program’s chances of extending its N.C.A.A. tournament streak to 14 years, though he is not ready to concede anything.“We ain’t done yet,” he said.Izzo had a chance to finish his career at Michigan State and start one in the N.B.A. last summer when Gilbert wooed him with an offer to make about $6 million a season. He chose to stay and does not regret it.“I’m happy with the decision I made,” Izzo said. “There’s probably some people that aren’t right now.”Izzo’s self-deprecating humor aside, it is no joke that the Spartans might finish the season in the National Invitation Tournament just as his first two teams did in 1996 and 1997.Izzo has tried to avoid directly addressing the team’s bleak N.C.A.A. tournament picture with his players.“You fight as a coach whether you want to put pressure on them, or take it off,” Izzo said. “But there does come a point in time, not talking about it doesn’t help because they’re not idiots. They see it and hear it. Everybody knows roughly what you have to do.“The pressure of the streak — that’s there — but there have been pressures to get to Final Fours that we’ve overcome.”The Spartans probably have to win at least four of their last seven games in the regular season and another game or two in the Big Ten tournament to earn an N.C.A.A. tournament bid.After getting the weekend off, the Spartans play at Ohio State and close the regular season with home games against Illinois, Purdue and Iowa along with matchups at Minnesota and Michigan.“I don’t hate coaching these guys, but it’s been a hard year because of all we’ve been through,” Izzo said. “It has been a perfect storm.”It started during the last N.C.A.A. tournament when the star guard Kalin Lucas ruptured his left Achilles’ tendon, leading to the first of several operations during the off-season that set back the development of key players.Chris Allen, one of the team’s best defenders and shooters, was not welcomed back for his senior season and the junior Korie Lucious, who filled in well for Lucas last season, was kicked off the team two weeks ago.The senior small forward Durrell Summers, whose strong play lifted the team to the last Final Four, is struggling to live up to expectations.The sophomore center Derrick Nix got into the best shape of his life last summer, then almost ate his way off the team in another setback that hurt the team on the court and its fragile morale off it.The improved Big Ten has not helped, with teams making shots and grabbing rebounds against a Spartans program that prides itself on defense and rebounding.Izzo put together a grueling nonconference schedule, which Sagarin rates as the nation’s toughest, that backfired this season because it did not let his banged-up team gain confidence.“He’s not used to losing, but neither are any of us,” forward Draymond Green said Sunday after an 82-56 loss at Wisconsin. “We just have to get our winning ways back.”'"
"'11-02-08,'1','Two rights groups issued what they called a preliminary indictment against former President George W. Bush on torture charges in Geneva on Monday, vowing that he would face a case against him wherever he traveled outside the United States. The 42-page document by the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights and the Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights said that Mr. Bush had authorized the torture of terrorism suspects in American custody. The document was described as “a preliminary legal analysis” that could be modified for particular plaintiffs and countries. “So if he decides to leave the United States in the future, as soon as we hear about it we will have a complaint filed,” said Katherine Gallagher, a senior attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights.

"'11-02-08,'1','But the fund-raising element was missing from the commercials and could only be found online. In the Tibet commercial, the actor Timothy Hutton narrated scenes of refugees as poignant music plays. “The people of Tibet are in trouble,” he said. “Their very culture is in jeopardy.”The scene suddenly shifted to Mr. Hutton seated in a restaurant. “But they still whip up an amazing fish curry,” he continued, “and since 200 of us bought at Groupon.com, we’re each getting $30 worth of Tibetan food for just $15” at a restaurant in Chicago.“A lot of our panel thought it was fairly offensive,” said Tim Calkins, clinical professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., referring to a group of students that assessed Super Bowl ads.“It makes Groupon seem somewhat insensitive as a company,” Mr. Calkins said. “It might have done quite a bit of damage.”In a survey by Ace Metrix, which measures the effectiveness of the creative content of television ads, the Groupon commercial finished 54th of the 58 spots that were tracked. Its overall “Ace score” of 468, on factors like likability and persuasion, compared with a score of 662 for Ace’s top-ranked Super Bowl spot, a commercial for Doritos titled “Pug Attack.”The campaign for Groupon, which carries the theme “Save the money,” is being created by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, a unit of MDC Partners known for risk-taking, rule-breaking work for advertisers like Burger King and Domino’s Pizza.The spot featuring Mr. Hutton concluded with an announcer declaring, “Unlock great discounts in your town at Groupon.com.” On screen were the words, “See it again at Groupon.com.”Only when viewers go to that site, or to savethemoney.groupon.com, do they learn there is actually an altruistic side to the campaign.“If you save so much money that you feel like saving something else,” reads text on the home page of savethemoney.groupon.com, “donate to the four mission-driven organizations below. Groupon is matching donations to make sure they can save the money, too.”In other words, the campaign is apparently meant to spoof do-gooder ads for groups like Save the Children, but also has a charitable component.That message was lost on many Super Bowl viewers, as evidenced by comments left on social media Web sites like Twitter and with Groupon itself.“More than offensive, this campaign is stupid,” wrote a poster on savethemoney.groupon.com identified as Lori N., who concluded by describing herself as a “former Groupon groupie.”Another poster, identified as Tim R., wrote: “If Groupon is launching a charity initiative, it needs to explain this by revising the Super Bowl ads. I watched the ads that were on Fox last night, and I had no idea they were linked to the causes that Groupon appeared to be mocking.”A third poster, identified as Jaymie D., called the campaign “offensive and insensitive,” adding, “I am also canceling my Groupon account immediately.”Groupon, which began as a purveyor of digital coupons in November 2008, is known for so-called stunt marketing that is intended to attract attention. For instance, a contest called Live Off Groupon offers a cash prize of $100,000 to the “Groupawn” who can live for a year with only a laptop computer, a cellphone and an unlimited supply of the company’s discount coupons, known as Groupons. (The progress of the contestant, Josh Stevens, can be followed on liveoffgroupon.com.)Recently, Groupon rejected a $6 billion takeover bid from Google and raised $950 million from large investors like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Morgan Stanley. The company is proceeding with plans for an initial public offering that may value it at $15 billion or more.Late Monday afternoon, Andrew Mason, chief executive at Groupon, posted a lengthy statement on the corporate blog, groupon.com/blog, explaining the company’s intent.“I’ve been spending the day listening to the negative feedback about our Tibet Super Bowl commercial,” he wrote, “and want to take a crack at explaining why we created this campaign.”“The last thing we wanted was to offend our customers,” Mr. Mason said, because “it’s bad business and it’s not where our hearts are.”“We would never have run these ads if we thought they trivialized the causes,” he wrote. “We take the causes we highlighted extremely seriously,” which is “why we created this campaign in partnership with many hallmark community organizations, for whom we’re raising money at SaveTheMoney.org.”One of them, Greenpeace, posted a statement supporting Groupon on its blog on Monday.'"

The bank trading was made possible by bank deregulation supported by politicians of both parties under the influence of the Wall Street banks.In the early 1900s, President Theodore Roosevelt became the “trust buster” because the power of monopolies was threatening the functioning of our economy and government.Unless we get strong presidential leadership to demand limitations on the power of outside forces to dominate our political system, we may no longer have a functioning economy and government.'"
"'11-02-08,'1','WASHINGTON — Whites continued to decline as a share of the American population in 2009, and they now represent less than half of all 3-year-olds, according to a Brookings Institution analysis of census data released Monday.The country’s young population is more diverse than ever, with whites now in the minority in nursery schools, preschools and kindergartens in eight states — Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas — and the District of Columbia, according to William H. Frey, a demographer at Brookings. That was up from six states in 2000.“We are on our way to having a majority of minority students in U.S. schools,” Mr. Frey said.Nationally, whites accounted for 58.8 percent of all school enrollment in 2009, Mr. Frey said, citing the new data, which measured enrollment from preschool to graduate school as of October 2009. That was down from 64.6 percent in 2000, a decline that came with falling birthrates as the white population aged.Population growth has come instead from Hispanics, blacks and Asians, whose children represent ever larger shares of the school population. Twenty-three percent of children in kindergarten were Hispanic in 2009, up from 18 percent in 2000 and 10 percent in 1989. Hispanics now account for nearly a fifth of all enrollment from nursery school through college, Mr. Frey said.The United States has been experiencing the biggest surge of immigrants since the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when European immigrants considerably expanded the population.'"
"'11-02-08,'1','“We believe this is a national security issue,” said Bryan Jacobs, executive director of the Coalition Against Copper Theft, an advocacy group in Washington that includes telecommunications firms, power companies and railroads. “The only thing keeping it from being an epidemic is that scrap yards are now scrutinizing the material. But theft is still rampant.”The ebb and flow in the thefts over the past several years appear to be tied to the movement in international commodity markets. Copper, for instance, is near an all-time high, which has translated into $4-a-pound prices for scrap copper at salvage yards. The price in 2009 was about $1.25 a pound.“If you watch the price of copper, you notice a correlation between the price and the rate of theft,” said Lynne Monaco, security director for Frontier Communications, which has seen an increase in thefts of its power and broadband lines in the 27 states it serves.Platinum is now trading at about $1,800 an ounce; rhodium at about $2,400 an ounce; and palladium, at more than $800 an ounce. Catalytic converters, a component of an automobile’s exhaust system, contain trace amounts of one of the three precious metals. The metals help cleanse emissions by turning toxic gases into less harmful exhaust at high temperatures.In December, the Ohio Department of Insurance warned about a rash of catalytic converter thefts in the state. “It’s a $200 or $300 payday for a minute’s worth of work,” said Jarrett Dunbar, a spokesman for the state’s insurance commission.The F.B.I. has said it considers theft of copper wire to be a threat to the nation’s baseline ability to function. Last month, the agency said it was planning to update a 2008 report that called the crime a threat to the nation’s “critical infrastructure.”Several states have enacted laws in the past few years to combat the theft of copper and catalytic converters. Some cities have taken particularly strong measures.Fresno had been losing nearly $1 million a year to copper wire thefts before it began shuttering its utility covers with concrete.“At one point, for every street light we would repair, five more would go out because of wire theft — that’s the pace of the battle we were losing,” said Patrick N. Wiemiller, director of public works in Fresno. “We can’t sneeze away $75,000 a month, especially as a self-insured city.”California enacted a law in 2009 requiring people selling copper wire or catalytic converters at scrap yards to be photographed, have their driver’s license copied and wait at least three days for payment. Georgia and Oregon have approved similar laws.Other states, including Florida, Hawaii, Michigan and Oklahoma, have elevated the illegal possession of a large amount of copper wire to a felony. In Arizona, the purchase or sale of individual catalytic converters by most people is now illegal.But whether the flurry of new legislation has reduced thefts is unclear.“Our goal was to completely stop copper theft,” said State Representative Guy Liebmann, who wrote Oklahoma’s law. “It pretty much has done that, but this is like trying to pass a law to stop people texting from their cars. It’s not easy to stop. I think we’ve done all we can.”Salvage yard owners say the primary flaw in the laws is that local police forces lack the time to monitor every scrap business, which larger business owners insist gives smaller firms a competitive edge.“The problem is that everybody has to go by the law or it gives an unfair advantage to the smaller guys, who are going ahead and buying it,” said Matt White, general manager of Yaffe Iron & Metal in Muskogee, Okla. “It has hurt our business.”Utility companies have taken their own preventive measures, including offering rewards of as much as $10,000 and painting copper wire to make it less valuable as scrap.The American Electrical Power Company in Ohio said it had begun to replace its copper wire with wire that contains less copper and is also more difficult to cut through. The company has also put up signs letting prospective thieves know that the new brand of wire is not worth stealing.“The new wire has no scrap value, and nobody has been able to cut through it,” said Pat Hemlepp, a company spokesman. “But we don’t know whether it has been successful in reducing thefts because traditional copper thefts are continuing.”'"
"'11-02-08,'1','Stephen J. Adler, who left the top editing job at BusinessWeek when Bloomberg L.P. took over the magazine in 2009, was named editor in chief on Monday of the Reuters News service.Thomson Reuters Corporation, the news and information provider that owns Reuters, said that Mr. Adler had been named to the position effective immediately.He is taking over from David A. Schlesinger, who after four years at the helm is becoming chairman of Thomson Reuters China.Mr. Adler spent 16 years at The Wall Street Journal before serving as editor in chief of BusinessWeek for more than four years. He stepped down in December 2009 after Bloomberg bought the weekly and handed the reins to Josh Tyrangiel, then deputy managing editor of Time magazine.Thomson Reuters hired Mr. Adler last year to recruit and lead a team of reporters in developing news services for the company’s legal, tax and accounting, and health care and science divisions.The company, which is based in New York, said Mr. Adler would now integrate that team with the rest of Reuters News. In addition, as executive vice president of news for the company, he will oversee Thomson Reuters’s entire news strategy and operation.Thomson Reuters has been slowly recovering from the economic downturn, which put a squeeze on the financial companies and law firms that subscribe to its services. The company’s markets division, which suffered the worst of the recession as the hard-hit financial sector shed jobs, had a modest uptick during the third quarter. That division includes products like trading terminals and the Reuters news service.'"
"'11-02-08,'1','“I’m here in the interest of being more neighborly,” Mr. Obama said, alluding to the contentious relationship he has had with the Chamber of Commerce over the past two years. “I strolled over from across the street, and, look, maybe if we had brought over a fruitcake when I first moved in, we would have gotten off to a better start. But I’m going to make up for it.”The chamber has fiercely opposed most of Mr. Obama’s health care and banking agenda and spent more than $50 million during last year’s midterm elections to cast the president and his party as anti-business and a threat to capitalism.But the chamber, too, is eager to tone down the rhetoric, according to senior officials there. At the height of the high-profile fight with the White House, several big-name companies left its board, citing concern about the chamber’s opposition to the administration’s efforts.Thomas J. Donohue, the Chamber of Commerce’s president, has in the past warned of a “regulatory tsunami” that will result from Mr. Obama’s policies. In particular, he told reporters after the November elections last year that the health care law would produce hundreds of new burdens on American businesses.But in introducing Mr. Obama, Mr. Donohue emphasized his group’s desire to work with the administration in areas where they might agree. Those include increasing free trade and exports, investing in technology and infrastructure and reducing the nation’s debt.“I reaffirm the American business community’s absolute commitment to working with you and your administration to advancing our shared priorities,” Mr. Donohue said.Mr. Obama’s remarks reflected the careful effort of a White House eager to seem more pro-business but anxious about the accusations of betrayal by some of the Democratic president’s most liberal allies.The president’s basic message to the business community — “I get it,” he said of the profit-making imperative — was joined with an admonition that corporate America must feel some sense of duty as well. That effort to walk a political line appeared to please neither side completely on Monday.Mr. Obama’s suggestion that businesses can help the economy recover by spending their reserves was met with skepticism by some in the audience. Harold Jackson, a executive at Buffalo Supply Inc., a medical supply company, called it naïve.“Any business person has to look at the demand to their company for their product and services, and make hiring decisions,” Mr. Jackson said. “I think it’s a little outside the bounds to suggest that if we hire people we don’t need, there will be more demand.”Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate, said in remarks Monday that “we’ll just have to wait and see whether the administration’s actions support its rhetoric.” Mr. McConnell urged Mr. Obama to prove his intentions to help the business community by doing more to push free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama.At the same time, Mr. Obama’s decision to address the chamber in the first place has upset liberal groups, who say the president is consorting with the very forces they believe have worked to undercut his policies.Public Citizen, a liberal group in Washington, issued a statement condemning the president’s comment that he would “go anywhere” in the world to promote trade, a line that prompted one of the few moments of applause from the crowd of business leaders.“It’s unclear what is more mortifying: President Barack Obama choosing the club of America’s notorious job-offshorers to talk about the importance of creating American jobs, or his rallying of his fiercest political opponents to help him overcome the majority of Americans who oppose more-of-the-same job-killing trade agreements,” said Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch.Erica Payne, the founder of the Agenda Project, a liberal organization in New York, said: “Two weeks ago, the president promised that he would work to rebuild people’s faith in government. Meeting with the biggest lobbyists in the country is hardly a step in the right direction.”In an interview after Mr. Obama’s speech, Ms. Payne said the president’s speech had “many words, little content.”'"
"'11-02-08,'1','Many Tibetans scoff at the spying allegations. But the episode starkly exposes the precarious position of the and the exiled movement of Tibetan Buddhism he has led since he fled China in 1959. The Tibetan cause depends heavily on Indian good will, particularly as China has intensified efforts to discredit and infiltrate their exile organization.Tensions are rising between India and China over a variety of issues, including Tibet. Sophisticated hackers, traced to China, have penetrated computer systems in Dharamsala and at Indian government ministries. China has long blamed Tibetan exiles in India for fueling instability across the border in Tibet. But now India, too, seems more wary of Tibetan activities; the Indian police are investigating new Tibetan monasteries near the border for possible ties to China, a police official said.Meanwhile, Chinese leaders are betting that the Tibetan movement will after the eventual death of the Dalai Lama, who is 74; they have even declared their intent to name his successor.Indian suspicions about the Karmapa are a particular problem. He has a global following and, at 25 years old, he is viewed as a potential future leader of the movement — a possibility deeply compromised if Indian authorities consider him a foreign agent.“What Tibetans must address is the idea that Tibetans could be considered a security threat to India and not an asset,” said Tsering Shakya, a leading Tibet specialist. “But the idea that a boy at the age of 14 was selected as a covert agent by a foreign government to destabilize India — and the assumption the boy will assume leadership of the Tibetan movement and eventually work against India — is worthy of a cheap spy novel.”For the past week, Tibetans have rallied behind the Karmapa, with thousands of monks holding candlelight vigils at his residence. Tibet’s political leaders, including the Dalai Lama, have called on the Karmapa’s aides to correct any financial irregularities but have dismissed any suspicions about the Karmapa’s being a Chinese agent.“Baseless, all baseless,” said Samdhong Rinpoche, the prime minister of the Tibetan government in exile. “Not a fraction of anything that has a base of truth.”Many Indian intelligence agents have distrusted the Karmapa from the start. He was a unique case, since both the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government had endorsed him. He would explain his escape as an act of principle; he was being pressured to denounce the Dalai Lama, and Chinese officials also were forbidding him to study with high lamas outside China. Many investigators were unconvinced, wondering how such an important figure could slip so easily over the border.On Wednesday, when the procession of monks arrived to offer support, the Karmapa described the current controversy as a “misunderstanding” and expressed confidence in the fairness of Indian authorities.“We all have taken refuge and settled here,” he said. “India, in contrast to Communist China, is a democratic country that is based on the rule of law. Therefore, I trust that things will improve and the truth will become clear in time.”Within Tibetan Buddhism, the Karmapa ranks third after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, with each man believed to be reincarnated through the centuries. After the death of the previous Karmapa, a bitter feud broke out between the high lamas charged with identifying his successor: at least two other people now claim to be the Karmapa, though a majority of Tibetans, including the Dalai Lama, recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje.But this dispute has complicated efforts by the Karmapa to claim the monastery built by his predecessor in the Indian border region of . Indian officials have blocked him from taking ownership until claims from rival Tibetan factions are resolved — which is why, given the uncertainty over the duration of the legal fight, the Karmapa sought land for a new monastery, his aides say.The land deal led to the current controversy. On Jan. 26, India’s Republic Day, police officers apprehended two men at a highway checkpoint after discovering about $219,000 in Indian rupees inside their car — money they said had come from the Karmapa. The next day, the police raided the Gyuto Monastery and found boxes of cash from more than 20 countries, including China; officers arrested the financial officer overseeing the Karmapa’s charitable trust and continue to investigate the Karmapa himself.“He ran from China,” said P. L. Thakur, the police inspector general in Dharamsala. “Tibet is under China. Why and how has this currency come here? For what purpose? Why was it being kept there?”Naresh Mathur, one of the Karmapa’s lawyers, said the money was from the devotees who for the past decade had come from around the world for the Karmapa’s blessing. By custom, they leave an offering, usually envelopes of cash; the Chinese renminbi, he said, are from Tibetans or other Chinese who have made a pilgrimage to Dharamsala.Mr. Mathur said the Karmapa’s aides were unable to deposit the money because they were awaiting a decision on their application — made several years ago — for government approval to accept foreign currency. In the interim, they say, the money is stored where the officers found it — in boxes kept in a dorm room shared by monks.Mr. Mathur also denied any suggestion that the land deal was secretive or illegal, and he said that it was the seller who demanded cash.On Friday, the Karmapa offered blessings to devotees who lined up to meet him in his fourth-floor reception room. Among them was a group of Chinese followers from the manufacturing hub of . Aides say that bookkeeping mistakes may have been made in recording the donations, but that the intent is to handle the money the right way.“We will be making changes,” said Deki Chungyalpa, a spokeswoman for the Karmapa. “Like hiring a professional accountant who is not a monk.”For many Tibetans, the broader concern is about the future of the Tibetan movement itself. Tenzin Tsundue is a Tibetan activist who once unfurled a banner at an appearance by President of China. He says India has always been a steadfast friend of Tibetans, providing a home for as many as 120,000 Tibetan refugees, yet now he worries its support may be wavering.“This country that we are so grateful to is alleging the Karmapa is a spy for China,” he said. “And we can’t understand that at all.”'"

These rivals, who have tangled in the past over cinematic awards bait, are both racing hard for best picture, with Mr. Rudin taking his riding crop to “The Social Network” and “True Grit,” and Mr. Weinstein digging in his spurs for “The King’s Speech.”But in the end Mr. Weinstein got to work the room alone during the cocktail hour that led up to the lunch. Mr. Rudin, perhaps reflecting the rigors of the season, was said to be home sick with pneumonia.Mr. Weinstein was congratulated by the likes of Robert A.

"'11-02-08,'1','JERUSALEM — Several dozen Jordanian tribesmen, historically core loyalists to the monarchy, have issued a rare statement calling for urgent and far-reaching political reform in Jordan. They said that without it, the country was headed down the path taken by Tunisia and Egypt.“Before stability and food, the Jordanian people seek liberty, dignity, democracy, justice, equality, human rights and an end to corruption,” said the statement, signed by 36 members of tribes, mostly Bedouins.The statement, ignored by most Jordanian news media, was published Monday on Ammonnews, the country’s most popular news Web site. But the site was hacked and out of commission for four hours on Monday, restored only after about 50 journalists held a sit-in at the journalists’ association headquarters in Amman, the capital.“The intelligence police called us and told us they were taking down our site because it was against national interests,” Basil Okoor, the publisher and editor of Ammonnews, said in a telephone interview. “But we are not going to accept this way of dealing with journalists.”The tribesmen’s statement said, “We are on the path where the floods of Tunisia and Egypt will reach Jordan sooner or later, whether we want it or not.” It called on King Abdullah II to no longer appoint the members of his cabinet but rather for them to be elected.Jordan is a country of six million, more than half of them Palestinian, and 40 percent members of tribes, also known as East Bankers.

Created with a grant from the United States Agency for International Development, it is being produced by experts on human and animal diseases from a few institutions, scientists announced on Monday at a conference here on emerging diseases.The consortium was put together in 2009, during the pandemic of H1N1 swine flu, which had a surprising mixture of genes from North American and Eurasian pigs but had never been detected in pigs before it was found in humans in Veracruz, Mexico.It had become clear over the years that there was too little surveillance of animal diseases that can infect humans. For example, the virus that caused the outbreak of SARS and the family of viruses that include Ebola are all thought to have originated in bats.The system will monitor data from 50,000 Web sites with many types of information, including World Health Organization alerts, online discussions by experts, wildlife trade reports and local news. How useful it is will depend on how well it filters that river of information.“We strongly believe in public access to the data we collect,” said Damien Joly, an associate director of wildlife health monitoring for one of the institutions, the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs New York City’s zoos and aquarium and has animal health projects around the world. “It doesn’t do public health much good to collect data and let it sit while it awaits publication.”'"
"'11-02-08,'1','These trusted travelers would probably pay a fee for the vetting, much like the $100 application fee for the Global Entry program operated by United States Customs and Border Protection. After submitting to an interview, a background check and a fingerprint scan to join Global Entry, members can clear customs using a kiosk instead of waiting to speak with an agent.“Our security apparatus has already acknowledged that we can create trusted traveler programs,” said Geoff Freeman, executive vice president of the U.S. Travel Association. “Let’s expand on that.”The association, a trade group, plans to release its own proposal for ways to improve security checkpoints next month, but many of its core concepts overlap with ideas presented by the International Air Transport Association at an industry conference last year.Both groups envision three screening lanes with different security procedures based on varying levels of risk. Trusted travelers would undergo lighter screening, perhaps passing through a metal detector with their shoes on and laptops in their bags, whereas anyone flagged as potentially risky would receive more intensive scrutiny, using technology like the body scanners and interviews with officers trained in behavioral analysis.Although many of the procedural details are still just proposals, the idea is to determine who may present a risk based on better use of government intelligence and watch lists as well as suspicious behaviors like checking in for a one-way international flight with no luggage.Travelers in the middle group — neither vetted nor risky — would receive an intermediate level of screening, but ideally the process would be quicker than current procedures because suspicious passengers would be diverted to a separate lane.Making the screening process more efficient is the major goal of both trade associations, based on concerns that as the economy improves and passenger traffic increases, security lines will slow down, deterring people from traveling. Whether more invasive procedures like pat-downs and body scanners are discouraging air travel is open to debate, but there is a growing consensus that 10 years after the Transportation Security Administration was created, it is time to re-evaluate the agency’s strategy.In remarks to the American Bar Association in January, Mr. Pistole expressed a need to formulate a vision for transportation security, mentioning a trusted traveler program as an option under consideration and expressing an openness to other suggestions.“If people have ideas, he wants to hear them because he’s looking at ways to make changes,” a T.S.A. spokesman, Nicholas Kimball, said.In response to concerns about the body scanners, the agency last week demonstrated software it was testing at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport that allowed the machines to display a generic outline of a human figure rather than the graphic images some passengers view as a privacy invasion.The agency has also responded to pilots’ concerns about escalating security measures by expediting the screening process for crew members, based on their trusted status and the background checks they undergo as a condition of their employment. The Air Line Pilots Association is also calling for a more risk-based approach to screening, not just for the crew but also for passengers.There is growing support for this type of approach, even on a global level. The International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations body that helps establish aviation policies for 190 member countries, has convened a working group to make recommendations about security screening procedures. A trusted traveler program is one idea on the table, said Jim Marriott, head of the organization’s aviation security branch.While there is support for more standardized practices around the world — rather than a hodgepodge of rules about liquids and laptops — Mr. Marriott cautioned that countries had different security needs, capabilities and resources.“There are also some hard realities that we have to recognize in the security world about the protection of personal information and sensitivities to individual rights,” he said.Another issue is the cost of escalating security measures, and how much taxpayers and travelers are willing to spend to feel safe in the air.“We need strong high-level leadership that levels with the public and says, ‘Look, you cannot expect perfection out of any security system,’ ” said Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation.For years, Mr. Poole has advocated for a more risk-based approach to aviation security, including some type of trusted traveler program. Now there finally seems to be more support to make it happen, he said.“For the first time since 9/11, I think we have the conditions where it might be politically possible to have a serious debate about it,” he said.'"
"'11-02-08,'1','For six months, Emily Huters and her husband, Trey Hatch, spent five hours every Sunday morning taking turns caring for their son, Henry, so they could clean up their loft for open houses.They packed up Henry’s play mat and toys, tried to remove smashed raisins from every crevice of his highchair and moved his hefty nursing chair to a neighbor’s apartment. Fifteen minutes before the open house began, they broke down his ExerSaucer, dropped him in his stroller and headed for the door.“He was generally up for the adventure,” Ms. Huters said about how Henry, who turns 1 later this month, handled the schedule. Still, she said, he “doesn’t have unlimited patience.”So against the advice of their broker, the couple recently accepted an offer for their two-bedroom apartment at 423 Atlantic Avenue in Boerum Hill. The broker wanted them to hold out until spring, when he predicted they would get more money. Ms. Huters could not be swayed.“I had enough,” Ms. Huters said. “That whole morning we would spend cleaning up, tidying things, and that was time we couldn’t spend playing with him.”It can be exhausting for buyers to trudge from open house to open house for weekends on end, and it can be even more so for the seller who has to prepare for all those buyers. It takes time to create the appearance that a home is both lived-in and cared for by housekeepers, especially when small children have had the run of the place.Not long ago, buyers were offering the asking price, even before the first open house. But in a slower real estate market, the broker, Antonio del Rosario of Rutenberg Realty,said, more clients may be growing weary of working all week and then preparing for and disappearing from the open houses they must hold every Sunday.He said that even though Mr. Hatch and Ms. Huters received an offer close to their $825,000 asking price, they could have received nearly $900,000 if they had waited until spring, when buyers would not have to trudge through snow and ice to see their home.But Ms. Huters and Mr. Hatch reached their breaking point. And they do not appear to be losing money on the deal, since public records show they bought the home in 2007 for $749,000.Ms. Huters said that the summer’s relentless heat, followed by the snow-covered winter, meant there had been few Sundays when it was pleasant enough to spend the entire afternoon outside.During open houses, they went out for lunch and, to take up time, tried to eat as slowly as possible. They went shopping for groceries, and after Henry could sit up they visited the playground. When visitors occasionally stayed past the end of the open house, they would stay in the hallway, rocking Henry in his stroller.After a two-week break around Thanksgiving, Ms. Huters found it especially difficult to return to the weekend open house groove. They accepted the offer in late January and returned to spending Sundays playing with Henry.“We were happy to take our offers,” Ms. Huters said. “At some point, after hiding things every weekend, you kind of just want to lay them out on the floor.”Mitchell Wexler, a Corcoran broker selling a one-bedroom in a fourth-floor walk-up at 15 Butler Place in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, knew that the apartment had flaws. He tried to address the problems in advance with a little signage. Halfway up to the apartment, he posted a sign telling buyers they were nearly there. He hung a sign over an oversize refrigerator suggesting that it be replaced. At other apartments he has hung photos in an unfurnished room showing what it looked like with furniture, and on overcast days he has hung signs on windows stressing the sunlight. What were the results? Mr. Wexler said he soon got an offer close to the asking price, which was accepted.IF THE POOL COULD TALKAfter Robert Kaufman, Evelyn Van-Zeller’s brother,  died in 1995, she inherited his five-story town house at 232 West 15th Street. The place has more contraptions for relaxation than do most Manhattan spas, including  an eight-foot-deep swimming pool, a sauna, a hot tub and a sun deck. It also came with a libidinous history. For the past 16 years, New Yorkers have approached Ms. Van-Zeller to regale her with stories about the parties her brother, who was a bachelor, and a previous owner held there. Now, a broker, Maggie Kent of Core, is selling the house for $10.9 million — history included.NO MORE FLIPPING OUTThe Federal Housing Finance Agency has backed away from a plan to bar Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from buying up loans in buildings that have flip taxes. Since many condominiums and co-operatives depend on flip taxes — a small portion of an apartment’s sale price, usually paid by the seller — the rule could have driven prices down by making it harder for buyers to find mortgages. New York brokers sent the agency more than 600 letters pleading against the change and got their wish on Feb. 1.'"

"'11-02-08,'1','THNAL BEK, Cambodia — Refugees clustered around cooking fires at a schoolhouse here as Cambodia and Thailand prepared for the possibility of further violence after a fourth day of shelling on Monday at their disputed border.The Cambodian Army cleared out military vehicles and construction equipment and evacuated villagers from the foot of a steep cliff that is the site of an 11th-century Hindu temple claimed by both sides.The dispute involves a century-old French colonial map, a ruling by the International Court of Justice and a decision in 2008 by Unesco, the cultural arm of the United Nations, to list the temple, Preah Vihear, as a Cambodian World Heritage site.It has become tangled within the complex knot of Thai politics, as well as simmering enmity between the two neighbors that has erupted into violence near the temple several times since the World Heritage listing.The current fighting is the most sustained engagement between the two nations. As many as a total of five civilians and soldiers have been killed on both sides, according to Thai and Cambodian news reports.Cambodia urged the United Nations to send peacekeepers to the border area on Monday, one day after asking the Security Council to convene an urgent meeting to “stop Thailand’s aggression.”'"

"'11-02-09,'1','Given the public’s deep lack of faith in the nation’s political class, many Haitians would welcome the shake-up Mr. Aristide might bring. But members of the international community have expressed concern that Mr. Aristide — who was beloved by the poor but criticized by many for demagoguery, corruption and the suppression of political opponents — could create widespread instability at a precarious moment.José Miguel Insulza, the secretary general of the Organization for American States, said Mr. Aristide’s return should not be considered until after the next president is sworn in. But the two leading candidates are not Aristide supporters, possibly making it harder for him to return then.Jon Piechowski, a spokesman for the American Embassy in Haiti, said that while Haiti’s government had the right to decide on the timing, “what Haiti needs right now, coming out of a prolonged first round of elections, is a period of calm, not divisive actions that can only distract from the vital task of forming a legitimate and credible government.”Brian Dean Curran, the American ambassador to Haiti during Mr. Aristide’s final years in office, offered a far more blunt assessment. “I think it’s a colossal mistake,” Mr. Curran said. “It’s particularly bad at this moment when the political situation is so fragile.”Mr. Aristide has said little about his intentions. Over the last few weeks, he has been reluctant to speak with reporters in South Africa, where the government has paid for a home, a car and security for the past few years.He explained his desire to return in a recent op-ed article in The Guardian, using pointed language: “What we have learned in one long year of mourning after Haiti’s earthquake is that an exogenous plan of reconstruction — one that is profit-driven, exclusionary, conceived of and implemented by non-Haitians — cannot reconstruct Haiti. It is the solemn obligation of all Haitians to join in the reconstruction and to have a voice in the direction of the nation.”He went on to say that he planned to focus on education — “the field I know best and love.”Mr. Curran said he doubted Mr. Aristide would limit himself to teaching. “No one should believe that for an instant,” he said.Indeed, a quiet academic life may not be likely for a populist like Mr. Aristide, whose popularity may surpass any other contemporary political figure. “His return would make very stark the real rouleau-compresseur, or bulldozer power, of the population,” said Amy Wilentz, author of “The Rainy Season: Haiti Since Duvalier.” “I believe they would rise en masse to greet him and that the airport scene would be like nothing anyone has witnessed in recent times in Haiti.”This popular support, Ms. Wilentz said, could protect him from the fate of Mr. Duvalier, who was quickly questioned and now faces charges of corruption and human rights abuses. United Nations officials have already raised the issue of Mr. Aristede’s legal vulnerabilities, and other efforts to influence his decision are also likely to be employed, according to diplomats, though they may be counterbalanced by President René Préval. He was a protégé of Mr. Aristide, and even before the earthquake that further damaged his standing he had become concerned with being forced into exile, according to embassy cables published by WikiLeaks.One theory advanced by some Haiti observers is that Mr. Préval believes that Mr. Aristide, with his large following, could help prevent that from happening.'"
"'11-02-09,'1','“It was great to get that rescinded,” Stoudemire said Tuesday at practice. “Back to where I was before.”Donnie Walsh, the Knicks’ president, said he would soon talk with Stoudemire.“Now Amar’e is in a position where he has to keep everything in check or else he’s going to lose a game,” Walsh said. “He doesn’t want that. We’re at a point where he’s going to have to be really careful.”Stoudemire’s technicals stem from a blend of complaints, lost debates, air punches and old-fashion bullying. Eight are for some form of arguing. The others were the result of brief player altercations, an extra push to Channing Frye here or a shove to Joel Anthony there.Complaining became nearly as common in the N.B.A. as a dunk (Rasheed Wallace drew a record 41 technicals in 80 games a decade ago). The N.B.A. enacted the 16-technical threshold before the 2005-6 season, studying several years of totals and arriving at the number as a total that warranted an additional penalty. That was not enough of an deterrent.Joel Litvin, the N.B.A.’s president for league operations, said in a telephone interview that the “respect for the game” guidelines are working well after a shaky preseason introduction.The league reviews each technical and flagrant foul and adjusts them, if need be. With more than a half-season under the new guidelines, officials use video to evaluate what violates the new rules. Having a video reference aids the officials, Litvin said. He added that fans were watching a cleaner game and coaches are happier because the less time players devote to complaining, the more they spend focused on returning to defense.Through Sunday, officials have called 664 unsportsmanlike technicals, compared with 502 at the same point in 2009-10. At this point in the 2008-9 season, 626 had been called.“High profile or not, we’re never pleased about suspending players,” Litvin said. “It’s just that the vast majority of players have been able to control their passion for the game in what’s happening on the floor and are not approaching the 16-technical threshold. There are a couple of players that are, and they have the ability to pull it back.”As players like Howard, Stoudemire and Charlotte’s Stephen Jackson creep closer to the limit, there is also a belief that they will control themselves to avoid suspension. Howard, who has only drawn about half of his technicals from the rule change, received his 15th technical last season with a month left. He stayed out of technical trouble the rest of the way.Stoudemire is emotional on the court. He talks — with teammates, officials and coaches. On Sunday, Sixers Coach Doug Collins complained to officials that Stoudemire kept playing after the whistle. Stoudemire, who was within earshot, smiled, walked toward Collins and engaged him in a conversation.“I don’t want to say it’s impossible,” Knicks Coach Mike D’Antoni said of Stoudemire avoiding more technicals. “It’s not impossible. But it makes it a little tougher. That’s for sure. We just have to adjust to it.”Traditionally, Stoudemire has ranked annually near the top technicals receivers. He drew 13 last season in Phoenix, tying for fifth in the league, and has finished in the top five in three other seasons.“He’s one of those guys that gets fired up,” said Raja Bell, once Stoudemire’s teammate with the Suns. “Whenever you are doing that, you’re riding the fine line. Some guys play much better when their emotional, they’re better.”That is the test for Stoudemire and the others — locating that balance between better and suspended under the new rules before it is too late.Eddy Curry and Anthony Randolph, both involved in trade speculation involving Carmelo Anthony, did not attend Tuesday’s practice.

"'11-02-09,'1','A real estate broker was cleared on Tuesday of misdemeanor charges that he served alcohol to the under-age daughter of a United States ambassador before she fell to her death from a Midtown high-rise building in August.Prosecutors told a Manhattan judge that there was not enough evidence to prove that the broker, Ilan Nassimi, had served alcohol to minors at a party in his apartment, from which Nicole John, 17, the daughter of Eric G. John, the ambassador to Thailand at the time, fell to her death.The investigation revealed that Ms. John had consumed alcohol before arriving at Mr. Nassimi’s party, an assistant district attorney said in court. A judge then dismissed the charges.Ms. John was found unconscious at 4:14 a.m. on Aug. 27 on a third-floor landing of Herald Towers at 50 West 34th Street. She was pronounced dead at the scene.The police said the fall appeared to have been accidental. Ms. John, a student at Parsons the New School for Design, had been out with friends at Tenjune, a club in the meatpacking district, the police said, before going to Mr. Nassimi’s party on the 25th floor of Herald Towers.'"
"'11-02-09,'1','To be eliminated from the chase is to find peace.“The rumors are over,” Derrick Favors, the Nets’ prized rookie forward, told reporters last week. “I don’t have to worry about them.”Favors and the Nets’ Devin Harris acknowledged being unnerved by the reports. The Nuggets’ Chauncey Billups, who wants to finish his career in Denver, was also bothered.The rumors have appeared to take a mental toll on the Knicks’ Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari.The Pistons are still dealing with the fallout from an aborted three-way trade with the Nets and the Nuggets. At the peak of the talks, Detroit benched its onetime star Richard Hamilton, deepening a rift between them.The failed trade also tarnished the Nets’ owner, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, and general manager, Billy King.Meanwhile, as the Nuggets canvass and recanvass the league in search of better deals, nothing else is getting done. Teams in the Anthony hunt are hesitant to make even minor deals, knowing they may need their draft picks, trade exceptions and expiring contracts to send to Denver.The wave of collateral damage claimed another team Tuesday, with ESPN.com reporting that the Los Angeles Lakers could swap Andrew Bynum, their talented young center, for Anthony.That report, as with so many others, was quickly picked apart and dismissed, classified as a warmed-over discussion from last summer or a means of provoking the Knicks into making a better offer.Yet the questions now hover over the Lakers. Would they really part with the 23-year-old Bynum, who is already one of the top centers in the league? Can they win a third straight championship without at least one bruising 7-footer? Are they so concerned about Kobe Bryant’s durability that they feel compelled to add another high-volume perimeter scorer?If Internet polls are any indications, fans say the answer is yes, to all of the above. Some 77 percent favored the trade in a poll on ESPN.com’s Los Angeles site. An LATimes.com poll yielded similar support.The Lakers’ interest is understandable. Four of their top players — Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and Derek Fisher — are over 30. Bryant is in his 15th season. At some point, they will have to replenish the lineup and find a new star to build around.But giving up Bynum now, as the Lakers make their last run before Coach Phil Jackson retires, seems foolish. The Boston Celtics, their finals opponent in 2008 and 2010, are loaded with big men — Kevin Garnett, Kendrick Perkins, Shaquille O’Neal and Glen Davis. The Lakers’ top rivals in the West, San Antonio and Dallas, are also well stocked.The Nuggets clearly need the Lakers, or another talent-laden team, to enter the fray and put pressure on the Knicks — Anthony’s preferred destination. Donnie Walsh, the Knicks’ president, is hesitant to break up his young core, knowing that he may be able to sign Anthony this summer.Walsh has always taken the long view in rebuilding, setting up the Knicks to have cap room in 2010, 2011 and 2012. There is really no desperation to land Anthony, a one-dimensional scorer who fills no obvious need.The Knicks do have holes at center and in the backcourt, and could find answers in the 2011 free-agent class. Available big men could include Tyson Chandler, Nene and Marc Gasol. Available guards could include Jason Richardson, Jamal Crawford, Aaron Brooks and Rodney Stuckey. They could get two impact players for the same price as signing Anthony.The 2012 class could include three of the N.B.A.’s best players: Dwight Howard, Chris Paul and Deron Williams.Committing to Anthony now would shut the Knicks out of free agency for years. Waiting keeps their options open. In today’s N.B.A., there is always another superstar on the horizon and another drama waiting to unfold.'"
"'11-02-09,'1','A spokeswoman for Dr. Gingrey, Brooke Sammon, said on Tuesday that the lawmaker was not available for comment.In response to written questions, his office issued a statement: “All parties in the case agreed to settle due to various factors, including the cost, time commitment and stress of another trial, along with the desire by all parties to have final closure on this case.” The statement added that Dr. Gingrey “strongly believes he and his partners practiced fully within the standard of care and no causation on his part was ever established in this case.”Dr. Gingrey was not the only obstetrician to treat the woman after she was hospitalized in 2001 for symptoms, including intense abdominal pain. The case included an accusation by the woman’s husband that Dr. Gingrey, contrary to hospital records, had not checked on his wife for several hours while he was on his shift; Dr. Gingrey insisted that he had.The legislation being sponsored by Dr. Gingrey would, among other things, limit damages for pain and suffering in malpractice cases to $250,000, restrict fees paid to lawyers representing patients and create alternative means to lawsuits for resolving medical disputes.The bill would also bar the awarding of punitive damages in cases brought against manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and other products that are approved, cleared or licensed for sale by the Food and Drug Administration.Dr. Gingrey’s proposal is supported by medical groups, including the American Medical Association. Its opponents include the American Association for Justice, which represents plaintiffs’ lawyers.In the statement, Dr. Gingrey’s office provided on Tuesday, he defended curbing damages under new legislation: “Too often our medical liability system benefits third parties over patients, allowing investors and law firms to reap huge percentages of rewards instead of the injured parties who need them most.”President Obama again last month promised lawmakers that he was willing to work with Republicans to address medical malpractice reform. The administration has yet to put forward its proposal.Obstetricians are more frequently sued for malpractice than many other types of doctors. A decision by a doctor or his or her insurer to settle a case does not mean that they did not care appropriately for a patient.In a pretrial deposition, Dr. Gingrey testified that he had been sued at least three other times over malpractice during his long career. In one case, a jury found against him; in another case, there was a settlement; and in another case, the patient dropped the action, he testified.The $500,000 settlement involving Dr. Gingrey arose from a case filed in 2002. At that time, a Georgia couple, Kimberly D. Walker and Scott M. Walker, sued him, two other obstetricians, a Georgia hospital and two surgeons.Among other things, the lawsuit charged that the doctors had failed to properly diagnose that Mrs. Walker, who was experiencing severe abdominal pains, nausea and other problems, was suffering from acute appendicitis.When Mrs. Walker’s appendix burst, it caused a huge infection that led to the loss of her 15-week-old fetus. She also developed respiratory distress, and after a month on a mechanical ventilator, suffered a stroke that left her partially disabled, court papers state.Robert U. Wright, one of the lawyers who represented the Walkers, said the hospital and surgeons had settled the claims against them for an undisclosed sum. However, Dr. Gingrey and two colleagues at the obstetrics practice where he worked had not settled, and the lawsuit against them went to trial in 2004.After about a week of testimony by the plaintiffs, the judge issued a directed verdict dismissing the lawsuit against Dr. Gingrey and his colleagues. At that time, Dr. Gingrey, who had become a congressman two years earlier, spoke about the case.“It was a major distraction from my Congressional responsibilities,” Dr. Gingrey was quoted by Roll Call, a newspaper, as saying at that time. “It is a great relief to be out from under that.”However, in 2005, a Georgia appeals court ordered a retrial after holding that the trial judge had erred in entering the directed verdict. That court also said that there were disputed issues of fact that a jury could decide, including differing accounts by Dr. Gingrey and Mr. Walker about the treatment of Mrs. Walker.The settlement involving Dr. Gingrey was made before a second trial was scheduled to start. The $500,000 was paid by an insurer, and it covered Dr. Gingrey, the other two obstetricians and the practice itself.'"

This gives employees added incentive to protect the financial health of their employer.Yet it is not necessary for employees to hold all of their stock forever, or to have all of their wealth in the form of their employer’s stock. Over time, they can — and should — be allowed to sell some stock, as long as they keep enough.And if they are allowed to sell particular shares, then they should also be allowed to hedge them.The author is the dean of Columbia Law School and has written about hedging and compensation policies.'"
"'11-02-09,'1','Re “A Swede by Any Other Name. In Fact, Many Swedes” (Stockholm Journal, Feb. 1):I enjoyed reading your article about Swedes changing their last names. One crucial point not mentioned, however, is how nobility and status have an effect on people wanting to switch.In Sweden, “-son” names are generally “farmer” or “common” names, nothing special. Most blue-blood names are easily identifiable since there are not too many Swedish noble families.Other desirable last names would either be identifiable European noble names or names that sound noble because, for example, there’s a “von” or “af” in front. Wetterlund has a higher status than any “-son” name; Pantzar and Cervall are perhaps more elusive but would look and sound fancier than a “-son” name to most Swedes.In short, many aspects of modern-day Swedish culture are extremely superficial. In a country where people have been striving toward mediocrity for decades, standing out a little bit (but not too much) by having a noble-sounding name that implies a hint of sophistication is very desirable.Personally, I enjoy having the name Anna Eriksson because it’s so generic. I have one of the 15 most common first names for women of my generation as well as the fifth most common last name. The anonymity of it is refreshing.'"
"'11-02-09,'1','And Mr. Modi receives — some would say claims — much of the credit. The year before he took office in 2001, Gujarat’s economy shrank by 5 percent.But critics of Mr. Modi, a Hindu nationalist, point to another legacy of his early days in office — something that has made him one of the most polarizing figures in Indian politics. Months after he became chief minister, Gujarat erupted in brutal Hindu-Muslim riots that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims.Despite Mr. Modi’s subsequent denials, he has not fully escaped a cloud of accusations by rival political groups, victims and their families, and human rights groups that he and his aides condoned the attacks against Muslims and — as one case now before the Supreme Court charges — may even have encouraged them.A special investigation team formed by the Supreme Court has filed a 600-page investigative report on the riots, which has not been officially released. Numerous other lawsuits related to the riots are also winding through India’s courts. In 2005 the United States refused to grant Mr. Modi a visa, on grounds of religious intolerance. Meanwhile, environmental activists and local tribesman who have been protesting the construction of seven dams in Gujarat that will displace 25,000 people say they the protesters have been regularly jailed by the state police, charged with being Naxalites, a militant rebel group.Mr. Modi, who has declined interview requests from The New York Times for several years, did not comment for this article.Of the lingering controversies, a spokesman for Mr. Modi, Steven King, with the Washington public relations firm APCO Worldwide, wrote in an e-mail responding to questions: “The government has very highly developed grievance proceedings.”Corporate executives, though, tend to concentrate on Mr. Modi’s pro-business attributes, which they see as something of an anomaly in an India where government bureaucracy, bumbling or corruption too often impedes commerce.“In India there is a sense that efficiency is at such a premium because there is so little to go around,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell who has served as an adviser to the Indian government. “When people find an effective politician who can make things happen on the ground, they are willing to ignore the character flaws.”Under Mr. Modi’s watch, the energy companies Royal Dutch Shell and Total have opened a major liquid natural gas terminal in Gujarat, and Torrent Power, an Indian company, has built a huge power plant. Meanwhile, Tata Motors, DuPont, General Motors, Hitachi and dozens of other foreign and Indian companies have built factories, expanded operations or invested in projects in the state.When the Canadian heavy machinery company Bombardier won a contract to supply subway cars to the Delhi Metro in 2007, it needed a factory site, quickly. It found one in Savli, an industrial estate in Gujarat. Just 18 months later— when in many parts of India, the permit process might still be grinding away — the factory was built and operating.“It was incredible,” said Rajeev Jyoti, the managing director of Bombardier in India, “and it was a world record within Bombardier.”Compared with most other states, Gujarat has smoother roads and less garbage next to the streets. More than 99 percent of Gujarat’s villages have electricity, compared with less than 85 percent nationally.In 2009, Gujarat attracted more planned investment than any other state in the country, about $54 billion by value of announced plans, according to Assocham, a trade association of Indian chambers of commerce.Mr. Modi, who has no business or economics background, deserves praise for this, corporate leaders say. Before entering politics in his late 30s, he was a religious volunteer for the Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which sponsors schools and provides aid during natural disasters, but has also been widely criticized as being intolerant of other religions and of secular Hindus.In India, where corrupt politicians often seem to be raiding the public coffers to benefit their offspring, Mr. Modi’s success is sometimes attributed to his apparent lack of a family life. Acquaintances and local news reports say he was married at a young age but separated soon after from his wife. Mr. Modi has never commented on reports about his personal life.Mr. Modi’s administration has brought novel solutions to some of India’s most tenacious problems. Corruption became less widespread after the state government put a large amount of its activities online, from permits that companies need to build or expand, to bids for contracts. To plow through a multiyear backlog of court cases, and prevent day laborers from losing income, Mr. Modi asked judges to work extra hours in night courts.Mr. Modi uses a chief executive style of managing the bureaucrats who work under him, according to associates and business executives in Gujarat. He gives promising people positions of responsibility, sets goals and expects people to meet them. Nonperformers are pushed aside.It may seem an obvious way to administer a state with more than 50 million people and a budget in the billions of dollars.But this approach runs counter to India’s tradition of cronyism. In a recent reshuffle of India’s national cabinet ministers, for example, the minister of highways who substantially missed targets for road-building was made minister for urban development, a crucial position for a rapidly urbanizing nation struggling to build livable cities.Even in another state considered pro-business, Tamil Nadu in the south, the ruling party, D.M.K., has been dogged by accusations of corruption.In Mr. Modi’s case, the accolades once would have been unthinkable. After the Hindu-Muslim riots a decade ago, he was considered a liability for his political party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. But these days, with Gujarat’s soaring economy, Mr. Modi is sometimes mentioned as his party’s most likely candidate for prime minister in 2014, when the next general election is expected.Despite his lack of executive experience, Mr. Modi’s supporters credit him with a politician’s innate sense of marketing. Images of Mr. Modi were plastered on billboards throughout Gujarat during the investment summit meeting, proclaiming the state’s support not only for investment but for social programs like support of girls’ education — a particularly important subject in India where there is a large literacy gap between men and women.Within Gujarat, which has a centuries-old reputation for business acumen, even Mr. Modi’s fans sometimes grumble that he and his image makers may be taking outsize credit for its economic growth. And they say that the headline numbers that Mr. Modi’s government trumpets can be misleading.For example, the $450 billion in “memorandums of understanding” — essentially, pledges to do business in the state — that the government says were signed during the January investment summit meeting double-count some deals, according to businessmen in attendance, because they include loans and investments for the same projects. Mr. Modi’s spokesman confirmed there might be some redundancy in the $450 billion figure, but said it was impossible to break out the loans from the investments.Yet, no one disputes Gujarat’s rapid growth. And Mr. Modi’s supporters say India’s economic success will depend on each state’s adopting many of the same measures he has employed. India’s central government may apportion budgets and write overall laws, they say, but it is the states that are responsible for overseeing everything from land allocation to electricity distribution.“If you are an investor in India,” said Mr. Somers, of the United States trade group, “Gujarat must be at the top of your list.”'"
"'11-02-09,'1','When he’s not writing or studying in India, Mr. Alborzian makes house calls, sometimes even moving in with clients to observe their daily routines and guide them toward healthier habits. One of the first things he attends to is the way a person chows down. I figured he could do the same for me. I’d chosen Szechuan Gourmet, one of the city’s shrines to tongue-scorching, because I crave spicy food the way other people might crave, say, a bowl of ice cream.This happens with pitta people, Mr. Alborzian told me.“Innately you’re drawn to the spicy, which is the thing that is not great for you,” he said. “A little bit of spice is great because it kindles the digestive fire.” But gorging myself on plate after plate of stir-fried chicken with roasted chilies? That would amount, in his view, to a gastronomic version of burning down the house. “What you’re doing is throwing a ton of dry logs on there, if you keep eating spicy stuff,” he said. “And it just burns and burns.”Mr. Alborzian, who turns 44 this month, has become something of a pitta-esque property, of late, thanks in part to a recent TV appearance on “The Dr. Oz Show” and his friendship with Ellen DeGeneres, who has embraced and endorsed his regimen of yoga, meditation and dietary mindfulness.He often travels (on any given day he might be in New York or London or Trivandrum, India) but last year he moved into Ms. DeGeneres’s guest house in Los Angeles and acted as a kind of live-in wellness consultant for five months. This was during Ms. DeGeneres’s brief tenure as a judge on “American Idol.”“ ‘Idol’ was really tough on her,” Mr. Alborzian said. “She’s an upbeat person and ‘Idol’ was all about judging people, and she really disliked it. So she walked away from it because it doesn’t go with what she believes in. It’s a sign of balance. You start giving up things that are imbalanced.”Mr. Alborzian, who grew up in England and Iran, knows about giving up plum gigs. During the 1980s and 1990s he was a sought-after model who appeared in campaigns for Versace and Karl Lagerfeld and, most famously, as a sort of proletarian Adonis in Madonna’s “Express Yourself” video, grinding gears in a sad gray factory where it always seemed to rain.One day in 1998 he decided to walk away. “I was in Nelson Mandela’s house in South Africa,” he recalled over lunch. (In spite of his counsel, I was inhaling a bowl of hot and sour soup. He took one slurp and declared it “way too spicy.”) “Naomi Campbell was there, Kate Moss, Amber Valletta, Christy Turlington: the whole crew. It wasn’t like a light bulb moment. It was more of, ‘Ah, this is really good, and it’s not going to get better than this.’ I thought, ‘Fashion will kick you out at some point, anyway. This is a good time to go off and find my path.’ ”That path led him to India, where he studied yoga and ayurveda, an approach to health in which foods are seen as having different essential properties. A source of nourishment might be deemed “hot” or “cool,” regardless of its actual temperature. (Onions are “hot.” Rice is “cool.”) When he’s cooking or ordering a meal, Mr. Alborzian tries to reach the right balance between those properties.And that’s only part of it. If he sits down in a restaurant, he is factoring in the room temperature of the place, how his body feels, which vegetables (he is a vegetarian) are local and in season. He doesn’t want anything that’s been canned or frozen. “It’s mummified food,” he said.He’s not into eggplant, either, but that’s just because he doesn’t like it. “It makes my throat itch,” he said. When our main dishes arrived (fried rice and two relatively mild and eggplant-free platters of vegetables), Mr. Alborzian ventured in with patient, tentative nibbles.“I’ll take a few bites, and then I’ll see how my body starts reacting to it,” he said, putting down his chopsticks. Meanwhile I charged through the fried rice with all the delicacy of a snowplow.“You’ll enjoy it more if you eat slow,” he offered. “And then you’ll see: you won’t eat even half as much as you usually eat.” He is an advocate of fasting and said he once subsisted for 28 days on nothing but water and green tea.It sounded like a lot of work. Doesn’t such an intensity of dietary awareness prevent him from just enjoying food?“Food has now become a burden to us,” he said. “A lot of people don’t look forward to life anymore. They just look forward to food. People tell me, ‘But I love food.’ And I tell them, ‘You can’t love something that owns you.’ ”'"
"'11-02-09,'1','Mark Isreal (above), who has been sending forth creative, multihued and myriad-flavored doughnuts from his Doughnut Plant shop on the Lower East Side for 16 years, will open his second New York store, in the Chelsea Hotel on Monday.The new look departs from his no-frills industrial style of the original store, with floral ironwork cast from the pattern on the hotel balconies sheathing the curved counter. “From the beginning I thought of this as a restoration,” he said. There is a bench covered in doughnut-shaped tiles, some doughnut-themed chairs and tables, and even handmade doughnut pillows mimicking the flavors of his doughnuts, on the wall.And the roster of doughnuts is also expanding. Some new flavors are riffs on cookies: chocolate chip, salty peanuts and, to assuage any guilt you might have in consuming a doughnut with your morning coffee, oatmeal. All the doughnuts are made on the premises, as they are downtown. Mr. Isreal expects his production to double, to 5,000 doughnuts a day, with the new store and kitchen. He will also serve coffee and juices.Doughnut Plant, the Chelsea Hotel, 220 West 23rd Street; (212) 675-9100. Doughnuts are $2.50 to $3; starting Monday, both locations will be open every day.'"

"'11-02-09,'1','For financial companies, the distinction is not trivial. Those deemed systemically important will face higher capital requirements and tougher regulatory scrutiny. They could also be forced to break up if they started teetering.Policy makers hope the expanded definition of “too big to fail” can help avoid a repeat of the abrupt collapse of Lehman Brothers, which helped set off a financial crisis.The Fed guidelines represent only the first stage of a lengthy process and could cause new lobbying by the financial industry. Even before the plan’s release, representatives from the hedge fund industry — including officials from D.E. Shaw and Paulson & Company — met with Fed officials to discuss how firms would be designated.So did BlackRock, the asset manager, and the Financial Services Roundtable, a group representing the nation’s largest banks and insurance companies.Now that the proposed criteria have been made public, more firms may ratchet up their efforts to avoid being deemed systemic — or at least try to press for less onerous oversight.The proposal will remain open for public comment through March 30. By midyear, the Fed plans to submit final rules for approval by the Federal Stability Oversight Council, a board of top financial regulators responsible for executing the policies set forth by the Dodd-Frank Act.The council’s work will result in a new list of systemically important firms.About 35 big banks, each with assets of $50 billion or more, will automatically make the cut. This group includes Wall Street giants like Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs as well as the 16 or so other large banks that were required to undergo comprehensive stress tests during the depths of the financial crisis.But nonbanks could also face harsher oversight if they have $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, or if their businesses were so closely intertwined with large traditional banks that they could put the broader financial system at risk.That may rope in big investment firms, like Citadel, the Fortress Group and Blackstone; large insurers like the American International Group and the Hartford; and big money managers like Fidelity Investments and Vanguard. Consumer and specialty lenders like General Electric Capital and the CIT Group could also be included.The new guidelines also define “data processing, data storage, data transmission services” as financial activities, meaning credit bureaus like Experian as well as payment companies like First Data, Visa and MasterCard could fall under the new rules since their businesses are closely tied to the giant banks. Officials from these companies said they were studying the proposed guidelines, declined to comment or did not return phone calls.'"
"'11-02-09,'1','But events in one can echo in the other. For instance, Iran’s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has gained widespread popularity among Arabs in recent years for his tough posture toward the United States and Israel.Tehran has tried to leverage its stance on the Arab-Israeli dispute into a means to influence Arab countries. Now it seeks to portray the political unrest in Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere as the long-delayed rippling of the Islamic Revolution through the neighborhood. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, gave a prayer sermon last Friday lauding the demonstrators.Mr. Karroubi, a former presidential candidate and Parliament speaker, said that all the news in the official Iranian media tends to highlight statements from Islamic organizations and focus on Western concerns that the Muslim Brotherhood is about to triumph in Egypt. Hence the pressure on the Iranian government to allow the protest march through downtown Tehran to go forward on Monday despite the risk that it could be transformed into an antigovernment rally of a kind not seen in a year.“If they are not going to allow their own people to protest, it goes against everything they are saying, and all they are doing to welcome the protests in Egypt is fake,“ Mr. Karroubi said.Some analysts and opposition members criticized the planned march and suggested that the government was unlikely to issue a permit, further demoralizing the movement. It is also unclear how many people might turn out, and there is some sense that the Green movement lacks the kind of clear aims that inspired protesters in Egypt.“There is no consensus in the Iranian opposition of what they are trying to achieve — is it the reform of the Islamic republic, the end of the Islamic republic?” said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It is tough to recruit people to the street for ambiguous ends.”Mr. Karroubi, while conceding that public activism had faded in the face of a harsh crackdown, said the Greens were still working for the kinds of basic rights they have always sought: free elections, freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.The movement has tried to highlight the incongruity between the Iranian government’s oppression at home and the fact that it welcomes political protests elsewhere.The Web site of Mir Hussein Moussavi, the other main opposition leader, recently displayed two pictures side by side. One showed the Egyptian police beating a protester, while the other was a similar photo of Tehran security forces. The Egyptian protester was labeled “heroic“ while the one in Iran was an “agent of imperialism.”Mr. Karroubi said he was living under near house arrest, with two or three cars full of guards outside his house for most of the day, turning many visitors away. He had not talked with a foreign journalist in about six months, he said, although he has occasionally answered questions via e-mail. For the video interview, he wrapped a headset around the back of his neck because it would not fit over his white turban.Mr. Karroubi said he was able to plan the call for a protest with Mr. Moussavi because the two had met recently at a wake, but otherwise they have had limited contact. They have not decided yet whether a march through downtown Tehran should be silent, he said.Should the young Egyptian protesters succeed in fomenting change, that would bring added pressure on the Iranian government, Mr. Karroubi said. It would mean that both Turkey and Egypt, the most populous states in the region, are more democratic than Iran.“It will show that Iran has been left behind, that it has not gone forward with the principles of the revolution that everything should be based on the vote of the people,” he said.Still, he noted that while a failure of Arab protests would be a setback for the Greens, the reform movement would still continue.“It could have a bad effect in Iran, but not that strong,” he said. “We have our own demands and our own desire for freedom in our own society — we were promised freedom with the revolution and never got it.”'"
"'11-02-09,'1','HONG KONG — China on Tuesday raised interest rates for the third time since October, in the latest sign that the authorities were trying to temper economic growth and prevent inflation from escalating further.The central bank in Beijing raised its benchmark one-year deposit rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3 percent, and its one-year lending rate by a similar amount, to 6.06 percent.The timing of the announcement, at the very end of the Lunar New Year holiday, which has kept mainland Chinese markets closed for the last week, was in line with what many analysts had expected.In fact, many economists forecast still more increases and other measures this year as the battle to combat price increases intensifies. “There are plenty of reasons to expect inflation to pick up further in the next few months,” Brian Jackson, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, wrote in a note after the rate increase announcement Tuesday.“Gradual policy rate increases in the months ahead should help to slow down investment in parts of the economy at risk of overheating, while also reducing the risk that more aggressive and disruptive action may be required at a later stage,” he wrote.Buoyed by ample lending and extensive state investment projects, the Chinese economy powered ahead last year, overtaking that of Japan to become the world’s second-largest economy after the United States.'"
"'11-02-09,'1','With $2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, nearly three times that of Japan, the country with the second-largest reserves, China has ample buying power to prevent any serious food shortages.“They can buy whatever they need to buy, and they can outbid anyone,” Mr. Zeigler said. China’s self-sufficiency in grain prevented world food prices from moving even higher when they spiked three years ago, he said.The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said Tuesday that 12.75 million acres of China’s 35 million acres of wheat fields had been affected by the drought. It said that 2.57 million people and 2.79 million head of livestock faced shortages of drinking water.Chinese state news media are describing the drought in increasingly dire terms. “Minimal rainfall or snow this winter has crippled China’s major agricultural regions, leaving many of them parched,” Xinhua reported. “Crop production has fallen sharply, as the worst drought in six decades shows no sign of letting up.”Xinhua said that Shandong Province, in the heart of the Chinese wheat belt, had received only 1.2 centimeters, or about half an inch, of rain since September. The report did not provide a comparison for normal rainfall for the period.The Food and Agriculture Organization, in its “special alert” on Tuesday, said the drought’s effects had been somewhat tempered by relatively few days of subzero temperatures and government irrigation projects. The agency went on to caution that extreme cold, with temperatures of minus 18 degrees Celsius (just below zero Fahrenheit), could have “devastating” effects.Kisan Gunjal, the F.A.O. food emergency officer in Rome who handles Asia alerts, said by telephone that if rain came soon and temperatures warmed up, then the wheat crop could still be saved and a bumper crop might even be possible.On Tuesday, Chinese meteorological agencies were warning of frost for the next nine nights in the heart of Shandong Province, with temperatures falling as low as 21 degrees Fahrenheit. They forecast little chance of precipitation in the next 10 days except for the possibility of a light rain or a dusting of snow on Wednesday or Thursday.Mr. Gunjal said the special alert on China was the first that the F.A.O. had issued anywhere in the world this year. There was only one last year, expressing “grave concern” about food supplies in the Sahel region of Africa, notably Niger.President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, China’s top two officials, made separate visits to drought-stricken areas last week, and each called for “all-out efforts” to cope with the water shortage.Typically, world food reports barely mention China, partly because many details of the country’s agriculture production and reserves are state secrets. But China, in fact, is enormously important to the world’s food supply, especially if something goes wrong.The heat wave in Russia last summer, combined with floods in Australia in recent months, has drawn worldwide attention to the international wheat market, because Russia and Australia have historically been big exporters. But China’s wheat industry has existed in almost total isolation from the rest of the world, with virtually no exports or imports, until last year, when modest imports began. Yet it is enormous, accounting for one-sixth of global wheat output. The statistical database of the United Nations’ food agency shows that in 2009, the last year available, China produced almost twice as much wheat as the United States or Russia and more than five times as much as Australia.Currently, the ground in the country is so dry from Beijing south through the provinces of Hebei, Henan and Shandong to Jiangsu Province, just north of Shanghai, that trees and houses are coated with topsoil that has blown off parched fields.China’s national obsession with self-sufficiency in food includes corn, another crop that is grown and consumed entirely in China with minimal imports or exports. Little known outside of China, the country’s corn industry actually grows one-fifth of the world’s corn, according to F.A.O. statistics. China’s corn crop is mostly in the country’s northern provinces, where the drought is worst now.Mr. Gunjal said the success or failure of the corn crop, as well as the rice crop, would depend mostly on rainfall this spring and summer, not the shortage of rain this winter.Winters tend to be dry in southern China, the world’s largest rice-producing region. But this winter is drier than most.China had about 55 million tons of wheat in stockpiles as of last summer, Mr. Gunjal said. That was equal to about half the annual harvest.China is already the world’s largest importer of soybeans, which are oilseeds, not a grain. China buys soybeans mainly for use as animal feed, because the Chinese diet is shifting toward more meat.'"
"'11-02-09,'1','PARIS — UBS, the Swiss banking giant, said Tuesday that its business had turned around in 2010 as it posted its first annual profit since before the financial crisis.The bank reported a profit of 7.2 billion Swiss francs ($7.5 billion) for the year in contrast to a 2009 loss of 2.7 billion francs. UBS last posted an annual profit in 2006. Over the ensuing three years, failed bets on the United States real estate market led it to combined net losses of more than 29 billion francs and a government rescue.UBS, based in Zurich and Basel, also announced a fourth-quarter profit of 1.3 billion francs compared with a year-earlier profit of 1.2 billion francs. That was slightly below the 1.35 billion francs analysts forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.The bank said the results were held back by a rise in the Swiss franc, which gained about 5 percent against the dollar and 7 percent against the euro in the last three months of the year, along with a 509 million franc charge against its own debt.UBS also said it was reducing its 2010 bonus pool by 10 percent from the 2009 level, to 4.3 billion francs. Of that amount, it said it would defer payment on about 1.6 billion francs.Oswald J. Grübel, the UBS chief executive, said during an online news conference that he was “optimistic” about the outlook for the bank’s wealth management business, as net new inflows of funds stabilized in the second half of 2010, particularly because of clients in the Asia Pacific region.'"

"'11-02-10,'0','This was meant to be a banner year for Egyptian tourism. The ministry of tourism was anticipating more than 14 million visitors in 2011, a record. It was hardly unrealistic, considering that Egypt had 12.5 million visitors in 2009, and in the first nine months of 2010, despite the continuing global recession, had already seen 10.5 million visitors pass through the country.“Egypt was, without a doubt, one of the primary destinations for our travelers,” said Amy Kotkin, director of Smithsonian Journeys, based in Washington. “It is simply one of those life journeys, an iconic destination with antiquities we have all learned about since our youth.” She said that Smithsonian Journeys had to cancel trips involving more than 200 travelers who had been scheduled to depart for Egypt this February and March through a joint program the company runs with Collette Vacations, a tour company based in Rhode Island.According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, Egypt is one of the top 25 destinations worldwide, accounting for 1 percent of the global tourism market. The current crisis is estimated to be costing Egypt $310 million a day, according to a recent report from Credit Agricole, a bank based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which also reported that tourism last year accounted for 6 percent of Egypt’s gross national product.So what are travelers, airlines and tour companies doing about cancellations and delayed trips? “The majority who can postpone are doing so with the hope that things will improve,” said Pamela Lassers, director of media relations at Abercrombie & Kent USA, adding that the company has canceled all trips to Egypt through March 31 and is providing full refunds to those who do not wish to rebook. Those who are locked into vacationing at that time, she said, have chosen destinations like East Africa or the Galápagos as an alternative.General Tours World Traveler, a 60-year-old travel company that specializes in small-group tours, has so far heard from roughly 200 guests booked on their Small Group Journeys to Egypt tours in February and March, according to Mickey Huang, the company’s marketing manager. Those scheduled to depart through Feb. 28 have been offered a choice of rescheduling their trip or receiving a full refund. Travelers booked from March 1 to 31 are being offered a later departure or a travel credit equal to the full value of their booking, valid for one year.'"

"'11-02-10,'0','So many people now receive jobless benefits that 30 states have run out of their unemployment trust funds and are borrowing $42 billion from the federal government. Three of the hardest-hit states — , and — have borrowed so much that they triggered automatic unemployment increases on employers, and the same thing is likely to happen to 20 more states this year.The crisis could prove to be a point of friction between Republican governors and members of Congress. On Tuesday, the Obama administration unveiled a smart proposal to delay those tax increases and provide some relief to both employers and state governments. Congressional Republicans reflexively objected to the idea, which could produce higher taxes in three years, but this plan provides relief that might stimulate hiring now when it is most needed. Republican governors in desperate states like Michigan and Indiana are likely to find that more attractive than party members in Washington do.Under the plan, which is subject to Congressional approval, there would be a two-year moratorium on the increased taxes that employers would otherwise have to pay to support the unemployment system, which could save businesses as much as $7 billion. During those same two years, states would be forgiven from paying the $1.3 billion in interest they owe Washington on the money they have borrowed. The stimulus bill provided a grace period, but it expired last year.In 2014, when the economy will presumably have recovered somewhat, employers will have to make up for the moratorium by paying higher unemployment taxes to the states. Specifically, they will have to pay taxes on the first $15,000 of an employee’s income, instead of the current $7,000. But, even then, unemployment taxes will be at the same level, adjusted for inflation, as they were in 1983, when President raised them.The administration is proposing to cut the federal unemployment tax rate in 2014 so that employers would pay the same amount to Washington as they do now. States, if they choose to do so, could collect more from each employer to repay the federal government and restock their own unemployment trust funds.Republicans immediately derided the proposal as an irresponsible tax increase. On his blog, Representative , the House majority leader, criticized the higher taxes in 2014, but he did not mention the two-year moratorium on the automatic tax increases in 20 vulnerable states.The proposal is not a bailout for the states or employers but rather a recognition that the automatic tax increases built into the benefits system could put a brake on hiring — and in precisely the states where employers need the most incentive to bring people back to work.'"
"'11-02-10,'0','Blake Griffin did not venture outside the laws of gravity. He did not bend minds or rims or emasculate any Knicks on Wednesday night in his Madison Square Garden debut.There were a few dunks here and there, but when Griffin was surrounded in the fourth quarter, it opened space for the mostly anonymous Randy Foye to decide the outcome.Foye scored 17 points in the fourth quarter, lifting the Los Angeles Clippers to a 116-108 victory.Griffin compiled 21 points (4 in the fourth) and 6 rebounds, along with five ordinary — by his elevated standards — dunks.For the Knicks, it was another evening when they spent the game buried under a large deficit and were forced to mount a too-little-too-late comeback.Amar’e Stoudemire (23 points) picked up his fourth foul with 9 minutes 38 seconds remaining in the third quarter and did not return until 10:18 of the fourth. He made up for lost time and scored 8 quick points after Toney Douglas chipped in 7 straight to bring the Knicks within 106-102. But Foye answered with jumper after jumper.'"

The city is eyeing two detainees: Djamel Ameziane, an Algerian chef, and Ravil Mingazov, a Russian ballet dancer. “This is one thing we can do to right some wrongs of our federal government,” said Wendy Kenin, chairwoman of the city’s Peace and Justice Commission, which drew up the resolution. The detainees would live with local families, and nonprofits would help them find work. Amherst, Mass., approved a similar resolution in 2009 that invited two detainees, including Mr. Mingazov, to live there, but they were not released. Phil Kamlarz, the city manager, is advising the Council not to act on Guantánamo detainees.'"

"'11-02-10,'0','Moreover, it’s not obvious that a deal with London would yield more cost savings than the alternatives. NYSE-Deutsche Börse is projecting cost cuts seven times greater than the £35 million ($56 million) on offer from the Anglo-Canadian duo.The question is whether money would be allowed to do the talking. TMX shareholders might prefer a juicy cash offer to a no-premium takeover by an Anglo-Italian-Emirati-Qatari consortium run by a Frenchman. But any buyer seeking more than 10 percent must receive approval from Ontario and Quebec securities regulators and the federal government.Just three months ago, Ottawa rejected BHP’s bid for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan for reasons that it has still not entirely articulated. If the Canadian government thinks a hole in the ground is worthy of such capitalism-crushing protection, don’t expect its premier financial exchange to go to the highest bidder.Wells Fargo has never been particularly cuddly with shareholders. So its executives ought not to be shocked that the unexpected, unexplained resignation of Howard Atkins, the chief financial officer, knocked $5 billion off its value Wednesday and nudged it off its perch as the most valuable bank in America ahead of JPMorgan Chase. Now that it has joined the big leagues, Wells Fargo needs to be a better communicator.The $173 billion California bank has never been a fan of public back-and-forth. Its executives refused to take questions on quarterly earnings calls until recently and would prerecord their statements. Both the current chief executive, John Stumpf, and his predecessor, Richard Kovacevich, were outspoken in their criticism of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the 2009 stress tests. But those remarks probably appealed to their peers and were made in what was thought to be a private setting.Moreover, Mr. Atkins was for a decade the face of the bank for shareholders. He was the one to explain why investors shouldn’t be overly concerned about its portfolio of mortgage assets, including hundreds of billions of dollars of home equity loans and other risky assets it assumed when regulators gave it approval to acquire Wachovia during the depths of the financial crisis.Executives resign for all sorts of reasons. But Mr. Atkins’s abrupt departure is potentially unsettling. He will take unpaid leave for several months before officially retiring — an odd sequence, even if it might put him in line for a bigger pension. Yet the bank isn’t offering much besides crumbs of explanation: it said his retirement is for personal reasons that have nothing to do with the company’s financial condition or financial reporting.Wells’s statement contained little of the praise typical when long-serving executives leave. That’s strange given the importance of Mr. Atkins’s financial role at a systemically critical banking giant. Wall Street was more effusive. “We viewed Atkins as one of the more respected C.F.O.’s in the business,” a Barclays analyst wrote in a report.If Wells wants Wall Street to accept what it says without the skepticism in evidence on Wednesday, it may just have to display a bit more openness.'"
"'11-02-10,'0','Analysts say Verizon could sell as many as nine million iPhones this year, although most of those could go to existing customers. A recent report from the Yankee Group, a research firm, estimated that 1.9 million AT&T iPhone owners could switch to Verizon this year. That is just 2 percent of AT&T’s wireless subscriber base of about 93 million people.Where the battle for customers will truly roar, analysts say, is in the last untapped frontier: cellphone users who are looking to trade in their creaky feature phones for more expensive smartphones and the costly data plans that support them.By the end of the year, one in two Americans will own a smartphone, compared with just one in 10 during the summer of 2008, according to a recent report from the research firm Nielsen. That means that for the first time in the United States, there will be more smartphones than feature phones in use.At stake for the wireless carriers is no small amount of revenue. Each iPhone owner pays an average of more than $90 a month to AT&T, according to Mr. Moffett’s estimates, while other subscribers bring in closer to $50 a month.In 2010 alone, AT&T activated 15.2 million iPhones on its network, of which 3.9 million went to new subscribers, accounting for the bulk of the company’s growth in subscribers with contracts, Mr. Moffett estimated.To get a sense for the escalating tension between the two carriers, one need look no further than their recent television commercials. During the Super Bowl, Verizon released a commercial for the iPhone that played up its much-lauded network strength. It seemed to take a swipe at AT&T’s overloaded network, ending with the line, “Yes, I can hear you now.”To bite back, AT&T has been promoting advantages like its international coverage. Phones that run on AT&T’s network are compatible with networks in more foreign countries than Verizon phones. And Verizon’s technology does not allow use of its data network during phone calls. In one AT&T commercial, a man scrambles to find a restaurant on the Web when his wife calls to remind him of their plans for an anniversary dinner. A voiceover says: “Only AT&T’s network lets your iPhone talk and surf at the same time.” The fierce competition underscores the growing importance of retaining and attracting new smartphone customers as the telecommunications industry shifts away from traditional phone lines and focuses more heavily on mobile.During AT&T’s most recent earnings announcement, it revealed that its revenue from the company’s mobile division had outpaced revenue from its wire line business for the first time.Now it would seem as if Verizon and AT&T are planning to deploy every weapon in their arsenals to try to capture as many of those new subscribers as they can.Verizon is offering a number of incentives to sweeten the deal for new customers, including offering an unlimited data plan for $30 a month — in sharp contrast to AT&T, which offers two gigabytes of data a month for $25. In response, AT&T has taken steps to punch up its own data offerings. It recently began allowing some of its smartphone customers to use their data connection to supply Internet access to other mobile devices, using a special hot spot application that costs $20 a month. AT&T also doubled the data cap for those who sign up for that feature to four gigabytes a month, at no additional cost.“AT&T is not going to just roll over,” said Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. “They will entice customers through other pricing offers.”Verizon also has a buyback program that will let AT&T iPhone owners offset some of the penalties they will pay for early termination of their contracts. The money is put on a gift card that can be used toward the purchase of a Verizon phone.Despite the heightened competition, AT&T says it is unconcerned. “We’ve been planning for life after exclusivity since we signed the first contract,” said David Christopher, the chief marketing officer for mobility and consumer business at AT&T. “That playbook still includes selling tons of iPhones. They are an incredibly important part of our go-forward plan.”Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, shrugged off its rival’s jabs at the technical quirks that impose some limits on its version of the iPhone. “We’re very comfortable with our network technology,” she said. “The ability to simultaneously use voice and data might matter to some people, but the majority of customers would prefer to be able to make a phone call.”Verizon’s marketing and advertising strategy, she said, would continue to focus on what the company views as its main advantage: call quality.“The same technology our competitor is touting as their strength is the same technology that is causing people to drop calls,” she added.'"

"'11-02-10,'0','THE new tax law signed by President Obama in December gives many people a reason to revise their estate plans. In the process, some will try to avoid probate. Others may be surprised to find that much of what they leave behind will not go through probate anyway.Either way, traps await the unwary.Probate is the system through which a court determines that a will is legally valid, something that must be done before the inheritances it covers can be given out. The process varies by state and is not necessarily costly or time-consuming. Still, it creates a public record of matters you may prefer to keep private, including what you owned, to whom it was left and the terms of a prenuptial agreement.Passing assets outside of probate keeps them private, avoids will contests — for instance, when blood relatives are hostile toward a domestic partner or new spouse — and simplifies planning for elderly people with just one child they wish to benefit.A living trust is the most widely publicized tool for bypassing probate. It can hold assets for your benefit while you are alive — for example, in case of dementia — and specify who gets what after you die.However, a living trust avoids probate only for assets put into the trust. And inevitably, something is left out, said Joanne Fanizza, a lawyer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. So lawyers recommend a will that can cover everything else, whether or not you listed it. Of course, this will must be probated.Other assets will not go through probate no matter what a will or living trust says. These include retirement assets, life insurance and savings bonds, as well as jointly titled bank accounts, brokerage accounts and real estate.Misunderstandings about who is entitled to these nonprobate assets, as they are called, can lead to unintended consequences, said Michel W. Nelson, vice president and senior trust officer at the Iowa Savings Bank in Carroll, Iowa. He recalled cases in which an aging parent with several adult children depended on one of them as the primary caregiver. To facilitate bill-paying, the parent opened a bank account of which that child was the co-owner, not realizing that the co-owner would automatically receive all the money in this account when the parent died.That child has no obligation to share the money with siblings, Mr. Nelson said. If the child wants to share it, the money is considered a gift, and the limits on yearly and lifetime tax-free gifts apply. To avoid this situation, a parent should give the child a power of attorney over the account instead of naming the child a co-owner, Mr. Nelson said.Forgetting to coordinate nonprobate assets with the rest of your plan can also “completely unravel and thwart your objectives,” said Jill Miller, a New York lawyer. That is what happened in one case she handled, involving a couple who married late in life. The wife suddenly became ill and died.The paperwork for her life insurance and retirement accounts named other family members to receive the benefits, and that superseded her will. Under New York law, her husband had some recourse, but he wound up with about 60 percent less than he would have received had his wife changed the forms to make him the beneficiary, Ms. Miller said.Another issue that gets neglected is who should pay expenses. Even if federal estate taxes are no longer an issue, heirs incur many costs, including state estate taxes (in 16 states and the District of Columbia), professional fees and the funeral bill. These typically come out of the pot of money covered by a will or living trust. When most of an estate passes outside of probate, there may not be enough money allocated for expenses, said Bernard A. Krooks, a lawyer with Littman Krooks in New York.To steer clear of these and other mishaps, make a list of all your assets, the type of account they are in and details about how they are titled. Here are issues to consider:JOINT ACCOUNTS With bank and brokerage accounts, the most frequent form of joint ownership is joint tenancy with rights of survivorship. It appears on some account statements with the abbreviation J.T.W.R.O.S., and on others by naming the owner as one person or the other (for instance, Lucy or Ricky Ricardo). Both owners have access to the assets during life, and when one joint tenant dies, everything goes to the survivor.'"
"'11-02-10,'0','WERE you among the millions of investors who stampeded out of stocks in 2008 and corralled most of your liquid assets into bonds?Given the likelihood of increased inflation and climbing interest rates, bonds may not be the safest place anymore. You don’t want to be trapped when the economy moves into reflation mode.Sensing that bond prices will drop, investors began retreating from income funds in December. In the first two weeks of the month, investors withdrew $13 billion from bond funds, according to the mutual fund trade group Investment Company Institute, compared with an inflow of more than $500 million the first week of this year.Fortunately, there are plenty of options to reap income that will sidestep a dot-com-style crisis. Knowing where to go is a matter of assessing your income needs, risk tolerance and ability to diversify.You can be least fearful if most of your income holdings are in individual Treasury or highest-quality municipal bonds that you plan to hold to maturity. Despite government debt perils, no one in Congress is discussing defaulting on that kind of debt.Bond mutual funds that are primarily invested in longer-term maturities (more than five years) are troublesome. They will lose value if interest rates rise as investors shift to higher-yielding notes. The conventional advice is to shorten average maturities and move more of your money into inflation-protected securities.Another useful measure is duration, or the amount of principal a bond will lose if interest rates rise at least one percentage point. The shorter the duration the better in a rising rate environment.Of course, shorter maturities mean lower yields, which presents a problem for those needing income. While income investors have certainly been scraping for decent returns in recent years, they’ve had a pretty good run on the appreciation side for the better part of a generation. The 10-year Treasury index has posted an annual average return of 11.3 percent from the beginning of the bond rally in 1981 through the end of this year.During the 30 years before 1981, the Treasury index averaged only about 2 percent, so the deleveraging of the economy in recent years has proved beneficial for investors and corporations alike. Is the great bond party over?If and when the economy moves into full recovery mode, producers, retailers and service firms will ask for higher prices and bid up the cost of credit. This will force interest rates to rise.Although unemployment is barely budging from its recession levels, producer prices rose in December. Sensing increased economic vigor, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said he thought “deflation risk has receded considerably, so we’re moving in the right direction.”Keep in mind that the Fed is still buying some $600 billion in Treasury securities in an effort to ignite the economy. The threat of inflation is always on the Fed’s radar screen, though, especially with all the debt the federal government is running up.Barring any national or global financial calamity (keep an eye on Portugal, Spain and Italy) that would cause a double-dip recession, those in open-ended bond funds should be most active.“We’ve gotten pretty defensive in fixed income,” said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank in Chicago. “I expect a one percentage point increase in interest rates in the coming year.”Being defensive typically means shortening maturities in bond funds and avoiding average maturities beyond five years. It also means searching for yield in nontraditional places.As the economy strengthens, it creates a healthier climate for preferred stocks and high-yield corporate “junk bonds,” Mr. Ablin said. He prefers the SPDR Barclays High Yield Capital B E.T.F. or the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond E.T.F.While both funds feature high yields — the iShares fund posted a 12-month yield of 8.25 percent (through Jan. 14) — they still carry significant credit risk. None of the bonds in these portfolios is government guaranteed, and you could suffer principal loss.More garden-variety ways of blunting inflation are through Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and commercial real estate. The Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund and REIT Index E.T.F. are the low-cost leaders in these areas.One little-known way of taking advantage of rising rates is through floating-rate funds, which invest in bank loans whose interest rates are adjusted every 30 to 90 days. Two worthy candidates include the Eaton Vance Floating Rate A fund and the Fidelity Floating Rate High Income fund. As with the junk bond funds, these vehicles are volatile and are not recession-proof; as a group they lost more than 27 percent in 2008.Those who can’t afford any principal risk are in a different boat. They may not be able to shift to higher-risk assets if they are dependent upon their portfolio for daily living expenses.With an eye on both inflation and guaranteed income, Paula Hogan, a fee-only certified financial planner in Milwaukee, recommends inflation-indexed immediate annuities for those currently in retirement. These vehicles pay a guaranteed income stream and are indexed to the government’s Consumer Price Index. She buys annuities through the Income Solutions service. The Vanguard Group also sells them.“If you’re using your daily portfolio for groceries, consider immediate annuities,” Ms. Hogan suggests. “The income from them should be indexed to the Consumer Price Index.”No matter how you see the future of the economy, it makes sense to do a complete portfolio review now to determine how much bond-market exposure you have and what you need to do to protect yourself. Many mutual fund companies offer free online programs to do that, or you can contact a fee-only financial planner for a consultation.'"
"'11-02-10,'0','EVEN though the bear market officially ended nearly two years ago, investors have shown a stubborn aversion to risk since then. The usually reliable steps taken to protect portfolios may prove ineffective, however, some investment professionals warn. In this market backdrop, safe may be the new risky.When investors want to limit potential losses, one strategy is to diversify among a broad range of assets like foreign and domestic stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate and hedge funds so that different market ups and downs will smooth out overall returns. For extra safety, they may put much of their money into high-quality government or corporate bonds, presumed to be havens against economic and financial turbulence.Developments in the last three years have called both strategies into question. Some investment advisers warn that new steps must be taken to try to minimize risk, while others contend that broad diversification, including into bonds, is still the best approach.Investors have hardly needed to be persuaded to buy Treasury bonds. They did so when stocks plunged in 2008 and kept buying after markets rebounded. But that sent yields close to record lows, apparently leaving little room for further declines.As for diversification, it has provided little benefit during the last three years. There were few places to hide besides Treasuries and cash during the downturn, as stocks, commodities and bonds of all but the most creditworthy institutions fell. Since selling reached a peak two years ago, the rally has been broad based, too. Markets often fall together, but are more inclined to rally individually or a few at a time.Synchronization “happens in every collapse, but two things stand out” this time, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “One is the magnitude, as correlations have moved a lot closer than in the past, and the persistence is interesting to me, too. We’ve had a year and a half of economic growth, and the stock market has almost doubled.”Correlations among markets became stronger in 2008, but the trend began in the mid-1990s. International stock markets became more coordinated around that time as the pace of trade and capital flows began to pick up — globalization — and as European economies converged ahead of the introduction of the euro.The closer alignment began to encompass other asset classes in the last decade in what has come to be called “risk-on, risk-off” trading. It is as if investors are more interested in buying or selling exposure to risk than particular assets, so many markets that are perceived to embody risk move as one. As Mr. Paulsen explained it, “everyone gets away from any delineation of asset classes and makes just one decision: do I want to get in or out?”Peter Kendall, co-editor of the Elliott Wave Financial Forecast newsletter, attributed the effect to “a liquidity bubble that waxes and wanes” and said that “2008 caught both ends of it.” He recalled that investment advisers thought that diversification across highly correlated asset classes was a fine idea, as long as they were all moving up. “People were speaking very highly of it in the first half of the year when risk was on. Diversification was viewed as a safe thing to do and then it reversed in late ’08.”Roger G. Ibbotson, a professor in the Yale School of Management, said diversification was still a good idea, in part because there was no way to know how long correlations among markets would last or what else the markets might throw at investors. But he was not hopeful about prospects for the main investment used to hedge risk.“I can’t be very optimistic about bonds long term,” he said. “There’s not really much upside potential because yields are so low.” Mr. Ibbotson added, nevertheless, that “to protect yourself from a financial crisis, you need to buy higher-grade bonds.”One potentially effective way to diversify, Mr. Ibbotson said, was to look for securities that had low correlations with their respective markets. Stocks that tend to move less in lockstep with the broad averages make excellent hedges that are suitable for investors “who want to get into the equity market but are afraid of the risks,” he said.“They give you a way to participate in the market, but when you do have drops, they don’t drop as much,” he said. The cost of hedging in this way can be reasonable, he added, because so-called low-beta stocks, or those with less volatility, often trade at lower valuations than high-beta stocks. As for where to find them, Mr. Ibbotson suggested looking among classic defensive stocks like utilities and health care companies and suppliers of consumer staples.Norman E. Mains, managing director and chief risk officer of Forward Management, recommends owning certain hedge funds — the type that truly hedge. An example is long/short equity funds that buy some stocks and sell others short, a bet on declining prices, so that returns are less dependent on the direction of the market than on the managers’ stock-picking acumen.Managed futures funds, which operate in much the same way but in a different investment arena, buying and selling commodity futures contracts, likewise offer “an attractive way to enhance overall portfolio performance,” he said.Mr. Paulsen of Wells Capital finds nothing wrong with diversifying among conventional asset classes to create a portfolio that is stable yet does not significantly sacrifice reward potential. The problem is that investors tend to use the strategy too late and expect too much from it.“People run to diversify risk, but generally they never do it until the market goes down,” he said. That leads them to be most risk averse at the bottom, when they should be embracing risk. They would be better off, in his view, building a broadly diversified portfolio during a period of comparative calm — now, for instance — to prepare for the next downturn and to realize that risk can only be controlled, not eliminated.“Most people are worried about a 2008 type of event,” Mr. Paulsen said. “They won’t avoid it, but they can lessen it. If people think they can find a diversification methodology that will prevent them from going down, they’re nuts.”'"
"'11-02-10,'0','IS there a way to invest in inflation-tracking vehicles that also benefit from growth in emerging markets?Commodities are often the answer, although not in the way most investors see them. Rather than latching onto the metals upsurge or even more fickle agricultural products, investors can find funds that offer a diverse basket of commodities. They can be essential parts of any wealth-building portfolio.In most years commodities show an inverse correlation to American stocks and the dollar and provide another layer of diversification for a portfolio. A weak or declining buck is one factor that has pushed dollar-denominated commodities prices higher.Commodities, viewed separately, are extraordinarily volatile. Subject to supply and demand and the vagaries of futures exchanges, they are among the riskiest short-term investments. Trading them is best left to professionals.Yet what about the direct connection between commodities and inflation? And what about the increase in demand because of the growth in emerging economies like China and India? Don’t these developing countries need all of the copper, coal and agricultural goods they can get?“As more and more people in formerly poor nations are entering the global middle class,” wrote Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, in his Op-Ed column in The New York Times on Dec. 27, “They’re beginning to drive cars and eat meat, placing growing pressure on world oil and food supplies. And those supplies aren’t keeping pace.”One prominent commodities advocate — Jim Rogers, chairman of Rogers Holdings — has been bullish on commodities since 1999. Like many international investors, he has seen demand escalate from emerging economies and does not expect that trend to ease — particularly with the potential for rising inflation.“Prices for raw materials are rising again,” Mr. Rogers told a meeting of the Executives’ Club in Chicago on Jan. 13, “which will just stoke the inflationary pressures caused by money printing.”Although commodities prices swooned in 2008 during the global financial collapse — along with just about every other asset class except for United States Treasury bonds — they have rebounded smartly in recent years.The Continuous Commodity Index, a benchmark maintained by the Commodity Research Bureau, was up 33 percent in 2009. That was a sharp contrast to 2008, when world demand plummeted and the index was off 48 percent. Last year, commodities prices gained about 17 percent over all, according to the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index. Until three years ago, commodities were on an uninterrupted bull run that began in 2001. The index peaked in 2008, having risen to a post-World War II record, posting a gain of 236 percent over the seven years. One surprise in the 2009 commodities rebound was the sectors that led the rally — not gold, silver or platinum. The leaders were cotton and copper, up 96 percent; cocoa, coffee and orange juice, up 63 percent; and crude/heating oil and natural gas, up 58 percent.While gold was up about 43 percent last year, it may not lead in 2011, with energy prices rising and the possibility of a gold bubble.To get an idea of how volatile commodity prices are, you need only look at the worst category last year, natural gas, which was down 41 percent. Normally, such price swings do not occur in bonds. There are too many market forces to contend with, so why take the risk of guessing wrong on the commodity that’s overbought?There are hundreds of ways to bet on commodity prices; almost all of them are ill advised for investors managing their own portfolios. You can buy individual futures contracts on commodities as different as gold and pork bellies.Or there’s the ever-expanding field of exchange-traded funds. Let’s say you wanted to bet on rare earth metals, which are essential in most high-tech products. You might explore a fund like the Market Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals E.T.F. (REMX), which has nearly half of its holdings in mines in Australia, Canada and the United States.For most investors, though, it’s wiser to spread your money among a wide array of commodities and leave the management to professionals. Several broad-based funds offer lower-risk alternatives.One such fund is the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund E.T.F. (DBC), which is based on the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index. The fund tracks commodities like oil, gasoline, natural gas, gold, aluminum, silver, copper, corn, wheat, soybeans and sugar. The iShares S.& P. GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust E.T.F. (GSG) is another, and is heavily weighted toward energy.Jeff Layman, who co-manages $1.7 billion for BKD Wealth Advisors in Springfield, Mo., favors the Pimco Commodity Real Return Strategy D fund (PCRDX), which mixes commodities with Treasury inflation-protected securities. (Disclosure: This fund is in my retirement portfolio.) Not only does he use the fund as a hedge against inflation, it is a play on growth in emerging economies and possible declines in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies.“Although commodities are extremely volatile, I think inflation is coming back,” Mr. Layman said. “I expect commodities prices will be higher 10 years from now, and there’s an expectation of a weakening dollar.” Mr. Layman allocates no more than 5 percent to commodities in his clients’ portfolios.As with any funds, there are robust debates about the best E.T.F. (and underlying commodity index) to choose, yet few will argue the need to protect against a falling dollar, rising inflation and the potential for another downturn in American stocks. Commodity funds are not a perfect hedge for any of these events. But their clear link to growth in developing nations is a bonus worth pursuing.'"
"'11-02-10,'0','And as technology increasingly allows doctors to diagnose problems in a developing fetus, the study underscores remaining risks and hurdles, including developing less-invasive techniques to avoid creating other problems for babies or mothers.The spina bifida procedure was considered beneficial enough that an independent safety monitoring board stopped the study early so babies scheduled to receive surgery after birth could have access to prenatal surgery.But there were medical downsides for the women and infants: greater likelihood of being born several weeks earlier than the postnatal group, related breathing problems, and thinning or tearing at women’s surgical incisions, requiring Caesarean sections for later births.“While this is a very promising and quite exciting result,” said a study author, Dr. Diana Farmer, surgeon in chief at the Benioff Children’s Hospital at the University of California, San Francisco, “not all the patients were helped here, and there are significant risks. This procedure is not for everyone.”Conducting the study was itself challenging. Prenatal spina bifida surgery gained attention in the late 1990s when some medical centers, like Vanderbilt University, began performing it. A photograph in which a fetus’s hand appeared to be gripping the finger of a surgeon who had lifted the hand out of the womb was circulated by opponents of abortion rights, further raising the profile.Leading experts suggested a clinical trial to determine if prenatal surgery was better than postnatal. They insisted on an unusual agreement: that all but three hospitals, in Philadelphia, San Francisco and Nashville, stop doing the procedure.“There were lots of places that wanted to do it” amid pressure from eager patients, said Dr. Michael Harrison, who pioneered fetal surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, and was a principal investigator for the spina bifida trial before retiring. “But we wanted to make sure it wouldn’t become a freak show. And if you offer treatment outside the trial, you’ll never have a trial because no mother would agree to flip a coin.”One reason spina bifida researchers wanted a trial was the experience with prenatal surgery for a condition in which the diaphragm has life-threatening abnormalities.After early efforts to repair the condition prenatally, “we thought we were heroes,” Dr. Harrison said, but realized it worked only for milder cases. Another prenatal approach, forcing the lungs to grow, worked, but caused significantly premature births, making it no better than postnatal treatment, he said. He added that prenatal techniques had improved, becoming less harmful.The spina bifida study involved the most severe form, myelomeningocele (MY-ell-oh-men-NING-guh-seal), in which the spine does not close properly and the spinal cord protrudes. Children may experience lower-body paralysis, fluid on the brain, bladder problems and learning disabilities. About one in 3,000 children have that form, said Dr. Alan Guttmacher, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which financed and helped conduct the study.Many babies now receive surgery to close the spinal opening after birth, but nerve damage from the spinal cord exposure to amniotic fluid remains. Also, the brainstem may be pulled into the spinal column. Excess fluid in the brain may require draining with implanted shunts, which can lead to infection or need repeated surgical replacement.In the study, about 80 babies were randomly selected for surgery after birth; another 80 had the spinal opening surgically closed in utero, between 19 and 26 weeks of pregnancy. Two in each group died.Before surgery, babies in the prenatal group had more severe spinal lesions than the postnatal group, but more in the prenatal group had better results, said a co-author, Dr. Scott Adzick, chief of pediatric surgery at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.Those who received prenatal surgery were half as likely to have a shunt, and eight times as likely to have a normally positioned brainstem. There was “much better motor function of the legs,” Dr. Adzick said, and at 30 months old, nearly twice as many walked without crutches or orthotics.Although they were born at 34 weeks of pregnancy on average, compared with 37 weeks for the postnatal group, there was no difference in cognitive development, said Dr. Catherine Spong, chief of pregnancy and perinatology at the child health institute.Dr. Adzick said prenatal surgery may “stop exposure of the developing spinal cord and perhaps avert further neurological damage” or stop the leak of spinal fluid that causes brainstem problems.Results were dramatic for Tyson Thomas, of Stansbury Park, Utah, now 22 months old. His mother, Jessica Thomas, a study participant, said doctors had described his brain malformation as “the worst they had ever seen” and said “it would be likely that he wouldn’t be able to breathe on his own.”Since birth at 35 weeks gestation, she said, Tyson breathes independently, shows no brainstem malformation and is starting to talk. Bladder nerve damage will require him to urinate through catheters all his life. He now uses a walker and a foot brace, but is “getting really close to walking” on his own, said Ms. Thomas, a nurse.Researchers will follow the children from ages 6 to 9 to see if benefits continue.Several experts said they would now mention prenatal surgery as one option for some women. But since many women were excluded from the study, including those who were severely obese or whose babies’ conditions did not fit certain specifications, many may be ineligible.The study should not propel surgeons to “run around and start doing this” for other conditions, said Dr. Terry Buchmiller, a fetal medicine expert at Children’s Hospital Boston who was not involved in the research. “I can go in utero right now and fix a cleft lip, but I don’t think anybody is saying we ought to do that, because of the risk.”But she called the study “a wonderful, almost several-decade journey of trying to improve the outcomes of a debilitating condition,” adding, “This looks to be potentially life-changing.”'"
"'11-02-10,'0','After reopening its investigation into telephone hacking by the News of the World, Scotland Yard said Wednesday that it was going to contact more people who may have had their voicemail messages illegally intercepted by reporters at the London newspaper.This included some people who had previously been told by the police that their personal details were not among a trove of evidence seized by the police in 2006 from a reporter and private investigator for the newspaper who were eventually imprisoned for illegally intercepting phone messages of members of the royal household.The police found evidence then that hundreds of other celebrities, government officials and sports stars may have had their telephone messages intercepted. But Scotland Yard chose to limit its investigation and informed only a small number of potential targets about the hacking.Since then, a number of other people who suspected that their phones had been hacked — including the actress Sienna Miller — have sued the tabloid’s parent company, News International, leading to more information from the investigation being made public in court documents.Last month, The News of the World, which had maintained that the hacking was solely the work of the reporter and private investigator, dismissed its assistant editor for news, Ian Edmondson, after finding “material evidence” linking him to the accusations of phone hacking. Mr. Edmonson has denied any wrongdoing. News International handed over the new material to the police.'"
"'11-02-10,'0','For “Toy Story 3,” the conclusion to the series about the toys that never grow up, Pixar decided that Andy, the little boy who owned them, would — a departure from cartoon convention, where most characters are frozen in time. They enlisted Michael Arndt, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of “Little Miss Sunshine,” to write the script — which earned him another Oscar nomination — and set about designing the characters.Eleven years have passed since “Toy Story 2,” an eternity in technological terms. Many of the programs the animators used on that film are obsolete now; the supervising technical director, Guido Quaroni, kept old computers around as reference points, but in some ways the animators were starting from scratch, Mr. Podesta said.The toys — Woody, Buzz Lightyear, the Potato Heads — looked the same, save for a bit of aging to account for wear and tear. But Pixar’s artists went through many drafts of what adolescent Andy, on the cusp of college, would look like. The images are in a gallery on the second floor of the building; a bangs-forward skate-punk haircut looked cool but was deemed too insecure.“I wanted him to be kind of tall and gangly, but still very boyish,” Mr. Unkrich said. “We studied a lot of kids. We looked at John Lasseter’s kids” — one of Pixar’s founders — “their pictures through the years, as they grew up and kind of analyzed facial structure and musculature.”The Pixar people are big on research. For major set-pieces in “Toy Story 3,” they toured real day care centers and dumps, even once filling their lobby with trash and asking employees to run through it, to see how it moved. And also because it would be fun — the Pixar campus, designed by a founder, Steve Jobs, for maximum creativity and productivity, is the kind of place that has communal scooters and drum kits, and where you might see a live monkey on a bigwig’s shoulder or stumble into a speakeasy hidden behind a bookshelf in someone’s office.The company has grown along with the field of digital animation, which it has dominated since “Toy Story,” its first feature film, in 1995. In the years since, digital animation has become the norm — when a hand-drawn independent film, “The Secret of Kells,” was nominated for an Oscar last year, it was considered a coup — and Pixar, once a small company of outliers, has been swallowed by a corporate behemoth, the Walt Disney Company, which bought it in 2006. It also now has a rival in the DreamWorks Animation studio, its constant challenger in the awards race. DreamWorks won Oscars for “Shrek” in 2001 and “Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit” in 2005 and is nominated this year in the best animated feature category for “How to Train Your Dragon.”In the insular world of animation, the rivalry has been thrown into relief by the Annies, the industry’s top awards. Last week DreamWorks Animation won 15 Annies, including best animated feature for “How to Train Your Dragon,” and Disney-Pixar won only one, for its short “Day & Night.” Why the rout?As my colleague Brooks Barnes reported, last summer Disney-Pixar said it would no longer participate in the Annies, run by the International Animated Film Society, because the company felt it was not an honestly earned prize. Antran Manoogian, the president of the film society, responded that it would pick the most deserving winner, regardless of who bought pricey tickets to its ceremony.The rest is blog fodder; “Toy Story 3” is still considered the front-runner for the best animated feature Oscar (although in a non-Pixar year, one Academy member told me recently, “How to Train Your Dragon,” about a young Viking dragon hunter, would have a much better shot).The Pixar team would dearly love to win a best picture Oscar. “I would be overwhelmed with emotion, I think, that our peers recognized how we make our films, and that we use the same tools and that we take ourselves so seriously,” said Darla K. Anderson, a producer of “Toy Story 3” who has been with Pixar for 18 years. Their painstaking approach “has been with this ferocity of intensity,” she added, “to make a great movie, plain and simple — not a great animated film, but a great film.”It’s still unlikely that the Academy will reward animation on the broader scale of cinema just yet. But the top award would be especially sweet for “Toy Story 3,” whose plotline — about growing up and letting go of the totems of your past, your own imaginative history — mirrors that of the company and filmmakers working on it.“There would be no Pixar without Buzz and Woody,” Ms. Anderson said. “These characters I know better than I know many members of my family.”Moving beyond them, added Mr. Unkrich, who worked on all three “Toy Story” films, is “definitely very bittersweet.”Working in animation, though, allows for total directorial control. Does he ever just entertain himself by, say, making Woody do unnatural things? Does he have an animated version of himself tucked away somewhere?“No,” he said. “That would be really creepy. No, thank you.”'"
"'11-02-10,'0','Q. On a Roku XD player, is there a way to get closed captions on those Netflix movies that offer them? I am hard of hearing and closed captions are crucial to me.A. A spokesman for Roku said the company did not support Netflix closed captions in its products, most of which are set-top boxes that stream content from the Internet to a connected television. But Roku is investigating the possibility of adding closed captions embedded in certain Netflix videos in the future, so you may want to keep an eye on the company’s Web site (roku.com) for news.If you have a Netflix account, you may be able to see closed captions on selected movies and shows when you watch them on the computer instead. A post on the official Netflix blog last year (bit.ly/9n43ii) detailed the company’s efforts to add closed captions and subtitles to some titles in its video library. An unofficial list of streaming Netflix videos with subtitles for the hearing-impaired is at bit.ly/nf-cc.But if you prefer to watch on the TV, try exploring other video stream providers that work with the Roku XD. Hulu Plus, for instance, offers some TV shows with closed captions; the company has a short video showing how to turn on the feature at www.hulu.com/support/article/332610.Q. When I get mail on the iPad, I occasionally see blue-underlined text in the message. I get why Web addresses are highlighted, but why are street addresses and certain words in blue?'"
"'11-02-10,'0','When the page is uploaded, the frame frozen on the video is at the 30-second point, as Rihanna’s nice and naughty personae gaze toward one another from either side of the mirror, and viewers may proceed in either direction. The video is expected to be uploaded to rihannareblfleur.com, and a simplified version will appear on video-sharing Web sites like YouTube and Vimeo.What viewers may find mind-boggling is that the video was choreographed to make it difficult to determine in which direction it was originally filmed. There are no obvious giveaways — say, flower petals being plucked in one direction and the petals being reattached in the other.Misha Louy, an executive producer at Droga5 who worked on the video, explained that in some shots Rihanna was even filmed walking backward, or was directed to walk forward in such a way that when the video was played in reverse it “wouldn’t look like she was moonwalking backwards.”Also palindromic, as the agency refers to the video, is the soundtrack, which was composed to play the same notes for each frame, irrespective of direction.The goal, naturally, is for the video to go viral, and Droga5 is projecting that it will be viewed more than 20 million times. What makes that more realistic than it may sound is the staggering popularity of Rihanna, whose music videos combined have garnered more than a billion views on YouTube and who has about 24 million followers on Facebook and more than 3.2 million on Twitter. The singer will direct fans to the video through both of those social networks.Parlux, a 28-year-old company based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., also produces fragrances named for other celebrities, including Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson, Kanye West, Nicole Miller and Queen Latifah.As for how much input celebrities have in designing their perfumes, Frederick E. Purches, the founder and chief executive of Parlux, said some were particularly influential, like Rihanna. When perfume designers first met with the singer, “she would come into the meeting with a very unique smell, and people would say, ‘What are you wearing?’ and she would rattle off five fragrances that she had mixed and layered,” Mr. Purches said.Perfume designers then analyzed those brands, which Mr. Purches declined to name, and incorporated fragrance notes from all of them in the final formulation of Reb’l Fleur, he said.Reb’l Fleur “may seem almost bipolar with its juxtaposition of garisher notes on a harder-to-detect discreet aroma of classicism,” Marie-Helene Wagner wrote in a recent review on The Scented Salamander, a fragrance blog. “The first part may well send you the message that if you don’t identify with a girly, flaming red singer, then there isn’t much left for you to smell. But if you persist, then there is an anchoring of the scent which is extremely classic, light, restrained, ladylike and soft.”Packaged in bottles that resemble stiletto heels, because Rihanna has a fondness for them, the fragrance has a suggested retail price of $49 for 1.7 ounces and $59 for 3.4 ounces of perfume, and $30 for 6.7 ounces of body lotion.For Parlux, the campaign invests an unprecedented amount of resources into an online campaign. But it also relies on more traditional advertising. Reb’l Fleur billboards featuring Rihanna were scheduled for monthlong runs beginning Feb. 7 on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles and Feb. 14 in Times Square. Rather than introducing scents as it often does, magazine advertising will bring up the rear, appearing in the April issue of Lucky and the May issues of Juicy and People Style Watch.For three months beginning in April, the perfume also will be advertised in 363 movie theaters on 1,903 screens. A 30-second spot will be an edited version of the online video, and as moviegoers exit the theaters representatives from the brand will hand them scented cards. The brand expects to hand out about seven million of the cards, offering them not to everyone but rather to the target demographic for Reb’l Fleur: women 18 to 24.In all, the campaign is expected to cost $4 million to $5 million. It represents “the biggest launch we’ve had for some time” for Parlux, said Mr. Purches, the founder of the company.The popularity of a celebrity does not alone guarantee success for an eponymous perfume. The tennis players Maria Sharapova and Andy Roddick are popular, but Mr. Purches noted that fragrances his company began producing about five years ago through licensing deals with both players had not sold well.“People looked at these people sweating on the court and said, ‘No, I don’t need that fragrance,’ ” Mr. Purches said.'"
"'11-02-10,'0','The change in attitude is prompted by more than just raw statistics. NATO and American military leaders have made reducing civilian casualties a cornerstone of their policy and have moved quickly to investigate claims of abuses and often issued apologies.“NATO, in some cases they acknowledge their mistakes; to some extent they have taken positive steps in terms of reducing their impact,” said Ajmal Samadi, director of Afghanistan Rights Monitor. “On the insurgent side we don’t have any acknowledgment of the problem and instead we see a brazen continuation of their crimes.”Afghanistan Rights Monitor is no stalking horse for the government. Last year, Mr. Karzai’s spokesman Waheed Omer attacked the group as supporting the enemy. “We said it will take a miracle to win this war under Hamid Karzai’s leadership, and he didn’t like that,” Mr. Samadi said.While a code of conduct put out by the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, in 2009 and updated last June called for avoiding civilian casualties, the Taliban have since claimed responsibility for many attacks where civilians were, if not necessarily the targets, the main victims.“We haven’t seen any change in the conduct of the Taliban since their code of conduct,” said Ahmad Nader Nadery, a commissioner of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. “To the contrary, we’ve seen an increase in roadside bombs and suicide attacks in places where there are civilian populations.”A Jan. 29 attack on the Finest Supermarket in Kabul by a Taliban member, using both firearms and a suicide bomb vest, was both a recent example of the insurgents’ disregard for civilians and something of a watershed event for the human rights community.Among the 14 civilian victims was a prominent human rights activist, Hamida Barmaki, her husband and their four young children; the youngest victim, her 2-year-old son, had a bullet wound in the head as well as blast wounds. When his body was found, clutched in his hand was the scorched remains of a plastic shopping bag handle.That galvanized many in the rights community, and a memorial service held in Ms. Barmaki’s honor on Feb. 1 at the Human Rights Commission turned into a series of impassioned eulogies, mostly denouncing the insurgents for singling out civilians.“Killing innocent people is a mortal sin, and under the holy religion of Islam, those who did this are condemned to hell,” said Sima Samar, the head of the rights commission.Rights groups have not stopped criticizing international forces, particularly over the issue of night raids, which often result in civilian casualties. Many say, as well, that the increased tempo of NATO operations is to blame for the greater frequency of all attacks, including those that end in civilian casualties.But human rights advocates’ main emphasis has shifted to what amounts to an insurgent killing rampage among softer, civilian targets — whom insurgents kill more than twice as often as they kill government or coalition forces.For the first time last summer, the United Nations’ twice-yearly report on the protection of civilians in Afghanistan, which previously focused on NATO and Afghan government violations, blamed the insurgents for engaging in “unlawful means of warfare through increased use of I.E.D.’s, suicide attacks and assassinations that violate Afghans’ basic right to life and the international humanitarian law principles.”Taliban officials reacted furiously to the report, denying its conclusion that insurgents caused most civilian deaths and proposing a “joint commission” between the United Nations and insurgents to study the problem.“NATO, with the tactical directives, they’ve moved a long way,” said Rachel Reid, Human Rights Watch’s Afghanistan analyst. “It’s very possible to engage with them, even organizations like mine, they’ll meet with us and listen to our concerns.”“There is a real need for more pressure and open dialogue with insurgent forces for their violations of the laws of war,” she said.She was among human rights activists who have met with the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, encouraging at least a preliminary investigation of human rights abuses on all sides. “He’s interested, and his ears are open,” she said.The prosecutor’s office “is examining alleged crimes within the jurisdiction of the court by all actors involved,” said Florence Olara, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor. “A preliminary examination however does not necessarily mean the prosecutor will open an investigation.”Last August, Amnesty International called on the court to step in. “The Taliban and other insurgent groups should be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes,” the group declared.The Human Rights Commission had a meeting on Saturday at which it discussed formally calling on the court to investigate Taliban war crimes, but it has made no decision, Mr. Nadery said.That initiative is complicated by efforts to start reconciliation talks between the government and the Taliban. As part of that, the Karzai government pushed through an amnesty law that specifically absolves any insurgent who stops fighting and accepts the government of all past war crimes and crimes against humanity — an amnesty so broad that it runs contrary to international law.On top of that, American officials have shown little enthusiasm for the involvement of the International Criminal Court. Although the Clinton administration signed the treaty on Dec. 31, 2000, the Bush administration renounced the treaty on May 6, 2002, fearing prosecution of American soldiers.'"
"'11-02-10,'0','Q. What accounts for MultiFunding’s growth — marketing, or a worsening economic environment for businesses?A. I think there’s a yearning and crying out for transparency and knowledge and understanding. Most small-business owners are more tradesmen than they are businessmen, and they don’t really understand the finances.A. I think people have a hard time with the whole collateral concept. Also, when you get into a loan, it’s extremely important to know what it’s going to take to get out of it if you choose to get out of it early. A few weeks ago, we were refinancing a loan and the prepayment penalty the bank was trying to charge the client was 19.5 percent of the face value of the loan. The guy didn’t even realize he had a prepayment penalty.Q. I would guess that 15 years ago not many small businesses went to intermediaries to help them find loans. Why do businesses come to you?A. Banks push the products or services that they have to offer. In today’s world, a bank’s portfolio of options represent maybe five or 10 of the options available to the customer. And in all the confusion out there with all these different structures and options, I think it’s very difficult for the average small-business owner to figure out what is going on. We have lending products in our portfolio that are as low as 4 percent annual interest to as high as 60 percent annual interest. The goal is to get them the cheapest possible loan that we think we can get them.Q. Is a 60 percent loan ever good for a business?A. I am not a fan of 60 percent loans, but if you need money to fulfill a purchase order or buy some inventory, and you have no other collateral to work with. ... Sixty percent a year is 5 percent a month, and if you borrow that money for two months at 10 percent and you make 30 percent on it, you’re still better off than you were without it. I would rather that they be aware of the choice and then they can make the decision for themselves. I don’t always agree with the decisions my clients make.But we try to bring some innovative and creative thinking. There’s a client who is currently backed up on payroll taxes with the I.R.S. and their business has dropped by about a half this year, but they have plenty of collateral. We are putting them into a factoring arrangement so he can pay off the I.R.S. quickly, and then flip him into an S.B.A. loan where he can pay off the other debts.Q. Are there people who should get loans that you can’t get bank loans for at this point?A. I think the people who aren’t getting loans today are appropriately not getting loans.Q. What disqualifies people right now?A. Collateral. The value of their houses has collapsed, or the value of their equipment or commercial properties has collapsed. This most likely disqualifies people from S.B.A. loans or traditional commercial mortgages and drags them into factoring or asset-based lending or private money. That’s about half of our fundable clients. No one is addressing that.Q. What could be done?A. I think there is an interesting idea for some kind of collateral exchange, if there was an eager entrepreneur out there. Companies could get someone to put up collateral for a loan in exchange for something. The investor doesn’t have to put up hard cash. He’s basically putting up the insurance policy for the company, if it all goes south.A. In some ways, maybe. The other thing I have suggested on my blog is that perhaps you could borrow money against your future revenues, or your future income. I now have one lender I work with who lends between $100,000 and $200,000 to a small business with a six- to 24-month payback.Q. Did you make that connection as a result of your blog post?Q. Are there particular banks that you like to try first?A. We hate going to the bigger banks. As a general rule, we would much rather go to a smaller community bank. For S.B.A. loans, there are a number of lenders based out of a small community bank doing S.B.A. loans on a national footprint. We like to go to those guys. If you are living in Paducah, Ky., and you go to an S.B.A. lender in your community, and they’ve done two S.B.A. loans that year, you’re marching up the wrong street.Q. Is your first choice to put someone in an S.B.A. loan?A. No. If their credit is in the high fives to mid-sixes, or their collateral is a hodgepodge of things, then it’s appropriate to put them in an S.B.A. loan. If they have decent collateral and the high sixes or the low sevens on a credit score and decent cash flow, I’d rather keep them away from the S.B.A. loan. There are a lot of regs, and there are a lot of rules and there are nine million papers to fill out. We joke that you have to give blood for these loans. The fastest S.B.A. loan I have ever gotten done is in 11 weeks, from start to finish.Q. When you find that the credit scores are good enough to avoid the S.B.A., which banks do you go to?A. We try to go to community banks or medium-sized banks in the community where that customer is, and generally speaking, from start to finish those loans are about four to six weeks.Q. The big banks — Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo and Bank of America — have all been talking about their commitment to small-business lending. How well have their actions measured up?A. Our customers have been through the wringer with them for months. They do press releases about how they’re hiring all these small-business bankers. I’d like to see less talk and more walk.Q. Have you tried to get a loan for your business?Q. Do you want one?A. No. If I tried, I don’t think I would be eligible.'"

"'11-02-11,'1','Mr. Smith said he ordered his tenant to immediately cease. “I’m pro dog,” he said, “but not at the expense of anyone else.”When the problem continued, Ms. Archer went to the police, who she said recommended asking the Department of Public Health to intervene.On Jan. 13, Irene Sanchez, a health department investigator, toured the roof, took notes, and promised action.“I was relieved to have someone who was going to have an impact on the situation,” Ms. Archer said.One week later, a “Notice of Violation” letter arrived in the mail — not to the dog’s owner, but to Ms. Archer’s building, which was “hereby declared to be a public nuisance.” If the waste was not removed immediately, the fine would be $163.Ms. Sanchez said that animal feces could spread disease and that Ms. Archer’s building, even though it had been victimized, was culpable. “I didn’t see the dog,” Ms. Sanchez said. “We don’t know whose dog waste it is.”But it took only a matter of minutes — by leaving a note at the neighboring building — for The Bay Citizen to find the responsible dog. Her name is Jane, a 50-pound, shepherd mix with long black hair — a rescue dog sometimes cared for by Howie Correa, a tenant of the neighboring building.“I feel bad,” Mr. Correa said. “It wasn’t something I knew was a problem.”He said Jane, who belongs to his girlfriend and visits only occasionally, was apparently sneaking up to the roof.Animal waste can be a contentious issue in a city of 815,000 residents where dogs are so popular — about 150,000, according to the local S.P.C.A. — that they outnumber children (118,000). Controversy goes back decades. In the 1970s Harvey Milk, the city supervisor, captured the political zeitgeist by advocating for tough pooper-scooper laws, helping set in motion a national trend.Complaints about dog waste remain common, but Sally Stephens, chairwoman of San Francisco Dog Owners Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for responsible dog ownership, said she was surprised that the city had penalized someone who does not own a dog.Eileen Shields, the health department spokeswoman, said that the city lacked the power to force one building owner to clean up another’s property — and that the city itself was not about to get its hands dirty.“It might not seem fair, but someone has to clean it up,” Ms. Shields said. “They think the health department is going to come out and clean dog poop?”Ms. Shields said this was not the only situation where the city punishes victims: owners of buildings vandalized by graffiti also face fines if they fail to clean their properties.That provided little solace to Ms. Archer, who went to the roof and removed the waste, one plastic-bag-wrapped handful at a time, to avoid the fine.In the meantime, Mr. Smith, the landlord, said he had warned Mr. Correa. “If it happens one more time,” Mr. Smith said, “he’s going to be evicted.”For his part, Mr. Correa said that Jane’s rooftop excursions were over, and that he and his girlfriend were considering finding a farm for the dog so she could get out of the city and have a better life.All involved said they were exasperated, and all wished they had settled the matter privately, now regretting that the city ever became involved.“It has been Kafkaesque,” Ms. Archer said.'"

He spoke Thursday at Science Park High School, after the screening of his new full-length documentary about the Harlem Rens basketball team, “On the Shoulders of Giants.”“It’s not life-threatening,” he said, “at this point in my life.”Abdul-Jabbar said when he first received his diagnosis, he didn’t know what to think. He feared the worst. “I thought I might be dead in a few months,” he said. “I had a good friend who was diagnosed with leukemia and was dead within 30 days. I really had no understanding of what I was dealing with.”He was referring to the actor Bruno Kirby.With the help of a medication called Gleevec, C.M.L. can be monitored better, and the chances for recovery are improved.

"'11-02-11,'1','Mr. Perry’s prescription for the Commission on the Arts is similar, saving the state $5.1 million in the next two years on top of what lawmakers would save with their proposed cuts. Fully funded, it’s a financial dust mite: It asked for $14.5 million over the next two years, down from the $15.9 million in the current budget.Those are two of four small agencies in line for Mr. Perry’s starvation diet (the boards of professional geoscientists and professional land surveying are the others). Eight more relative small fries would be consolidated into other agencies. He has $468.5 million in savings on that list, which isn’t nothing, but most of it — $412.1 million — would come from selling land, chasing debts owed the state, selling a prison, using managed care in a prison health program and charging state employees a fee for insured dependents who can get health insurance elsewhere.The biggest program at the Historical Commission is a courthouse renovation and preservation program — financed by bonds — that started when Mr. Bush was governor. Most of the Arts Commission money goes to arts grants throughout the state.In the heart of Mr. Perry’s budget proposal, he simply looked at what the House and the Senate had proposed for each agency and took the lower of the two numbers. His own proposals were more symbolic than lucrative and trivialize the cuts that are being made elsewhere.Mr. Perry didn’t talk about what it might mean to cut almost $10 billion from public education with 80,000 new students joining that system every year. He didn’t talk about how cuts of 10 percent or more in what the state pays Medicaid providers — doctors and hospitals and such — might shake out. He talked about closing a rural affairs office that most people haven’t heard of and of cutting frills like archaeological projects and arts festivals.It creates the impression that the budget can be balanced by snipping some minor programs that don’t seem vital, and diverts attention from vital programs that, in this address, seemed minor.There is plenty of money in what the state’s budget analysts refer to as the “digital dust” — the small expenditures that, taken alone, are fairly insignificant. The $56.4 million in the suspensions and consolidations on the governor’s list could probably be put to good use elsewhere. Whether that’s a better use is up to the budget writers.A quick example, with big numbers: If you cut $5 billion from the annual state education budget, you’ve cut roughly $1,000 for every student in the public schools. The other cuts Mr. Perry is talking about would restore that $1,000 for each of 56,400 pupils. That’s a fraction of the total, but it’s a lot of children.Writing a budget is an exercise in just those sorts of equivalencies: would this particular dollar be best spent on arts, history, public education, luring companies to Texas, ensuring air safety or keeping a no-new-taxes promise?In his State of the State address, the governor was describing Texas now, in present tense. It’s the Legislature, led by the budget writers, who will determine what he’s talking about at the next address, in two years.'"

"'11-02-11,'1','Justice Antonin Scalia galloped beyond the farthest boundaries of judicial propriety in secretly meeting on Capitol Hill to discuss the Constitution with Tea Party members of Congress saddled with a co-equal duty to assess the constitutionality of legislative action. If there are better ways to destroy public confidence in judicial impartiality, they do not readily come to mind.Like Caesar’s wife, justices must be above suspicion. The Supreme Court has sermonized that “justice requires the appearance of justice.” The Constitutional Convention of 1787 rejected a Council of Revision with Supreme Court members to advise on legislation to avoid the unseemliness of justices vetting the constitutionality of their own handiwork.No justice has ever testified on the constitutionality of bills before Congress — even President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s ill-conceived “court-packing” proposal. Associate Justice Abe Fortas was forced to resign for, among other things, secretly advising President Lyndon B. Johnson on race, urban unrest and the Vietnam War.Charles Evans Hughes, who later became chief justice, observed in 1907: “We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.” Don’t be surprised if a Tea Party member soon speaks on the floor of the House urging repeal of the health care reform law’s individual mandate because Justice Scalia secretly advised that it exceeds the powers of Congress.The writer was associate deputy attorney general under President Reagan, 1981-83.'"
"'11-02-11,'1','Can’t stand Taxi TV? Even New York’s taxi commissioner feels your pain.In a candid assessment of the much-maligned back-seat screens, David S.

Only the high cost of a fare came in for more criticism.Asked at a news conference about the widespread contempt for the screens, Mr. Yassky said, “I was not surprised, to tell you the truth.”“We are working with the two companies that operate those devices to try and get some better content,” he continued, “and some content that will be more compelling to passengers.”Currently, Taxi TV includes a variety of news, weather and cultural reports produced by two local stations, WABC and WNBC. The city is planning to unveil a second channel of programming that will potentially include content produced by the media arm of the Bloomberg administration, including shopping and cooking shows.'"
"'11-02-11,'1','Mr. Shipp recently completed a memoir filled with unclassified documents that he said backed up his assertions. He says that he submitted the manuscript to the agency for the required prepublication review but that it blacked out swaths of information, like accounts of his children’s nosebleeds, strange rashes, vomiting, severe asthma and memory loss.Citing a confidentiality agreement he signed with the government, Mr. Shipp would not discuss where the secret facility was located, what its purpose was, which agency he worked for or what his duties were.Still, he said, he was free to say that he worked at C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va., both before and after his stint at the facility. And public documents from a separate lawsuit, which he filed against his insurance carrier over a claim for his family’s destroyed belongings, make clear that he was stationed at Camp Stanley.Mr. Shipp’s ex-wife, Lorena Shipp, and one of his sons, Joel Shipp, now 28, said in interviews that the C.I.A. had assigned Mr. Shipp to a high-ranking job at the facility to uncover suspected security breaches. The family moved to an Army-owned house at Camp Stanley in June 1999 and left in May 2001.It is not clear what took place at the C.I.A. facility. But the camp had been used as a weapons depot for generations. Joel and Lorena Shipp described bunkers and many old weapons, including Soviet weaponry. They also said that they occasionally saw officials performing tactical drills, and that sometimes items were burned or buried there.“The house that our family was moved into was planted on top of a lot of buried ammunition,” Joel Shipp said. “One time me and my little brother dug up a mustard gas shell.”The Shipps soon began to get sick. First they got nosebleeds, then they developed symptoms that doctors said resembled H.I.V. infection or exposure to radiation, according to family members. Eventually, Kevin Shipp said, he discovered that the house was full of a spreading black substance.Camp Stanley has a troubled environmental record. In August 2001, according to local news reports, military officials began distributing bottled water to residents nearby after it was discovered that toxins from the camp had polluted an aquifer in the area, contaminating the drinking water.The Shipps said they were twice evacuated from the house after expressing concern about their sudden health troubles. But, Kevin Shipp said, his supervisor played down the problems, declaring that the house was fine after its air was tested — although the windows and doors were open at the time, Mr. Shipp said.Suspicious of a cover-up, Mr. Shipp said he sent samples from the house to a scientist at Texas Tech University. His manuscript includes a Texas Tech report showing that the samples tested positive for toxic mold.Eventually, the Shipps sued the C.I.A. using pseudonyms. Meanwhile, Mr. Shipp was transferred to the agency’s headquarters, where he became a polygraph operator. But his relationship with the agency was deteriorating, and the family began to suspect that they had been placed under surveillance.Mr. Shipp said he quit in 2002 after he was accused of using a government credit card to pay for personal expenses; he says he paid the money back, but had been told by a supervisor to use the card for clothes and lodging after his family had to leave the house and their old clothes were destroyed.A federal judge overseeing the case ordered the family and the C.I.A. into mediation. Mr. Shipp’s memoir includes a December 2003 settlement agreement — signed by a government counsel — under which the family would be paid $400,000 and would have to stay silent about the matter.But two days later, he said, one of his attorneys, Clint Blackman, called him to say that the government had withdrawn the settlement. The case would be fought out in court.The case was already sealed, and the Justice Department invoked the State Secrets Privilege — a judicially created doctrine that the government has increasingly used to win the dismissal of lawsuits related to national security, shielding its actions from judicial review.A federal judge dismissed the case, and an appeals court in New Orleans, in a secret ruling, later upheld that dismissal, Mr. Shipp said. Mr. Shipp’s manuscript mentions several other lawyers who helped him in the case, including Mark Zaid of Washington, who has represented many intelligence officials in lawsuits against the government, and Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor who has filed several lawsuits challenging claims of executive secrecy.Mr. Blackman and Mr. Zaid confirmed that Mr. Shipp had been a client, but they declined to discuss any sealed lawsuit. Mr. Turley confirmed that he had been asked to consult on the case, but said he was never given details about it.Mr. Shipp has moved to Florida and tried to rebuild his life. But angry at what had happened to his family, he says he has decided to go public, no matter the risk of talking about a sealed case.“I decided to just sacrifice myself for the public to know what they did, how illegal it was, how flawed the State Secrets Privilege is, and how they used it to cover up the destruction of my family,” he said. “It’s just abominable what they did.”'"
"'11-02-11,'1','The main obstacle is an agreement between the United States and Iran known as the Algiers Accords, reached the day before the hostages were freed. In return for their release, Washington pledged to unfreeze Iranian assets that had been seized after the hostage-taking and to give Iran immunity from lawsuits like the one being pursued.Through six presidencies, Republican and Democratic alike, the government’s position has been that the accords form an enduring obligation, unshaken by Congressional attempts to override it with antiterrorism legislation that effectively endorsed the former hostages’ right to sue Iran. The federal courts have thus far sided with the government, though appellate judges in Washington will take up the case this year.From the hostages’ vantage, the Algiers Accords were reached with a gun pointed at America’s head. “It’s very clear from communiqués at the time that the Iranians were going to try, convict and hang these folks,” said their lawyer, V. Thomas Lankford Jr., of Alexandria, Va. To him and his clients, the accords amounted to “a ransom note.”About 150 Americans are part of the lawsuit, including surviving hostages, the estates of those who died and some relatives. In all, they are seeking $6.6 billion in damages, but no one pretends that is a realistic figure. The true purpose of a big number like that, Mr. Lankford said, is to take a firm stand against state-sponsored terrorism, by “making it costly enough to where you just don’t go out and do it.”That is also the view of Mr. Rosen, the lone New Yorker in the group. “Iranians need to know that you just can’t do this in this world,” he said, “abrogating international law, walking into an embassy, taking over people. They really didn’t learn a lesson from the hostage crisis.”It galls him that the State and Justice Departments have consistently opposed the hostages in court. It is, he said, almost as if “the Iranian government and the American government are somehow in collaboration on this issue.”A few weeks ago, on the 30th anniversary of their being freed, about 20 of the surviving hostages held a reunion at West Point, where they were first taken after returning to American soil. It was a happy gathering, Mr. Rosen said, but there was also despair about the lawsuit — “a certain sense that nothing will come of it.”Obviously, none of them are getting younger. Mr. Rosen is 66, a grandfather of four. After Iran, he settled into a relatively sedate life. These days, he is in charge of public and external affairs at the Borough of Manhattan Community College.But his spirit of adventure did not die. Eight years ago, he went to Afghanistan, part of an international team trying to rebuild that country’s educational system. The principal language of people he worked with was Dari, a close cousin of the Farsi that he spoke. “Ironically,” the former hostage said, “they used to call me ‘Mr. Iranian.’ ”'"
"'11-02-11,'1','Further, it may be that covenants often do not bring much protection anyway. Because they typically cap debt at a level 20 to 30 percent above a company’s initial debt load, a highly leveraged borrower could easily run out of cash long before breaching a debt covenant.Investors are still rightly taking care. Del Monte’s debt of seven times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is high, but it is not outrageous for a leveraged buyout, especially with Ebitda growing 36 percent in 2010. Lenders shouldn’t get carried away, though. Covenants may not always seem worth much, but if investors let them go completely, they may come to miss them.Kevin Warsh’s resignation as a governor of the Federal Reserve removes one of the closest advisers to the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and almost certainly the most hawkish of his inner circle. If current policies produce 1970s-style inflation, as many of Mr. Bernanke’s critics predict, Mr. Warsh could be well placed to take over as Paul A. Volcker did in 1979.While Mr. Warsh voted with his boss on monetary policy matters, as is Fed tradition, the former investment banker has made clear his concerns over recent financial policy, writing in November that “chronic short-termism in the conduct of economic policy has done much to bring us to this parlous point.”Mr. Warsh, a Republican who is both a fiscal hawk and a proponent of higher savings rates, has said he believes “sound fiscal policy must do more than reacquaint consumers with old bad habits.” He also has said that “responsible monetary policy” in the current climate should heed potential long-term effects.So his imminent departure would appear to deprive Mr. Bernanke of an intellectual sparring partner, strengthening the hand of the doves on the Fed board. However, assuming he does not depart the monetary policy arena to run for political office or return to Wall Street, he represents a kind of secret weapon for monetary hawks should current policies produce resurgent inflation and its attendant woes.Outside the Fed, Mr. Warsh will be better placed to make the case for monetary stringency than while belonging to the collegial Board of Governors. In extremis, should a spike in inflation or a financial market crash remove the credibility of current Fed policies, Mr. Warsh would be available as a replacement, either when Mr. Bernanke’s current term ends in January 2014 or earlier in a crisis.That’s sort of what happened when Mr. Volcker was appointed Fed chairman to replace G. William Miller, who had lost the faith of bond markets. As a known Republican, Mr. Warsh would presumably be passed over by President Obama. But at 40, he is a relative spring chicken compared with Mr. Volcker, 83. Harder money advocates who felt they lacked a potential replacement for Mr. Bernanke may find succor in Mr. Warsh’s decision.'"
"'11-02-11,'1','On the page dedicated to Walgreens, viewers see ads for the new campaign along with videos about things like choosing the right day care and protecting children from springtime risks like bee stings. The page also features advice videos from a Walgreens pharmacist, Stacia Woodcock.While the videos are not new to the campaign, the fact that Ms. Woodcock will begin recommending Walgreens brand products is, said Susan McNally, an associate media director at Digitas.Banner ads comparing Walgreens store brands to name brands will also appear on the page and on Web sites like ABC.com and CBS.com, where the company has purchased video spots that will run before prime-time shows like “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Modern Family,” “How I Met Your Mother,” “Survivor” and “The Big Bang Theory.”The banner ads list the crucial comparison points between store brands and brand names, including when store brands contain the same active ingredients or may be less expensive and usually backed by a guarantee. The ads also contain a link to the Walgreens Web site where users can purchase products and see the best-selling store-brand items.As part of its digital strategy, Walgreens also partnered with the women-centric blog publishing network, BlogHer, to reach its target demographic of women between the ages of 25 and 54. The company provided seasonal products like cold and flu remedies to bloggers at sites like TheFrugalGirl.com and SliceOfLemon.com so the bloggers could review them and encourage their readers to try them, Ms. McNally said.Walgreens will continue to provide products to a variety of bloggers — primarily those who focus on mothers and deal seekers — throughout the year. All of the participating bloggers will be paid to participate in the campaign and will be allowed to combine Walgreens brand principles in their posts, Ms. McNally said.Banner ads will also appear within the BlogHer.com network of sites that will incorporate comments from users and snippets of blog posts about the products.Walgreens spent $271 million on advertising for the 2010 fiscal year, $334 million in 2009 and $341 million in 2008, according to the company. Its new advertising effort is an extension of a campaign Walgreens began in 2009 called “There’s a Way,” which was aimed at increasing consumer awareness of all of its health services and products.For its new television commercial and the print ads, Walgreens worked with its agency of record, Downtown Partners. The work emphasizes the theme of pharmacists recommending the Walgreens private-label products.The television commercials show three scenes, including a woman in an elevator whose Walgreen pharmacist recommended “cold tablets and hot soup” for her cold. After she sneezes, a fellow elevator passenger gives her a cautious look.The second and third scenes in the commercial include a mother whose Walgreen pharmacist recommends “bubble gum flavor and patience” as her son hides behind a toy shield, and a man standing in a restaurant who is recommended “antacid tablets and only one taco.”The idea was to make the spots memorable and warm so that viewers could identify with the characters, said Jim Schmidt, a creative partner at Downtown Partners. “It’s a pretty heavily informative commercial. We hopefully succeeded in making it likable,” Mr. Schmidt said.Consumers who purchase the store-brand products will also be able to make others feel better through the cause-marketing portion of the campaign. On Feb. 1, Walgreens began donating a penny from the purchase of every store-brand health and wellness product to its Walgreens Way to Well fund, which provides health services and educational efforts to local communities, including preventative health tests and vouchers for products. Walgreens will donate up to $3 million annually.To extend the store-brand campaign in the spring, Walgreens will introduce new in-store signs featuring frequently asked questions about health and wellness products on store shelves.'"
"'11-02-11,'1','But the deployment plan has created an uncharacteristic uproar on this normally sleepy island. A local election held in September, in the midst of the trawler standoff, turned into a bitterly fought referendum over whether to accept the garrison, with supporters winning four of the six town council seats up for grabs.The supporters of the garrison, led by Mr. Hokama, say they hope the base brings not only peace of mind but also an influx of badly needed jobs and youthful residents, especially if the soldiers come with their families. They hope this will provide a lift for an economically depressed island that currently lacks either a high school or a hospital, and where the number of residents has fallen by 250, or almost 15 percent of the population, during the past decade alone.Still, the plan faces deep resistance in Yonaguni, a part of the Okinawan chain, where bitter memories linger of how the Japanese military turned its guns on Okinawan civilians during World War II.Opponents also say they fear the soldiers would scare away what they see as the island’s best chance for an economic future — investors and tourists from vibrant Taiwan, just 65 miles away, which has been rapidly gaining on Japan in terms of economic development.“Our choice is between seeking economic exchange with Taiwan, or bringing in the Self-Defense Forces,” said Shoichi Miyara, a sugar cane farmer. “Do we embrace or resist?”For the leader of the opponents, Yosuke Azato, a 68-year-old retired phone-line repairman, the answer is clearly to embrace. Mr. Azato said that before the war, Yonaguni had close economic ties with Taiwan, then a Japanese colony. Growing up after the war, he said, he remembers Yonaguni as a thriving hub for smuggling into Taiwan, which swelled the island’s population to more than 12,000 until American occupation forces cracked down in the 1950s.Last year, he began a one-man effort to revive trade links with Taiwan, though in a more legal form. He bought several tons of fertilizer in Taiwan, which he could sell to Yonaguni’s sugar cane farmers more cheaply than the high-priced fertilizer shipped from the main islands of Japan nearly 650 miles away.“The best protection we can have is to be economic partners with them,” he said.Other garrison opponents fear that the soldiers may bring noise and crime, echoing criticisms made on Okinawa’s main island about its large American military presence.Mr. Miyara, the farmer, said he was turned against the base idea last year when 120 Self-Defense Force members came to Yonaguni as volunteers to help with an annual marathon.“They littered the public toilets with cigarette butts and scolded our children,” said Mr. Miyara, 60. “They will ruin our peacefulness.”That peace is already being disturbed. When Japan’s defense minister visited the island last March, opponents hung large banners along roads pledging to resist a Self-Defense Force presence.The banners, which still hang flapping in the wind, seem out of place on this mountainous island where cows outnumber people, and where the only sound is often the crash of waves against cliffs, or the rustling of sugar cane fields.Mr. Hokama, the mayor, rejected the opposition’s argument that the garrison would harm ties with Taiwan. Since taking office five years ago, he said, he has frequently visited Taiwan and has opened an office for the island in the Taiwanese city of Hualien.“Taiwan has an army, too,” said Mr. Hokama, 62. “They understand the threat from mainland China better than anyone.”He said many islanders also felt a personal connection to the Senkakus, which sit about 90 miles to the north. As a child, Mr. Hokama said, he visited the island group twice with his father, a fisherman who used to ferry supplies to a fish processing plant that once operated on one of the Senkakus but closed more than 30 years ago.Mr. Hokama said he used to be a socialist who opposed the Self-Defense Force’s very existence as a violation of Japan’s pacifist Constitution. But he said he became a base proponent after Chinese ships began appearing in nearby waters a decade or so ago.Shinko Kinjo, the owner of a small distillery that makes the island’s potent awamori spirits, underwent a similar political conversion. He said he used to vote for Japan’s Communist Party; now, he leads the Yonaguni Defense Association, a rightist group that calls for a stronger military.“China will be claiming our island next,” said Mr. Kinjo, 67, who decorated his office with military photographs and a large United States flag given to him by the crew of a visiting American minesweeper.While some like Mr. Kinjo said they believed that the United States would help Japan against Chinese threats, others said it was time for Japan to prepare to defend itself. Younger islanders said the September trawler showdown had a particularly large effect on pushing local attitudes to the right.Hitomi Maehamamori, a 28-year-old part-time worker, said she used to be uninterested in politics. But Ms. Maehamamori, who wore a blue kimono as she joined a recent festival of Okinawa’s animist religion, said the trawler episode had shocked her.“Why is China doing this?” she asked. “I am O.K. with the Self-Defense Forces if they keep away the Chinese ships.”'"
"'11-02-11,'1','The women and few men sitting at their desks in the film “Poetry” have open faces and smiles. They’re good pupils, these older people who have come to the cultural center to learn. Perhaps because they have chosen to be there, they don’t have the look of sullen resentment and cultivated boredom that glazes the faces of the high school students glimpsed now and again. Instead these latter-day bards gaze at the man who has come to say something to them about art and maybe life. Instead he holds up an apple and talks about seeing.The importance of seeing, seeing the world deeply, is at the heart of this quietly devastating, humanistic work from the South Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong. Throughout the story, the teacher, a bespectacled man with an easy manner, will guide the students as each struggles to write a single poem, searching memories and emotions for inspiration. “Up till now, you haven’t seen an apple for real,” he says in that first class, as the film cuts to a student, Mija (Yun Jung-hee), sliding into a seat. “To really know what an apple is, to be interested in it, to understand it,” he adds, “that is really seeing it.” From the way the camera settles on Mija it’s evident that he could substitute the word apple for woman — or life.For Mija, a 66-year-old raising her only grandson, Wook (Lee David), in a cramped, cluttered apartment in an unnamed city, the pursuit of poetry becomes a pastime and then a passion and finally a means of transcendence. At first, though, it’s a pleasant distraction from an otherwise mundane existence, if also a way to exercise a mind that, as a doctor tells Mija early on, has begun to slip slowly away from her. Out of fear or confusion, she keeps the diagnosis to herself and almost from herself, telling neither Wook nor his mother, who lives in another city. Instead she dons the poet’s cap. “I do have a poet’s vein,” she says, chattering into her cellphone. “I do like flowers and say odd things.”She seems so unremarkable, this woman with her white hats, tidily arranged scarves and vanity. But like this subtle, transfixing film, she draws you in. Crucial in this respect is Ms. Yun’s performance, a tour de force of emotional complexity that builds through restraint and, like Mr. Lee’s unadorned visual style, earns rather than demands your attention. (His earlier features include “Secret Sunshine.”) The shabby rooms and ordinary streets in “Poetry” are shown without fanfare, more like statements of facts than pieces of an evolving narrative. Yet it’s the prosaic quality of this world, its ordinariness, that makes the story’s shocks reverberate so forcefully, beginning with the revelation that Wook and five friends, all boys, have been implicated in the death of a classmate, a girl first seen floating face down in a river in the opening scene.There’s a mesmerizing quality to that sequence, which begins with an image of rushing water, partly because — like the young child on the riverbank whose viewpoint you share — you initially can’t make out what it is that you’re looking at until the body floats into the frame in close-up. The corpse belongs to a teenage girl who accused some classmates of having serially raped her. On the most brutal level, her body introduces a mystery. Yet there’s more to the opening, including the children clustered on the riverbank, ominously doubled by the teenagers who helped put that body in the water and whose indifference suggests that, for them, this death wasn’t cataclysmic, just play that got out of hand.This cruelty doesn’t exist in isolation, as becomes obvious when the father of one of the other accused rapists contacts Mija and sweeps her off to an afternoon meeting at a restaurant. Together, he and four other fathers have decided — with the school’s blessing — to give the dead girl’s mother a large sum of cash, a bribe for her silence. What’s done is done, one man more or less says, as another pours the beer. (“Ladies first,” he says, offering Mija a glass.) “Although I feel sorry for the dead girl,” a father says, “now’s the time for us to worry about our own boys.” Her face empty, Mija sits wordlessly. And then she drifts outside, opens her little notebook and begins writing: “Blood ... a flower as red as blood.”'"
"'11-02-11,'1','This week there are questions from visitors: some have a budget in mind, others are focusing on a celebration. As always, send your queries to dinejournal@nytimes.com.Q. My wife and I live in Wisconsin but will be staying on the Upper East Side for two weeks while she does a rotation in medical school. She has never been to New York before, and I haven’t been since I was young. Unfortunately, our budget is not New York-size, and we’re looking to spend only around $500 total on all our meals out. (We’ll cook the rest of our meals at the apartment, which won’t be counted toward that budget.) Do you have any recommendations for where we can get some tasty and unique dining experiences without breaking the bank? A few restaurants on our list already: Toloache (for the guacamole) and Cafe D’Alsace (for the nearby beer experience).A. Two weeks, $500 for meals out in the world. You’re going to be cooking at home a lot, though the two of you could decide to eat solely from food carts in Midtown and do pretty well for yourselves at around $12 a throw, no sodas included. Get your Jamaican Dutchy on, your Halal Cart, your Trini-Paki. For these and more, take a gander at the Midtownlunch.com blog. It’s an invaluable resource for eating in Manhattan on the cheap. (Always ask for extra hot sauce.)In addition, I’m going to push hard on the Chinatown front: Xi’an Famous Foods on East Broadway for lamb face; Prosperity on Eldridge Street for cheap fried dumplings. I think you should hit Lexington Avenue in the 20s for Indian food (try Tiffin Wallah) and for the banh mi at Baoguette.For real sit-down fare, though, you should try dinner for two at Le Relais de Venise L’Entrecôte, steak for cheap, very fun. I think you should also go to the Lower East Side for arepas at Caracas Arepas Bar. Also to Veselka in the East Village for borscht. And I believe you should scrimp and save toward one semi-blowout at the end of the trip: dinner at Torrisi Italian Specialties, in Little Italy. The price is $50 per person, seven courses. Get there wicked early. No reservations.'"
"'11-02-11,'1','“The price is there,” said James Hesketh, the president and chief executive of Atna Resources, which reopened the Briggs Mine on the western border of Death Valley National Park in 2009. “It’s still a very well-endowed resource state.”Sutter Gold estimates that there could be $800 million or more in ore under the 3.6 mile stretch it owns in the Mother Lode. And with most of about three dozen local, state and federal permits already in hand, its new Lincoln Mine could be producing gold as early as next year.But Sutter Gold will not be the first to get back in the game in California. In addition to the Briggs Mine, which last year produced some 25,000 ounces of gold — or about $30 million worth — there is the Mesquite Mine, in Imperial County on the Mexican border, which reopened in 2008. In 2010, that mine outstripped company estimates to produce nearly 170,000 ounces of gold.Both the Briggs and Mesquite projects are open-pit mines. But here in the Sierra foothills, where the discovery of nuggets in 1848 set off the global rush of prospectors to California, miners are headed back underground. In addition to the Lincoln Mine, plans are afoot to reopen the Idaho-Maryland mine in Grass Valley, a family-friendly area 50 miles northeast of Sacramento.That mine — now flooded — has not had hard hats in it since 1956, but a Canadian company is convinced that more than one million ounces of gold were left behind. “This was a world-class ore body,” said David Watkinson, chief executive of the Emgold Mining Corporation, which is spearheading the project.The Idaho-Maryland project is further from being shovel-ready than the Lincoln Mine: pumping out more than 50 years of water will take time, after all, as does completing a variety of environmental impact reports and permitting processes. And the prospect of a newly opened mine has also been met with opposition from some local activists, whose worries are rooted in both the legacy of the first Gold Rush — including contaminated and sediment-filled rivers and hillsides denuded by hydraulic mining — and by more modern quality-of-life concerns like traffic, noise and water rights.“We’d be looking at reopening a mine in the middle of a city,” said Ralph Silberstein, the president of a grass-roots group called Citizens Looking at the Impacts of Mining in Grass Valley (or Claim-GV). “Which is not a good idea.”Like many of the other towns in the Mother Lode, Grass Valley has long since moved its economy away from mining toward things like software and tourism. The Gold Rush itself peaked in 1852, according to the state’s Department of Conservation, when nearly four million ounces were discovered in California. By 1971, when the nation went off the gold standard, less than 2,000 ounces were produced in California.But the rebound in price has led to a rebound in production. Domestic gold mine production in 2010 increased for the first time in a decade, according to the United States Geological Survey. Nevada is by far the largest gold-producing state, producing roughly four times that of all other states combined.Early California prospectors used pans and their hands to find nuggets in freezing cold streams. Methods soon became more intrusive, however, with machinery and dynamite being used to dig into hard rock and lethal chemicals like mercury and cyanide used to help process the crushed ore.And while today’s methods are safer, Izzy Martin, chief executive of the Sierra Fund, a nonprofit group devoted to preservation of the Sierra Nevada, says there are several challenges to mining old mines, including what previous companies might have left behind.“There’s a lot of toxic materials in there,” Ms. Martin said. “And you have to clean it up.”Such processes can be expensive, particularly in an environmentally attuned state like California. And the worry, Ms. Martin said, is that companies could abandon the work halfway. “And then we’ll be left with this gigantic eyesore,” she said.For its part, Emgold says its mine will be “a forward-thinking, environmentally responsible business,” which will provide jobs and tax dollars for the local economy. Water from the mine will be treated before it is returned to a local creek, the company says, and some of the mine’s waste rock will even be used to make another product: tile.And while the Gold Rush miners swarmed the region in a near-lawless crush, Mr. Watkinson says today’s deliberate pace of exploration, permitting and local approval — the Idaho-Maryland project has been in the works on and off for nearly two decades — has made the hunt for nuggets seem almost dull.“The concept of a ‘gold rush’ is no longer applicable into today’s world,” Mr. Watkinson said. “All anyone can expect to see is resurgence, not a rush.”That said, there is an undeniable romance surrounding the idea of gold in places like Sutter Creek, a picturesque town of 3,000 where there is a Eureka Street, a Gold Dust Trail and Oro Madre Way.The Lincoln Mine itself sits just off Highway 49, a reference to the year — 1849 — when the first Gold Rush kicked into high gear. Sutter Gold Mining hopes to break ground this year on its new mill — designed to look like an old mill, per a requirement with the county.The actual mine will be built out from an existing tunnel that is currently used for tours, a popular attraction drawing some 50,000 visitors a year. But Mr. Cochrane says a mine could be even more lucrative; engineers, using calculations made with modern surveying equipment as well as historic mine records, believe there is nearly 700,000 ounces still in the ground.On a recent tour, Mr. Cochrane showed off several veins of quartz, flecked with what he said could be either gold — or its deceptive cousin, iron pyrite. Once the mine is fully operational — probably by 2012 — he expects dozens of miners to be blasting into those veins.“They’re our friends,” he said of the quartz veins. “Because that’s where the gold is.”'"
"'11-02-11,'1','Shares on Wall Street were lower Thursday as investors weighed disappointing earnings news against an encouraging report on jobs. Technology shares led the early decline.The Labor Department said 383,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the lowest level in nearly three years. That raised some hope that companies are slowly beginning to hire again. Yet economists noted that applications would need to fall consistently to 375,000 or below to indicate a significant and steady decline in the unemployment rate.And the Commerce Department said that businesses at the wholesale level added to inventories in December even as demand for their products slowed. The expectation is that rising demand from businesses will keep factories humming.Wholesale businesses increased inventories 1 percent in December, pushing the total to $430.5 billion, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Economists consider that a healthy level for inventories. It is 11.4 percent above the low reached in September 2009 when companies were reducing their stockpiles in response to a recession.Sales at the wholesale level rose 0.4 percent in December, a smaller than expected increase and the poorest showing since last July. However, the December advance followed a strong 1.9 percent rise in November.'"
"'11-02-11,'1','But Versailles has the requisite snob appeal, with its palace within walking distance of the proposed location on a former military base. Either Gonesse or Marne-la-Vallée would allow the federation to own its site outright instead of settling for a long-term lease.The three alternatives offer huge increases in acreage and elbow room for a tournament site that is the smallest of the four Grand Slams and whose walkways can often seem as crowded as a subway car at rush hour.Still, Paris is Paris, which may sound trite but makes perfect sense to those who come from afar to watch continental Europe’s most prestigious tournament and enjoy the scenery and cafe culture.And it would also be an undeniable pity to lose the house that the Four Musketeers built.The musketeers were Henri Cochet, René Lacoste, Jean Borotra and the doubles specialist Jacques Brugnon. It was their Davis Cup victory for France over Bill Tilden and the United States in 1927 that created the need for Roland Garros stadium.Named for a French aviator (who liked rugby better), the stadium was built in less than a year for the 1928 Davis Cup finals, and it has remained, through multiple makeovers and expansions, the home of French tennis and of its signature event. Generations of leading French players — from Yannick Noah to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga — have lived on site at the national training center during their apprenticeships. Noah even won the French Open in 1983, although no Frenchman since has mustered the combination of great talent and good fortune necessary to join him.There are more than 80 years of memories at Roland Garros: Cochet being carried in triumph after beating Tilden in 1928 to defend the Cup; Bjorn Borg patrolling the baseline on his way to six French Open titles; Martina Hingis petulantly crossing to Steffi Graf’s side of the court on her way to unraveling in the 1999 women’s final; Gustavo Kuerten spontaneously drawing a heart in the clay to commemorate a comeback victory in 2001; and Rafael Nadal crushing Roger Federer in straight sets in 2008.Nadal, a five-time French Open champion, has repeatedly made it clear that he is against the tournament’s moving, emphasizing that it would lose some of its soul.But Justine Henin, the retired Belgian who won the women’s title four times, takes a more nuanced approach.“I have a hard time imagining Roland Garros anywhere else, but I think it’s definitely true that the site needs to grow,” she said. “The players and the spectators suffer because it’s too small. They have to find a solution.“Can it grow where it is? That’s what everybody wants. But other tournaments have left and gone somewhere else. Maybe Roland Garros will do it, too, even though it will leave me with twinges of regret.”Nostalgia has hardly been much of a trump card in Grand Slam tennis. The United States Open left the West Side Tennis Club in the Forest Hills section of Queens for a bigger, more soulless site in Flushing Meadows in 1978. The Australian Open was held in other cities before it settled in Melbourne at the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club, only to pull up stakes and move to a new facility in Melbourne’s city center in 1988. Even Wimbledon — yes, Wimbledon — moved from Worple Road to its current grounds in 1922 and has been on a modernization kick recently that has involved the destruction of multiple show courts, including the atmospheric No. 1 court.So Nadal and other traditionalists should have no illusions this weekend.The French Open certainly could move. If it stays, the plan is to build a retractable roof over the main Philippe Chatrier stadium, and the Paris municipal authorities have approved a proposal that would permit the tournament to expand from its current 21 acres to about 33, and allow construction of a small stadium in the adjacent botanical gardens, les Serres d’Auteuil.This has hardly gone unopposed in a city where grand architectural projects — including Frank Gehry’s latest — routinely run into trouble. Though Roland Garros dates to 1928, the gardens date to 1761, and more than 35,000 people have signed an online petition to defend it against tennis intruders.“We fear that a building project like this will denature and disfigure this site,” the French singer Françoise Hardy wrote in a commentary in the French newspaper Le Monde, urging city authorities to let the tournament depart.Delanoë and his assistants have argued that the building plans respect the gardens, that the only greenhouses to be demolished will be without historical value and that all the exotic plants will be protected. “Not one leaf will be damaged,” Delanoë assured Le Figaro.Perhaps not, but there are no such debates in the spacious suburbs, at least not yet.'"

"'11-02-12,'0','“The failure to fully check records before granting priestly faculties is a violation of archdiocesan policy,” Cardinal Mahony said in a statement. “We owe it to victims and to all our faithful to make absolutely certain that all of our child protection policies and procedures are scrupulously followed.”Father O’Loghlen had sex on several occasions with Julie Malcolm in the 1960s while she was a student at Bishop Amat High School in nearby La Puente, Ms. Malcolm said. Nearly three decades after the abuse ended, Father O’Loghlen tried to reach Ms. Malcolm, who was then living in Phoenix.After receiving several phone messages from Father O’Loghlen, Ms. Malcolm filed a complaint with the Diocese of Phoenix and later filed a lawsuit against the priest and his religious order, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. In 1999, she settled the lawsuit for $100,000, Ms. Malcolm said.“I am deeply sorry for our becoming involved and readily accept the fact that I was the responsible one in our relationship,” Father O’Loghlen said in a five-page handwritten letter dated June 23, 1996. “Clearly, I was the one in power position. If I had not made a move nothing would have happened between us. I sincerely hope that there were some moments of joy for you in our relationship, but ultimately it caused you much significant pain.”Father O’Loghlen goes on to say that since Ms. Malcolm filed her complaint, he has undergone psychological evaluations, which determined that he is “not a pedophile” or a “sexual predator.” But, he adds, “I do have a sexual addiction.”Copies of the letter and other documents were provided to The New York Times by Joelle Casteix, the southwest director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, who had received them from Ms. Malcolm.Father O’Loghlen, 74, was ordained in Ireland in 1961. He began teaching at Bishop Amat later that year and remained there for six years. In 1967, around the same time of his involvement with Ms. Malcolm, he moved to Damien High School, a boys’ school nearby, where he was vice principal and principal for more than 10 years.In 1995, Father O’Loghlen became the provincial leader in the western region for the religious order of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. After he contacted Ms. Malcolm in 1996, leaders in the Los Angeles Archdiocese and officials with the religious order based in Rome exchanged several letters.According to copies of those letters, Father O’Loghlen admitted to molesting Ms. Malcolm and told his superiors that he was undergoing counseling. Msgr. Richard Loomis, then the vicar for clergy in Los Angeles, told officials in Rome that he would not remove Father O’Loghlen from the archdiocese but that his service should be limited.Several months later, Monsignor Loomis removed all restrictions on Father O’Loghlen and, in a letter, thanked him for agreeing to serve on the sexual abuse advisory board. He writes that both he and Cardinal Mahony “feel that you will bring valuable insights to the work of the board.”In a deposition in 1999, Father O’Loghlen said he had attended some of the review board’s meetings. Mr. Tamberg said it was not clear why Father O’Loghlen was appointed to the board. Father O’Loghlen remained the provincial for the religious order until 2001, according to the church records. Then, for five years beginning in 2003, he was a pastor in the Philippines.Mr. Tamberg said the provincial, the Rev. Donal McCarthy, who now oversees the religious order in California, wrote to the archdiocese in March 2009, asking that Father O’Loghlen serve as a priest in Los Angeles. The letter included assurances that Father O’Loghlen “manifested no behavioral problems in the past that would indicate that he might deal with minors in an inappropriate manner” and had “never been involved in an incident or exhibited behavior which called into question his fitness or suitability for priestly ministry due to alcohol, substance abuse, sexual misconduct, financial irregularities, or other causes.”He was appointed as an associate pastor in the San Dimas church four months later. Father O’Loghlen also worked at the parish’s elementary school.The archdiocese’s Vicar for Clergy’s Office “did not fully consult” other records of the priest’s “previous assignments in the archdiocese, which would have indicated that he admitted to having had a sexual relationship with a female minor,” Mr. Tamberg said.American bishops adopted a “zero tolerance” policy in 2002 that bars from the ministry any priest who has abused minors. Mr. Tamberg said that the archdiocese had not received any complaints about Father O’Loghlen in his time at the San Dimas church. He said officials would review records to verify that there had been no other errors.Father McCarthy said he could not comment. “I can’t say anything about the placement of a priest, that’s our policy,” he said.John C. Manly, a lawyer for victims in dozens of sexual abuse cases, said Father O’Loghlen’s case was egregious because of his time on the sexual review board. “He was personally selected for a board that is meant to protect people from priests like him,” Mr. Manly said.Ms. Malcolm, now 61, said in an interview that Father O’Loghlen had been her debate coach at Bishop Amat High School and that he was particularly encouraging. Sometime around the time she was 16 years old, she said, Father O’Loghlen, who was around 29 at the time, met her at a home where she was baby-sitting. After a few minutes of sitting on the couch talking, Ms. Malcolm said, Father O’Loghlen kissed her. They began having sex more than a year later, Ms. Malcolm said.“I was so naïve, I thought this was some kind of special treatment,” Ms. Malcolm said. “We would meet somewhere like it was this clandestine romance. We would periodically break up, but he would call and apologize and ask to see me again and I always agreed.”She said she never considered filing a complaint until Father O’Loghlen tried to contact her.'"
"'11-02-12,'0','If Boehner is responsible it would be extremely significant since it would probably be his greatest success to date in the role of speaker of the House.Really, the rest has been pretty much a mess. So far, the new Republican majority hasn’t been able to agree on anything that is not entirely symbolic. In lieu of actual legislation, the House spent the last half of the week debating a measure instructing committees to do oversight on government regulations to see if they’re cost-effective.Which is, actually, their regular job.“Our committee already convened a hearing on this exact topic yesterday,” said Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the, um, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during the ninth hour of debate.But about Lee. Aficionados of political sex scandals have been wondering whether he was shoved out the door too fast. We’ve certainly seen politicians survive scandals worse than trying to score a date while married. I am represented by a congressman who was censured by the House for misdeeds that included not paying his while running the tax committee. I would be absolutely thrilled if the worst thing he’d done over the past few years was misrepresenting his marital status on a BlackBerry.However, it’s one thing to be a would-be adulterer and another to be an incredibly stupid would-be adulterer. In his re-election campaign, Lee bragged about his work providing students with instruction on the hazards of having personal conversations on the Internet. Yet he was working under the assumption that the best way to conduct an extramarital social life is to pretend to be a different person online, while using one’s real name and photograph.Nobody wants to be represented by a person who has to be reminded of the existence of .Lee comes from the suburbs of , and this is the second time in a year that a congressman from upstate New York has had to resign because of a sex scandal. First there was , a Democrat who shared a townhouse with five young, low-paid male staffers and who, when questions arose about groping issues, produced the immortal explanation: “I tickled him until he couldn’t breathe.”In between Massa and Lee, upstate New York produced the Republican candidate for governor, , who spent much of the race apologizing for sending pornographic and racist e-mails, interspersed by explanations of why it took him years to tell his wife that he had fathered an out-of-wedlock daughter. His supporters are reported to be urging him to run for Lee’s suddenly vacant seat.Do you think somebody in upstate New York has disturbed the sacred cemetery of a clan of extremely cranky witch doctors? Honestly, when you’ve got high unemployment, terrible weather and a dwindling population, you should not be stuck with a rapidly revolving cast of horny politicians, too.Finally, we should be pondering whether it’s really such a great thing to have a new generation of legislators that puts a premium on being in good physical shape. Lee, who described himself as a “fit fun and classy guy,” apparently couldn’t wait to ship his potential hookup a deeply incriminating shot of his well-toned body.These people are already dangerously self-satisfied. Maybe we were better off with paunchy, aging guys who had to acknowledge, in their deepest heart, that if they were getting any sexual action at all it was only because they were on the Appropriations Committee.'"

New York City itself almost filed for bankruptcy protection in 1975.You also claim that a bankruptcy option would scare off investors in the bond markets, but do not explain that state bond investors already have to account for the greater risk of a state defaulting on its bonds, which is why California has the worst credit rating and most expensive borrowing costs of any state.A state bankruptcy option would provide a proven, orderly, predictable and equitable process in which the recovery of bondholders and others will be far more secure than in the case of outright default.The writer is press secretary and spokesman for former Speaker Newt Gingrich.'"

"'11-02-12,'0','It has been a lonely few weeks for Mr. Abouelenein, 34, a tidily dressed lover of historic-film epics who was raised by a police officer under Mr. Mubarak and came to New York at 20, trading a promising career as an engineer for a job washing dishes at a restaurant in Times Square. Now, he is heckled by old friends who call him a traitor and accosted by red-faced rivals. This week, he thought of organizing a pro-Mubarak demonstration, but found few willing to join.As tens of thousands of young Egyptians took to the streets of Cairo over the last few weeks, Mr. Abouelenein said he had been consumed by divided loyalties. He insisted that he loved democracy, just like the young Egyptian rebels. But he also insisted that people power had given way to a foolish romanticism and warned that an unsustainable and fragile democracy could tip into dictatorship — or, worse, civil war.Such doom-mongering amid all the euphoria did not win him many friends on Friday. “He’s a kid and he opens his mouth before he thinks,” said Ali El-Sayed, 60, a restaurant owner whom Mr. Abouelenein describes as his older brother. “I am angry at him because he supports Mubarak, and Mubarak is a snake.”The two men nearly came to blows Thursday night at the hookah cafe as they watched Mr. Mubarak’s lengthy speech, which did not include a resignation, and Mr. Abouelenein dared to applaud him as the country’s only hope.“This younger generation in Astoria like Hassan is a lost generation because they have had everything given to them and don’t understand what democracy means,” Mr. Sayed said.But Mr. Abouelenein said it was Mr. Sayed and his fellow Mubarak detractors who were being naïve, arguing that history was on his side. “It is easy for Egyptians in New York to speak loudly about freedom,” he said. “They are not the ones who are going to die.”Mr. Abouelenein parsed his position. He said that he wanted Mr. Mubarak to eventually leave, but in his own time. He argued that Egypt had undergone a revolution before, in 1952, under former President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who also had promised modernization and socialist reform, only to transform the country into an autocracy.The downfall of Mr. Mubarak, Mr. Abouelenein said, leaves a nation of 80 million in the hands of an untrustworthy military, which he said had promised to address the demands of the protesters but was unschooled in the ways of democracy.And he said he was deeply worried that a power vacuum would clear the way for the ascent of the Muslim Brotherhood, a group that has long been banned by Mr. Mubarak and is considered by many in the West to be a radical menace. He is familiar with it, he said, because his uncle had been a leader of the group.“I am worried that Egypt will turn into Afghanistan, that girls won’t be able to go to school and will be forced to wear burqas, that we will end up with a country run by extremists,” Mr. Abouelenein said. “Mr. Mubarak was America’s son, and we had good relations with America.

"'11-02-12,'0','I once asked an art dealer how he determined whether someone was an outsider artist, and he offered this criterion: anyone who called up and said he or she was an outsider artist was immediately disqualified. In his view, outsider artists don’t self-identify and they don’t operate telephones.Standing inside the 19th annual Outsider Art Fair at 7 West 34th Street in Manhattan on Thursday evening, Colin Rhodes, an Australian art historian who’s written a book on the subject, disagreed. “Pathology is not the defining criterion,” he said. For him, an outsider artist is not an amateur, just someone working outside the regular art world structures.In any case, the mentally ill, the developmentally disabled and the self-taught generally rule the field — the dearth of art by prisoners at these fairs is a continual surprise; they’re an extremely creative, productive and expanding population — and their stories haunt wall labels throughout the 33 exhibitors’ booths. But this is a strong fair whose work begs to be considered along other lines.There are, for instance, pieces characterized by striking or unusual materials, like Jim Work’s drawings of farms and rural roads done in crayon on opened-up paper grocery bags, at the Pardee Collection; or George Paterson’s carved skateboards, which look like tribal objects, at Cavin-Morris. David Butler’s cut-and-pounded-tin birds and creatures, on view at Gilley’s Gallery and Ricco/Maresca, were made to decorate his yard in New Orleans or hang in his windows, casting distinctive shadows into the interior of his home.Outsider art also accommodates the late bloomer. Aaron Birnbaum, a retired New York tailor, started painting at 65. His lovely “Two Peacocks in Tree” from 1985 at Maxwell Projects is framed by painted pieces of a wooden crib found in the street. Giorgos Rigas began painting scenes of the Greek countryside from memory at 56. His Grandma Moses-like canvases are hung salon-style at C. Grimaldis.'"
"'11-02-12,'0','MONTCLAIR, N.J. — It’s not every artist who will list prominently in her biography that her national nickname is “a permanent irritation.” But so the South African choreographer Robyn Orlin proclaims in program notes for “Walking next to our shoes ... Intoxicated by strawberries and cream ... We enter continents without knocking ...,” which had its American premiere on Thursday night as part of the Montclair State University’s Peak Performances series.As that biographical detail and the (typically) ridiculously long title indicate, Ms. Orlin isn’t out to ingratiate or simply entertain, but to get in people’s faces in order to tell them very specific things. Though “Walking” (2009) may seem like an inscrutable title, the references in this hourlong dance-theater work are pointed, and fraught: poverty, AIDS and emigration.Ms. Orlin uses seduction and irritation in equal measure to make her positions clear — sometimes too clear; a little more ambiguity wouldn’t be amiss at times. Though based in Berlin and clearly influenced by European dance-theater traditions, she is working with South African artists, including Phuphuma Love Minus, an all-male isicathamiya choir (pronounced issi-KAT-ah-mee-ya, this is a form of Zulu a cappella).These men are gorgeous harmonizers, their soaring songs syncopated by synchronized stamping dances and punctuated by thrilling calls, and it’s easy to be lulled into blissful reverie by their music before you realize that they are singing about disease and warfare.Phuphuma Love Minus is joined by the opera, gospel and pop singer Ann Masina, a formidably large woman with an even bigger voice; the powerful Xolisile Bongwana; and Vusumuzi Kunene, a swanker, or participant in stylized dress competitions.And then there is Thulani Zwane, the fly in all of this fancy ointment, who screeches and preens, demanding attention be directed at him, not at the otherwise smooth parade of sounds and sights.

"'11-02-12,'0','At least at the outset, the alliance may “Microsoft will have the rationale to really double down with its investment in the smartphone platform and ecosystem,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC.One measure, in addition to market share, of how far Microsoft trails in building that ecosystem is the number of software applications developers have created for the Microsoft Windows Phone 7 operating system. The Microsoft applications store, though growing rapidly in recent months, has about 8,000 applications, Mr. Hilwa said. By contrast, more than 350,000 applications have been developed for Apple’s iPhone.“It’s a big win for Microsoft today,” said Pete Cunningham, an analyst with Canalys, a research firm in Reading, England. “Windows Phone 7 is no one’s priority. But now Microsoft has a leading vendor committed to use the platform. For Nokia, the big question is how quickly can the company execute on this. That has been one of the major issues.”Nokia held meetings with Google and considered Android, Mr. Elop said in an interview, but was concerned that Google, not Nokia, would benefit from a alliance. Android, which Google gives away to phone makers, is widely used by Samsung, LG, HTC, Huawei, Motorola and Sony Ericsson.Nokia risked becoming a commodity maker of mobile phones by ceding software to Google, Mr. Elop said. An alliance with Google, he said, “felt like giving up, not like fighting back.” With Microsoft, Mr. Elop said, “this is now a three-way horse race.”Microsoft, analysts said, most likely offered Nokia more generous support than Google in paying for engineering assistance, revenue-sharing terms on mobile advertisements, search and map services. In 2007, Nokia paid $8 billion for Navteq, a mobile mapping service, which Google undermined by offering Google Maps free.“It looks like a good deal for Microsoft, but far riskier for Nokia,” said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “It’s choosing a new platform and an unproven one in Microsoft’s smartphone software.”Dropping Symbian, Nokia’s operating system, will be temporarily disruptive to Nokia’s product plans. About 200 million phones around the world use Symbian and the company expects to sell another 150 million more before halting its development and switching to Windows. Investors were skeptical of the Nokia-Microsoft partnership. Nokia shares dropped 14.2 percent in Europe. Microsoft shares closed down 0.9 percent.Mark Sue, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who attended the investors’ conference where the announcement was made, compared the alliance to “two unpopular kids in high school with rich parents suddenly becoming prom king and queen.” He added: “It was clear that Nokia needed to do something different. But there is a lot of skepticism about whether this will work.”During a joint interview with Mr. Elop, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, dismissed the initial market reaction and skepticism surrounding the alliance. “Objectively, is today a better day or a worse day for Microsoft?” Mr. Ballmer asked. “Objectively, is today a better day or a worse day for Nokia? Ding! It’s a better day for both. So whatever people thought yesterday, they should think something a lot more positive today.”Mr. Elop also sidetracked Nokia’s one-year collaboration with the chip maker Intel, called MeeGo, to produce a new generation of Nokia smartphones. It will become a long-term open-source project designed to develop new kinds of devices, Mr. Elop said. The collaboration failed to produce a cellphone in its first year.Nokia’s share of the global handset market, once more than 50 percent, is now falling rapidly as its rivals close in. According to the Gartner research firm, Nokia’s global share fell to 29 percent in 2010 from 36 percent a year earlier as Apple and Research In Motion, maker of BlackBerry, both posted gains.The announcement left some big questions unanswered. Mr. Elop declined to say when Nokia and Microsoft would sell the first handsets, later clarifying in a presentation to analysts that significant numbers would be ready by 2012. He also said he was not prepared to say if and when Nokia and Microsoft would collaborate on a tablet computer.He said the alliance would coincide with “significant” job cuts, the scope of which he said remained to be determined after talks with its unions. Nokia employed 132,427 people at year-end.During his two-hour presentation with financial analysts, Mr. Elop, who usually comes across as earnest and serious, had the audience laughing when explaining the new organizational chart of his leadership team, with his name at top. “If this works, I will be C.E.O.,” he joked, pointing to his name.'"

"'11-02-13,'0','“I almost had a heart attack out there,” he said, adding: “It’s a big game for us. And we understood the magnitude of the game. So my emotions came out a lot, from a cheerleading standpoint.”Stoudemire said the toe was injured in a collision with the Los Angeles Lakers’ Ron Artest during Friday’s loss. He had trouble putting pressure on the toe Saturday morning, but the team did not reveal the injury until 45 minutes before tip-off.The injury is not considered serious, and Stoudemire said he “should be ready to go” on Wednesday, when the Knicks host the Atlanta Hawks in their last game before the All-Star break. He seemed confident he would play in the All-Star Game next Sunday in Los Angeles.For one night, the Knicks did not appear to be rattled by trade rumors or lacking focus or swagger — the presumed causes of their recent tailspin. The offense was reasonably fluid, and the defense sufficient, or enough at least to beat the Nets (17-38).Chandler had been slumping for weeks, in part because of a calf injury and, presumably, because he kept hearing his name in Carmelo Anthony trade rumors. Although he did not shoot well (8 for 21), he was assertive and steady in 41 minutes 40 seconds as Stoudemire’s stand-in.“Maybe it helps him to get his rhythm back,” Coach Mike D’Antoni said. “You could just see him getting more confident in his game. We need him back to where he was, and tonight was a pretty good indication, especially the second half.”Chandler said that he felt fine and that the rumors had not bothered him. He said his resurgence was just a matter of opportunity.“Ray just kept feeding me,” he said, referring to Raymond Felton, who had 11 assists. “That’s a way to get hot, if you’re touching the ball so many times.”Toney Douglas added 19 points off the bench as the Knicks beat the Nets for the second time this season. Devin Harris led the Nets with 22 points. Brook Lopez had 19 points and 4 rebounds.The Knicks (27-26) had lost 11 of their last 15 games, sapping their confidence and threatening their playoff position. The victory kept them from slipping below .500 for the first time since late November.After wiping out a 9-point deficit in the fourth quarter, the Nets took their last lead, 89-87, with an Anthony Morrow 3-pointer. Chandler and Fields made consecutive 3-pointers to restore the Knicks’ lead. Mozgov, who was in foul trouble all night, made his biggest contribution, with a putback and a free throw for a 96-90 lead.The Nets pulled within 5 points with 1:53 left, but Fields put the game away with his 3-pointer from the left corner. As it swished, he kept his hand up, then glanced into the crowd and finally skipped back up the court.“A little shimmying?” Fields said sheepishly. “Yeah, I don’t usually get like that. We’re going to have to tone that down.”Fields leads the N.B.A. in fourth-quarter 3-point percentage, having converted 20 of 31 shots (64.5 percent) — “a pretty good stat for a rookie,” D’Antoni said.Without Stoudemire, the Knicks quickly gravitated to the arc and hit 16 of 34 attempts. Fields, Chandler, Douglas and Bill Walker hit three apiece.Ronny Turiaf returned from a three-game absence and helped stabilize the frontcourt. He played just 10 minutes but made an impact with 6 points, 2 rebounds and 4 fouls.The Nets held a distinct size advantage, with Lopez and Derrick Favors starting in the frontcourt, but rarely took advantage. Favors had 14 rebounds but only 9 points.“This is a big win for us,” D’Antoni said. “Because without Amar’e, and with the way we’re going and everything involved, this is a good win.”'"
"'11-02-13,'0','The latest chapter in the feud between Gov. Rick Perry and Representative Lloyd Doggett over $830 million in federal money for education unfolded Tuesday, when, in his State of the State address, the governor called out a “certain Texas congressman” for singling out Texas “for punishment in pursuit of his own agenda.”The dispute between Mr. Perry and Mr. Doggett, Democrat of Austin, began in August, when Congress passed legislation to give $10 billion in aid to allow states to hire and retain teachers. Tacked onto the law was a measure proposed by Mr. Doggett and supported by other Democrats — applicable only to Texas — that requires the governor to offer his assurance that the money will be used to “supplement and not supplant” state education financing through 2013.Six months later, Texas is one of only two states that has not received money from the fund. Attorney General Greg Abbott filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education to claim the money — without complying with the Doggett provision — and the state’s Congressional delegation has split along party lines.Mr. Abbott argues that the provision violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution because it imposes a requirement on Texas that is not imposed on any other state. In its court papers, the federal government says the condition is there for a reason: in 2009 the state used federal stimulus money intended for education to offset its state spending.At issue is the Texas-only “maintenance of effort” clause. The clauses — intended to ensure that federal grant money goes to the programs it intends to support — are a common feature in applications for federal education dollars, according to the Department of Education’s brief to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. If the governor signed the application and the Legislature was later unable to fulfill his promise, it is unlikely that the state would face legal action from the federal government, said Tom Brandt, a Dallas lawyer who represents school districts and local governments.'"
"'11-02-13,'0','The great-grandson — Tyrus Charles Brogan Cobb — said the name had opened a window on baseball that he would not have looked into otherwise, including a visit to the Hall of Fame.“I did a lot of reading about old baseball players that were contemporaries of Ty Cobb,” he said. “Just being connected to a part of history got me interested in research.”The elder Cobb was born in Narrows, Ga., in 1886 when the South was strictly segregated. Along with a reputation for a surly temperament and an aggressive playing style, he was widely regarded as a racist.“I’ve got no qualms with how Ty Cobb led his life,” his great-grandson said. “From what I’ve heard from my dad, who knew him really well as a grandpa, he was a very generous, loving man.”The younger Cobb plays on an Occidental team that includes three black and three Latino players.“He was born in Jim Crow Georgia,” Cobb said. “It was a completely different world than living in California these days, which is such a diverse area and people are just comfortable being around people that aren’t the same skin color or from the same background.”His namesake retired comfortably, having invested heavily in Coca-Cola and General Electric stock. He died in 1961 at 74.“They don’t know he made his money from investing,” Cobb said. “He retired to Atherton, Calif., which is a very nice area. He had a big house in Tahoe right on the lake, and that was all from being an astute businessman, even though he never went to college and never got much of a formal education.”Cobb is considering majoring in economics and possibly attending business school.He played three sports at Sacred Heart Prep in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was a double-figure scorer and rebounder on the basketball team, and a first baseman and left-handed pitcher on the baseball team.“If I was ever just playing around with friends, it was always throwing a basketball,” he said. “I love basketball because it’s five guys working together to accomplish one goal. Baseball is a lot more individual.”The Tigers (11-10)entered the weekend having won five of six. Cobb has played in all 20 games, starting three, for Occidental, a 2,100-student liberal arts college where President Obama spent two years before transferring to Columbia.“When he’s on the court, good things happen,” Newhall said. “He’s just kind of clutch. He’s not overwhelmed by anything. Sometimes, freshmen will come in and talk a big game, and Ty didn’t say a word, he just worked and worked.”Occidental’s baseball team began its season last week, and Coach Jason Hawkins has reason to be optimistic.Cobb talked to him recently about possibly pitching. He is torn between focusing on basketball year-round and unleashing his fastball.“When the weather turns, you smell the fresh grass,” Cobb said, smiling. “It’s like instinct to be playing baseball. I miss being out there, but I’m still happier playing basketball only. That was my choice.”Growing up in the Bay Area made Cobb a San Francisco Giants fan, and his favorite player is Barry Bonds, who like his great-grandfather remains a flash point even in retirement.“For all the bad rep he got, I really liked watching Barry Bonds play,” Cobb said. “He had one of the best, most compact swings in baseball and is a guy that’s really good to imitate on that level.”'"
"'11-02-13,'0','The idea would be to base the future kilogram on a fundamental physical constant, not an inconstant object, said Dr. Peter J. Mohr, a theoretical physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. “We want to have something that’s not changing, so that we can have a stable system of measurement,” he said.The kilogram is the last base unit of measurement to be expressed in terms of a manufactured artifact. (Its cousin, the international prototype of the meter, was retired from active duty in 1960, when scientists redefined the meter. They redefined it again in 1983; a meter is now officially “the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second,” for those who would like to try it at home.)Scientists now have similarly bold plans for the kilogram, and indeed for several other base units of measure. A draft resolution to be considered at the General Conference of Weights and Measures in October includes new and improved definitions for the ampere, the mole and the kelvin.“This would be the biggest change in metrology since the metric system was introduced during the French Revolution,” Dr. Quinn said.Which is all very exciting and very revolutionary. But it is easier said than done. The proposed new kilogram definition is based on a physical quantity known as Planck’s constant — a constant beloved by quantum physicists but not yet as precisely expressed as it might be.Half a dozen teams around the world have been toiling for years to measure Planck’s constant to an acceptably low degree of uncertainty. A resolution could take 5 to 10 more years, or maybe not, said Prof. Michael Kühne, the current director of the measures bureau. “While everyone hopes the experiments will yield excellent results, I don’t have a crystal ball.”None of this is meant to denigrate the ur-kilogram, still resting in its safe, beneath three cheese-plate-style bell jars. Until a new definition takes effect, the prototype remains the Platonic ideal — so precious that it is has been removed from the safe only three times in its life (to be measured against all the copies), so singular that the French call it Le Grand K, and so iconic that writers of scientific papers sometimes designate it simply by the Gothic letter K.“Despite all its shortcomings, the reason it hasn’t been redefined before now is that nobody has come up with something better,” said Professor Kühne, who has a fetching model of the prototype in his office. (He also has one of the keys to the safe, which he keeps in a different safe. The second key is held by the president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures; the third is in the French National Archives.)There are about 100 working copies of the international prototype in countries around the world. These are periodically brought back to Sèvres to be compared with the original.This is a fraught and delicate undertaking.Because of a legendarily horrifying incident in which one of the national kilograms was wrested from its casings by a customs agent and exposed to a hostile environment teeming with airborne detritus, not to mention the agent’s organic matter, countries are advised to ship their kilograms in diplomatic pouches.Dr. Mohr and his colleague Dr. David Newell, who was recently charged with escorting the American kilogram to Sèvres, opted for a backpack and an official Do Not Touch Our Kilogram letter from the standards and technology institute. They made it through, after some harrowing moments.“At one point, there were about a dozen people standing around the screen looking at it,” Dr. Mohr said of the kilogram. “Of course, it’s platinum, so the X-rays can’t go through it, and you can’t see inside it.”The most obvious argument for the prototype’s eventual obsolescence is the tautological underpinning of its existence, which calls to mind the question, “How long is a piece of string?”Because a kilogram is defined as whatever the mass of the prototype is, it does not, for definitional purposes, matter if the prototype loses mass, or indeed packs on the micrograms by spending all its free time gorging on éclairs: it is still a kilogram. Like Norma Desmond in “Sunset Boulevard,” the prototype could plausibly argue that it has not gotten lighter — the other kilograms have gotten heavier.The new definition should render unnecessary such frustrating intellectual exercises. Even still, it is a little sad to contemplate the demotion of the prototype, which has served so valiantly for so many years and which now seems destined to spend its retirement on a shelf somewhere, its glory days behind it.Dr. Quinn did not seem very sentimental about the prospect.“The old kilogram will still exist,” he said. “But a fundamental constant is much more fundamental than an artifact in a vault.”'"
"'11-02-13,'0','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Reuters) — A Pakistani court on Saturday issued an arrest warrant for former President Pervez Musharraf in connection with the 2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto, a former prime minister and his rival.The authorities did not provide details of their accusations against Mr. Musharraf, who left under the threat of impeachment in 2008 and has been living in exile in London and Dubai.In October, Mr. Musharraf apologized to Pakistan for what he characterized as mistakes he made in office, and he said he would return to the country as the new head of a political party in time for elections due by 2013.The arrest warrant might keep him from returning to the country, where Ms. Bhutto’s husband, Asif Ali Zardari, is now president and struggling to cope with multiple challenges, including a stubborn Taliban insurgency and a stagnant economy.Ms. Bhutto, who was an opponent of Mr. Musharraf’s rule, was killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack after an election rally in the city of Rawalpindi on Dec. 27, 2007, weeks after she returned to Pakistan following years in self-imposed exile.A spokesman for Mr. Musharraf, Mohammad Ali Saif, called the accusation against the former leader baseless, adding that Mr. Musharraf is accused of not providing adequate security for Ms. Bhutto.'"
"'11-02-13,'0','WASHINGTON — Last Saturday afternoon, President Obama got a jarring update from his national security team: With restive crowds of young Egyptians demanding President Hosni Mubarak’s immediate resignation, Frank G. Wisner, Mr. Obama’s envoy to Cairo, had just told a Munich conference that Mr. Mubarak was indispensable to Egypt’s democratic transition.Mr. Obama was furious, and it did not help that his secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Wisner’s key backer, was publicly warning that any credible transition would take time — even as Mr. Obama was demanding that change in Egypt begin right away.Seething about coverage that made it look as if the administration were protecting a dictator and ignoring the pleas of the youths of Cairo, the president “made it clear that this was not the message we should be delivering,” said one official who was present. He told Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to take a hard line with his Egyptian counterpart, and he pushed Senator John Kerry to counter the message from Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Wisner when he appeared on a Sunday talk show the next day.The trouble in sending a clear message was another example of how divided Mr. Obama’s foreign policy team remains. A president who himself is often torn between idealism and pragmatism was navigating the counsel of a traditional foreign policy establishment led by Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Biden and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, against that of a next-generation White House staff who worried that the American preoccupation with stability could put a historic president on the wrong side of history.In interviews, participants described those tensions, as well as offering the first descriptions of Mr. Obama’s two difficult phone calls imploring Mr. Mubarak to take the protesters’ demands seriously. In those conversations, as Mr. Obama pressed Mr. Mubarak without demanding that he resign, the embattled Egyptian leader pushed back hard, arguing that the protests were the work of the Muslim Brotherhood and agents of Iran, a contention the Americans dismissed.The officials said the hardest of those conversations came on Tuesday, Feb. 1, barely an hour after Mr. Mubarak announced he would not run for president again. In Mr. Obama’s view, Mr. Mubarak still had not gone far enough. Describing the conversation, one senior official quoted Mr. Obama as telling the Egyptian president, “It is time to present to the people of Egypt its next government.” He added, “The future of your country is at stake.”Mr. Mubarak replied, “Let’s talk in the next three or four days.” He added, “And when we talk, you will find that I was right.” The two men never talked again.However direct the conversations between the presidents, the public stance taken by the United States fed the perception that there was confusion on the Potomac. Time and again, the administration appeared to tack back and forth, alternately describing Mr. Mubarak as a stalwart ally and then a foe of meaningful political change. Twelve days ago, Mr. Obama was announcing that Mr. Mubarak had to begin the transition “now”; last weekend his chief diplomat was telling reporters that removing Mr. Mubarak too hastily could undermine Egypt’s transition to democracy.Inside the White House, the same aides who during his campaign pushed Mr. Obama to challenge the assumptions of the foreign policy establishment were now arguing that his failure to side with the protesters could be remembered with bitterness by a rising generation.Those onetime campaign aides included Denis McDonough, the sharp-tongued deputy national security adviser; Benjamin J. Rhodes, who wrote the president’s seminal address to the Islamic world in Cairo in June 2009; and Samantha Power, the outspoken Pulitzer Prize winner and human rights advocate who was once drummed out of the campaign for describing Mrs. Clinton as a monster.All agreed that Egypt, facing a historic popular revolt, needed to begin a genuine transition to democracy. The debate was how to deploy American influence on a volatile and fast-changing situation.Despite the fervor on the streets of Cairo, and Mr. Obama’s occasional tough language, the president always took a pragmatic view of how to use America’s limited influence over change in Egypt. He was not in disagreement with the positions of Mr. Wisner and Mrs. Clinton about how long transition would take. But he apparently feared that saying so openly would reveal that the United States was not in total sync with the protesters, and was indeed putting its strategic interests first. Making that too clear would not only anger the crowds, it could give Mr. Mubarak a reason to cling to power and a pretext to crush the revolution.It was not only Mr. Wisner’s and Mrs. Clinton’s comments that threw the administration off message. Mr. Biden told an interviewer that he did not believe Mr. Mubarak was a dictator — words he quickly regretted, officials say.As the administration struggled to craft a message, it was playing to multiple audiences — the crowds in Tahrir Square, neighboring allies who feared the instability would spread, and home audiences on the left and the right.Mrs. Clinton and some of her State Department subordinates wanted to move cautiously, and reassure allies they were not being abandoned, in part influenced by daily calls from Israel, Saudi Arabia and others who feared an Egypt without Mr. Mubarak would destabilize the entire region. Some were nervous because they perceived that the United States had been a cheerleader for the Tunisia protesters.'"
"'11-02-13,'0','Now, results are in: Fetal surgery, while increasing premature births and causing tearing at some mother’s incisions, made babies more likely to walk and less likely to have neurological problems or need shunts to drain brain fluid.Besides the groundbreaking results, the seven-year study spotlights ethical dilemmas in research.The surgery was becoming popular in the 1990s, even appearing on a Time magazine cover, and some experts believed that it might eventually eliminate most symptoms. But given the risks, others wanted proof that it was better than postnatal surgery.“There were no systematic data regarding safety and efficacy,” said Dr. Jeremy Sugarman, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University who participated in early discussions. “Many things we believe to be true and right and appropriate ultimately are shown to be harmful and ineffective.” Spina bifida researchers believed that few women would participate if the surgery were available elsewhere, so they persuaded all but the three hospitals in the trial to stop doing the procedure, an unusual agreement.“I frankly have a lot of problems when a group of physicians get together and in effect shut down everything so they can have a trial,” said Baruch A. Brody, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor College of Medicine. “For physicians who believe in it, why should they be pressured into stopping? For families who believe they should have the surgery, why should they be told they can’t?”But several ethicists praised the pause. “It’s impressive to see that kind of collaboration,” said Dr. Jeffrey R. Botkin, a pediatric ethicist at the University of Utah. “The sophistication surgeons need to do this is so high, it makes sense to answer research questions by allowing it only at a few centers.”The surgery proved beneficial enough that an independent monitoring board stopped the trial, not wanting to deny more women the opportunity for prenatal surgery. But stopping trials early sometimes limits the information researchers can collect that might benefit future patients.Monitoring boards “walk a very fine line,” said Dr. Steven Goodman, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins and editor of the journal Clinical Trials. “At what point is the benefit of getting more information outweighed by the consequences of not releasing results and continuing to randomize patients?”In some trials, if one treatment proves superior, other participants can then receive that treatment. But with prenatal surgery, that isn’t possible, said Jeffrey Kahn, director of the University of Minnesota’s bioethics center. “Some people are accepting risk for the benefit of those who will come after them.”Still, regardless of therapy, “people who enroll in clinical trials, for the most part, do better than people who don’t, because care is controlled and monitored,” Dr. Goodman said. “You simply can’t go back and say, ‘In every trial people who didn’t get the winning therapy were deprived.’ ”Tyson Thomas emerged from prenatal surgery with no need for a shunt and, at 22 months old, uses a walker but is almost walking independently. Zachary Shapiro, 6, has a shunt, walks with braces, and has some attention problems. Both boys, who received their surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, need catheters.Ms. Shapiro, a kindergarten teacher, said of her son, “I do feel like he benefited, even though he didn’t benefit from the actual surgery.”She added, “He benefited from the research that has happened about his disability.”'"

By buying something for $30 that you value at $40, you get $10 of what economists call “consumer surplus.” Similarly, your young neighbor gets $10 of “producer surplus,” because he earns $30 of income by incurring only $20 of cost. Unlike a sports contest, which by necessity has a winner and a loser, a voluntary economic transaction between consenting consumers and producers typically benefits both parties.This example is not as special as it might seem. The gains from trade would be much the same if your neighbor were manufacturing a good — knitting you a scarf, for example — rather than performing a service. And it would be much the same if, instead of living next door, he was several thousand miles away, say, in Shanghai.Listening to the president, you might think that competition from China and other rapidly growing nations was one of the larger threats facing the United States. But the essence of economic exchange belies that description. Other nations are best viewed not as our competitors but as our trading partners. Partners are to be welcomed, not feared. As a general matter, their prosperity does not come at our expense.To be sure, there are exceptions to this rule. When China uses our intellectual property such as software without paying for it, we should view that as a form of theft. And when other nations’ economic growth has side effects on the global environment, as it does when they emit the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, the United States has good reason for concern. But these limited exceptions should not blind us into taking a more generally adversarial approach to international economic relations.During the address, Mr. Obama lamented the fact that many foreign students attended colleges and universities in the United States and then returned to their countries of origin. “As soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us,” he said. “It makes no sense.”The president is right that we should encourage a greater number of highly educated foreigners to migrate here. Because skilled workers pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits, increasing their supply would reduce the fiscal burden on the rest of us. But if these foreign students decide to return home, as many do, we shouldn’t worry that they are competing against us.Instead, we should view higher education in the United States as one of our most successful export industries. The United States has 5 percent of the world’s population but most of the best universities. Is it any wonder that students from many nations flock here to learn? And as they do so, they create opportunities for Americans — from the professors who teach the classes to the grounds crews who maintain the campuses.When the foreign students head home, they take the human capital acquired here to become productive members of their own communities. They spread up-to-date knowledge, so it can foster prosperity everywhere. Some of this knowledge is technological. Some of it concerns business, legal and medical practices. And some is even more fundamental, such as the values of democracy and individual liberty. Nothing could be better for the United States than these thousands of American-trained ambassadors who have seen at first hand the benefits of a free and open society.As we confront the many hard policy choices ahead, let’s prepare for the future. Let’s invest for the future. Let’s be willing to make hard sacrifices for a more prosperous future. But let’s not presume that the future is a game requiring winners and losers.'"
"'11-02-13,'0','Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, says his airline represents the future of mass air travel. In an era when many international carriers are struggling to sustain themselves, Emirates has filled its planes, raised fares and consistently turned a profit. It earned $925 million in the six months ended last Sept. 30, up from $205 million in the year-earlier period.To win over customers, its executives want to bring a bit of glamour back to air travel. On the double-decker Airbus A380s, full bars are standard in business class, and the first-class cabin includes showers. No one pays for food or drinks, of course, on any Emirates flight.So far, Emirates’ success is partly an accident of geography. Roughly four billion people live within an eight-hour flight from here. But to the consternation of rivals, Emirates also enjoys the patronage of Dubai’s rulers, in particular, Sheik Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, who is its chairman. While home-grown airlines in places like Singapore and Hong Kong have also turned those cities into global hubs, Emirates stands apart for the scale of its ambitions.COMPETITORS are fighting back. SkyTeam, the global alliance that includes Delta Air Lines and Air France/KLM, said recently that it would add two airlines — Middle East Airlines, from Lebanon, and Saudi Airlines — to counter Emirates’ dominance in the region.“There is a reason that airlines around the world are afraid of the success of Emirates,” says John Leahy, chief operating officer of Airbus, the European plane maker, referring to Emirates’ mix of quality service, operating efficiency and low costs. “That should strike fear in the hearts of airlines around the world.” Emirates is one of Airbus’s top customers.Over the next two decades, air travel in the Middle East is expected to grow by more than 7 percent a year, outpacing every other region, according to a forecast from Boeing in 2010. Much of that growth will be spurred by Emirates and two other fast-expanding airlines based in the Persian Gulf area: Etihad Airlines, based in Abu Dhabi, and Qatar Airways.Emirates is by far the most ambitious of the three. Its greatest strides have come from building routes to developing countries long neglected by traditional carriers and providing an alternative to local airlines. Instead of connecting through European hubs like London or Frankfurt, all of these new routes run through Dubai.“The legacy carriers still see us as the monster of the Middle East, the bête noir of civil aviation in the 21st century,” says Mr. Clark, 61. “But they won’t accept that the business we are carrying wasn’t theirs anyway. The 21st century is very different from the 20th century.”Emirates, for instance, offers 184 flights a week from Dubai to India, to cities like Ahmedabad, the commercial hub in the state of Gujarat. It flies to 17 cities in Africa and, in China, to Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Guangzhou. It runs two daily flights to Bangkok and nine to Australia.The strategy has prompted a strong reaction from airlines like Air France and Lufthansa of Germany. These carriers hope to persuade their governments to limit Emirates’ access to French and German airports.“Emirates’ strategy is aggressive,” says Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the chief executive of Air France, who complains that Emirates is siphoning off passengers from Europe’s traditional hubs. “Europe is at the center of the global aviation world. It’s the result of aviation history.”Wolfgang Mayrhuber, the C.E.O. of Lufthansa, notes that it took 40 years for Lufthansa to build up its fleet of 30 Boeing 747s in Germany, one of the world’s largest economies. Emirates already flies 15 A380s, the world’s largest passenger airliners, and has ordered 75 more for delivery by 2018. (Air France, Lufthansa and British Airways have ordered a total of 39 A380s and, among them, have only eight flying.)In Canada, discussions to expand Emirates’ landing rights took a particularly bitter turn. After the Canadian government turned down Emirates’ request to fly to Calgary and Vancouver and to increase the frequency of flights to Toronto, the United Arab Emirates scrapped a military agreement that allowed Canadian forces to use a logistical base near Dubai.Craig Jenks, an airline consultant based in New York, says Emirates threatens established carriers in the one market where these airlines are making money: long-haul international trips. “There’s nothing better than a highly motivated cowboy airline in a small country,” he says.LIKE so much in Dubai, Emirates started out small but dreamed big. It was established after Gulf Air, a regional airline then owned by Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates, reduced its service to Dubai in the early 1980s. Feeling shunned, Dubai’s rulers created their own carrier.The government provided $10 million in capital. Emirates began flying with two planes, a Boeing 737 and an Airbus A300, both leased from Pakistan International Airlines. The new carrier was run by a band of British aviation executives, including Mr. Clark, who had been at Gulf Air, and Maurice Flanagan, a former top executive at British Airways.Much of Emirates’ early traffic connected Dubai with cities throughout the Indian subcontinent and a few European destinations, including London.By the 1990s, however, new airplanes with longer reach, like Boeing 777s, enabled Emirates to establish Dubai as a world hub. Sheikh Ahmed, the company’s chairman, boldly proclaimed that Dubai would be “at the center of the new Silk Road between East and West.”Rivals express grudging admiration for Emirates. “Emirates recognized the value of a global hub,” says British Airways’ chairman, Willie Walsh.And Mr. Clark says: “If you want to go from Africa to Asia, or from South America to China, the straight line is through the Middle East.”But geography is only one element in the Emirates formula. Government support has also been essential. From the start, Emirates was seen as integral to the government’s ambitions of building Dubai into a commercial, financial and tourism center in the Persian Gulf.Sheik Ahmed plays a role in almost every aspect of air travel into and out of Dubai. Indeed, he is known as “Mr. Aviation.” He is the chairman of FlyDubai, the city-state’s budget airline, and of Dnata, the airport’s ground handling company. He is also the president of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, which oversees the industry. And he happens to be the uncle of Dubai’s current ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.Critics say this tight relationship among Emirates, airport authorities and regulators gives the airline an unfair advantage. Emirates, these critics say, essentially receives government subsidies, in the form of low tax rates and shiny new facilities like Terminal 3, where another expansion is under way to accommodate Emirates’ growing fleet of A380s.Emirates disputes this characterization. The airline publishes audited financial reports, and its executives say Emirates gets no government subsidies.“Emirates works like a corporation,” says Ram C. Menen, who runs the company’s global cargo operations. “We’re a business unit of Dubai Inc. And it’s a happy relationship.”The airline, however, does have undeniable advantages over competitors, including lower labor costs. While Emirates pays its pilots international wages, it hires inexpensive workers, usually from the Indian subcontinent, for tasks like handling baggage or working in catering services.Nathan Zielke, a transportation specialist at the consulting company Arthur D. Little, estimates that Emirates’ overall costs, including those for labor, are 30 percent lower than those of its rivals.“It’s extremely difficult for other airlines to close that gap,” Mr. Zielke says. “Because their costs are so much lower, Middle East carriers will be the most profitable carriers with the lowest prices in the market.”ON the road to Abu Dhabi, about an hour’s drive from downtown Dubai, city planners want to build the world’s biggest airport. It would have five parallel runways and be able to accommodate 160 million passengers a year. (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport now handles 90 million passengers a year, more than any other airport in the world.) The estimated cost of this giant is more than $34 billion.Although Dubai has shaken off the worst of its financial crisis, the shock has nonetheless stalled this grand plan for now.Yet Emirates has proved remarkably resilient to recent financial shocks — the economic slowdown did not hamper its growth. The question now is whether Emirates can sustain its momentum without jeopardizing quality and service.Each week, as many as 90 new trainees file through the company’s training academy, a modern building near the Tennis Club, a popular Dubai spot among the expatriate community, close to the historical center of the city.Its growing fleet of A380s means that the airline will need to hire an additional 11,000 flight attendants in coming years, nearly doubling its current roster of 12,000. Over eight weeks of training, the new employees — most in their early 20s and speaking some English — learn all the ropes of the job. Life-size mock-ups of airline cabins mounted on hydraulic legs are used to simulate safety drills. Elsewhere, the trainees are taught how to serve meals or use the first-aid kits.Emirates executives say they recognize the challenges ahead. “We don’t forget who we are, and what we do,” says Mr. Clark, the president. “We’re a bus company. We have seats, we have people, and we recognize what it is that makes life more comfortable. If we hit the spot, passengers come back.”Emirates has emerged as a formidable player on the international travel scene. Its innovations, including private suites in first class and individual entertainment screens in the coach cabin, have been copied by many other airlines; its emphasis on quality has forced traditional legacy carriers to pay more attention to their own products.So far, Emirates has benefited from the weakness of some airlines in China, India and African nations as it establishes its presence in those and other developing countries.But that advantage may one day come to an end. In India, the advent of a new generation of quality carriers, including Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways, now offers some appealing domestic alternatives for India’s vast expatriate population, long one of Emirates’ growth engines.The recent tensions in Egypt, Yemen and Jordan have also hurt Emirates. Mr. Clark said last week that traffic to many of these destinations had a “pretty resounding” drop as tourists postponed holiday plans.Another threat is on the horizon. As more airlines start using long-range planes now in development, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350, they will be able to fly more people nonstop to most any other place in the world. That could pose a problem for the Emirates business model: its reliance on the Dubai hub.“One survey that is consistent is that people simply do not like to change planes,” says Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation consultant at the Teal Group, a consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. But, he added, “Underestimating the competition is a time-honored feature of the airline business. Is it confidence or is it hubris? It is only hubris if you lose.”'"
"'11-02-13,'0','You may not receive management’s support — and perhaps rightly so, because not every company should use social media, Mr. Karr says. “Some companies don’t have a culture that fits with it, like financial or law firms. There might be too many legal ramifications.”If you start using social media for customer service, you run the risk that your company will not be able to respond quickly to complaints or problems.Try making a business case for your plan by outlining your goals and how they align with the company’s, says Josh Bernoff, a senior vice president at Forrester Research and co-author of “Empowered: Unleash Your Employees, Energize Your Customers, Transform Your Business.”Q. What are some ways to use social media effectively?A. Be specific about your objective — for example, to have customers make one more purchase each year — says Adam Metz, who works from San Francisco as director of social business for the Pedowitz Group, a marketing firm, and wrote “The Social Customer,” to be published in July.Work with the marketing department on a strategy to achieve your goal and a way to track the results of your campaign, Mr. Karr says. “Let’s say your company releases a new product and you want to tell people about it,” he says. “The marketing department can give you a link people can use to find out more about the product, and it enables them to track who is responding.”Although it’s common for companies to use Twitter and Facebook, posting comments to industry blogs is another way to enhance your business’s reputation. “Follow the leaders in your industry and comment on their blogs” in the appropriate area, Mr. Karr says. “This is a place to add insight and alternative views, not write about your company.”In fact, Mr. Metz suggests a four-to-one engagement. “Every time you write a post about your company, you should also write a comment on four other people’s blogs in your industry,” he says. “Don’t just pump out content about your company.”Q. Although your intentions are good, you don’t want the company to get into trouble because of your tweeting and blogging. Are there rules you can follow to avoid that?A. Never disclose proprietary or confidential information belonging to the company or its clients, says Sara A. Begley, a partner in the employment practice at the law firm Reed Smith in Philadelphia who advises clients about social media use in the workplace. Disparaging your competition publicly by making untrue statements could be seen as an unfair trade practice or defamation, she says. “You could also write something that is viewed as discriminatory, harassing or threatening and be fired for that.”If you have a question about something you want to post, ask the human resources department. Have it send an e-mail approving your post so you have a written record, she says.Don’t comment on blogs anonymously. If you are discovered and your identity revealed, you risk an embarrassing response from those who believe that your company is having employees post positive comments on blogs, says Mr. Bernoff of Forrester. Identifying yourself as an employee allows those comments to be evaluated properly.One common-sense guideline for using social media is to obey the same rules you would with any other communications channel. “In the same way you can’t stand up at a conference and tell everyone what your company’s financial results will be for next quarter,” Mr. Bernoff says, “you also can’t tweet about it.”'"

"'11-02-13,'0','Fashion companies have been quick to capitalize on this gypsy-like allure. Shortly before the 2009 release of Florence and the Machine’s debut album, “Lungs,” the fast-fashion retailer Topshop approached Ms. Welch about designing her stage attire for the Glastonbury Festival that year. “She’s a born showgirl,” said Topshop’s head designer, Jacqui Markham, who collaborated with Ms. Welch on three costumes, including a bodysuit with dramatically fringed neckline and sleeves. “She has a natural playfulness and innate quirkiness about her.”Noticeably, since the album became a hit, Ms. Welch’s wardrobe has accelerated to considerably more luxurious looks, including the Roksanda Ilincic asymmetrical black silk gown with lace detailing she wore to the 2010 Brit Awards last February; a peekaboo Chanel black chiffon dress with embellished panels at the 2010 V Festival in August; and a gold floor-length gown with leaf embroidery, by Elie Saab, at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Then there was the stunning long-sleeved Givenchy fall 2010 couture gold lace gown she donned for the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, which some online commenters deemed too sophisticated for the event.“Well, I suppose it’s a compliment in a way,” Ms. Welch said of the reaction. “Look, if Givenchy is going to lend you a dress, I’m not going to turn it down. I would wear that dress to just go out and buy a pint of milk if they would lend it to me.”Since 2009, Ms. Welch has been working with the London-based stylist Aldene Johnson, who is also the fashion editor of Vice magazine in Britain. “The process of working with Flo has evolved,” Ms. Johnson said in a phone interview. Ms. Welch, whom she described as “quite brave, quite up for trying things,” is her first and only celebrity client. “The bigger she’s gotten, the more we can do different things than what we could do in the beginning. On stage, it’s about two sides. It’s always this ethereal white witch meets darkly sexy vamp character. For red carpet, it’s classic and glamorous and never trashy.”As tends to happen with musicians of the moment, Ms. Welch’s sensibility has also seeped onto runways. Both Valentino and Dries Van Noten used Florence and the Machine tracks for their spring 2011 shows. Mulberry went even further, hiring Ms. Welch to sing at its after-party and putting a parade of models in red wigs on the catwalk, though fortuitous timing also played a part.“It was a perfect colliding of inspirations,” said Emma Hill, Mulberry’s designer. “I like to design with one girl in mind to have a consistency to the collection, and we found this gorgeous girl from Finland, Julia Johansen, who opened our show. Coincidentally, she has red hair like Florence and we liked the idea that all the other girls would be mirror images of Julia with red wigs and all. It was all quite bizarre.”Ms. Welch watched the spectacle from the front row, wearing a sheer black blouse from her own closet with Mulberry skirt and booties. “As all the models were filing out, my friend, who was sitting opposite me, was laughing,” she said. “She was like: ‘You should be walking off the runway, too. Go join your fellow girls in the land of ginger.’ ”Ms. Welch (who will also sing “If I Rise” from the movie “127 Hours” at the Oscar ceremony on Feb. 27) said she hadn’t given her Grammy ensemble for tonight’s award show much thought, preferring to spend hours in the recording studio for her yet-to-be-titled second album.Ms. Johnson said that the pair had been working on a custom-designed ensemble with Yves Saint Laurent (“A wonderful part of this is that designers are creating specific pieces for Flo now,” she said), but refused to confirm the choice, playing the moment for the suspense of an established A-lister. “I’m in the middle of the selection process and we always have last-minute options,” she said. “It’s all top secret.” But one thing is certain: Ms. Welch will be avoiding the pyrotechnics of her peers in pop music. And if the eyes aren’t pleased, there will always be the ears to fall back on. “She’s not trying to be something,” Ms. Hill, the Mulberry designer, said of Ms. Welch. “There’s nothing manufactured about her. To have no kind of crazy dances or flying trapezes go through the air ... that’s daring. It’s just that amazing voice.”'"
"'11-02-13,'0','No Kindles in cafes? You’ve got to be kidding. This is an affront, not only to readers and gadget lovers, but also to the spirit of cafes!Many indie New York City cafes now heavily restrict, or ban outright, the use of Kindles, Nooks and iPads. Evidently, too many coffee shops in town have had their ambience wrecked when itinerant word processors with laptops turn the tables into office space. Sure, that phenomenon can be depressing — whether you’re a scornful lady who lunches or the nomadic freelancer who fields glares. And full-dress computers are perhaps too much personal furniture for cafes to accommodate. But banning devices the size of books, like Kindles and iPads, is going too far, and it’s anathema to the character and history of cafes.Unwholesome things have always happened wherever people drink coffee together. They gossip and complain about powerful jerks; they read, write and scheme about their own comebacks. On the sidelines of those conversations — muttering, silently judging, chiming in — have always been loners who loiter with books and newspapers all day, ready to be recruited into conversation. This might come as hard news to would-be restaurateurs looking only to taste that sweet margin of coffee markup, but loiterers and readers must be part of the cafe equation. People who sit at bars are going to make out and brawl; people who sit in cafes are going to read and talk.And often what they’re reading and talking about is unsavory. Coffeehouse patrons have always been a little bit . . . wired. This has been true at least since 1555, when the world’s first coffeehouses opened in Istanbul. High on caffeine and impromptu colloquy, 16th-century coffee­house patrons denounced the government. Sultans didn’t like it. Later, in 1675, Charles II described the coffeehouses in England as “places where the disaffected met and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers.” In 1721, Montesquieu wrote of the coffeehouse scene in France: “Were I the King, I would close the cafes, for the people who frequent those places heat their brains in a very tiresome manner. I would rather see them get drunk in taverns. Then, at least, they would harm only themselves, while the intoxication which coffee arouses in them causes them to endanger the country’s future.”But what the powerful disdain, the bookish and garrulous adore. Well before Jean-Paul Sartre made Parisian cafes the headquarters of Western literary life — saying he wrote in cafes because the clamor helped him concentrate — coffeehouses were a place to try out ideas. Jean Chardin, a French visitor to Istanbul, couldn’t get enough of the curious Turkish brew: readers, writers, populists buzzing with class rage and even dervishes (real dervishes) reciting poetry. But what he appreciated most about cafes was not that you got to express yourself in them. He was delighted that you were not required to listen to anyone else express himself. “No one is forced to give up his game or his conversation” just because another coffee drinker is trying to hold court. Amen.Knowing how to tune in and out, by turns, has long been a skill of cafe people. Now headphones facilitate that practice — both symbolizing and enforcing public solitude. That works for cafe novices, but in the long term, it’s the job of anyone in a public space to learn the fine art of ignoring people.'"

"'11-02-14,'1','Because the theater and Hollywood composer Burton Lane wrote the music for only two major Broadway hits (“Finian’s Rainbow,” with lyrics by E. Y. Harburg, and “On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,” lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner), he is perennially treated as an also-ran in the pantheon of great American songwriters. Lane, who died in 1997 at 84, was a natural melodist, but he didn’t fully come into his own until the late 1940s, when Harburg invited him to write the music for “Finian’s” and told him he wanted it to be as artistically lofty as “Porgy and Bess.” (George Gershwin had been Lane’s close friend and mentor.)Lane fretted that he wasn’t up the task. And as he feared, his music didn’t quite reach that level, but it came reasonably close. The beautiful Irish-flavored score, five of whose songs were performed on Saturday evening at the 92Y Lyrics & Lyricists program “On a Clear Day: The Musical Vision of Burton Lane,” yielded the frisky “Old Devil Moon” as well as the honey-scented ballads “How Are Things in Glocca Morra?” and “Look to the Rainbow.”Those ballads, which singers nowadays tend to treat roughly, have ur-melodies whose concentrated sweetness and grace require tender love and care for their luminosity to shimmer. And on Saturday in the first of four performances of the program, Liz Callaway’s “Glocca Morra” and Heidi Blickenstaff’s unmiked “Look to the Rainbow” found the songs’ almost otherworldly purity. The strongest rendition of six selections from “On a Clear Day” was Ms. Blickenstaff’s understated “What Did I Have That I Don’t Have.”The beauty of the performances owed as much to the sensitive chamber arrangements for quintet (Andy Einhorn on piano, Steve Kenyon on woodwinds, Sarah Seiver on cello, Bill Ellison on bass and Bruce Doctor on drums and percussion), as to the vocals. David Loud, the show’s artistic and musical director, writer and host, demonstrated a responsiveness to Lane’s tunes that is rare even among the experts who host the Lyrics & Lyricists series.The program’s more prosaic first half concentrated on Lane’s movie songs, its high points Michele Ragusa’s saucy “Everything I Have Is Yours” and a remarkable “Too Late Now,” begun by Ms. Callaway, who was joined one by one by the other cast members (the remaining singers were James Clow and Joshua Henry) to create an exquisitely harmonized echo chamber of regret.The evening’s special guest, John Cullum, the original male lead in “On a Clear Day,” who replaced Louis Jourdan at the last minute, sang “Melinda” from that show and reminisced about the challenge of having to learn the role in only four days.'"

Kids should be learning it from an early age.”There have been collegiate ethics bowl competitions across the country for 15 years, but the Long Island contest is the only high school level competition in the New York area, and one of just a few in the nation. This year, Moorestown Friends School, in Moorestown, N.J., fielded the first team from outside Long Island.Part philosophy slam, part debate team competition, part mock town hall meeting on Our Troubled Youth, the ethics bowl encourages contestants — about five members on each of two teams in each round — to listen to the opposing team’s arguments and integrate them into their own.“Debating the white lie question, I started out with no doubt that there was only one possible answer there,” said Laura Bader, 17, a junior on the Moorestown team. “Honesty is everything to me.”Although it did not change her mind, Ms. Bader said hearing the opposing team’s suggestion that the job applicant who lied in the hypothetical case might have been out of work for a year, with three kids and a sick spouse, “made it possible for me to see situations that I hadn’t thought of before.”In Saturday’s competition, there was some dazzling philosophical footwork. One student said lies of omission were lies-in-full because Kant’s categorical imperative proved it.Another dismissed the theories of the social philosopher B. F. Skinner, who worked with lab rats, by declaring, undeniably: “People are not rats!”Yet the bulk of the arguments among the teams relied heavily on simple ideas — which almost always turned out to be not so simple — like honesty, fairness, human dignity and the ever-present bogeyman of ethical living, the slippery slope.A highlight reel of the many ardent debates — which were held in several classrooms during preliminary rounds and in an auditorium for the final — would show repeated admonitions against the insidious slope: the white lie on an application was “a slippery slope that ends with you getting fired”; the sterilization of a disabled daughter was a slippery slope to eugenics; interfering with a scientist’s right to perform experiments involving her children was a slippery slope ending in government control of all spheres of private life.In the slippery-slope battle, some students counterargued with admonitions against ignoring special circumstances and making disproportionately harsh judgments based on unproven hypotheses.Zachary Murdock, a litigation lawyer in Melville who was among a dozen businesspeople, teachers and professors of philosophy who served as judges, said he found the quality of the discourse inspiring.“What I like about this competition is that it rewards kids for acknowledging the shades of gray, instead of trying to beat the other side into submission,” Mr. Murdock said.Several judges said they were impressed by how often they heard a debater preface remarks with “This is a complex issue.”In a few cases, the issues were so complex that each team essentially argued both sides at the same time, as when Huntington High School and Sacred Heart Academy agreed that polygamy was not immoral, per se, but should not be legalized. Each team agreed on that much but reached its own conclusions about why.Bethpage High School is one of the few public schools on Long Island that offer a philosophy elective. It is taught by Wendy Way, who helped organize this year’s ethics bowl and also teaches history.Other schools have started philosophy clubs or incorporated ethics discussions into activities like Model Congress.But for the most part, the students competing have learned the basic concepts of philosophical ethics “on the job,” said Phillip Weinstein, a junior at Roslyn High School.How does it help in everyday life to know your way around inside an ethical dilemma?“It makes you better at saying what you think,” said Joseph Fridman, 15, a sophomore at Oceanside High School. “It also helps me win arguments with my girlfriend.”Do they read Aristotle on self-realization, Epicurus on the dangers of self-indulgence?Many of the students interviewed mentioned Ayn Rand, the libertarian philosopher-novelist, as their favorite philosopher.“Also,” said Rachel Olin, 17, a senior at Oceanside, “a lot of this stuff is on Wikipedia.”'"
"'11-02-14,'1','Last year, the Obama administration permanently banned oil drilling in Alaska’s Bristol Bay, America’s richest salmon fishery and the heart of a $2.2 billion regional fishing industry. One huge threat to this extraordinary ecosystem remains: a proposed gold and copper operation known as the Pebble Mine. If built, it would affect a huge area of clear-running headwater streams and wetlands that feed the bay.Responding to urgent requests from nine native tribes that depend on the headwaters for subsistence, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has now announced that it will assess the risks to the bay from mining and commercial projects in general.This is very good news. The agency obviously cannot prejudge the study’s outcome, but its announcement pointedly called attention to Bristol Bay’s “extraordinary importance” as a salmon fishery and source of food and income for local residents. It also called attention to its obligation under the federal Clean Water Act to block any project that would have an “unacceptable adverse effect” on water quality and wildlife.Anglo American, the London-based multinational powerhouse behind the project, says it can extract the minerals safely. But historically the mining industry has done a sloppy job of protecting the environment. Mining residues, like sulfide-laced rock, are toxic. No matter how hard the company tries to sequester them — it proposes to build a 740-foot-high dam to contain the waste — an earthquake or other disturbance can jar them loose.The people of Alaska came close to blocking the project themselves in a 2008 referendum. Three former governors, including two Republicans, and Senator Ted Stevens spoke out against the mine. Industry, however, spent $12 million on advertising about the mine’s economic benefits; that, plus a last-minute pro-mining push by Gov. Sarah Palin and her administration, turned the tide in industry’s favor.The E.P.A. is right to do this study. We are certain it will find that the mine presents unacceptable risks and should not be allowed to proceed.'"
"'11-02-14,'1','“Back then, for guys to not put the ball on the ground, that’s hard to do even now,” he said. “Make five passes without the ball hitting the ground, hitting people cutting through the lane without the ball hitting the ground — that’s tough.”The Rens were largely invisible actors in a sport that itself was on the margins of American sports culture.In 1939 the Rens won the first world professional basketball championship in Chicago. Screaming news in the black press, the Rens’ victory over the Oshkosh All-Stars was all but ignored by the white press.Fast-forward to 2011, when the sports news media are obsessed with Carmelo Anthony’s potential movement. Not a day has passed in the last month that Anthony has not been the subject of speculation: Los Angeles? New York? New Jersey? Denver?Anthony’s generation is portrayed as richly compensated young men who eschew history and live in the moment and for the moment, but he understood that the hardships of the past contrast with the lavish lifestyle of today’s athletes. He expressed a subtle appreciation for what his basketball ancestors endured simply to scratch out a living playing a game that now pays out multimillions: the name-calling, the physical abuse and humiliation, then having to perform at a high level.On the other hand, pressure is relative. While black athletes of the Harlem Rens’ generation struggled for equality and fairness, the contemporary athlete attempts to find a way to get the most out of a narrow window of tremendous earning potential.Anthony talked recently to FanHouse.com about the pressure he felt and the intense scrutiny of his possible free-agent status this summer.“I think it takes a strong-willed person, a strong-minded person, to deal with the stuff that I deal with and still go out there and go to work every day and perform on a nightly basis,” he said. “I really don’t think an average person can walk in my shoes. I don’t think that.”The Harlem Rens could. And did. The Rens often played eight games in a week, many times two a day. They played all comers, traveling as far as 200 miles for a game.When they were refused housing accommodations because of Jim Crow laws, the Rens slept on the bus. When they were turned away from restaurants, they ate cold meals.They drove buses and cars through the segregated South and the often hostile North. They endured the profanities, the physical confrontations, just to eke out a living.“Now we, sorry to say, we complain about playing back to back, you know, two games,” Anthony said in the documentary. “Now we fly in private jets. You’ve got catered food on the plane, you’ve got meals when you get to the hotel, meals before the game. Back then you didn’t have any of that.”The contemporary athlete needs these lessons to help understand that an older generation endures trials and tribulations so that another generation can prosper.The source of Anthony’s pressure is simply deciding which team will pay him many millions of dollars to play basketball.Pressure? Where is the pressure?In his final appearance in the documentary, Anthony expresses an understanding of the debt his generation of athletes owes to the Rens and other pioneers.“Guys like Sweetwater Clifton, all the older guys, we couldn’t thank them enough,” he said.History lessons are meaningless unless applied in a contemporary context.Strength comes from knowing who and what came before, what races they won and lost, that they had to deal sometimes with life and death circumstances.During a recent interview in New York, Abdul-Jabbar said: “When you have a connection to your history, you have a perspective that gives you a lot of confidence. It gives you an idea of where you need to go from here. It’s not like they just dropped you out of a plane. There’s a connection there; young people absolutely needed that.”Even a young superstar athlete like Anthony, who knows now whose shoulders he stands on.'"
"'11-02-14,'1','ZURICH (Reuters) — Swiss voters, upholding their national tradition of an ever-ready citizen militia, on Sunday rejected a proposal to ban army firearms from their homes, after an emotional national debate on the subject.Provisional results of Sunday’s vote showed that 57 percent voted against tightening the rules on firearms in a country where many see keeping a weapon at home as a crucial element of national identity.After serving compulsory stints in the military, many Swiss men keep their rifles even after they have left active or reserve status. But occasional shooting attacks, and concerns over suicide rates, have prompted calls for tighter controls.“There was a clear division between cities, where voters were more in favor of the initiative, and the countryside, where people were mobilized against it,” Claude Longchamp, head of the research institute gfs.bern, said on Swiss television.Supporters of the initiative, which also aimed to restrict purchases of new guns and set up a central register of all gun owners, used posters featuring a teddy bear with a bleeding bullet wound in its torso.Backed by the socialist and ecologist parties, the initiative aimed to ban an estimated two million guns kept at home. More than half of them were issued by the army, the Justice and Police Ministry said on its Web site.'"
"'11-02-14,'1','Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, said he expected the data to show the economy was strengthening. Economically sensitive sectors like industrials, energy and technology have been among the stock market’s strongest performers so far in 2011.Indeed, estimates for gross domestic product growth in the United States for 2011 have been creeping up from about 3 percent to closer to 4 percent, in part because of the $858 billion in tax cuts and incentives that Congress passed in December. There is also optimism that unemployment could sink below its current level of 9 percent.Those are among the reasons that American stocks have gotten off to a strong start this year, with the S. & P. 500-stock index rising 5.7 percent, the best annual opening since 1998. In fact, Mr. Wien said, after a long period of outflows from stocks to bonds, mutual fund investors have started putting money into equity funds again.Mr. Stovall added that with concerns about the Middle East ebbing, the recent flight to safety that has lifted the dollar could reverse, helping the euro regain a bit of ground it had lost on worries about excessive debt.Oil prices are also expected to be closely watched this week. Though crude fell sharply on Friday after President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt announced his decision to step down, indications that political unrest was reawakening in Yemen and spreading to Algeria are likely to keep energy prices volatile.Unlike Egypt and Tunisia, both of which have now seen governments topple, Algeria is a major energy producer and member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.“This is a relief rally, but there is a long road ahead,” said Ann Wyman, head of emerging markets research in Europe for Nomura. “There is a worry about which country may be next and that this isn’t the end of the story.”Nevertheless, the resolution to the standoff in Egypt provided global markets with a bit of a lift. In Asia on Monday, stock markets broadly rose, with the Nikkei 225 index in Japan up 0.8 percent by midday.Stocks in the United States rallied on Friday after news of Mr. Mubarak’s decision to step down broke, and the upward trend continued on Sunday, as bourses in the Middle East also rose, with shares in Abu Dhabi up 0.6 percent and the QE index in Qatar edging higher by 0.7 percent.The Egyptian stock market has been closed since Jan. 27 but is set to reopen on Wednesday, and many observers expect it to bounce back as well. In what could also be a bullish indicator, Egypt successfully completed a $1.1 billion bond offering Sunday.'"
"'11-02-14,'1','Mr. Muse’s lawyers say that his birth records are nonexistent, but that they determined, through interviews with his family, that he was about 16 at the time of the offense. They say he is now 17 or 18, and depict him as merely a hired hand in the operations.“The temptations of piracy were overwhelming for Abduwali,” the lawyers wrote to Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court. “He had so little to lose.”But prosecutors in the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, in a memorandum to the judge last week, described Mr. Muse’s crimes as “extraordinarily depraved and violent,” and asked for a sentence at the highest end of the range, of nearly 34 years.Prosecutors said Mr. Muse had admitted to being over 18 at the time of the hijackings, and that during a five-week period in 2009, he led a gang of pirates in attacks on three ships in the Indian Ocean.Mr. Muse and his band fired machine guns at the ships, boarded them and held crew members at gunpoint, the prosecutors said.In the last of the three hijackings, of the Maersk Alabama, the captain, Richard Phillips, was held hostage in a lifeboat and repeatedly threatened, they said. During the five-week period, the government said, a total of 53 sailors were kidnapped, two of whom died of illness months after Mr. Muse’s arrest, while still being held off the Somali coast.Far from being “conscripted into service by hunger or any other duress,” the government said, Mr. Muse and his men “appeared to relish even their most depraved acts of physical and psychological violence and abandoned all pretense of human treatment of their captives.”The prosecutors described Mr. Muse as “the undisputed leader,” saying he threatened to kill his captives and even aimed a gun at Captain Phillips, pulling the trigger, and laughing after it clicked but did not fire.Mr. Muse’s lawyers said they agreed that Captain Phillips had “conducted himself with great bravery,” but they said a sentence of 27 years would provide heavy punishment and send a strong message of deterrence.In another dispute, the government contends that Mr. Muse made coded phone calls from jail after his arrest in which he relayed an order to kill a ship captain.The defense argues that the calls, while pertaining to piracy matters, were misinterpreted by the government, and because of their timing, could not have involved such a threat. Rather, they said, the calls concerned payment of a debt Mr. Muse owed.'"
"'11-02-14,'1','Islanders General Manager Garth Snow refused to criticize the N.H.L. and did not seem the slightest bit upset at his team’s tactics. He only wondered why the Penguins were not fined, too.“We came to play hockey,” Snow said in a news conference Sunday before the Islanders won at Buffalo in overtime, 7-6. “Obviously, there were a lot of things that happened in the course of the game. I’m proud of the way the team competed, and I’m going to support my guys.”In addition to a heavyweight in Godard, the Penguins also have Matt Cooke, a forward who has developed a reputation around the league as a dirty player and is serving a four-game suspension for a check from behind last week.In the statement, Lemieux said: “We must make it clear that those kinds of actions will not be tolerated and will be met with meaningful disciplinary action. If the events relating to Friday night reflect the state of the league, I need to rethink whether I want to be a part of it.”Lemieux spoke out several times against cynical tactics during his illustrious N.H.L. career. In 1992, he called the N.H.L. a “garage league” because of the obstruction tactics then allowed, and in 1997, he retired for three seasons in part over his frustrations. Pittsburgh Coach Dan Bylsma did not comment.Colin Campbell, the league’s senior executive vice president for hockey operations, said in a statement announcing the punishments that Gillies was suspended for delivering a blow to Penguins forward Eric Tangradi’s head, then punching him several times when he was down.“The Islanders also must bear some responsibility for their failure to control their players,” Campbell said.Martin was suspended because he punched Pittsburgh forward Max Talbot from behind in the second period. Talbot might have been a marked man; his unpenalized hit on Islanders forward Blake Comeau in a 3-0 Pittsburgh victory Feb. 2 resulted in a concussion for Comeau.In addition, Islanders goaltender Rick DiPietro was injured late in that game when he was dropped with one punch by Johnson.Haley fought Johnson on Friday immediately after fighting Talbot in the third period. Haley received a game misconduct but was not fined or suspended.Snow said Sunday: “It was nothing premeditated. It was a division game, and every game has its unique nuances.”Snow said he was surprised that the Penguins were not fined after Friday’s game, but he does not plan to appeal the decision. The Islanders (20-29-7) are to play the Penguins on April 8 in their final regular-season home game — a contest that has potential for more fireworks.Taking a poke at Godard and Pittsburgh, Snow said, “I’m very proud that our team showed restraint, that no one left the bench to create a bench-clearing brawl.”'"
"'11-02-14,'1','CAIRO — The Egyptian military consolidated its control on Sunday over what it has called a democratic transition from nearly three decades of President Hosni Mubarak ’s authoritarian rule, dissolving the feeble Parliament, suspending the Constitution and calling for elections in six months in sweeping steps that echoed protesters’ demands.The statement by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, read on television, effectively put Egypt under direct military authority, thrusting the country into territory uncharted since republican Egypt was founded in 1952. Though enjoying popular support, the military must now cope with the formidable task of negotiating a post-revolutionary landscape still basking in the glow of Mr. Mubarak’s fall, but beset by demands to ease Egyptians’ many hardships.Since seizing power from Mr. Mubarak on Friday, the military has struck a reassuring note, responding in words and actions to the platform articulated by hundreds of thousands in Tahrir Square. But beyond more protests, there is almost no check on the sweep of military rule. Its statement said it would form a committee to draft constitutional amendments — pointedly keeping it in its hands, not the opposition’s — though it promised to put them before a referendum.Even as calm seemed to be settling over Egypt, antigovernment demonstrations erupted in Yemen, with protesters clashing violently with security forces on Sunday. A small group tried to rush the palace of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, but was beaten back by riot police officers.In Algeria, opposition groups meeting on Sunday vowed to hold weekly protests against the government in the capital, Algiers, said the head of the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights, Mustapha Bouchachi. Around 300 people were arrested Saturday at a demonstration in the heart of the city that was stifled by a heavy police presence, the League and other opposition groups said.While opposition leaders in Egypt welcomed the Egyptian military’s moves, some have quietly raised worries about the future role of an institution that has been a pillar of the status quo, playing a crucial behind-the-scenes role in preserving its vast business interests and political capital.“Over the next six months, I am afraid the army will brainwash the people to think that the military is the best option,” said Dina Aboul Seoud, a 35-year-old protester, still in the square on Sunday. “Now, I am afraid of what is going to happen next.”The day in Egypt brought scenes that juxtaposed a more familiar capital with a country forever changed by Mr. Mubarak’s fall. Hundreds of policemen, belonging to one of the most loathed institutions in Egypt, rallied in Cairo to demand better pay and treatment. Traffic returned to Tahrir Square, a symbol of the revolution, navigating through lingering protesters and festive sightseers, many of whom lingered by the pictures of dead protesters that hung from clotheslines at one end of the square.Youthful volunteers swept streets, painted fences and curbs, washed away graffiti that read, “Down with Mubarak,” and planted bushes in a square many want to turn into a memorial for one of the most stunning uprisings in Arab history. Soldiers drove a truck mounted with speakers that blared, “Egypt is my beloved.”“Egypt is my blood,” said Oummia Ali, a flight attendant who skipped work to paint the square’s railing green. “I want to build our country again.”As she spoke, a boisterous crowd marched down the street away from Tahrir Square, “Liberation” in Arabic and named for the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in 1952. “Let’s go home,” they chanted, “we got our rights.” Though hundreds, perhaps more, vowed to stay until more reforms were enacted, tents were dismantled, banners taken down and trucks piled with blankets that kept protesters warm over the 18 days of demonstrations that began Jan. 25, the date organizers have given to their revolution.The military’s statement was the clearest elaboration yet of its plans for Egypt, as the country’s opposition forces, from the Muslim Brotherhood to labor unions, seek to build on the momentum of the protests and create a democratic system with few parallels in the Arab world.The moves to suspend the Constitution and to dissolve Parliament, chosen in an election deemed a sham even by Mr. Mubarak’s standards, were expected. The statement declared that the supreme command would issue laws in the transitional period before elections and that Egypt’s defense minister, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, would represent the country, in a sign that the 75-year-old loyalist of Mr. Mubarak’s had emerged to the forefront. Protesters — and some classified American diplomatic cables — have dismissed him as a “poodle” of Mr. Mubarak’s. But some senior American officers say he is a shrewd operator who played a significant role in managing Mr. Mubarak’s nonviolent ouster.The military’s communiqué was welcomed by opposition leaders as offering a specific timetable for transition to civil rule. Ayman Nour, a longtime opponent of Mr. Mubarak’s, called it a victory for the revolution, while youthful leaders, some of whom met in downtown Cairo on Sunday night to chart a path forward in negotiations with the military, described it as a concrete step.'"

"'11-02-15,'0','TAMPA, Fla. — C. C. Sabathia used to eat Cap’n Crunch by the box, not the handful, a habit conducive to maintaining his 315 pounds but detrimental to his long-term goals. Sabathia envisions himself pitching for another 8 years, maybe 10, and so after having surgery on his right knee in October, he consulted a chef and a nutritionist, improved his eating habits and began exercising twice a day.Seeing a sleeker Sabathia glide through the clubhouse Monday encouraged the Yankees, who are dependent on his health and happiness for this season and beyond. His off-season lifestyle makeover happened to coincide with a pivotal juncture in his career, months before he can opt out of his seven-year contract. Having lost 25 pounds, Sabathia on Monday also shed his standard I’m-a-Yankee answer for a more noncommittal approach, for the first time acknowledging the possibility of exercising his contractual right to explore free agency.“I have no idea,” Sabathia said. “Anything’s possible.”Sabathia reiterated on Monday how much he enjoyed pitching for the Yankees and vowed that his status would not become a distraction. Much as Derek Jeter did last February, Sabathia said he would address his contract only once, on Monday, and not again.But this uncertainty figures to loom all season over a rotation weakened by the retirement of Andy Pettitte and the Yankees’ failure to sign Cliff Lee. It is against team policy to negotiate during the season, and General Manager Brian Cashman said he was not planning to make an exception.“Liking it here and having contractual choices are two different things,” Cashman said.The Yankees were desperate to sign Sabathia after the 2008 season, and after more than a month passed without his responding to their six-year, $140 million offer, Cashman sweetened the deal by suggesting the opt-out clause: if Sabathia truly preferred to pitch on the West Coast, as was the perception, then he could leave after three years. Cashman said he had no regrets.“Turning the clock back, he was obviously a big piece to try to get over here,” Cashman said. “I’m glad we’ve got him. And hopefully we’ll have him the whole way.”'"

"'11-02-15,'0','Pablo Fajardo, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, called the ruling a “triumph of justice,” but said it still fell short. “We’re going to appeal because we think that the damages awarded are not enough,” he said in a telephone interview. The plaintiffs were seeking as much as $113 billion, according to a report recently submitted to the court.A Chevron spokesman, Kent Robertson, called the decision “illegitimate and unenforceable.” He said Chevron would appeal through the Ecuadorean legal system, and would not pay the damages.“This is the product of fraud,” he said. “It had always been the plan to inflate the damages claim and coordinate with corrupt judges for a smaller judgment.”He suggested that the timing of the ruling, a week after Chevron filed a lawsuit against the plaintiffs’ lawyers, was not coincidental. He said it was coordinated between the plaintiffs and the court, which had previously accepted an expert environmental opinion that Chevron contended was partly ghost-written by representatives of the plaintiffs, who include villagers and Indian tribes in northeastern Ecuador.The plaintiffs have denied any collaboration with the judge and said they merely provided information for the expert’s report as the court encouraged both sides to do.Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, reported a net profit of $19 billion last year. In addition to its appeal in Ecuador, the company hopes to block enforcement of the judgment in American courts.“It might as well be Monopoly money, given all the respect that Chevron will show it,” said Ralph G. Steinhardt, professor of law and international affairs at George Washington University Law School. “There is a legal regime for enforcing foreign judgments but there is a lot of discretion for U.S. judges to suspend the enforcement of foreign judgments.”The decision was the latest installment in a legal soap opera in which Chevron and lawyers for Ecuadorean peasants have sued and countersued over oil pollution in Ecuador’s rain forest.The origins of the case go back to the 1970s, when Texaco, which was later acquired by Chevron, operated as a partner with the Ecuadorean state oil company. The villagers sued in 1993, claiming that Texaco had left an environmental mess that was causing illnesses. Chevron bought Texaco in 2001, before the case was resolved.Chevron has been playing hardball for at least the last two years. It produced video recordings from watches and pens wired with bugging devices that suggested a bribery scheme surrounded the proceedings and involved a judge hearing the case. The judge was forced to resign, although it was later revealed that an American behind the secret recordings was a convicted drug trafficker.Chevron appeared to gain the upper hand again when it won a legal bid to secure the outtakes from a documentary about the case, “Crude,” in which Steven Donziger, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, is seen developing strategy and discussing the judicial system and how it operates. Mr. Donziger appeared boastful about meetings with judges and other Ecuadorean officials.Last week, Chevron filed a suit against dozens of people involved in the case, charging that they conspired to extort the company for $113 billion by making up evidence and trying to manipulate the Ecuadorean legal system. At the company’s request, an American judge issued a temporary restraining order to block any judgment for at least four weeks. A day later, international arbiters ordered Ecuador to suspend the enforcement of any judgment.Almost lost in the various disputes related to the lawsuit is the fact that Chevron and plaintiffs have agreed that oil exploration contaminated what had been largely undeveloped swaths of Ecuadorean rainforest. The plaintiffs claim that Chevron must be held responsible for damage where Texaco once operated. Chevron, however, argues that Texaco carried out a cleanup agreement with the Ecuadorean government and that much of the damage was done after Texaco left in the early 1990s, actions for which it should not be held responsible.“The judge recognized the crime committed,” said Guillermo Grefa, head of a Quichua Indian community who claims that Texaco’s oil contamination created respiratory problems among his people. “For us, this is very little.

The Sussex spaniel was one of nine breeds originally recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1884, but they are an unusual sight today, ranking 155th in annual registrations out of the kennel club’s 167 ranked breeds.The issue has not gone unnoticed in the United Kingdom, where the Kennel Club, the British counterpart of the A.K.C., has mounted a campaign to protect 24 breeds that it has labeled “vulnerable.”To encourage its countrymen to buy British, the Kennel Club holds annual breed showcases, called “Discover Dogs,” where the endangered breeds get special billing. The club has organized parades featuring the dogs and their handlers, who dress as historical characters with links to the breeds.Last fall, the British clothing designer Jeremy Hackett warned in a newspaper article that his beloved Sussex spaniels — which are featured in many of his clothing advertisements — have a popularity that is “on a par with whalebone corsets and powdered eggs.”“The whole idea is simply to re-educate the public about the benefits of some of the old British and Irish breeds,” said Caroline Kisko, a spokeswoman for the Kennel Club. “I think the main concern is that we have — as in the United States — we have a public that has become more and more accustomed to thinking that the Labrador retriever is the No. 1 possible pet, and the other breeds are just being forgotten.”Rare-breed enthusiasts say they have devoted themselves to the dogs in part for the novelty. Nichole Dooley, a field spaniel breeder from Boston, said people often stop her on the street when she is with her dogs, which are often confused for cocker or springer spaniels. “They say, ‘I had one of those when I was little,’ ” Dooley said. “I’m like, no, you didn’t.”But the main attraction, dog owners say, is the idiosyncrasies of each individual breed. Glenn, Baxter’s owner, said otterhounds are clowns. They tend to sleep with all four feet in the air, and Baxter is so obsessed with having his hind scratched that he introduces himself to strangers by backing into them.Dooley said field spaniels tend to be calmer than other spaniels. “They’re a well-kept secret,” she said.The field spaniel fell out of favor in the middle of the 20th century, losing out to the rising stars of the springer and cocker spaniels. They virtually disappeared from the United States in the 1940s and ’50s, before being revived in the 1960s after a breeder imported a handful of dogs from England. Every field spaniel in the United States today can trace its lineage to four dogs from the 1950s and ’60s, said Jane Chopson, president of the Field Spaniel Society of America.“We joke in our breed that we don’t have a gene pool, we have a gene puddle,” Dooley said.Extinction is a rarity in recent years, but canine history is full of cautionary tales. Many times, the dogs disappeared after they lost their jobs. In the Middle Ages, many households employed a turnspit dog, a breed developed to turn roasting meat by running inside a small cage that resembled a hamster wheel. Modern cooking technologies eliminated the need for turnspit dogs, and they faded away.Aficionados of otterhounds and harriers say their breeds are also victims of changing times. Owners of both breeds worry that the dogs may become extinct, possibly as soon as 10 to 15 years from now.Otter hunting was outlawed in England decades ago, and after that, demand for otterhounds dropped. “You’re talking about an ancient breed that no longer has a job,” said Betsy Conway, an otterhound owner and advocate.Because of their small gene pool, otterhounds suffer from physical ailments, although Conway said breeders were working to address the issue. Of particular concern is late-onset epilepsy, which can surface after an otterhound has already produced offspring, as well as decreasing litter size and female dogs who have difficulty conceiving.The harriers’ métier — chasing hares — was also outlawed several years ago, leading to concerns that they will eventually disappear in England, where the dogs are kept exclusively in hunting packs. Harriers in the United States are third-to-last in the A.K.C.’s popularity list and are mostly kept as pets. Less than 100 are believed to be living in the United States.Breeders of harriers import dogs from England every few years to infuse fresh genes into the United States stock. “If we’re cut off from that, or if there’s some reason that there’s a difficulty with that, then it’s questionable if there is enough genetic diversity for this breed to exist,” said Kevin Shupenia, a Georgia breeder who owns about 20 harriers.Still, Conway said owning an otterhound was worth it. “The negatives to me certainly are so minor in comparison to the wonderful things about life with an otterhound,” she said.“Why have otterhounds? Because they are a piece of history,” she said. To those who question whether the dogs have outlived their usefulness, she answers: “What difference does it make if we have polar bears or mountain gorillas? What do you need them for?”'"
"'11-02-15,'0','By the fall, people will most likely be paying more for each of them, as rising prices hit most consumer goods, say retailers, food companies and manufacturers of consumer products.Cotton prices are near their highest level in more than a decade, after adjusting for inflation, and leather and polyester costs are jumping as well. Copper recently hit its highest level in about 40 years, and iron ore, used for steel, is fetching extremely high prices. Prices for corn, sugar, wheat, beef, pork and coffee are soaring. Labor overseas is becoming more expensive, meanwhile, and so are the utility bills to keep a factory running.“There are cost pressures from virtually everywhere,” said Wesley R. Card, the chief executive of the Jones Group, whose brands include Nine West and Anne Klein. After trying to keep retail prices flat or even lower during the recession, Jones says prices for its brands will climb 15 to 20 percent by autumn.When commodity prices started to rise last summer, many manufacturers and retailers absorbed the costs, worried that shoppers would not pay higher prices during the competitive holiday season or while the economy was still fragile.Many big companies, including Kraft, Polo Ralph Lauren and Hanes, say they cannot hold off any longer and must raise prices to protect some profits.Whether shoppers will pay is unclear. “Consumers are not exactly in the frame of mind or economic circumstances to say ‘Oh, pay whatever they ask,’ ” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc. “There’s going to be pushback.”Economists say the increases may eventually show up as inflation, though they are not yet projecting rates that would set off alarms. Despite some fears, inflation has been extremely low, at a rate of just 1.4 percent annually in December. Data for January will be released Thursday, but economists expect inflation will run about 2.5 percent this year.Some do see the creeping signs of higher inflation, and warn that the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates or at least stop pumping more money into the economy. Others argue that such moves would choke off economic growth sorely needed to get companies hiring again.For consumers, higher prices in stores means there will be a little less extra cash to spend. For companies, profits may be squeezed, making them a little less likely to invest in equipment or to hire aggressively.“One has to think about these higher prices not as a reason for economic activity to get derailed,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics, “but as a reason why the recovery is slower than might otherwise be the case.”Given that the price of a gallon of gas is now well over $3 on average, Americans may feel that they are already dealing with higher prices.Adding to the cost of food won’t greatly distort most household budgets. Food, gas, clothing, personal care products and cleaning and laundry supplies make up less than a quarter of household spending in the United States, according to government data.People at the bottom of the income scale struggle more as these prices rise, of course, because a larger share of their spending is on such essentials.To some, the prospect of modestly higher prices is no reason to worry. In fact, rising prices can indicate improving economic conditions. Greater demand from fast-growing countries like China has helped push up the costs of many raw materials — though officials there are worried about inflationary pressures, as are some officials in Europe.In the United States, the willingness of companies to raise prices shows they are feeling better about the domestic recovery.The sharp rise in commodity prices since last year has not translated into all new records. Food commodity prices are about 8 percent below the high in the summer of 2008, while energy prices are less than half their zenith. Prices of a basket of other commodities are about 4 percent below the heights of mid-2008.The cost of raw materials accounts for a small portion of the cost of most consumer goods, as labor, processing and packaging tend to make up a larger share of the price at the cash register. Foods like coffee, meat and milk, which are closer to raw materials, will probably show some of the biggest price jumps.'"
"'11-02-15,'0','Americans shouldn’t fear a German takeover of the New York Stock Exchange. Politicians are getting antsy — even about the merged entity’s name — and some may use the deal to criticize last year’s financial legislation. That’s a superficial and illogical response. N.Y.S.E.’s purchase of Euronext didn’t emasculate European markets. And this deal, whose details are expected on Tuesday, won’t ruin America’s. What happens on markets matters more than who owns them.That doesn’t mean Senator Charles Schumer isn’t entitled to insist that the combo put the New York brand first. It’s in his interest to promote his home town as global financial center. And he may have saved the new group some communications consulting fees. The Big Apple and its connotations make for a better brand than the generically Teutonic alternative.But for New York to thrive as a financial center, it needs its backers to move on from an antiquated picture of the Big Board as a floor where burly men wave General Electric share certificates or where only stocks are traded. To retain its role as a financial hub, it must lead in innovation and technology, and above all represent itself as a place where the interests of investors are well served.On its own, N.Y.S.E. Euronext was in danger of losing out in this race. The Nasdaq, Hong Kong and London exchanges challenged it for new listings; the Chicago exchanges led in the innovation of indexes, futures and other derivatives; and rival trading platforms have eroded the profitability of its once-core stock trading business.The Euronext deal in 2007 gave the N.Y.S.E. access to a lucrative European derivatives business, whose operating profits now top those generated by the combined company’s cash trading and listing services. Moreover, because electronic trading has made cash transactions a volume game, a tie-up with Deutsche Börse should channel more business New York’s way. The German group’s Eurex joint venture also owns the International Securities Exchange, a big United States options exchange. The planned partnership — even one where the N.Y.S.E.’s shareholders call only 40 percent of the shots — should bolster New York’s position.'"
"'11-02-15,'0','Despite some political grandstanding, the bipartisan support to repeal the expanded Internal Revenue Service 1099 reporting requirement means that millions of the nation’s smallest businesses have one less regulatory burden threatening their ability to survive (“The Health Care Tweak,” editorial, Feb. 6).We encourage Congress to consider this small but essential tweak a teachable moment illustrating the incredible benefit that can result from fixing a bad bit of policy.Congress should now focus on making the temporary expansion of the health insurance deduction for self-employed business owners permanent. The self-employed have been the only business entities to not enjoy a full tax benefit for buying health insurance, significantly affecting their bottom lines and competitiveness.Creating a standard home office deduction would also deliver a big benefit to small business. Many small businesses leave a part of their tax refund on the table because calculating the deduction amount is ridiculously complicated.We don’t need more major small-business legislation — just a few minor fixes to existing law will help our nation’s smallest businesses continue to put our economy back on track.

"'11-02-15,'0','A wide-ranging review of the effects of high-caffeine energy drinks on children and young adults finds that they have been linked to an array of serious events — including heart palpitations, high blood pressure and even cardiac arrest and death — and may pose special risks to young people who take medication or have chronic illnesses.The paper, published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday, draws from case reports and scientific studies in the medical literature as well as newspaper articles, and outlines regulatory steps taken in other countries. (Denmark, Turkey and Uruguay have banned them; Norway prohibits sales to children under 15.)The study urges pediatricians to discuss the risks of energy drinks with patients, especially those with heart conditions and mood or behavioral disorders, like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The high amounts of sugar may pose risks to those with diabetes.An average energy drink contains 70 to 80 milligrams of caffeine per eight-ounce serving, about three times the concentration of cola drinks, but may derive extra caffeine from other ingredients, like kola nut, cocoa and guarana, the paper says.Officials with the American Beverage Association, a trade group, said that the study perpetuates misinformation about energy drinks, and that an average energy drink contains only half the caffeine of a cup of coffeehouse coffee.'"
"'11-02-15,'0','Even if it doesn’t know a thing about singing, even if it can’t tell Handel from Haydn, an audience perceives when a singer is uncomfortable. You can feel it in the air, hear it in the applause.On Sunday evening at the Metropolitan Opera House, the star crossover tenor Andrea Bocelli seemed out of his element and ill at ease in one of his rare all-classical recitals, and listeners responded politely and pleasantly, as if fulfilling their duty, a bit puzzled by the gap between the cautious sounds they were hearing and the smooth polish of Mr. Bocelli’s blockbuster recordings.The singer shuffled around stiffly and smiled tightly through a program called “Notte Illuminata,” a track-by-track run-through of his new album of the same name featuring placid, hopeful songs and arias by Fauré, Gounod, Liszt, Beethoven, Handel, Wagner and Strauss, in descending order of their appropriateness for his sweetly fragile voice.“I encouraged repertoire not usually associated with Italian tenors,” Eugene Kohn, Mr. Bocelli’s adviser, writes in the program notes. “You will notice there are no works by Tosti or Donaudi, nor old Italian art songs.”Mr. Kohn’s condescending tone is odd given that heart-tugging Italian popular songs are precisely what made possible Mr. Bocelli’s huge success, and doubly odd since it was only when the singer turned, for his second encore, to Tosti’s sentimental “A Vucchella” that there was a hint of connection to his material, of his enjoying himself.'"
"'11-02-15,'0','“No fear anymore,” reads graffiti along the main road in Zarzis, a port city near the border with Libya that is the departure point for many of the migrants.“Before the 14th the police and the National Guard were everywhere,” said Salem Ben Abdallah, whose son Moncef Ben Salem died in an attempt to get to Lampedusa a week earlier. “Then the police disappeared.”Tunisia’s caretaker government said Monday that it had set up military checkpoints at several ports to try to halt the flow of migrants amid growing tensions with Italy. Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, was expected to meet with Tunisia’s interim prime minister on Monday evening after the Tunisian authorities turned down an Italian request to send its own police officers to help patrol the coast.More than 3,000 Tunisians have landed in Lampedusa, which is just off Sicily, in recent days, leading the Italian government to declare a state of humanitarian emergency. One Italian official called it an “unprecedented biblical exodus.”Italy has also called on the European Union for help in dealing with the migrants.In Zarzis, a small group of soldiers patrolled the port on Monday. “We are being very, very strict now,” said a security official who stood guard at the entrance and declined to give his name. “We want to be sure that this phenomenon stops.”For now, the soldiers seem to have stemmed the tide of migrants, and fishermen report seeing fewer departures. But the army’s presence is thin and the coastline is long.Fishermen say they are sleeping in their boats because they are worried that they may be stolen by people who want to leave the country. “We saw them day and night,” Mohamed Hnid, a security guard at the port, said as he sat on a pile of fishing nets. “Only God knows why they went,” he said. “They are insane.”The young men of Sedouikech who survived the fishing boat’s sinking gave various reasons for their decision to try to reach Europe. Several have family in France. Others sought better-paying jobs. One of the victims, Lassaad Ragdal, had a French fiancée, villagers said. He was buried here on Sunday.Finding steady work at home is difficult, said Zyed Ben Salem, one of the survivors. “We can only rely on tourism three or four months a year,” he said. Income from fishing is limited, and the olive groves have suffered low yields in recent years because of drought.“I have been trying to convince our young people not to go there,” said Gacem Ben Yahiaten, an English teacher who drove the bodies of the dead men back to the village. “But they have this idea — they want to make money quickly, and they think it’s easy in Europe.”The trip was Mr. Ben Salem’s first attempt to reach Europe. “I won’t try it again,” said Mr. Ben Salem, who added that he paid about $1,400 to a smuggler to make the journey.He and three other survivors recounted seeing the lights of Lampedusa — which is closer to Tunisia than to the Italian mainland — when their boat was intercepted by the Tunisian National Guard.The National Guard boat, which survivors said was named Horriya, or Freedom, rammed them, the survivors said. The National Guard could not be reached for comment.“We heard a very loud noise,” said one of the survivors, Wissem Ben Yahyaten, who described the sound of the hull splintering. “I can still hear it. It was like we were watching an action film.”'"
"'11-02-15,'0','The proposal would effectively double that amount beginning in 2013, but ministers have also been debating whether to increase the fund’s lending capacity to the full 440 billion euros before then.Ministers, however, put off a formal decision, despite increasing concern about Portugal, whose 10-year bond yield rose 11 basis points, to 7.42 percent, on Monday.“The situation on the sovereign debt markets remains worrying,” Mr. Juncker said. “We do think that Portugal is broadly on track, but all this has to be observed from our point of view in the coming months and weeks.”Meanwhile, Ireland’s campaign to improve the terms of its 85 billion euro ($115 billion) bailout received crucial support after Europe’s senior monetary official said there might be room to adjust the interest rates paid on loans from the European Union.Speaking ahead of the meeting of finance ministers, Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, hinted at flexibility, though he ruled out any change this year.It is essential to respect the agreement struck when Ireland asked for aid, “especially for 2011,” Mr. Rehn said. “Concerning outer years, there is more room for maneuver.”Mr. Juncker said later that no decision had been made but added that it was an issue under consideration.European finance ministers also discussed possible concessions to extend the period over which Greece — the other country that has been rescued — must repay its loans.In Ireland, the interest rate charged to the government has been a significant issue in elections scheduled for Feb. 25, with the opposition leader, Enda Kenny, promising to renegotiate the deal.Ireland, which is borrowing from two European Union funds and the International Monetary Fund, pays on average an interest rate of under 6 percent, a premium of around 3 percentage points over market rates.Germany has urged terms tough enough to deter countries from straying, and some nations argue that the high profile adopted by Irish politicians makes it difficult to agree to concessions without being seen as rewarding critics of the deal.But the issue is likely to be included in wider negotiations over the euro, said one diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity. In particular, Ireland will be asked next month to sign a pact under which the euro zone would consent to a common system for assessing the corporate tax base.That is a delicate matter in Ireland, which carefully guards its right to set a lower corporate tax rate than many of its continental rivals. It remains unclear whether Ireland could agree to realign its tax base as opposed to the rate.Meanwhile, Peter Praet of Belgium was nominated to fill the next opening on the European Central Bank’s executive board.Provided that he receives the endorsement of the European Parliament, Mr. Praet will take the seat to be vacated on May 31 by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell of Austria, who is currently the only woman on the central bank’s board.'"
"'11-02-15,'0','“China saves and exports,” Ms. Lagarde said. “Europe consumes. The U.S. borrows and consumes.” She asked, “Is this a balanced model? Probably not.”While decisions about which measurements to use may be technical, they are also politically tricky. China, in particular, has resisted suggestions by the advanced economies of the G-20 to include measures for exchange rates; Beijing has been criticized by other countries, notably the United States, for deliberately keeping its currency, the renminbi, weak to gain a trade advantage.Exchange rates have become a particular sore point recently now that trade deficits and surpluses have started to rise in many countries, after falling during the financial crisis. On Monday, China reported a smaller-than-expected trade surplus for January as an increase in imports exceeded growth in exports for a fourth consecutive month.But economists expect the surplus will climb after the Lunar New Year holidays, raising pressure on Beijing to speed up the appreciation of its currency.Huge trade surpluses occur when a country exports more than it buys from abroad. That dynamic drew complaints from a number of countries at the Seoul meeting in November that others were artificially lifting trade by cheapening their currencies. The heated discussion, coming just after the Federal Reserve’s decision to pump $600 billion into the American economy, led Washington into a war of words with Beijing over whether each country was engaging in its own form of currency manipulation to stoke growth.“This is not about pointing fingers,” Christian Noyer, the governor of France’s central bank, said of the efforts under way to measure imbalances. “It’s about identifying structural weaknesses.”He called on countries to cooperate or risk seeing “brutal reversals.” Countries with high trade surpluses, for example, “may eventually hit a point where consumers won’t be able to keep buying at the same pace,” he said. “And those cutting into savings could eventually face higher interest rates.”In a bid to defuse the currency issue, Ms. Lagarde said, the G-20 will also discuss making a transition toward a global monetary system that is “founded on several international currencies.”Some officials of the G-20 and I.M.F., as well as in China, have been pushing for an alternate reserve currency based on a basket of virtual currencies overseen by the I.M.F. The renminbi could be included, Ms. Lagarde said.“What we don’t want to do is to come back to fixed exchange rates or call into question the role of the U.S. dollar,” Ms. Lagarde said. The United States has responded coolly to the proposal in the past, but Ms. Lagarde said, “I’m sure the U.S. is interested in elements of the reform with a view to having a better balance between the dollar and other currencies.”G-20 officials will also discuss ways to correct other imbalances, including the sharp surge in food prices, and a surge in prices for a wide range of commodities.'"
"'11-02-15,'0','JERUSALEM — The prime minister of the Palestinian Authority dissolved his cabinet on Monday and was immediately reappointed by the president to form a new one. It was the latest in a series of political steps taken by the authority after the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt.Ghassan Khatib, the spokesman for the authority’s government in the West Bank, said that there had been plans for a cabinet reshuffle for months, but that the process had “taken longer than expected.”Speaking by telephone from Ramallah, the authority’s headquarters, Mr. Khatib said the timing of the move had more to do with the Palestinian Authority’s timetable for statehood. Prime Minister Salam Fayyad’s two-year plan for building the institutions of a state is supposed to be completed by September.That same month, the one-year time frame runs out for direct peace talks with Israel, which the Palestinians have suspended because of continued Israeli settlement construction. And in the absence of a negotiated agreement, the Palestinians hope they will have enough international support by September for a United Nations resolution recognizing their right to a state within the 1967 boundaries.“The Palestinians are taking September very seriously,” Mr. Khatib said, “and I hope that the outside world will take us seriously. We cannot continue with business as usual after this date.”It does appear that the regional upheavals have given the Palestinian Authority a sense of urgency.With the Palestinians split between the West Bank and Gaza, which is controlled by the militant Islamic group Hamas, the authority’s president, Mahmoud Abbas, and his senior officials seem to be seeking greater unity and government accountability in the West Bank.'"

"'11-02-16,'1','“The Battle for Marjah” enters the crowded field of Iraq and Afghanistan battlefield documentaries, where films like “Restrepo,” “Gunner Palace” and “The War Tapes” have already made their marks. What will distinguish this British production for the American viewer is its mood of poetic fatalism, even despair.An account of one Marine company’s experiences during Operation Moshtarak, the major offensive carried out in southern Afghanistan last February, “The Battle for Marjah” is both an absorbing record of combat on the ground and an attempt to assess the larger battle for hearts and minds. It seems clear, though, that the filmmakers consider that battle hopeless as far as the Afghans are concerned. The only hearts and minds that are really in play are those of the American Marines themselves.The British journalist Ben Anderson spent two months embedded with Bravo Company of the First Battalion, Sixth Marines to report the film, which was shown in Britain last year under the title “Bravo’s Deadly Mission.” It receives its American premiere on Thursday night on HBO.Mr. Anderson records the company’s commander, the square-jawed, straight-out-of-central-casting Capt. Ryan Sparks, declaring before the operation that the Marines are “masters of controlled chaos and violence.” What we see once Bravo Company lands are five days of fighting so highly controlled — because of restrictive rules of engagement intended to clamp down on civilian casualties — that the troops seem like marionettes as they advance and retreat among the mud huts.There is tension and profanity to spare, though relatively little bloodshed, as the film makes real the movie cliché of American troops as sitting ducks for guerrilla fighters. The beautiful and coherent cinematography by Mr. Anderson is also a cliché by now when it comes to war documentaries, but it’s no less impressive for that.Meanwhile the director, Anthony Wonke, splices in news footage of generals and politicians discussing the lofty goals of the fighting, along with high aerial shots of the landscape, in a superfluous effort to make a point about big pictures and small pictures. His use of ominous, droning music and funereal-looking white-on-black text also contributes to an artiness (in the service of the film’s pessimistic outlook) that’s irritating but easily ignored.'"

"'11-02-16,'1','“All dogs are easy to love,” said Lloyd, 31, a professional handler who won the junior competition at Westminster in 1998. “But sometimes you find one where everything clicks. She is certainly one of those dogs.”Hickory, whose official name is Grand Champion Foxcliffe Hickory Wind, has had a distinguished career in five years, having taken home more than a dozen other best in shows and earning the title of top-ranked Scottish deerhound for the previous three years. She is owned by Sally Sweatt of Minneapolis and her breeders, Cecilia and Robert Dove, on whose farm she lives when she is not on the show circuit.Hickory takes over the Best in Show title from Sadie, a 4-year-old Scottish terrier.The other contestants for Best in Show included Malachy, an ambling Pekingese who represented toy dogs; Mister Baggins, a bearded collie from the herding category; Jayne, a Chinese Shar-Pei who was named top non-sporting dog; Adam, a smooth-fox terrier who took the terrier group; Ladybug, a Portuguese water dog who won the working category; and Beckham, a black cocker spaniel who represented the sporting group.Paolo Dondina, the Best in Show judge, said the competition was stiff, but ultimately he settled on Hickory.“This one feels perfectly the standard in all the ways,” said Dondina, who is the first Italian to judge the top prize. “I am a hound person. I had Afghans, I had whippets, I had Irish wolfhounds. I never owned a deerhound. This is my dream.”The Scottish deerhound, an almost ghostly dog that seems to glide as it walks, has a history that dates to the 16th or 17th century. In its early days, only royalty with the rank of earl or higher were permitted to own the dogs. The American Kennel Club, which first recognized the breed in 1886, describes the dogs as having a “quiet and dignified” personality, but warns that the dog may “try to chase any furry animals that run past him.”Despite her success as a show dog, Lloyd said Hickory is best suited to a rural lifestyle. “The breed is very sensitive to their surroundings and this is quite an extreme experience for a dog who lives on a farm and chases deer and squirrels daily,” Lloyd said Monday after Hickory won the hound group.To keep her happy on the road, Lloyd said Hickory sleeps in a fluffy bed at the hotel and gets extra biscuits.“She demands love,” she said. “You could be sitting watching TV and she’ll come up and nudge you, and when I mean nudge you, I mean really throw your arm up in the air. You better not be holding something to drink.”She also likes to nudge Lloyd in the middle of the night.When Hickory is on the road, “She always knows she can get away with most things,” Lloyd said. “She’s a diva.”Hickory will need to channel her inner celebrity to survive a news media gantlet Wednesday — her scheduled appearances begin at 6:30 a.m. and include the “Today” show, Martha Stewart’s show, Fox News and a “steak on a platter” lunch at Sardi’s.Then she can relax. Westminster was Hickory’s retirement show, Lloyd said, because her owners plan to breed her this spring. Lloyd said she knows Hickory will enjoy a full-time life on the farm, but “I’m going to miss that nose nudge in the middle of the night.”'"

"'11-02-16,'1','Israel temporarily closed four of its diplomatic missions abroad in recent days because of suspicions that they were under threat of attack, an Israeli official said on Tuesday. He refused to specify their locations, for security reasons, but he said that two had partially reopened. The precautions were taken after “unusual occurrences were identified recently around a few missions abroad,” the Israeli government said in a statement. The Israeli Counter-Terrorism Bureau had issued a travel advisory on Friday warning of a heightened threat against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad because of anniversaries this week of the deaths of two senior Hezbollah figures. It listed Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania and Venezuela as countries with a heightened risk. Imad Mugniyah, a Hezbollah commander, was killed by a bomb in Damascus in February 2008, and Hezbollah blamed Israel for his death. Sheik Abbas Musawi, a leader of Hezbollah, was killed by Israeli forces in February 1992.'"
"'11-02-16,'1','WOODSIDE, Calif. — There may not be an app for it, but Steve Jobs did have a permit. And with that, his epic battle to tear down his own house is finally over.For the better part of the last decade, Mr. Jobs, the co-founder and chief executive of Apple, has been trying to demolish a sprawling, Spanish-style mansion he owns here in Woodside, a tony and techie enclave some 30 miles south of San Francisco, in hopes of building a new, smaller home on the lot. His efforts, however, had been delayed by legal challenges and cries for preservation of the so-called Jackling House, which was built in the 1920s for another successful industrialist: Daniel Jackling, whose money was in copper, not silicon.Opponents of Mr. Jobs’s plan had hoped to rescue, or perhaps even move, the manse. But on Monday, Mr. Jobs — who bought the house in the 1980s, but moved out a decade ago — opted to delete instead.“The demolition process started yesterday,” said Howard N. Ellman, Mr. Jobs’s lawyer, confirming that the wrecking ball had swung on Monday.Brian Turner, regional lawyer for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which has worked for years to preserve the house, called the end of the Jackling House “really unfortunate.”“Steve Jobs knew about the historic significance of the house,” Mr. Turner said. “And unfortunately he disregarded it.”'"
"'11-02-16,'1','MEXICO CITY — Gunmen on a highway in northern Mexico killed an agent with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday and wounded another, in an attack that signaled the escalating risk for American officials fighting Mexican crime gangs that move drugs and migrants into the United States.The United States homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, said in a statement that the agents were assigned to the customs agency’s attaché office at the American Embassy in Mexico City, and that they had been shot in the line of duty while driving between the city and Monterrey.The agent who was killed was identified as Jaime J. Zapata. He joined the agency in 2006 and served in Laredo, Tex., before a recent assignment to Mexico City. The name of the other agent was not released, but a statement from the immigration and customs agency said he was in stable condition.It was the first time that an employee of the immigration and customs agency had been wounded or killed in the line of duty in Mexico, American officials said.Typically American immigration agents are involved in major investigations of trafficking, in conjunction with Mexican law enforcement. And on Tuesday, the American agents were clearly driving into dangerous territory. The police in San Luis Potosí State said the attack occurred on a main highway about midway between Mexico City, the capital, and Monterrey, the same highway where, a month ago, a group of armed men clashed with the federal police in a running battle that left five presumed criminals dead.'"
"'11-02-16,'1','ALBANY — New York’s leading abortion-rights group is investigating whether its former president abused her expense account over a period of several years, an official at the group acknowledged on Tuesday.The former official, Kelli Conlin, abruptly left the group, Naral Pro-Choice New York, last month after leading it for close to two decades. Officials gave no explanation at the time.In a statement released late Tuesday, Lorna Brett Howard, the chairwoman of the group’s board, and Cathrine Steck, chairwoman of a related group, the National Institute for Reproductive Health, said officials had “moved swiftly and appropriately to conduct an independent audit of expenses and reimbursements” after becoming aware of “potential improprieties.”While the statement did not mention Ms. Conlin by name, the political blog State of Politics reported earlier in the evening that it had obtained a draft audit of Ms. Conlin’s expenses conducted by the accounting firm Marks Paneth & Shron.Later, a Naral official confirmed that the expenses were Ms. Conlin’s.The audit reportedly examined tens of thousands of dollars worth of spending on clothing, meals, car services and even a summer rental in the Hamptons, according to the blog, all charged on Naral credit cards. In the statement, the group described the report as merely preliminary.“No conclusions have been reached based on the information gathered thus far, and there has been no determination as to whether there was any wrongdoing that would require the notification of the legal or regulatory authorities,” Ms. Howard and Ms. Steck said in their statement. “We are committed to doing the right thing and to serving our organizations and supporters. This will not deter us from our critical mission of protecting and advancing access to reproductive health care and rights.”'"
"'11-02-16,'1','In the meantime, pressure is growing on Portugal, whose 10-year bond yield rose to 7.42 percent Tuesday, a measure of investor nervousness about the country’s ability to finance its debts.The Portuguese finance minister, Fernando Teixeira dos Santos, criticized the slow pace of European decision-making. “The discussions are taking longer than desirable, and delays and hesitations affect the euro zone and the stabilization of the euro,” he said Tuesday after a meeting of ministers from all 27 European Union countries.The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, said there was no need to change the existing temporary fund. Member states could act with “lightning speed” to make changes if necessary, he added.Though the rescue fund now totals 440 billion euros, only about 250 billion euros is available for lending because of the fund’s structure and its requirement for capital buffers.The proposal would effectively double that amount, beginning in 2013, but the ministers have also been debating whether to increase the fund’s capacity to the full 440 billion euros before then.The Dutch finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager, suggested Tuesday that this was not an immediate priority.“The shape and size of the bailout fund is neither the problem nor the solution for the crisis,” he said. “It’s ultimately about strong fiscal discipline and building healthy economic fundamentals.”Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said the lack of a decision at the two-day meeting did not suggest that support for increasing the temporary fund had waned.He argued that ministers could agree on the details of the post-2013 fund “and then apply sufficient and suitable elements” to change the current fund.On Monday, Mr. Juncker acknowledged the concern over about the Portugal’s position.“The situation on the sovereign debt markets remains worrying,” Mr. Juncker said. “We do think that Portugal is broadly on track, but all this has to be observed from our point of view in the coming months and weeks.”The finance ministers also discussed possible concessions to extend the period over which Greece must repay its loans.On Monday, Mr. Rehn said there might be room after this year to adjust the interest rates Ireland paid on the portion of its 85-billion-euro bailout that comes from loans from the European Union.In Ireland, the interest rate charged to the government has been a significant issue in elections scheduled for Feb. 25, with the opposition leader, Enda Kenny, promising to renegotiate the deal.Ireland, which is borrowing from two European Union funds and the International Monetary Fund, pays on average an interest rate of less than 6 percent, a premium of about three percentage points over market rates. Germany has urged terms tough enough to deter countries from straying, and some countries argue that the high profile adopted by Irish politicians makes it difficult to agree to concessions without being seen as rewarding critics of the deal.'"
"'11-02-16,'1','As part of the new health care reform, the federal government and 27 state governments are establishing temporary high-risk pools to offer coverage for people with pre-existing conditions until the law takes full effect in 2014. The effort has gotten off to a slow start, and Republican critics have, predictably, seized on that as “proof” that the government will be incapable of managing the much more complex changes lying ahead.Initially, the concern was that the $5 billion allocated to lower premiums in the pools would not be enough to cover all of the people expected to apply after being denied commercial coverage because of costly conditions like cancer or multiple chronic illnesses. The Congressional Budget Office thought that 200,000 a year might enroll; the chief actuary for Medicare and Medicaid estimated 375,000 would enroll the first year. Experts estimate that a few million people are potentially eligible.Six months after the plans started accepting applicants, only 12,000 people have signed up and the opposite concern has emerged — that the pools will fail to serve the needs of some very sick people.Time for a reality check. It takes time to start any new program and enrollments grew slowly because — even with premiums brought down to levels that individuals without pre-existing conditions would pay — the price remained out of reach for many people.Applicants also had to be uninsured for six months before they became eligible. Some 200,000 people remain enrolled in 35 state high-risk pools that existed before reform was enacted. While the premiums in the new pools are generally lower, most people will probably stay put rather than drop out for six months to be able to qualify.The Department of Health and Human Services made sensible changes late last year. It lowered premiums by 20 percent in the standard plan, reduced the deductible for drugs and offered two more coverage options. It has also become more aggressive about informing people that they may be eligible. Enrollment has increased by 50 percent since Nov. 1, but the numbers are still very low.House Republicans are preparing to investigate the program with an implication that sluggish enrollment may show that the public is unwilling to embrace reform. That’s really a stretch. Congress and the Obama administration should certainly identify reasons for the slow start and think about how to move the program forward.'"
"'11-02-16,'1','The plaintiffs also face an uphill struggle collecting damages in the United States, at least immediately, given that a judge in New York this month temporarily prevented enforcement of the Ecuador awards. Still, legal advisers said they were prepared to try to collect damages in the United States as well.A confidential memo prepared by the Washington law firm Patton Boggs recently released under court order laid out the plaintiffs’ strategy, which foresees using a European industrial espionage firm to investigate Chevron’s assets around the world.“The fact that Chevron has agreed to ‘play ball’ in Venezuela, while the company’s peers have universally rejected the unfavorable contract terms imposed by the Chávez government, may portend difficulty there,” said the memo, code-named “Invictus.” “Nonetheless, the populist Chávez government remains a natural ally” of the plaintiffs.In the memo, lawyers also identified the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, Angola, Canada and several other countries where Chevron has significant assets as potential targets. In the Philippines, it even suggested using the services of Frank G. Wisner, the retired diplomat and a foreign affairs adviser for Patton Boggs, who recently waded into the crisis in Egypt as an envoy for the Obama administration.Citing the Invictus memo, Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York argued that the plaintiffs were seeking to use a “worldwide, full-court press” to extract a settlement against a company of considerable importance in providing energy supplies to the United States economy.Chevron said it did not intend to pay a dime. “We intend to resist enforcement anywhere where the plaintiffs seek to take what we perceive to be a fraudulent judgment,” said Kent Robertson, a Chevron spokesman.Beyond the temporary protection issued by Judge Kaplan, Mr. Robertson noted a decision by a panel of international arbitrators in The Hague that granted the company a preliminary injunction that might also block enforcement of the judgment.But Ecuadorean lawyers said they did not consider themselves under the jurisdiction of either the American court or the arbitrators.Referring to the arbitration process, one of the lawyers, Pablo Fajardo, said, “This is part of the Chevron legal strategy to delay and obstruct.”Duncan Hollis, associate dean of the Temple University law school, said it was logical for the plaintiffs to take their battle to other countries in the region because “there is some commonality in Latin American legal systems.” But, Mr. Hollis added, “there is no international law about how one court is supposed to enforce the judgments from another nation’s court.”For now, the case moves forward in the Ecuadorean courts. Three judges will hear appeals from both sides. The Amazon coalition intends to appeal the amount of the damages, while Chevron will appeal the entire ruling.“I don’t know if we will be broadcasting” our legal argument, Mr. Robertson said. But he added: “It is the illegitimate nature of the ruling. The scientific evidence demonstrates that this is a meritless outcome.”The final appeal will go to a national appeals court, a process that could take months. Then the fight may move to several countries simultaneously. Advisers to the villagers and forest tribes said they hoped to extract Chevron money from many countries until they reach the final judgment total.The ruling’s impact is already being felt in Ecuador and beyond as a cautionary tale of the environmental and legal aftermath of oil exploration. Alberto Acosta, a former oil minister in Ecuador, called the ruling “a historical precedent.”It is “a reminder that we have to defend ourselves from the irresponsible activity of extraction companies, both oil and mining,” Mr. Acosta said.'"
"'11-02-16,'1','“It seems that there’s a computer that makes most of the decisions for you — it changes a lot of the rules, it removes a lot of the skill,” said Ken Koury, a competitive Monopoly player and coach who informally settles rule disputes for others. “With this computer, I’m wondering what’s left for the player to decide — is it they just keep pushing buttons and wait for someone to win?”Hasbro is aiming at luring 8- to 12-year-olds back to these board games. Its executives say this age group, accustomed to video games, wants a fast-paced game that requires using their hands. To move forward on the new Monopoly board, players cover their game piece with their hands, and the tower announces how many spaces the player can move. Players also hold their hands over decals to buy or sell properties, insert “bank cards” into slots to check their accounts, and send a plastic car moving around a track to win money or other advantages (only when the tower instructs them to, of course).Hasbro executives also say that young players do not want to bother with reading instructions and toss rules aside.“For games, but really for anything you buy today, you need to be able to take it out of the box and play it,” said John Frascotti, Hasbro’s chief marketing officer. “You’re not ensconced in the rulebook.”To that end, Hasbro is shortening and simplifying many of its popular games, changing the formats of Scrabble and Cranium so they can be played in five-minute spurts. Rivals like Mattel are doing the same with games like Apples to Apples. Even video games often come in bite-size pieces, like the popular Angry Birds.""There is a recognition that people’s attention spans maybe aren’t as big as they used to be, or they don’t have the time to dedicate to this activity,"" said Sean McGowan, a toy analyst with Needham & Company.Ms. Ritson-Parsons said that while some aspects of the game had changed, Monopoly Live still emphasized social interaction.“Getting rid of the instruction book encourages a lot more face-to-face interaction,” she said. “If you’re not having to read as much, you are all chatting more.”Hasbro has kept key social elements, like allowing negotiation for property.The adherence to rules also speeds up the game and makes it more interesting, she said. For example, if a player lands on Marvin Gardens but decides not to buy it, the rules mandate that it be auctioned off right away — but a lot of players do not know or do not follow that rule.“People were saying, ‘It takes me a while to get to own properties,’ ” Ms. Ritson-Parsons said. “Well, it’s going to if you don’t auction it.”The new version tries to combat board boredom in other ways. It sprinkles in random events, like a horse race where players must bet on winners.The computer also tracks how fast or slow play is going, and may intervene to make it lively. If, say, very little property is getting bought, it will announce an auction in the middle of turns.Hasbro executives said that the company would continue to sell classic Monopoly once the new edition came out.“It’s really just an extension of the brand, not a destruction of what was,” Mr. Frascotti said.Mary Flanagan, a game designer and distinguished professor of digital humanities at Dartmouth, said that games tended to reflect the societies that they were played in. For instance, the original Monopoly, issued in 1935 by Parker Brothers, now a subsidiary of Hasbro, reflected “American ingenuity, the sense of needing to have hope, and reinforcing capitalism in the face of real economic despair,” she said.This version, she said, seemed to be “less and less about financial awareness” — children do not need math skills in it— and more about social interaction.Yet “when you say you can’t cheat, it means that there’s no sense of being able to socially negotiate the rules,” she said.Joey Lee, who studies games as an assistant professor of technology and education at Teachers College at Columbia University, said cheating could actually be instructional.“I wouldn’t necessarily even call it cheating,” he said. “In many cases a gamer’s mind-set is coming up with new and novel approaches to winning, and to a certain problem at hand. That’s exactly the kind of mind-set we need as far as 21st-century skills.”“Being able to negotiate with others, make up your own rules, argue with other players, that, to me, is part of what makes it a successful social game,” he said. The tower is “more of that blind adherence to following orders, versus being able to figure out and learn the game for yourself.”Though Hasbro is emphasizing social interaction with the game, some Monopoly players and academics said the new version sounded much less social — no arguing over whether a player could buy his neighbor’s “Get Out of Jail Free” card?“It takes away from the aspect of interpersonal negotiations if you have an electronic voice in the middle of the board telling you everything to do,” said Dale Crabtree, a finalist in the national Monopoly championships in 2009. “The first thing I said was, ‘The next thing they’ll do away with is the players.’ ”'"
"'11-02-16,'1','Air Products and Chemicals dropped its $5.9 billion hostile bid for Airgas Tuesday after a Delaware judge upheld Airgas’s main anti-takeover defense.“It is abundantly clear that the Airgas Board is thoroughly entrenched in its position, so we have decided to withdraw our offer and move on,” John E. McGlade, the Air Products chairman, said in a statement by e-mail.Air Products had pursued Airgas for more than a year. Judge William B. Chandler III of Delaware Chancery Court rejected Air Products’ claim that the Airgas poison pill defense was flawed because it gave directors too much power to deflect offers for the company.“The board’s actions do not forever preclude Air Products, or any bidder, from acquiring Airgas or from getting around Airgas’s defensive measures if the price is right,” Judge Chandler said in a 153-page ruling.Air Products, based in Allentown, Pa., raised its bid on Dec. 9 to $70 a share, from $65.50. Airgas officials repeatedly rejected Air Products’ advances, claiming the company is worth at least $78 a share. The Airgas board turned down the latest offer, which Air Products executives called their “best and final” bid, on Dec. 22.'"
"'11-02-16,'1','So perhaps it is not surprising that the Labrador retriever has never won Best in Show in Westminster’s 135 years. Other breeds better known as pets have also been overlooked. The golden retriever has never won, either, and the German shepherd and the pug have only won once apiece. In 2008, Uno the beagle became a household name after he was the first of his breed to win the top prize.Jenifer Haekl, who was showing her pug, Newman, on Monday, said pugs, too, are not properly respected. She does little to prepare Newman, other than feeding him a diet of luxury dog food and chicken livers and shampooing him with Suave the night before shows. “There really is not a lot you can do,” she said.The story is the same for Maxxim, a beagle owned by Victoria Braddock. She washed him for Westminster because he had recently been digging in dirty snow, but otherwise, he only gets a bath “when he starts smelling like a dog.”Maxxim does get his nails trimmed, along with the stray hairs along his throat and the tip of his tail. Still, she said, “You are supposed to be able to take them from the field to the show ring.”Wendi Huttner owns Wes, a 7-year-old black Lab who visits five elementary school classes a week in Richboro, Pa. Sometimes, Huttner wonders about the high-maintenance dogs who spend their lives on the road.“I see them walking with towels on their backs and with their ears pinned down and I wonder what kind of life they have,” she said.Huttner says Labs and other ordinary dogs suffer precisely because they are so wash and wear.“I think they’re too plain for the judges,” she said. “They look for something with flowing hair — more curb appeal for the audience.”Labrador and other family-pet owners take pride in their dogs, of course. They note that outside the show ring, Labradors are all-purpose dogs, skilled at guiding the blind, performing search-and-rescue missions, sniffing out bombs and excelling at nearly everything they are asked to do.“It doesn’t go: ‘Me! Me! Me! Me!’ ” said Sue Willumsen, a show judge who has been breeding Labradors for three decades. “It’s not a ‘ta-da’ dog. It says, ‘Let’s go out hunting.’ ”Because golden and Labrador retrievers are in the sporting group at Westminster, judges look for fitness and muscle tone. Sandy Nordstrom and Bob Ashenbrenner feed their golden retriever, Benny, a diet of raw bison, chicken and ground vegetables, and put him through regular workouts. He likes to romp through the brush near their home in Austin, Tex. Even so, “if we brought him in with thistles in his coat, he probably wouldn’t win,” Ashenbrenner said.Still, some Labrador owners say their breed is overdue for a big win. “I think it’s a cold shoulder, because Labs are the No. 1 breed,” said Eileen Ketcham, whose sister, Susan, was showing Sam, a 3-year-old black Labrador.Pensabene made much the same point. “It makes me crazy, because how many Irish water spaniels do we have?” she said. “They always go for the flashy, and Labradors are just a good, reliable, sturdy dog.”'"
"'11-02-16,'1','A satirical cartoon about an America increasingly enfeebled by its fear of anything outside the sanctioned norm, Lynn Rosen’s comedy “Apple Cove” is part eco-fable, part “Stepford Wives” riff, part cautionary tale for a hermetic society. This play is many things, just not as funny or clever as it should be.Alan (Erin Gann) and Edie (Allison Mack) are newlyweds moving into a sterile gated community next door to Edie’s dad, Gary (Paul Carlin), and his perky young wife, Mary (Kathy Searle), who wear matching velour jogging suits.In Scott Bradley’s colorful set design, Apple Cove is a pop-up fairy-tale book. Like most fairy tales, this one has sinister overtones. Those are manifested in the English-only community’s oppressive surveillance and regulation, from the flowers preapproved to grow in its gardens to the upbeat updates of its morning paper to the strict perimeters of its electrified fence.Keeper of this pristine order is Gary, while Mary reports back on transgressions. Gary nixes Edie’s plea to save a tree from the former swampland and frowns upon Alan’s insistence on keeping his off-site Rec World job rather than joining “the Firm.” Still, he’s confident the kids will eventually fall into line once they start producing their own “battalion of love.”However, while Edie’s fertility remains in question, wild roses start popping up all over the place. Alan grows more timorous and emasculated, but his wife starts secretly nurturing the forbidden plants, encouraged by Duke (Dion Mucciacito), a hunky security guard whose multiethnic roots stretch back to the swamp.'"
"'11-02-16,'1','Since then Mr. Beauchamp has produced and directed two television programs about cold cases: “Murder in Black and White” on TV One in 2008 and “Wanted Justice: Johnnie Mae Chappell,” on the History Channel in 2009.“I’ve been asked to do so many things, including features,” said Mr. Beauchamp, who grew up near Baton Rouge, La. “I’ve turned them down because my heart is with these civil rights cases. I truly feel this is my calling. I never would have been a filmmaker had it not been for Emmett Till.”He was only about 10 when he became obsessed with the story of Till, Mr. Beauchamp said, after he found a Jet magazine photo of Till’s bloated and battered body.While Emmett Till’s chilling story is perhaps the most well known of the era, the “Injustice Files,” to be broadcast over three consecutive Friday nights, focuses on lesser-known cases. They come straight from the files of a federal initiative announced in 2007 to solve more than 100 pre-1970 cold cases. The series was created with the participation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.“The more people are aware of these crimes, the better the chance to find what they’re looking for,” Christopher Allen, an F.B.I. spokesman, said of the bureau’s participation.It suggested cases to Mr. Beauchamp that stood to benefit the most from publicity but did not give him special access to its files. There are a few surprises.A white man is the murder victim in the case examined in the March 4 episode, “He Walked Alone.” The body of William Lewis Moore, a postal worker and member of the Congress of Racial Equality was found by the side of an Alabama road on April 23, 1963. He had been shot after staging a walk from Tennessee to Mississippi to deliver a pro-civil rights letter to the governor of Mississippi.And the Feb. 25 episode, “The Ghosts of Bogalusa,” shows that even black law-enforcement officers were singled out. On June 2, 1965, a year after they were named the first black sheriff’s deputies in Washington Parish, La., Oneal Moore and David Creed Rogers were ambushed and shot in their car. Mr. Moore, 34, was killed, and Mr. Rogers was wounded.Each of the three one-hour episodes features Mr. Beauchamp interviewing family members, law-enforcement officials and witnesses, and poring over old records. There are also some dramatic re-enactments of scenes. In “The Secrets of Natchez” Mr. Beauchamp even confronts a potential suspect.Also seen tracking down leads and being interviewed by Mr. Beauchamp is Cynthia Deitle, the chief of the F.B.I.’s civil rights unit when the series was shot. Viewers with information about the crimes will be able to contact the bureau through the Investigation Discovery Web site.“One of the major obstacles the F.B.I. has is convincing people to come forward,” Mr. Beauchamp said in an interview from his office in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. “People are often more willing to talk to a filmmaker than to talk to the F.B.I.”New evidence has come to light in some of the cases covered in “Murder in Black and White,” Mr. Beauchamp said, though there have yet to be new prosecutions.Theodore M. Shaw, a professor at Columbia Law School and the former director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said, “The culture of our country is that these shows do produce an audience.”He added: “It’s not just a question of whether someone is sentenced to prison, but the inviolate right to prosecute these cases. It’s a kind of truth and reconciliation.”Mr. Jackson, a 52-year-old demolition expert who lives in Natchez, said in a recent interview that he shares that view through shards of grief. “I came home with his flesh still in his shoe,” he said, recalling his father’s killing.His murder was in apparent retaliation for his N.A.A.C.P. affiliation and for taking a “white” job as a chemical mixer at a tire and rubber factory in Natchez.“I hope that America begins to see the hero he was to break the back of Jim Crow here in Mississippi,” Mr. Jackson said of his father.Mr. Jackson said he was dissatisfied with the F.B.I.’s response to the killing. But “I thought Keith was able to understand,” he said, referring to Mr. Beauchamp.Jeffrey Heinze, a supervisory special agent for the bureau, said that he understood Mr. Jackson’s feelings of impatience, but added that the elder Mr. Jackson’s murder has been “actively investigated” since it was reinitiated.Other families and civil rights organizations have complained that not enough money and resources have gone into solving the cold cases, a charge the F.B.I. has denied. In fiscal 2010, the Justice Department received $1.6 million for the unsolved crimes initiative. So far, investigations into 56 of the 109 cases have been concluded, with two successful prosecutions. Mr. Heinze said that most suspects in the cases the bureau had closed were dead.“After ‘Emmett Till,’ so many families reached out to me,” Mr. Beauchamp said of why he keeps producing programs about crimes from 50 or 60 years ago. “I feel like a dinosaur, but we still deal with issues of race and social injustice, and there are so many stories to tell.”'"

"'11-02-17,'1','WASHINGTON — Greenhouse gas emissions in the United States declined in 2009 for the second consecutive year, reflecting the impact of the recession on industrial production and overall energy use, the federal government reported on Wednesday.Emissions of carbon dioxide and other climate-altering gases fell 6 percent in 2009 and were at their lowest level since 1995, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which produces the annual inventory of emissions. The agency attributed the decline to the economic slowdown and a shift from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas to produce electricity as the price of natural gas has declined.Overall emissions in the United States have risen by 7.4 percent since 1990, an annual average of 0.4 percent, the agency reported. Even as the American population has grown, emissions per capita have fallen, and the rate of emissions relative to the size of the economy — sometimes known as carbon intensity — has dropped even more sharply.Total emissions of greenhouse gases were 5.5 billion metric tons in 2009, down from 5.92 billion in 2008 and 6.12 billion in 2007, the last pre-recession year. The United States is the second-largest source of such heat-trapping gases, after China.Greenhouse gas emissions declined most heavily in the industrial and transportation sectors in 2008 and 2009, while there was virtually no year-to-year change in emissions from commercial and residential buildings and from agriculture.The trend, while reflecting the weak economy, is in part encouraging news to President Obama, who has pledged to the United Nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. The figures released on Wednesday indicated that the country was more than halfway to that goal.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','The Manhattan district attorney’s office is investigating whether the former longtime president of New York’s leading abortion-rights group abused her expense account, two people briefed on the inquiry said Wednesday.An official of the group, Naral Pro-Choice New York, confirmed Tuesday that it was auditing expenses and reimbursements of the former president, Kelli Conlin, after “potential improprieties” came to light.The political blog State of Politics reported earlier Tuesday that it had obtained a draft audit of Ms. Conlin’s expenses.The audit reportedly examined tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of spending on clothing, meals and car services, as well as a summer rental in the Hamptons, all charged on Naral credit cards, according to the blog.After nearly two decades leading Naral in New York, Ms. Conlin left last month without explanation.Ms. Conlin’s lawyer, Anne C. Vladeck, would not comment directly on the district attorney’s investigation. But she said Ms. Conlin had “worked tirelessly to increase the organization’s stability and effectiveness.”“We have not had an opportunity to see the audit,” Ms. Vladeck added. “However, Ms. Conlin has always acted in the best interest of the organization.”'"

That loss was No. 11 in a league-record streak that eventually reached 26 before Cleveland ended it last week with an overtime victory against the less-heralded squad from Los Angeles, the Clippers.Pau Gasol had 30 points and 20 rebounds for the Lakers.Playing the finale of a seven-game trip, the Lakers spent much of the night looking as if they were already on vacation. They threw errant passes, forced outside shots and could not catch the Cavaliers down the stretch despite a frantic comeback.Kobe Bryant finished with 17 points on 8-of-24 shooting.

"'11-02-17,'1','Peter Ackerman, a onetime student of Mr. Sharp who founded the nonviolence center and ran the Cairo workshop, cites his former mentor as proof that “ideas have power.”Mr. Sharp, hard-nosed yet exceedingly shy, is careful not to take credit. He is more thinker than revolutionary, though as a young man he participated in lunch-counter sit-ins and spent nine months in a federal prison in Danbury, Conn., as a conscientious objector during the Korean War. He has had no contact with the Egyptian protesters, he said, although he recently learned that the Muslim Brotherhood had “From Dictatorship to Democracy” posted on its Web site.While seeing the revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak as a sign of “encouragement,” Mr. Sharp said, “The people of Egypt did that — not me.”He has been watching events in Cairo unfold on CNN from his modest house in East Boston, which he bought in 1968 for $150 plus back taxes.It doubles as the headquarters of the Albert Einstein Institution, an organization Mr. Sharp founded in 1983 while running seminars at Harvard and teaching political science at what is now the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. It consists of him; his assistant, Jamila Raqib, whose family fled Soviet oppression in Afghanistan when she was 5; a part-time office manager and a Golden Retriever mix named Sally. Their office wall sports a bumper sticker that reads “Gotov Je!” — Serbian for “He is finished!”In this era of Twitter revolutionaries, the Internet holds little allure for Mr. Sharp. He is not on Facebook and does not venture onto the Einstein Web site. (“I should,” he said apologetically.) If he must send e-mail, he consults a handwritten note Ms. Raqib has taped to the doorjamb near his state-of-the-art Macintosh computer in a study overflowing with books and papers. “To open a blank e-mail,” it reads, “click once on icon that says ‘new’ at top of window.”Some people suspect Mr. Sharp of being a closet peacenik and a lefty — in the 1950s, he wrote for a publication called “Peace News” and he once worked as personal secretary to A. J. Muste, a noted labor union activist and pacifist — but he insists that he outgrew his own early pacifism and describes himself as “trans-partisan.”Based on studies of revolutionaries like Gandhi, nonviolent uprisings, civil rights struggles, economic boycotts and the like, he has concluded that advancing freedom takes careful strategy and meticulous planning, advice that Ms. Ziada said resonated among youth leaders in Egypt. Peaceful protest is best, he says — not for any moral reason, but because violence provokes autocrats to crack down. “If you fight with violence,” Mr. Sharp said, “you are fighting with your enemy’s best weapon, and you may be a brave but dead hero.”Autocrats abhor Mr. Sharp. In 2007, President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela denounced him, and officials in Myanmar, according to diplomatic cables obtained by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, accused him of being part of a conspiracy to set off demonstrations intended “to bring down the government.” (A year earlier, a cable from the United States Embassy in Damascus noted that Syrian dissidents had trained in nonviolence by reading Mr. Sharp’s writings.)In 2008, Iran featured Mr. Sharp, along with Senator John McCain of Arizona and the Democratic financier George Soros, in an animated propaganda video that accused Mr. Sharp of being the C.I.A. agent “in charge of America’s infiltration into other countries,” an assertion his fellow scholars find ludicrous.“He is generally considered the father of the whole field of the study of strategic nonviolent action,” said Stephen Zunes, an expert in that field at the University of San Francisco. “Some of these exaggerated stories of him going around the world and starting revolutions and leading mobs, what a joke. He’s much more into doing the research and the theoretical work than he is in disseminating it.”That is not to say Mr. Sharp has not seen any action. In 1989, he flew to China to witness the uprising in Tiananmen Square. In the early 1990s, he sneaked into a rebel camp in Myanmar at the invitation of Robert L. Helvey, a retired Army colonel who advised the opposition there. They met when Colonel Helvey was on a fellowship at Harvard; the military man thought the professor had ideas that could avoid war. “Here we were in this jungle, reading Gene Sharp’s work by candlelight,” Colonel Helvey recalled. “This guy has tremendous insight into society and the dynamics of social power.”Not everyone is so impressed. As’ad AbuKhalil, a Lebanese political scientist and founder of the Angry Arab News Service blog, was outraged by a passing mention of Mr. Sharp in The New York Times on Monday. He complained that Western journalists were looking for a “Lawrence of Arabia” to explain Egyptians’ success, in a colonialist attempt to deny credit to Egyptians.Still, just as Mr. Sharp’s profile seems to be expanding, his institute is contracting.Mr. Ackerman, who became wealthy as an investment banker after studying under Mr. Sharp, contributed millions of dollars and kept it afloat for years. But about a decade ago, Mr. Ackerman wanted to disseminate Mr. Sharp’s ideas more aggressively, as well as his own. He put his money into his own center, which also produces movies and even a video game to train dissidents. An annuity he purchased still helps pay Mr. Sharp’s salary.In the twilight of his career, Mr. Sharp, who never married, is slowing down. His voice trembles and his blue eyes grow watery when he is tired; he gave up driving after a recent accident. He does his own grocery shopping; his assistant, Ms. Raqib, tries to follow him when it is icy. He does not like it.He says his work is far from done. He has just submitted a manuscript for a new book, “Sharp’s Dictionary of Power and Struggle: Terminology of Civil Resistance in Conflicts,” to be published this fall by Oxford University Press. He would like readers to know he did not pick the title. “It’s a little immodest,” he said. He has another manuscript in the works about Einstein, whose own concerns about totalitarianism prompted Mr. Sharp to adopt the scientist’s name for his institution. (Einstein wrote the foreword to Mr. Sharp’s first book, about Gandhi.)In the meantime, he is keeping a close eye on the Middle East. He was struck by the Egyptian protesters’ discipline in remaining peaceful, and especially by their lack of fear. “That is straight out of Gandhi,” Mr. Sharp said. “If people are not afraid of the dictatorship, that dictatorship is in big trouble.”'"
"'11-02-17,'1','The decision by the school has attracted the anger of parents, environmental groups and members of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s office. They have banded together, with many accusing the tidy red-brick school of chronic mismanagement, willful elitism and short-sightedness. The debate over the field, in a multiethnic neighborhood peppered with sari shops and Peruvian chicken joints, has touched on issues of class and ethnicity.The mayor’s office said Wednesday that Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson would meet with the school’s board this week to try to persuade it to reconsider the city’s offer. Meanwhile, many local parents have dug into their own pockets and raised $260,000 to try to keep the field out of private hands. But so far, the school has refused their loan.“If the school sells to developers, it will kill the school, as who on earth will pay $15,500 tuition to send their kid to a school without a playground?” asked Will Sweeney, a film producer, who is leading the drive to save the field. He said he was motivated by the desire for an expansive green patch where his 2-year-old, Malcolm, could play. “Someone needs to ask how the school got to this point financially,” he added.But Michael Rakosi, vice president of the school’s board of trustees, argued that chalk, teachers and computers could not be paid for with the city’s promises. Moreover, he said, the residents shouting the loudest did not send their children to his school.Disagreeing with criticism that Garden School, most of whose students are not from Jackson Heights, was out of touch with the community, he said that the school served dozens of ethnic groups from across Queens, and that many students received financial aid.“I would happily sell to the city tomorrow, but they haven’t paid a nickel,” said Mr. Rakosi, who works in real estate. “I can’t pay my teachers based on promises. My responsibility is to 300 little kids.”Arthur Gruen, president of Garden’s Board of Trustees, said the financial downturn had contributed to enrollment falling to 240 students this year, from 330 in 2009. “There has been no financial mismanagement,” he said.But some parents of students at the school said that mismanagement preceded the financial crisis, and that a sudden rise in tuition in 2009 had led to the departure of many students, and that the problem had been made worse by a lack of investment and meager fund-raising efforts.According to the school’s financial statements, the school has four outstanding loans amounting to $2.25 million, including two loans totaling $1 million that it took out in 2009 — at an interest rate of 12.99 percent — from Precision Financial, a loan and mortgage company based on Long Island, which has since gone out of business, and whose chief executive was Mark Rosenbloom, Mr. Rakosi’s nephew. Mr. Rosenbloom could not be reached by phone.Mr. Sweeney was adamant that the school could have received loans with better terms. But Mr. Rakosi said the loan from his nephew’s company was the most favorable at the time and had been secured with the support and knowledge of the board.Why a single athletic field in Queens has unleashed such a maelstrom might seem mysterious. But the hunger for green space here is strong. New York City has more than 28,000 acres of municipal parkland, with roughly one-quarter of it in Queens. But Jackson Heights, built in the 1920s and 1930s as an idyllic garden city, has long since given way to concrete and sprawl.Even Travers Park, the only one in the neighborhood, is largely covered in concrete.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','After registering in the clubhouse and breezing down the hill, Mickelson paused for questions at the practice range before warming up.“Things are good; I’ve been playing well,” he said when asked about his recent form at the Farmers Insurance Open, where he finished second, and at the AT&T Pebble Beach, where he tied for ninth. “I’ve got just a slight hurdle to get over, where I’ve got to get the scores down to how I feel I’m playing. Some of that will be course management, some of that will just be getting a couple putts to drop.“But I feel like I’m right on the cusp of playing some really good golf.”That would mean Mickelson is tracking toward another strong performance this week and a peak performance in April at Augusta National Golf Club, where he will try to defend his third Masters title.As the highest-ranked player in the field, Mickelson will most likely be the favorite. But he will have plenty of competition. The 2010 Northern Trust champion, Steve Stricker, ranked No. 8, is back. Also on hand are ninth-ranked Luke Donald, 10th-ranked Jim Furyk and 14th-ranked Dustin Johnson, who tied for third last year and who worked on his game this week with his swing coach, Butch Harmon.On another level, there is Mark Wilson, the PGA Tour’s only two-time winner this season; the talented rookie Jhonattan Vegas, who won the Bob Hope Classic in a playoff; and Hunter Mahan, who finished second last week at Pebble Beach.“A lot of interesting golf holes,” Wilson said of Riviera, where his best finish was a tie for 11th in 2008. “They’re all unique and different, and it’s a fun course.” One of the reasons he likes the tournament, he added, is that “you know you can go around and shoot just a couple under par every day and actually make up ground on the field.”Few realize that more than the former champions Fred Couples and Corey Pavin, who now play on the Champions Tour but are in the field this week. They dominated at Riviera from 1990 to ’96. Couples won in 1990 and ’92 and finished second in 1994 and ’96. Pavin won in 1994 and ’95.This will be Pavin’s 27th, and probably final, start at Riviera as a professional. He also played twice as an amateur, missing the cut in 1979 in his debut as a 19-year-old. Now 51, Pavin, who last year contended at Colonial and lost a playoff at Hartford, said he thought he had a chance to play well.While Couples was out on his old stomping grounds, ringing up six birdies through 13 holes in the pro-am, Pavin was ruminating about his chances of finishing strong.“Yes, I think I can be in contention here,” he said. “I feel like I can win. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t, or have a chance to win, anyway.”And if he were to pull it off? Now that would be entertainment.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','In its filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, Borders listed $1.29 billion in debt and $1.27 billion in assets. As of the filing, Borders owed $272 million to its 30 largest unsecured creditors — including $41.1 million to the Penguin Group USA.Publishers, mourning the loss of valuable shelf space, said they hoped the bankruptcy filing would be a chance for the bookseller to reinvent itself. But they were also skeptical that the company’s deep-rooted problems could be overcome.Borders told publishers on Wednesday that it was working on a long-term plan for its revival.“It has become increasingly clear that in light of the environment of curtailed customer spending, our ongoing discussions with publishers and other vendor-related parties, and the company’s lack of liquidity, Borders Group does not have the capital resources it needs to be a viable competitor and which are essential for it to move forward with its business strategy to reposition itself successfully for the long term,” Mike Edwards, the company president, said in a statement.One area in which the chain has struggled is its online business. Borders, which was hurt by pressure from Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble and big-box stores like Wal-Mart, badly lagged behind Barnes & Noble in establishing a viable online book business. In 2001, it linked its online store to Amazon, but waited until 2008 to restart its own e-commerce site.Shake-ups at the top of the Borders corporate structure contributed to an overall sense of instability in the last several years. When other stores were downsizing or eliminating their music and DVD sections, Borders delayed scaling back its own.Borders also opened stores overseas, a move that analysts said stretched the company thin.“They overexpanded,” said Michael Norris, senior analyst with Simba Information, which provides research and advice to publishers. “They just had the mentality of, ‘If we open a new store, the growth will happen.’ ”As e-reading began to take off, Barnes & Noble created its own signature product, the Nook, to compete against the Amazon Kindle. Borders, in contrast, carried at least six devices, including the Kobo, the Velocity Micro Cruz tablet, the Sony Pocket Edition and the Franklin AnyBook, an audio-only reader shaped like a remote control.None of them have gained significant traction with consumers, compared with the more popular Kindle and Nook. For the last five years, Borders stock has drifted downward and the number of employees reduced to 19,500 from 35,000.Its same-store sales were down more than 12 percent in the third quarter of 2010, with a loss of $74.4 million.In conversations with publishers last year, top executives at Borders said they were confident the troubled company could revamp, even suggesting that some stores would be outfitted with wine bars to offer a more social atmosphere. The executives also said they believed there was a strong possibility that Borders could eventually merge with Barnes & Noble.Borders has been in crisis mode since December, when it stopped paying publishers for books shipped through the holiday season. The company asked publishers to accept i.o.u.’s for their missed payments, a proposal that publishers considered but eventually rejected.Now publishers, burned by Borders’ unpaid bills, have been left to decide whether they will resume shipping books to Borders. Several publishers said they are not convinced, given the company’s financial instability.Others said they would consider it if Borders was willing to pay in cash, an arrangement that Borders indicated that it would be open to. A spokesman for the Ingram Book Group, a major wholesaler, said on Wednesday that the company stopped shipping books to Borders — at Borders’ request — but that it would resume shipping books “as the process allows.”Large publishers have grimly accepted that they will lose millions on books they shipped to Borders throughout the holidays. Besides Penguin, other publishers owed money include the Hachette Book Group, Simon & Schuster, Random House, HarperCollins and Macmillan.A spokeswoman for Penguin said in an e-mail that “Penguin hopes that Borders will emerge from this process as a smaller but stronger book retailer, and will work closely with Borders management to support this transition. Penguin has been following developments at Borders very closely for many months and has taken appropriate steps to mitigate the financial impact of the company’s bankruptcy on Penguin.”Borders said it had secured $505 million in financing from lenders led by GE Capital to keep it operating through the court process. One publisher estimated that it was enough money to last two to four months.Last month, GE Capital had offered Borders a $550 million loan commitment, but one that was dependent on the company’s reaching certain milestones, including securing $125 million in junior debt. That money would have come in large part from persuading publishers to accept interest-bearing i.o.u.’s in lieu of missed payments.The two biggest equity holders — William A. Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management and the group’s chairman and chief executive, the financier Bennett S. LeBow — may suffer the most from the bankruptcy filing. Neither Mr. Ackman nor Mr. LeBow has made additional investments in Borders since the company began looking for new financing.Last year, Mr. Ackman had proposed lending Borders up to $960 million to finance a merger of the company with its larger rival, Barnes & Noble. He still supports a deal, but only if Borders is able to shed enough underperforming stores, a person briefed on the matter said.Many retailers, including Amazon.com and independents, stand to benefit from a reduction in Borders stores. Barnes & Noble, the nation’s largest book chain, will be the biggest beneficiary, said Peter Wahlstrom, a retail analyst with Morningstar Equity Research, who suggested that customers would move their dollars to the next-closest retailer.It also gives Barnes & Noble the chance to use its position as leverage with publishers and landlords. “Does it provide an opportunity for Barnes & Noble to go back and fight for lower rates with their real estate owners?” Mr. Wahlstrom said. “Or, No. 2, does it provide a catalyst for Barnes & Noble to go back and get better terms from publishers and distributors?”Borders’ struggles as a corporate behemoth are a world apart from its origins. Susan Orlean, the author of “The Orchid Thief,” said she remembered spending hours in a Borders as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan in the 1970s. “I was a poor college student, and they were always very welcoming,” she said. “It was a wonderful bookstore. Borders always felt smaller and more human scale, sort of handmade.”'"
"'11-02-17,'1','Funds belonging to the family of Hosni Mubarak, the former Egyptian president, or his senior ministers have been discovered in Switzerland, a Swiss government official said Wednesday. But the official declined to specify how much money had been identified or who controlled the account.“The first traces have been identified,” said the Swiss official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “At the end of the week, we might have a better picture.”The disclosure came as the new military-led Egyptian government confirmed that it had asked countries across the Western and Arab worlds to freeze the assets of senior former government officials. But the statement from the government did not say whether the list included Mr. Mubarak and his family members. Egyptian opposition members said they feared that the military would shield Mr. Mubarak, a former air force chief, and his relatives from an investigation.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','MEXICO CITY — The gunmen who attacked two American law enforcement officials in Mexico on Tuesday, killing one and wounding the other, knew they were firing on foreign officers but proceeded anyway, current and former American officials said Wednesday.But an important unresolved question is whether the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were attacked because of their work — more than one Mexican drug gang has expressed interest in killing American officers — or for another reason, like an attempt to steal their dark and presumably armored S.U.V., a vehicle favored by drug gangs.The Justice and Homeland Security Departments announced on Wednesday the creation of a task force to work with Mexican federal authorities to investigate the shooting, which killed Jaime Zapata and wounded his colleague, Victor Avila. Mr. Zapata was the first American immigration agent to be killed in Mexico.The men were shot as they traveled in their vehicle, which had diplomatic plates, on a main highway to Mexico City from San Luis Potosí, about 265 miles to the north. Mr. Avila was released from an American hospital on Wednesday after being treated for gunshot wounds to his legs.American and Mexican officials would not comment about the reason for the shooting, saying they had not yet determined a motive.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','Contingent value rights are a nice idea. The ones structured for Sanofi-Aventis’s purchase of Genzyme helped seal the $20 billion deal. But the drawbacks posed by these rights should limit their use to special cases.In the Sanofi-Genzyme deal, Sanofi will pay the cash price and also pay Genzyme shareholders more if certain thresholds are reached in revenue from the multiple sclerosis treatment Lemtrada. If sales rise above $2.8 billion a year before the end of 2020, the rights will ultimately be worth $3.8 billion, an extra $14 a share on top of the $74-a-share cash price. Genzyme’s hopes for sales run higher than that. But if revenue fails to reach $1.8 billion a year — the more pessimistic view shared by Sanofi and most analysts — the rights will be worth at most around $1 billion, or $4 a share.Sanofi won’t mind, though, if the drug is a blockbuster. Suppose Lemtrada meets Genzyme’s expectations and brings in $3.5 billion a year. Using the industry rule-of-thumb valuation of five times sales for a drug with reasonable patent protection, the drug would be worth perhaps $17.5 billion at that point. That would leave plenty of money on the table for Sanofi even after the rights payoff.It’s a neat way to close a gap in expectations. But investors mostly don’t like contingent rights. Their specialized nature and limited shelf life mean they tend to be illiquid. And the inherent uncertainty tends to mean they trade at a discount, even to an objective estimate of their fair value.Such instruments are particularly unpopular among the marginal investors that can make or break a deal — arbitrage investors. They tend to buy into companies involved in transactions, and they like to bet one way or another. An illiquid add-on that drags out a deal’s final denouement for several years doesn’t suit them.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','HONG KONG — Premier Wen Jiabao of China and his cabinet decided Wednesday to “streamline” the country’s rare earth industry by consolidating production, clamping down on illegal mining and clearly deciding which government agencies would oversee it, the government said.State media reported last summer that two government agencies had drafted proposals for the cabinet calling for a few state-owned rare earth mining enterprises to take over the country’s legal and illegal private rare earth mines and consolidate production.In a statement on Wednesday, the government did not specify how production would be consolidated. But Beijing officials and industry executives have been predicting that the government would order mergers to produce as few as three state-owned businesses that would coordinate production and prices.China mines 95 percent of the world’s rare earths, a group of 17 physical elements that are crucial for smartphones, computers, compact fluorescent bulbs, medical imaging equipment, oil refining and many military technologies. Chinese officials have complained for years that vigorous competition among many small rare earth mining companies had kept prices too low — a popular phrase recently has been that China was exporting “gold for the price of cabbages.”The statement on Wednesday was vague about how regulatory authority would be clarified, but noted that the ministry of land resources in Beijing had asserted regulatory control last month over 11 rare earth mining districts totaling 965 square miles in southern Jiangxi province. Local and provincial agencies previously oversaw the districts but struggled to control environmentally destructive illegal mining by organized crime syndicates, whose huge profits allow them to buy influence with local officials.China has been reducing its annual rare earth export quotas since 2006, and particularly in the last two years. The Chinese government set off international alarm in September when it imposed an unannounced embargo for two months on shipments of raw rare earths to Japan during a territorial dispute. It halted some shipments to the United States and Europe as well for a week in October.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','Funny, in that yogurt began catching on in the 1970s because many Americans perceived it to be healthier than other foods they ate then. Ah, progress.“Zorba would happily dance the Sirtaki to celebrate the robust sales surge of Greek yogurt these days,” said Phil Lempert, editor of The Lempert Report, a food industry newsletter.“Consumers are finally discovering what yogurt is supposed to taste like, without all those sweeteners, coloring and preservatives,” Mr. Lempert wrote in an e-mail, “and are willing to pay more for it.” Greek yogurt can cost twice as much, or more, than regular yogurt like Dannon or Yoplait.As sales soar for Greek yogurts like Chobani and Fage, sold by Fage Dairy Industries, the giant yogurt makers are jumping in.Yoplait, from General Mills, has brought out Yoplait Greek. The Stonyfield Farm division of Groupe Danone, which also owns Dannon, sells a Greek yogurt under the Oikos name.And Kraft Foods, which left the yogurt business — Chobani got its start in a former Kraft plant in South Edmeston, N.Y. — recently introduced a Greek yogurt under the Athenos brand name that it also uses for foods like hummus.In fact, Kraft plans to begin the first television advertising for the Athenos product line on Feb. 28 with a campaign from Droga5 in New York that will also include magazine and digital ads and social media like Facebook and YouTube.“Everybody wants to get on the wagon,” Hamdi Ulukaya, president and chief executive at Agro Farma in New Berlin, N.Y., said in an interview at which he and Doron Stern, vice president for marketing, offered a preview of the campaign.The ads are rooted in social media to reflect how since the introduction of Chobani in 2007 “consumers have said, ‘I’m going to tell all my friends and family about this,’ ” Mr. Ulukaya said.“The ‘love stories’ idea is a celebration of the passion people feel about our products,” he added.The consumers in the initial two commercials were among those who previously reached out to Agro Farma to convey their ardor for Chobani. One, Stephen Wright, a student from Cortland, N.Y., tells how he once took an 80-mile bicycle ride to the Chobani factory “just to see where my favorite yogurt is made.”In the other commercial, Stephanie Lane, an office worker from Richmond, Va., describes how she found “a supersecret hiding place” in the break-room refrigerator to foil colleagues who kept pilfering her Chobani.“Probably the most stories that come in to Chobani are about getting your yogurt stolen at work,” Peter McGuinness, chairman and chief executive at Gotham in New York, said, laughing.“We did not want a ‘corporate-out’ campaign,” he added. “We wanted a ‘consumer-up’ campaign, to tap into and extend the ‘Chobani love’ that is rapidly spreading across the country.”The campaign uses a theme, “Nothing but good,” that was developed for Chobani as part of a test campaign in late 2009 by TDA Advertising and Design in Boulder, Colo. Gotham was hired a year later “as we started growing and needing more services,” Mr. Stern said.Also working on the campaign is ID Media, an Interpublic agency that handles direct-response media, and the New York office of a London agency, Unruly Media, which specializes in so-called social video — distributing video clips on blogs and Web sites to help stimulate word of mouth.“We’ve been working in the U.S. for other clients like Samsung and Heineken as part of global campaigns,” said Art Zeidman, who joined Unruly as United States president from Google, “but this is our first campaign that is U.S.-originated.”Unruly is arranging for sites like mommydaddyblog.com, notecook.com and passportdelicious.com to carry the Chobani commercials along with a two-minute clip about the making of the spots.For the 52 weeks that ended on Jan. 23, Chobani sales in supermarkets, drug stores and mass-merchandise stores (excluding Wal-Mart) totaled $257.3 million, according to data from the SymphonyIRI Group, a market research firm in Chicago, up 225.9 percent from the same period a year before.Fage sales totaled $141.7 million, SymphonyIRI reported, up 66.3 percent, followed by Oikos at $55 million, up 53.8 percent. (Athenos, relatively new, had sales of $1 million.)Chobani is countering the efforts by the yogurt giants to encroach on its turf by moving into one of their specialty areas: children’s yogurt. Chobani Champions, billed as the first Greek yogurt for children, was brought out last month.And Agro Farma wants to open a second plant, Mr. Ulukaya said, adding, “We believe the Greek yogurt story in this country is just starting.”'"
"'11-02-17,'1','BRIAN MESSANA and Toby O’Rorke, architects who run the Manhattan firm Messana O’Rorke, favor interiors that are white, bright and clutter-free.As Mr. Messana put it: “We’re not really knickknack people.”When they design homes for clients, he said, “in essence, we create museums,” meaning that every object on display is carefully considered.“We want people to have things,” Mr. O’Rorke added hastily. “But not all over the place, all the time.”The odd ornate piece is fine, they conceded, but usually they prefer simple forms that don’t call attention to themselves.“A lot of the items we like feel like they haven’t been designed at all,” Mr. Messana said.“They’re pared down and simple — not frouffy,” Mr. O’Rorke said.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','THOMAS WARNKE found his house on Craigslist, and he knows how odd that will sound to some people. “Normally one goes to Craigslist for used bikes and rentals, not properties in the hundreds of thousands,” said Mr. Warnke, 43, an architect who moved here from Germany 11 years ago. “And, of course, I was aware that for some other things it could be seen as a little sketchy.”But Mr. Warnke had become frustrated with more-conventional means of finding property — looking with brokers and searching real estate ads — particularly after seeing a deal fall through when the sellers decided at the last minute to raise the price of a house he was buying. And the standard real estate listings offered nothing near the area he had his heart set on: the still-undeveloped waterfront in Red Hook, Brooklyn.So three years ago, when he saw an ad on Craigslist for a “Charming 2 Story Carriage House” for $775,000, two blocks from the water in Red Hook, he was intrigued. And because he was an architect, the cautionary phrase “needs TLC — get your architect ready!” only served as further enticement.When he went to see the 1899 building, he was equally undaunted by what surrounded it: the vacant lots on either side, the large expanse of overgrown land behind and the neighboring house that appeared to be collapsing.He quickly made an offer, buying the 2,000-square-foot house for $760,000, and moved in.The ground floor, an open garage, was uninhabitable, but the cramped apartment on the second floor was livable enough while he completed plans for the renovation — most of the time. “There were three nights when the roof was open and it poured with rain,” he said. “So that was unpleasant.”'"
"'11-02-17,'1','Increasingly, Mr. Warren said, private colleges are competing with the flagship universities in their region. California Lutheran University allows incoming students who have been admitted to some University of California campuses to enroll for the same price they would pay at the public university. Other colleges seek to entice desirable candidates by offering them a similar deal.Something of that sort was on Mr. McCardell’s mind as well. In the past two years, in head-to-head competitions for students, Sewanee lost 46 to the University of Georgia, 39 to the University of Tennessee, 37 to the University of Virginia and 28 to the University of North Carolina.The new tuition would put Sewanee within striking distance of the out-of-state tuition at Georgia ($27,000 this year, without room and board, and probably substantially more next year).Mr. McCardell, the former president of Middlebury College in Vermont, emphasizes that Sewanee is by no means in dire straits, and the pressures and challenges it faces are much the same as those that many — probably most — other small liberal arts colleges are encountering.Like most, Sewanee has a declining number of students paying full tuition, and a rising number who pay a discounted rate. Nearly 3 out of every 4 students received some financial aid, including loans. The applicant pool is growing, as students submit applications to more colleges — but the percentage of admitted students who choose to enroll at Sewanee is shrinking, and, at just under 24 percent, is at its lowest level of the past decade.“The trends are discouraging, and what we definitely don’t want to do is move, however slowly, in the direction of dying,” Mr. McCardell said.The price cut at Sewanee will mean that, over the next three years, about $6 million to $8 million less will flow into the college’s coffers. That means Sewanee may have to draw more heavily on its $315 million endowment for a few years.But Mr. McCardell, in a memo to the board of regents broaching the idea of cutting tuition, suggested that other considerations were paramount.The memo read, in part: “If we believe this is the right thing to do; if we believe it will benefit the university in significant, even fundamental, ways; if we believe in the quality of our product; if we believe that all we need to do is bring Sewanee to the attention of a wider audience; and if we believe that there is a value, however computed, to boldness and leadership, then we will figure out how to cover the shortfall.”Sewanee’s approach goes against the grain. Of the 19 colleges that have cut tuition since 1996, most have been little-known institutions with serious problems. More common have been decisions to increase tuition and fees sharply, in search of what is widely known as the Chivas Regal effect — the perception that high price equals high quality.And that has sometimes been a boon to colleges. After Hendrix College in Arkansas raised its tuition and fees 29 percent in 2004, for example, its freshman class grew by 37 percent.Mr. McCardell, though, is not sure that would work in the current economic environment.“When you look at those things, you have to remember that that was then and this is now,” he said.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','And the numbers may keep climbing. In December, the E.P.A. said it might set the value of preventing cancer deaths 50 percent higher than other deaths, because cancer kills slowly. A report last year financed by the suggested that the value of preventing deaths from terrorism might be 100 percent higher than other deaths.The trend is a sensitive subject for an administration that is trying to improve its relationship with the business community, much of which has bitterly opposed the expansion of regulation. The White House said the decisions on the value of life were made by the agencies. The agencies, for their part, referred any questions to the White House.“This administration utilizes the best available science in assessing the benefits and costs of any potential regulation, drawing on widely accepted methodologies that have been in use for years,” Meg Reilly, a spokeswoman for the , which oversees the rule-making process, said in an e-mail.Several independent experts, however, said that the increases were long overdue, noting that some agencies had been using the same values for more than a decade without adjusting for inflation. One office at the E.P.A. cut the value of life in 2004.“Agencies have been using numbers that I thought were just too low,” said W. Kip Viscusi, a professor of economics at whose research is cited by most of the federal agencies as the basis for their calculations.Businesses would prefer to discuss the consequences of the increases — new regulations and higher costs, which they say are hampering economic growth — rather than suggest that the government has overstated the value of life.But some industry representatives said assigning a value to life was inherently subjective, and that the recent changes were driven by the administration’s pursuit of its regulatory agenda rather than scientific considerations.“It looks like they just cooked the books — they just doubled the numbers,” said Todd Spencer, executive vice president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, a trade group for the trucking industry, which faces higher costs under some of the Transportation Department’s new rules. The Bush administration rejected a plan in 2005 to make car companies double the roof strength of new vehicles, which it estimated might prevent 135 deaths in rollover accidents each year.At the time, Transportation officials figured that the cost of the roofs would exceed the value of lives saved by almost $800 million. So the agency proposed a smaller increase in roof strength that might save 44 lives a year.Last year, the Obama administration imposed the stricter and more expensive roof-strength standard, and it published a new set of calculations showing that the benefits outstripped the costs.Most of the difference came from the increased value of human life. By raising that number to $6.1 million from a figure of $3.5 million in the original study, the Obama administration rendered those 135 lives — and hundreds of averted injuries — more valuable than the roofs.The pattern of increases is scrambling a long-standing political dynamic. The business community historically has pushed for regulators to put a dollar value on life, part of a broader campaign to make agencies prove that the benefits of proposed regulations exceed the costs.But some business groups are reconsidering the effectiveness of cost-benefit analysis as a check on regulations. The United States Chamber of Commerce is now campaigning for Congress to assert greater control over the rule-making process, reflecting a judgment that formulas may offer less reliable protection than politicians.Some consumer groups, meanwhile, find themselves cheering the government’s results but reluctant to embrace the method. Advocates for increased regulation have long argued that cost-benefit analysis understates both the value of life and the benefits of government oversight.“If analysis is going to be imposed on the rule-making process, we want higher values for injury and for fatalities,” said Robert Weissman, president of , which pushed the Transportation Department to reconsider the roof-strength regulation.But Mr. Weissman said he still believed that such analysis was an impediment to necessary regulation.“The bigger picture is absent,” he said. “How do you do cost-benefit analysis on ? It constrains the imagination. It really is a constraint in terms of bounding what is given serious consideration.”The current rise in the value of life is based on the work of Professor Viscusi, who wrote his first paper on cost-benefit analysis as a Harvard undergraduate in the early 1970s. He won a prize and found a career.The idea he and others have since developed in a long string of studies is that differences in wages show the value that workers place on avoiding the risk of death. Say that companies must pay lumberjacks an additional $1,000 a year to perform work that generally kills one in 1,000 workers. It follows that most Americans would forgo $1,000 a year to avoid that risk — and that 1,000 Americans will collectively forgo $1 million to avoid the same risk entirely. That number is said to be the “statistical value of life.”Professor Viscusi’s work pegs it at around $8.7 million in current dollars.Before the current administration, only the E.P.A. had fully embraced this methodology. Other agencies relied instead on the results of surveys asking Americans how much they would spend to avoid a given risk. This technique tends to produce significantly lower results. An even older technique, which yields even lower numbers, is to sum the wages lost when a worker dies. In 2000 the E.P.A set a baseline of $7.8 million, updated to current dollars. But in 2004, the office that issues clean air regulations reduced that baseline by $500,000 in an analysis of proposed limits on emissions from industrial boilers.Last year, the E.P.A. directed its various offices to return to the 2000 baseline, adjusting that figure for inflation and wage growth. In some recent studies, the E.P.A. has used a figure of $9.1 million after making those adjustments.The agency said at the same time that it was working to set a new standard. In a white paper issued in December, it raised the possibility that people might place a higher value on avoiding a slow death from cancer than a quick death in a car accident. It also broached a concept it described as “altruism,” the idea that people may place a higher value on the common good than on their own survival.John D. Graham, who oversaw the use of cost-benefit analysis during the George W. Bush administration, said that the scientific justification was “quite strong” for raising the values used by the Transportation Department, but he cautioned that the E.P.A. was going too far.“Why should the same clinical condition be valued differently at different federal agencies?” Mr. Graham, now dean of the School of Environmental and Public Affairs at , asked in an e-mailed response to questions.Many experts similarly ask why life itself should be valued differently. Agencies are allowed to set their own numbers. The E.P.A. and the Transportation Department use numbers that are $3 million apart. The process generally involves experts, but the decisions ultimately are made by political appointees.The Office of Management and Budget told agencies in 2004 that they should pick a number between $1 million and $10 million. That guidance remains in effect, although the office has more recently warned agencies that it would be difficult to justify the use of numbers under $5 million, two administration officials said.Close observers of the process point to two reasons for the variation in numbers. First, they say that setting a single standard is not worth the high-stakes battle that would be required with advocates on both sides. The Obama administration, like its predecessors, has preferred to deal with the issue informally, on an agency-by-agency basis.Second, they say the lack of a standard preserves flexibility.The Food and Drug Administration issued a rule in 2009 requiring new warning labels on packages and bottles of acetaminophen and other drugs. Its justification valued life at $5 million. A few months later, the agency acknowledged that it had calculated the cost of adding one new label, while requiring two new labels. However, the agency continued, the benefits still exceeded the costs because the value of life was $7 million.A few months later, in an unrelated rule regarding , the agency once again cited a value of $5 million, which it said best reflected the available research. And in its recent study on cigarette labels, the agency cited a value of $7.9 million.“The reality is that politics frequently trumps economics,” said Robert Hahn, a leading scholar of the American regulatory process who is now a professor at the University of in . But he said that putting a price tag on life still was worthwhile, to help politicians choose among priorities and to shape the details of their proposals.“Even small changes,” he said, “can save billions of dollars.”'"

Firesheep grabs that cookie, allowing nosy or malicious users to, in essence, be you on the site and have full access to your account.More than a million people have downloaded the program in the last three months (including this reporter, who is not exactly a computer genius). And it is easy to use.The only sites that are safe from snoopers are those that employ the cryptographic protocol Transport Layer Security or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer, throughout your session. PayPal and many banks do this, but a startling number of sites that people trust to safeguard their privacy do not. You know you are shielded from prying eyes if a little lock appears in the corner of your browser or the Web address starts with “https” rather than “http.”“The usual reason Web sites give for not encrypting all communication is that it will slow down the site and would be a huge engineering expense,” said Chris Palmer, technology director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an electronic rights advocacy group based in San Francisco. “Yes, there are operational hurdles, but they are solvable.”Indeed, Gmail made end-to-end encryption its default mode in January 2010. Facebook began to offer the same protection as an opt-in security feature last month, though it is so far available only to a small percentage of users and has limitations. For example, it doesn’t work with many third-party applications.“It’s worth noting that Facebook took this step, but it’s too early to congratulate them,” said Mr. Butler, who is frustrated that “https” is not the site’s default setting. “Most people aren’t going to know about it or won’t think it’s important or won’t want to use it when they find out that it disables major applications.”Joe Sullivan, chief security officer at Facebook, said the company was engaged in a “deliberative rollout process,” to access and address any unforeseen difficulties. “We hope to have it available for all users in the next several weeks,” he said, adding that the company was also working to address problems with third-party applications and to make “https” the default setting.Many Web sites offer some support for encryption via “https,” but they make it difficult to use. To address these problems, the Electronic Frontier Foundation in collaboration with the Tor Project, another group concerned with Internet privacy, released in June an add-on to the browser Firefox, called Https Everywhere. The extension, which can be downloaded at eff.org/https-everywhere, makes “https” the stubbornly unchangeable default on all sites that support it.Since not all Web sites have “https” capability, Bill Pennington, chief strategy officer with the Web site risk management firm WhiteHat Security in Santa Clara, Calif., said: “I tell people that if you’re doing things with sensitive data, don’t do it at a Wi-Fi hot spot. Do it at home.”But home wireless networks may not be all that safe either, because of free and widely available Wi-Fi cracking programs like Gerix WiFi Cracker, Aircrack-ng and Wifite. The programs work by faking legitimate user activity to collect a series of so-called weak keys or clues to the password. The process is wholly automated, said Mr. Kitchen at Hak5, allowing even techno-ignoramuses to recover a wireless router’s password in a matter of seconds. “I’ve yet to find a WEP-protected network not susceptible to this kind of attack,” Mr. Kitchen said.A WEP-encrypted password (for wired equivalent privacy) is not as strong as a WPA (or Wi-Fi protected access) password, so it’s best to use a WPA password instead. Even so, hackers can use the same free software programs to get on WPA password-protected networks as well. It just takes much longer (think weeks) and more computer expertise.Using such programs along with high-powered Wi-Fi antennas that cost less than $90, hackers can pull in signals from home networks two to three miles away. There are also some computerized cracking devices with built-in antennas on the market, like WifiRobin ($156). But experts said they were not as fast or effective as the latest free cracking programs, because the devices worked only on WEP-protected networks.To protect yourself, changing the Service Set Identifier or SSID of your wireless network from the default name of your router (like Linksys or Netgear) to something less predictable helps, as does choosing a lengthy and complicated alphanumeric password.Setting up a virtual private network, or V.P.N., which encrypts all communications you transmit wirelessly whether on your home network or at a hot spot, is even more secure. The data looks like gibberish to a snooper as it travels from your computer to a secure server before it is blasted onto the Internet.Popular V.P.N. providers include VyprVPN, HotSpotVPN and LogMeIn Hamachi. Some are free; others are as much as $18 a month, depending on how much data is encrypted. Free versions tend to encrypt only Web activity and not e-mail exchanges.However, Mr. Palmer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation blames poorly designed Web sites, not vulnerable Wi-Fi connections, for security lapses. “Many popular sites were not designed for security from the beginning, and now we are suffering the consequences,” he said. “People need to demand ‘https’ so Web sites will do the painful integration work that needs to be done.”'"
"'11-02-17,'1','Republicans lambasted the report as flawed. Representative Ed Royce of California said the document did not place sufficient blame on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government finance entities. (The report found that they were not central to the crisis.)Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina said the document was “a clipping service” of previously published findings, and Representative Francisco R. Canseco of Texas called it merely “a step-by-step accounting of the crisis.” (Though most of its findings were no surprise, the commission held 19 days of hearings, conducted 700 interviews and gathered millions of pages of documents.)Representative Robert Dold, Republican of Illinois, said Democrats had used the report “to support pre-established political philosophies.” Representative Michael Grimm, Republican of New York, said some commissioners were “more interested in following an ideological agenda than in producing a report that would assist Congress.”Representative Maxine Waters of California suggested that the critics were trying to detract attention from the panel’s findings. “My fear is that some of my colleagues will try to rewrite history, and perhaps some of those in the public, listening to their messages, will forget the true cause of how we got here,” she said.Of the four Republicans who dissented, three, including Mr. Thomas, did not substantially disagree with the Democratic majority. Mr. Thomas said the main differences were: a focus on a global credit bubble fed by capital flows across borders, which the majority did not emphasize; Republicans favored less attention to the structure of the mortgage finance system in the United States, since other countries with very different mortgage systems also experienced housing crashes; and also an emphasis on problems financial services firms shared — like concentrated exposure to housing and poor risk management — rather than failures of individual executives and regulators.“However, when you are looking for victims and villains, rather than essential causes, you can examine the same set of facts and arrive at diametrically different conclusions,” Mr. Thomas said.Mr. Angelides said the majority did not pull its punches. For example, he noted that the report assailed as inadequate the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s oversight of Citigroup, the banking giant that ultimately needed a federal bailout.At the time, the New York Fed was led by Timothy F. Geithner, now the Treasury secretary. It was Citigroup’s primary regulator, though it shared the duties with other regulators whose failings were also cited.“We found, without regard to party, without regard to private sector or public sector, that this crisis was avoidable,” Mr. Angelides said.Mr. Thomas questioned that conclusion, citing testimony by the financier Warren E. Buffett, who said that no one had anticipated a nationwide fall in home prices. “If Warren Buffett didn’t know it was coming, how can you say, very nonchalantly, it all could have been avoided?”The impact of the report was already blunted by the fact that the Dodd-Frank Act, a far-reaching overhaul of financial regulation, was signed into law in July.Mr. Angelides offered a strong endorsement of the new law, saying it had addressed many of the failings examined by the commission, which was responsible for looking at causes, not recommending solutions. Mr. Thomas, in contrast, called the law a case of “regulatory overreach.”That the report was recording healthy sales — even though it is available free at fcic.gov — was nearly the only development that was not met with partisan rancor. Though the proceeds will go to the government, one skeptic, Representative David Schweikert, Republican of Arizona, quipped, “I’m really beginning to question Americans’ reading habits.”'"
"'11-02-17,'1','Producer prices rose in January to their highest rate in more than two years, hinting at a build up in inflation pressures as the recovery gathers pace.The core Producer Price Index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.5 percent, the highest since October 2008, the Labor Department said on Wednesday.The advance came after increases of 0.9 percent in December and 0.7 percent in November.The rise in producer prices, which exceeded economists’ expectations for a 0.2 percent gain, reflected a jump in pharmaceutical preparations, which accounted for 40 percent of the increase.“The price increase might be a little troubling because it suggests that inflation is spreading across all raw materials,” said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors in West Conshohocken, Pa. “If you print money and have a stronger economy you’re going to have some inflationary pressures,” he said.The rise in core index comes at a time when a surge in commodity prices has caused most advanced economies to raise red flags on inflation. The Federal Reserve has so far shown little concern about pricing pressures, and officials have repeatedly said that core consumer inflation remains too low for comfort. Economists believe that could change.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','For any savvy operagoer, an evening spent with “The Bartered Bride,” a rustic comedy by Smetana more widely known about than actually seen, is an evening spent waiting for the other shoe to drop. Introduced in 1866 and completed in 1870, this romantic frolic is built on a plot twist predictable from miles away, a triumph of true love over cynical calculation. The ending is never in doubt, yet the opera remains irresistible for its charming characters and lively pace, and, above all, for its rich, colorful score: part bubbly operetta, part Bohemian folk pageant.James Levine plainly loves this music. A DVD of a 1978 Metropolitan Opera performance that he conducted is included in a recent boxed set celebrating his 40th anniversary as the company’s music director. Small wonder, then, that the Met would devote its resources to a fresh staging, engaging substantial collaborators including the director Stephen Wadsworth, the choreographer Benjamin Millepied and the poet J.D. McClatchy, who created a new English translation of Karel Sabina’s Czech libretto.What is unusual about the undertaking, unveiled on Tuesday night, is that it takes place in the Peter Jay Sharp Theater at the Juilliard School, representing the tightest collaboration yet in an increasingly cozy relationship between the Met and the school. The cast comprises members and graduates of the Met’s Lindemann Young Artist Development Program and the Ellen and James S. Marcus Institute for Vocal Arts at Juilliard. In the pit Mr. Levine steers the Juilliard Orchestra, which showed a responsiveness on Tuesday not unlike that of his usual luxury vehicle at the Met.This is something of a trial run. The creative team will create an expanded version of the production for a future Met season. Still, there is nothing undercooked about the single-set Juilliard staging, which painlessly moves the action from the late 19th century to the World War II era. A large area serves as a bustling cafe, with a smaller space to the side for more intimate scenes; upstage, members of Juilliard Dance bounce through Mr. Millepied’s folksy choreography almost continually.Mr. McClatchy’s translation, characteristically clever and packed with cheeky wordplay, neatly serves the characters and situations, and mostly suits music originally tailored to Czech cadences. The singers delivered their lines so clearly here that the projected titles provided were rarely necessary.Layla Claire and Paul Appleby, as the young lovers Marenka and Jenik, were winsomely moony together and playfully potent apart. Jordan Bisch brought a robust sound and buffo presence to Kecal, the scheming marriage fixer. Alexander Lewis was both amusing and touching as Vasek, Jenik’s stuttering stepbrother. Among smaller roles, Renee Tatum was imperious as Hata, Vasek’s mother; Joyce El-Khoury played a brightly seductive Esmeralda.The entire company is kept active throughout Mr. Wadsworth’s busy conception, with a great many feet bounding, leaping, prancing on point and pedaling a unicycle before that proverbial other shoe drops. (Mr. Appleby’s solo dance, practically a choreographed tantrum, is a particular delight.) The constant bustle needlessly distracted at times. But Smetana’s bountiful score, buoyantly conveyed, held up against all competition.'"
"'11-02-17,'1','NEW DELHI — Faced with broad criticism of his government and of his own performance, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India on Wednesday vowed to complete his term while promising to crack down on corruption scandals that have stained India’s image at home and abroad.Mr. Singh, who leads India’s coalition United Progress Alliance government, sought to directly address mounting speculation about his own status and about whether his government — with more than three years remaining in its five-year term — was capable of righting itself and addressing the litany of problems facing the nation.“We have a functioning government, and whatever some people will say — that we are a lame-duck government, that I am a lame-duck prime minister — we take our job very seriously,” he said in a nationally televised news conference. “We are here to govern and to govern effectively, tackle the problems as they arise, and get this country moving forward.”For months, India’s coalition government, led by the Indian National Congress Party, has been troubled by scandal, infighting and unmet expectations. Corruption scandals, covered feverishly in the Indian news media, have included malfeasance in the allocation of 2G telecommunications spectrum, questionable contracts in the staging of the Commonwealth Games, contractual irregularities in the national space program, and more.Mr. Singh, who has long enjoyed a reputation for probity, has found himself on the defensive in the telecom scandal, as critics have blamed him for failing to intervene with the country’s former telecom minister, Andimuthu Raja, even as irregularities were becoming apparent. Mr. Raja, a member of a south Indian party included in the coalition government, has since resigned and been arrested in connection with allegations that he cost the Indian treasury billions of dollars by selling spectrum to cellphone companies at below-market rates in exchange for bribes.'"

But its shares slipped after the results failed to meet analysts’ expectations.The automaker, based in Stuttgart, Germany, also said that it would resume paying a dividend. It canceled the payments for 2009 for the first time in more than a decade.Daimler, which makes vehicles including Mercedes-Benz cars and Daimler trucks, posted a fourth-quarter profit of 1.14 billion euros ($1.55 billion), in contrast to a loss of 352 million euros in the period a year ago. Revenue climbed 24 percent, to 26.4 billion euros.The crucial figure for analysts, earnings before interest and taxes, soared 249 percent, to 1.56 billion euros.But a Reuters poll showed that the market had expected an even bigger gain, to almost 2.1 billion euros. The company said increased spending on research and development held back earnings before interest and taxes.'"

"'11-02-18,'1','The Finance Ministry said Thursday that an “erroneous” audit and inadequate help from international banking advisers compounded financial problems at the embattled Kabul Bank. After meeting with a top United States Treasury official, the ministry said that “Afghan and U.S. officials agreed” that fraudulent and unethical behavior were at the heart of the crisis, but that it “was compounded by the erroneous audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers and inadequate international technical assistance and supervision.” An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, took issue with the statement, saying the responsibility of supervising Afghan banks rested with the Afghan government, not with outside auditors or international banking advisers. The audit was conducted by A. F. Ferguson & Company, a Pakistan-based member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, an international accounting and consulting company. A. F. Ferguson said Thursday, “We don’t understand the basis for this comment.” Last October, the deputy finance minister said audits done by the company did not mention irregularities.'"
"'11-02-18,'1','The San Francisco Police Department may be one step closer to getting Tasers.A recent spate of officer-involved shootings of mentally ill people has reignited the divisive debate over these controversial weapons, which have never been used by the department.The police department and other supporters, including former Mayor Gavin Newsom and the former police chief George Gascón, have said that stun guns are a safe, widely used law enforcement tool. But critics say they increase the risk of death and are abused by the police.Now the city’s police commission — a seven-member panel that guides department policies — appears ready to consider allowing the police to research and propose a pilot program, the first step toward equipping a small number of officers with stun guns.The commission will vote Feb. 23 on whether to allow the department’s proposal.Commissioners rejected a proposal in 2004 to allow Tasers, and another by Chief Gascón last year. In January, after officers shot a knife-wielding man in a wheelchair, Chief Gascón demanded that commissioners vote again, adding that Tasers “most likely would have ended this scenario,” but the commission delayed a decision.But now, as the police department, the police commission and the city at large work together to address the policies and practices regarding policing and the mentally ill, the tide may finally be turning.'"

"'11-02-18,'1','And already there are signs that the military is purging from the cabinet and ruling party advocates of market-oriented economic changes, like selling off state-owned companies and reducing barriers to trade.As the military began to take over, the government pushed out figures reviled for reaping excessive personal profits from the sell-off of public properties, most notably Mr. Mubarak’s younger son, Gamal, and his friend the steel magnate Ahmed Ezz. On Thursday, an Egyptian prosecutor ordered that Mr. Ezz be detained pending trial for corruption, along with two businessmen in the old cabinet — former Tourism Minister Zuhair Garana and former Housing Minister Ahmed el-Maghrabi — as well as former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli.But the military-led government also struck at advocates of economic openness, including the former finance minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali, who was forced from his job, and the former trade minister Rachid Mohamed Rachid, whose assets were frozen under allegations of corruption. Both are highly regarded internationally and had not been previously accused of corruption.“That mystified everybody,” said Hisham A. Fahmy, chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt.In an interview, Mr. Rachid said he felt like a scapegoat. “People who have been supporting liberal reforms or an open economy are being caught up in the anticorruption campaign,” he said. “My case is one of them.”“Now there are a lot of voices from the past talking about nationalization — ‘Why do we need a private sector?’ ” he added. He declined to talk specifically about the military but said that in general within the government, “some people have tried to say that the cause of the revolution was simply economic reform.”Though some Western analysts have guessed that the military’s empire makes up as much as a third of Egypt’s economy, Mr. Rachid said it was in fact less than 10 percent. But economists say that because of its vested interests they still worry that the military will impede the continuation of the transition from the state-dominated economy established under President Gamal Abdel Nasser to a more open and efficient free market that advanced under Mr. Mubarak.Moreover, the military’s power to guide policy is, at the moment, unchecked. The military has invited no civilian input into the transitional government, and it has enjoyed such a surge in prestige since it helped usher out Mr. Mubarak that almost no one in the opposition is criticizing it.“We trust them,” said Walid Rachid, a member of the April 6 Youth Movement that helped set off the revolt. “Because of the army our revolution has become safe.”Some of the young revolutionaries at the vanguard of the revolt identify themselves as leftists or socialists. And the idea of liberalizing the economy was thrown into disrepute because of the corrupt way that the Mubarak government carried out privatization, bestowing fortunes on a small circle around the ruling party while leaving most Egyptians struggling against grinding poverty and rampant inflation.“People think that liberalization creates corruption,” said Abdel Fattah el-Gibaly, director of economic research at Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. “I think we will go back, not exactly to socialism, but maybe halfway.”And the Egyptian military, said Mr. Springborg of the Naval Postgraduate School, is happy to go along. “The military is like the matador with the red cape attracting the bull of resentment against the corruption of the old regime,” he said, “and they are playing it very successfully.”Gen. Fathy el-Sady, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense Production, declined to comment, saying the minister in charge was tied up dealing with strikes at military-run companies.The military has used its leverage in times of crises to thwart free market reforms before, most notably during the 1977 bread riots set off after President Anwar el-Sadat cut subsidies for food prices to move toward a free market. The military agreed to quell the unrest only after extracting a promise from Mr. Sadat that he would reinstate the subsidies, said Michael Wahid Hanna, who studies Egypt’s military at the Century Foundation in Washington.Field Marshal Tantawi, the defense minister, and other senior officers were all commissioned before Mr. Sadat switched Egypt’s allegiance to the West in 1979. They trained in the former Soviet Union, where sprawling business empires under military control were not uncommon.“In the cabinet, where he still wields significant influence, Tantawi has opposed both economic and political reforms that he perceives as eroding central government power,” the American ambassador at the time, Francis J. Ricciardone Jr., wrote in one 2008 cable released by WikiLeaks.“On economic reform, Tantawi believes that Egypt’s economic reform plan fosters social instability by lessening G.O.E. controls over prices and production,” the ambassador added, referring to the government of Egypt and calling Field Marshal Tantawi “aging and change-resistant.”In a cable later that year describing the tensions pitting the military against the businessmen around Gamal Mubarak, the new ambassador, Margaret Scobey, wrote: “The military views the G.O.E.’s privatization efforts as a threat to its economic position, and therefore generally opposes economic reforms. We see the military’s role in the economy as a force that generally stifles free market reform by increasing direct government involvement in the markets.”Mr. Mubarak, scholars and Western diplomats say, allowed the military to expand its empire, ensuring the allegiance of its officers and quieting discontent by dismantling other state-owned businesses. And with so many businesses under their control, the military’s top officials have doled out chief executive jobs and weekends at military-owned resorts to cultivate loyalty. Though deprivation and inequality were major complaints leading to the uprising, economists credit the Mubarak government with expanding the economy and increasing its growth rate by loosening state controls and attracting foreign investment.But the Mubarak government carried out reforms from the top, without changing burdensome regulations that made it hard for small businesses to compete, and the benefits flowed mainly to a few. Most Egyptians felt, if anything, more impoverished, watching new Mercedeses and BMWs zip by donkey carts hauling garbage through the streets.“The Mubarak government privatized basically by offering state properties to their cronies,” said Ragui Assaad, an economist who studies Egypt at the University of Minnesota.Paul Sullivan, an expert on Egypt and its military at Georgetown University, said the military leaders were farsighted enough to see that stability would now require continued economic as well as political liberalization. But he also acknowledged the possibility of a return to the past. “There is a witch hunt for corruption, and there is a risk that the economy might go back to the days of Nasser,” the apex of centralized state control, he said.'"
"'11-02-18,'1','WASHINGTON — The House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, said Thursday that Republicans would not agree to a short-term extension of the spending measure now financing the federal government without additional cuts, sharply raising the stakes in a war of wills with Democrats that officials say could lead to a government shutdown early next month.The stopgap measure, which expires on March 4, has held spending generally to 2010 levels.House Republicans are close to approving a spending bill for the balance of the fiscal year that includes the largest spending cuts in modern history — a swift, huge slash of more than $60 billion from domestic programs and foreign aid that they say would fulfill their campaign promise to shrink government outlays.The bill, which covers spending through Sept. 30, seemed likely to be approved on Friday.Democrats say such drastic cuts would harm the fragile economic recovery. The White House has already threatened to veto it, and Senate Democrats have voiced strong objections. Senate Democrats are expected to put forward a temporary extension of the stopgap measure that would prevent a government shutdown and allow continued negotiations.But at a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Boehner said Republicans would not accept a temporary extension without additional reductions. “When we say we’re going to cut spending,” Mr. Boehner said, “Read my lips: we’re going to cut spending.”Mr. Boehner accused Democrats of seeking to shut the government to avoid making cuts.Democrats have been warning for weeks that Republicans were willing to risk a shutdown by insisting on steep cuts without being willing to compromise.“It is unproductive to resort to threats of a shutdown without any negotiations,” the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said in a statement on Thursday.If Mr. Reid puts forward a temporary extension of the stopgap measure, Senate Republicans would have to make a choice between blocking the bill with a filibuster or letting it pass and leaving their counterparts in the House to decide on shutting the government. Republicans were blamed for such a shutdown in 1995 during a standoff with the Clinton administration.After working through Wednesday night and into the predawn hours on Thursday, lawmakers returned to the House floor and clashed fiercely over proposed amendments to the spending measure. A final vote was not expected until Friday, but with the new Republican majority resolute in executing big cuts, approval was a foregone conclusion. Because the rules of debate required that any restorations in spending be offset with corresponding cuts elsewhere, the total reductions were certain to exceed the roughly $60 billion originally included in the spending measure by the House Appropriations Committee.While the final tally remained to be counted, there was no doubt that House Republicans would succeed in approving their bill after the sort of raucous, freewheeling debate that has been a rarity in the House in recent years. Rank-and-file lawmakers put forward hundreds of amendments, and the outcome of some votes went against the wishes of Republican leaders.Mr. Boehner said the debate underscored his commitment to letting the House work its will. But long before the vote, he was boasting of the outcome. “As part of our effort to liberate our economy from the shackles of out-of-control spending,” he said, “the House will soon vote to cut discretionary spending by over $100 billion over the last seven months of this fiscal year.”'"
"'11-02-18,'1','When the Supreme Court hears arguments next week, it will mark the fifth anniversary of Justice Clarence Thomas’s silence during oral argument — unless he chooses to re-enter the give-and-take. We hope he will.This milestone has stirred a wide conversation about his effectiveness as a justice following another about his ethics. They are actually related. How Justice Thomas comports himself on the bench is a matter of ethics and effectiveness, simultaneously. His authority as a justice and the court’s as an institution are at issue.Last week, 74 Democrats in Congress cited the threat to the court’s authority when they asked Justice Thomas to recuse himself from an expected review of the health care reform law. This came after an announcement by his wife, Virginia, a lobbyist, who said she will provide “advocacy and assistance” as “an ambassador to the Tea Party movement,” which, of course, is dedicated to the overturning of the health care law.The representatives based their request on the “appearance of a conflict of interest,” because of a conflict they see between his duty to be an impartial decision-maker and the Thomas household’s financial gain from her lobbying. If Mrs. Thomas were involved as a party in the litigation about the health law, or the litigation’s outcome proved central to her professional life, those classic conflicts would require him to recuse himself. The annual requirement that the justice disclose the sources of his household income is designed to address that issue.Still, the reputations of the justice and the court — which depend on public confidence — are at issue because of Mrs. Thomas’s lobbying. Justice Thomas’s attendance at a political event also seemed ill advised.The court relies on each justice individually to judge whether he or she should not hear a case because of bias or the appearance of bias. It’s a bad approach, but it underscores Justice Thomas’s responsibility for his comportment and for acting in ways that contribute to the court’s authority.'"
"'11-02-18,'1','“Few loans to ordinary customers are likely to be made outside the Q.R.M. construct; the loans that are made will be costlier and likely to be made only to more affluent customers.”In other words, Congress did not know what it was doing when it mandated the retention of risk, and the regulators should spare us such folly.If bankers had their way, only loans that were negatively amortizing, or had balloon payments, would be excluded. You could buy a house with no money down, so long as you took out mortgage insurance. Even interest-only loans would be acceptable in some instances, and what few rules there were could be circumvented because bankers would be given discretion when applying the rules.It now appears the regulators will not go nearly that far. According to people knowledgeable about the discussions, the regulators are likely to propose that the definition allow only loans with a down payment of at least 20 percent. Adjustable-rate loans would be permitted, but there would be limits on how large an adjustment would be allowed. These people spoke on the condition that they not be named.One provision likely to set off controversy is a limit on how that 20 percent down payment is obtained. The buyer would have to put up at least half of it — 10 percent of the purchase price — from his or her own holdings. The rest could be a gift, from parents, for instance, but it could not come from seller concessions or from borrowing. Mortgage insurance would not enable a nonqualifying loan to become qualifying.The regulators hope the result of this will be two vibrant mortgage markets, with a substantial share of mortgages in each market. If a qualified mortgage is defined too broadly, there would be few other loans made, and even fewer of them would be able to be packaged in securities, when and if a private-label market for those securities begins to function again. Without enough available loans, no such market would be likely to develop.The bankers’ solid front on the issue was shattered by Wells Fargo, which suggested that only loans with a 30 percent down payment — a 70 percent loan-to-value ratio — should qualify. Other bankers were horrified.In an interview, John P. Gibbons, an executive vice president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, said he thought “skin in the game” made sense and would make it more likely that private investors would again be willing to invest in mortgage securities that did not have a government guarantee.“You gain confidence when you go to a restaurant and see an owner is eating his own food,” he said.That was the view of Barney Frank, the Massachusetts congressman whose name is attached to the law. “We’re basically saying now, ‘You’ve got to keep 5 percent of that,’ ” he said after the law was passed. “That way we’ll just get better-quality loans made in the future.”One reason some lenders oppose skin in the game is that they do not have enough capital to cushion the additional risk. Those not affiliated with depository institutions are not used to keeping loans on their books, and a requirement that they do so could reduce the amount of competition. That could help well-capitalized banks, like Wells Fargo, the largest mortgage lender in the country. According to Mortgage Daily, a trade publication, Wells Fargo had a 25 percent market share for mortgage loans made in 2010.The group of regulators, which includes the Securities and Exchange Commission and bank regulatory agencies, as well as the agency that supervises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, must also decide just what constitutes “skin in the game.” The law says banks should keep a 5 percent stake, but it does not say how that should be calculated.It seems likely that the regulators will mandate some form of “vertical” share, meaning the lender would keep at least a 5 percent share of every tranche in the securitization. A “horizontal” share — in which the lender would suffer the first 5 percent of losses — has some advocates. But there are concerns that ways could be found to structure deals so that such a “loss” was illusory because it would come out of profits that were not expected to be earned in the first place.The new rules will apply to all securitizations, including those guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. If the Q.R.M. definition is as tight as now seems likely, that means banks would have to retain risk even on some loans guaranteed by those agencies.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, one of the regulators, has been pushing to include servicing standards in the Q.R.M. definition, and has gained some support, although no final decision has been made. Such standards would change the way banks are compensated for handling billing and receiving payments. They now get a fixed fee, but the change would pay them more when a loan is in trouble and requires more work.Such a rule would also require that servicers be allowed to modify the principal balance or interest rate on outstanding loans if that would be beneficial to the securitization as a whole, even if such a decision would hurt one tranche relative to others.The regulators are required to get a proposal out by April 17, and had been expected to act by now. One person involved says an announcement is likely soon, but refrained from being more specific. None of this is made any easier by the fact there seems to be nothing except peer pressure to force any regulator to accept a rule favored by the other regulators.Once a proposal is released, it will be open for comment, and there is likely to be fierce lobbying. Many banks will take the position that excluding any loan from the definition of a Q.R.M. is tantamount to denying a mortgage to a borrower who needs such a loan, and will warn that restricting credit in that way could further devastate the housing market.On that position, they may have some allies. A joint letter to regulators from groups of banks, home builders, real estate agents and consumer groups warns that “a Q.R.M. definition that is too narrow would prohibit many first-time homebuyers from buying a home, especially if the definition includes an excessively high minimum down payment requirement.”That conclusion is based on the assumption that non-Q.R.M. loans will not be made, or at least not made at a reasonable cost. But it is far from clear that would be the case; Wells Fargo says it will make such loans.In essence, pleas for a broad definition assume both that “skin in the game” is unreasonable and that it is unnecessary, because bankers can be trusted to never repeat the mistakes that got us into this mess.“We must also remember,” Mr. Courson, the president of the mortgage bankers’ group, wrote in his letter to regulators, “that many of the loan products and characteristics under consideration to be restricted were, for many years, not problematic when underwritten prudently.”'"
"'11-02-18,'1','She urged Congressional Republicans to oppose raising the nation’s debt ceiling, declaring, “It doesn’t necessarily have to result in a government shutdown.” Even if it did, she added, “Let it be for a week or two.”She conceded that a successful presidential bid could not be built through a digital campaign alone, saying that Facebook and other forms of social media could not reach enough voters. Asked if she would be the first Twitter president, she blanched and adopted a self-mocking tone. “What a slogan: I tweet more than you tweet.”She said it was unwise for Republicans to keep doubts alive about the authenticity of President Obama’s birth certificate and citizenship, saying: “It’s distracting. It gets annoying. Let’s stick with what really matters.”And she called for the full repeal of the new health care law, revisiting the catchphrase that caused so much controversy during debate of the bill: “When I talk about death panels, death panels was in quotation marks.”Such lines are standard political fare, and Republicans may not give them a second thought on television. But on the front lines of a campaign — whether in an Iowa living room or a New Hampshire diner — voters often consider things with a different ear.“What people are desiring to see is no more status quo — not necessarily just seeing more players in these political machines, who are sort of preordained and get to be the ones who get nominated and go forth,” Ms. Palin said. “People are ready for our governmental establishment to kind of shake it up.”Ms. Palin’s afternoon appearance at the ballroom of the Crest Hollow Country Club, the site of numerous wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs, offered an atmosphere much like she would face if she decided to run for president. Despite her best-selling books, reality television show and hours of televised interviews, Ms. Palin is not yet a fully formed political figure, and her approval ratings could change — for better or worse — as a candidate.The audience, which included many Democrats, responded with repeated applause. But there were also uncomfortable silences. She held up a Reader’s Digest from February 1964, the month of her birth, which she used to make a point about reducing the deficit.“We don’t have to reinvent any wheels here to get the economy back on the right track,” Ms. Palin said. “The solution in here to fix the problem, you know what it is? You invest in a five-cent stamp and you write your congressman and you tell him, ‘You’re going to get fired.’ Five cents back in the day! Nothing’s changed. It’s the same principles that can be applied.”Robert Zimmerman, who represents New York on the Democratic National Committee, was in the audience and met with Ms. Palin at a reception before her talk. He said he was surprised by the Reader’s Digest anecdote.“She’s really an Atlantic City lounge act for the right wing,” Mr. Zimmerman said. Still, he said, Democrats should not to dismiss her potential, saying, “Suburbs have the largest swing voters in the country, which concerns me.”The Long Island Association, which bills itself as the state’s largest business group, invited Ms. Palin to speak about a month ago. She was paid for her appearance, but organizers declined to disclose details of the arrangement. It was originally intended to be private, officials said, but Ms. Palin asked that it be opened to the media.“I was actually surprised she got as much applause as she did,” said Mr. Law, who asked Ms. Palin questions for 64 minutes. After escorting her to her car, he said: “She told me she loved the format. She probably will do more of it because she did pretty well.”'"
"'11-02-18,'1','Human Rights Watch has also documented one case in which the military transferred a prisoner to the country’s feared State Security forces, where it says he was tortured.Ms. Morayef said the cases of detention and torture did not appear to be “systematic,” but added, “It is enough to set off alarm bells and call for an investigation into abuses by the military police.”Most victims were arrested by the military, she says, though two were detained by neighborhood watch groups and then handed over to soldiers. The interrogations accompanying abuse all revolved around victims’ suspected participation in the antigovernment protests that toppled the Mubarak government.Hundreds of unidentified bodies have shown up at hospitals around the country, says the Front for the Defense of Egyptian Protesters, deepening the uncertainty. On Wednesday, Egypt’s Health Ministry reported that 365 had died during the uprising and that 5,500 were injured.Military officials said at a meeting of youth activists on Monday that they would search for those who had disappeared during the uprising, and confirmed that at least 77 people had been detained in fighting in Tahrir Square, according to notes of the meeting published on Facebook.Local media reported that the army chief of staff, Sami Enan, had agreed to release all of those detained during the revolution, but rights groups complain that he did not commit to a timetable. They have seen little movement toward fulfilling the pledge.Ramadan Aboul Hassan, 33, vanished well after the battle with the police around Tahrir Square had ended. On Jan. 29, after the police fled the city and the military stepped in, Ramadan left home with his nephew Ahmed Aboul Hassan, 22, and their friend Mostafa Mahrous Mostafa to join neighbors in fending off looters. Then they disappeared.For 18 days Mohamed Aboul Hassan, 51, Ramadan’s eldest brother, worked the phones, each call introducing him to a new lieutenant or government bureaucrat offering a different story about the men’s whereabouts and counseling a different course of action.The family combed hospitals and police stations and begged military officials they managed to get on the phone. They asked the national prison authority if the men’s names were in the country’s database of inmates, and were told they were nowhere to be found.Five days after the disappearance, their families learned that the men had been arrested by the military under a bridge on nearby Revolution Street close to the local headquarters of military intelligence. Mohamed was called in to the intelligence office, given their national ID cards and asked to sign for them before he could take the cards home. He was not told why they had been arrested or when they would be released.“I don’t understand why the government is doing this,” Mohamed said Tuesday, the height of the search. “If they would just give me some piece of information about them, it would mean so much for me.”The military has little experience directly governing and policing the civilian population, leaving it ill equipped for tasks like notifying families of arrests or detentions, said Ahmed Ragheb, the executive director of the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, a human rights organization. “The army is not prepared to operate an incarceration system or facilities.”Early Tuesday afternoon, a contact in the military told the Aboul Hassan family that the three men had been released from Wadi Gedid maximum security prison in a distant southern province and put on a military train bound for Cairo. A short while later a cousin with friends working in the train station told them no such train existed, and an official at Wadi Gedid said the prison had no record of them.Later, another prison official told Mohamed that the men were in the custody of the civil police in Upper Egypt, while a military official told another brother, Rabie, 36, that the men were awaiting military trials on unknown charges.On Wednesday, Rabie hired a taxi and made the 400-mile journey to Wadi Gedid prison to ask about the men himself. He found them awaiting release with several hundred others, and said they bore the physical and psychological scars of torture.The men had been detained at Hikestep Military Base, in the desert outside Cairo, before being sent to Wadi Gedid. They were beaten, whipped, exposed to electric shocks and suspended from the door frames of their cells, Rabie said. They were offered bread doused in gasoline and had guns held to their heads, he asserted. “They treated them like a herd of sheep,” he said.After their release, Mohamed said, “They are psychologically traumatized and physically ill,” although he denied that they had been tortured. Because of concerns for their well-being, the Aboul Hassan family did not allow reporters access to the three men after their return to Cairo and none were interviewed for this article.The Aboul Hassans are a poor family in an upper-class neighborhood. Ramadan, Ahmed and Mostafa are the children of men who tend the gardens and guard the doors at upscale apartments in the Heliopolis district of Cairo. Their homes are a grim warren of windowless concrete rooms in the building’s basement, sparsely furnished and bursting at the seams with children.For weeks, the men’s recovered national ID cards were the only clues family members had about their fates.“We joined the protests to liberate the country and end the problems of the regime,” said Rabie, who had accompanied his brother to Tahrir Square in the days before his arrest. His family’s ordeal at the hands of the military, an institution he said he respected, has shaken his faith in the revolution.“After 18 days the regime is gone but the same injustices remain.”'"
"'11-02-18,'1','Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, appeared to reinforce that last point recently when he praised the iPhone’s uniformity, contrasting it with phones based on Google’s Android software, which come in many formats.“We think Android is very, very fragmented and getting more fragmented by the day,” Mr. Jobs told financial analysts in October. “We think this is a huge strength of our approach compared to Google’s.”Another senior Apple executive said during a private meeting recently that it did not make sense for the company to make multiple iPhone models, noting that Apple would stick with its practice of dropping the price of older models when it introduced a new one.The iPhone 3GS is now available for $49 with a two-year contract that helps subsidize the price of the device in the United States.As part of its effort to find new customers for the iPhone, Apple plans to make it easier to operate the device through voice commands, removing an obstacle for people who do not like using a virtual keyboard, said another person with knowledge of Apple’s plans.Apple is also considering changing internal components of the device to bring costs down. “Although the innards of the phone, including memory size or camera quality, could change to offer a less expensive model, the size of the device would not vary,” said the person, who has worked on multiple versions of the device.Another person with knowledge of Apple’s plans said that the company was actively building a more versatile version of its MobileMe service, which allows users to store music, photos and files online and have them accessible on all their devices.The current version of MobileMe, which costs $100 a year, has failed to catch on with consumers. Rivals like Google and others offer similar services free.The new version of MobileMe is expected to be free and would allow users to synch their files without using a cable.“The goal is that your photos and other media content will eventually just sync across all your Apple devices without people having to do anything,” the person said. If more iPhone users stored files online, Apple could make cheaper devices with less storage. Flash storage is one of the iPhone’s most expensive components.Apple has dominated the high end of the smartphone market, but the company is facing increasing competition from devices running Google’s Android, which collectively outsell the iPhone. Analysts said it would make sense for Apple to introduce a cheaper iPhone, especially in overseas markets where carriers do not subsidize handsets. Unsubsidized handsets are often called “prepaid.”“If they are going to be a player in the global market they have to have a prepaid option,” said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. But Mr. Munster said that to be successful, a prepaid iPhone would have to be able to run the more than 300,000 apps available in the App Store.A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said that a low-priced iPhone could help Apple expand its unit sales of the device sixfold.In recent days, some published reports, citing anonymous sources, said that Apple was building a smaller iPhone. One report gave the code name of the project as N97. Several people with knowledge of Apple’s plans said that N97 was the code name for the Verizon iPhone 4, which was introduced this month.'"
"'11-02-18,'1','The Tune-In festival at the Park Avenue Armory promises to explore musical connections between past and present, as well as a few philosophical notions, like whether music has the power to express anything. (Stravinsky said that it does not; others have disagreed.)Most of the series, which runs through Sunday, was assembled by the enterprising new-music ensemble Eighth Blackbird. But the festival opened on Wednesday evening with the armory’s own contribution, “Arco,” a quirky symphonic and vocal program that unfolded as a continuous, 90-minute, period- and style-hopping stream.A collaboration among the composers Paul Haas, Bora Yoon and Paul Fowler, “Arco” borrows a couple of concepts from pop music: the mash-up, in which unrelated pieces are melded together, and the remix, which embellishes and reconstitutes familiar music.About 17 works (depending on whether you count some merely quoted in passing) were performed by Sympho, a chamber orchestra led by Mr. Haas, and New York Polyphony, an a cappella quartet. Ms. Yoon, who sang her own music (and supplied electronic and percussive accompaniments), and Charles Perry Sprawls, a bass-baritone, filled out the cast.Mostly the pieces flowed together smoothly. At times they interrupted one another. The Funeral March from Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony, for example, is not quite finished when it morphs into Mr. Fowler’s “Building.” The Fowler, in part a remix of themes from the Beethoven, twice cedes the spotlight to sacred settings by William Byrd (a Sanctus and an Ave Verum Corpus) before melting into another, more vigorously cinematic Fowler score, “Aggression.” That piece is split in two, with works by Mr. Haas and Ms. Yoon interposed between its opening and conclusion.Mr. Haas, Ms. Yoon and Mr. Fowler seemed to be taking an unusual approach to Stravinsky’s declaration about music’s nonexpressivity. Their section titles — “Sorrow,” “Building” (as in creating), “Aggression” and “Ecstasy” — suggested a belief that music is indeed expressive, and some of their choices drove the point home. In the “Sorrow” section, a richly played account of Arvo Pärt’s “Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten” and a soulful reading of the Beethoven Funeral March framed Mr. Haas’s gently meditative “Sorrow.”'"
"'11-02-18,'1','A main leader of Iran’s opposition was reported missing on Thursday and both the opposition “green movement” and Iran’s hardliners issued calls for street rallies, escalating tensions after the reemergence of street protests and their brutal suppression on Monday.The daughters of the missing opposition leader, Mir Hussein Moussavi, told an opposition Web site that they had had no word from either of their parents since Tuesday and feared they had been detained. Security forces have surrounded their home, and all communications have been cut.On Wednesday, the Web site of another opposition leader, Mehdi Karroubi, reported that the house of his eldest son had been raided and damaged by security officers seeking to arrest him.Calls have intensified from Iran’s Parliament and judiciary for the prosecution of both men, who have been accused repeatedly of waging war against God, a crime that carries the death penalty. This week, as the opposition revived in solidarity with uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, law markers in Parliament called for them to be hanged.An opposition group, the Green Path of Hope, issued a call through the opposition Web site Jaras for supporters to take to the streets on Sunday to remember the deaths of two protesters in this week, as well those of “other martyrs of the green movement.”The opposition’s Monday rallies were met with a forceful response from Iran’s security forces, which include not only police officers but also plainclothes members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps and the paramilitary Basij group.'"
"'11-02-18,'1','The Nokia chief executive, Stephen Elop, has promised “significant volumes” in 2012 and is pushing for the first models to reach the market later this year.The alliance will test both companies, said Rajeev Chand, a wireless analyst at Rutberg, an investment bank in San Francisco that focuses on the wireless industry.“I would call this a daunting challenge,” Mr. Chand said in an interview at the convention. Because of the thorny decisions that will have to be made quickly, Mr. Chand said, “Our general sense is that this is going to be truly difficult.”Mr. Woodman said Microsoft’s cooperation with Nokia would bring significant benefits to both. With global data from Navteq, the digital map company owned by Nokia, Microsoft will be able to enhance the mapping service of its Bing search engine, he said. Bing has superior mapping detail in the United States but not abroad, Mr. Woodman said. Data from Navteq would put Bing on a par with Google Maps around the world, he said.Nokia, which shipped 450 million phones last year, will use its leverage over suppliers to rapidly bring down the price of Windows Mobile phones, which have tended to be priced at the top range of the smartphone segment.“Nokia’s ability to leverage its supply chain will bring Windows Mobile to a bigger market,” Mr. Woodman said.For Nokia, Microsoft will be able to use its brand recognition to help improve the Finnish company’s market share in the United States, where it is in the low single digits, far behind Samsung, the market leader, Mr. Woodman said.Nokia was the market leader in the United States as recently as 2002.“I think we can help reintroduce Nokia into the North American market,” Mr. Woodman said.Investors remained skeptical on Thursday, almost one week after Nokia and Microsoft announced their alliance. Nokia’s share price was trading at 6.65 euros, or $8.99, in Helsinki, Finland, 21 percent lower than it was before the announcement.But Mr. Chand, the analyst at Rutberg, cautioned that investors might be overly pessimistic. Wireless companies want a third operating system to help them avoid becoming dependent on Apple and Google, the maker of the Android system adopted by numerous smartphone makers, he said. Although wireless companies attending the convention were muted in their support of the alliance, Mr. Chand said they would embrace the phones if they were good and if customers demanded them.“You have to keep in mind that this is early days,” Mr. Chand said. “Remember that three years ago, there was no Android. The market sentiment is so negative on this alliance right now that it probably means that it is going to succeed.”'"
"'11-02-18,'1','“The plan is to try and slow this down because it’s an extreme piece of legislation that’s tearing this state apart,” Senator Jon Erpenbach, one of the missing Democrats, told The Associated Press by telephone. (He refused, of course, to say where he was.)By noon, the sergeant-at-arms, Ted Blazel, was climbing past the crowds in the Capitol, searching for senators through the mazelike hallways, in offices, under desks — a task he has rarely been called to carry out.“Nothing yet,” Mr. Blazel said at one point, his forehead glistening with sweat.By dusk, Senate Republican leaders had decided to adjourn, at least temporarily, as supposed sightings of Democrats — and rumors of supposed sightings of Democrats — were alleged by seemingly everyone. Among the claims: They had been seen leaving on a bus altogether. They were in . Or . Or both.“They’re in Rockford!” Mr. Fitzgerald called out excitedly at one point, as he rushed between chambers. Some of the Democrats conducted interviews from what they described as “secure locations,” and others posted messages on social networking sites.Over three days, protesters’ backpacks, sleeping bags, water bottles and homemade signs have come to jam the marble halls of this Capitol, and on Thursday evening the rallies against the bill grew. People screamed: “Shut it down! Shut it down!” Drums pounded. Students, some barefoot, danced. Extra law enforcement workers now pepper the building, trying to guide officials through the thick, chanting crowds.Many among the protesters said that they had no plans to leave, and that they would wait, as long as it took, to end the proposal, which was introduced only a week ago by Scott Walker, the new Republican governor here. Regarding the claims by Mr. Walker that the changes were forced by gaping budget deficits, some protesters here question his figures and his motives.National leaders, including , have weighed in with criticism.“That’s not the real fight,” said Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, who flew here on Thursday morning. “It’s a politically motivated attack. It’s not about the money. What he wants to do is destroy the voice of educators and public employees.”For his part, Mr. Walker, who appeared before reporters from his office even as chants from beyond security barriers echoed into the room, had no apologies and said he had no intention of changing the bill. And he chastised the Democratic senators for leaving.“We’re certainly looking at all legal options out there, but I have faith that after they do their stunt for a day or two — it’s more about theatrics than anything else — that they’ll come back and realize again they’re elected to do the job,” Mr. Walker said. “Show up, debate the bill, offer amendments, have a healthy debate, but you don’t have that debate if you hang out down in Rockford or Dubuque.”By 5 p.m., Senate Republicans said they were adjourning for the night. They had no immediate plans for sending law enforcement officers after the missing senators (it was unclear whether the Wisconsin State Patrol could pursue them across state borders anyway, one senator said). But they said they planned to be back on Friday, ready to vote. They hoped, they said, that the Democrats would choose to come, too.And if they do not? No one here seemed to know. As the senators went home, the protesters, some of them bearing pillows, did not.'"
"'11-02-18,'1','“There has been a rebound pretty much across the board,” he added. “Going forward, increases in commodity prices, improvements in the labor market and a stabilization in the housing component lends an upward bias to C.P.I. during the course of the year.”The core index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in January and was up 1 percent for the previous 12 months. A 1 percent rise in apparel prices accounted for the acceleration in the core index, the figures showed.Stuart Hoffman, the chief economist at PNC, said the core rate was “a long way from the Fed’s preferred range” of about 2 percent or slightly lower.“You can stop talking about deflation now,” he said. “The odds were always fairly low but now they are slim to none.”He added, “The debate will be how fast inflation is going to move up but I don’t think it is going to meet or exceed 2 percent in the next couple of years.”The concern about deflation was a principal factor behind the decision by the Federal Reserve in August to carry out its bond purchasing program.On Wednesday, the minutes from the latest meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers indicated that the Fed saw a decreasing risk of deflation and that it now expected economic growth of 3.4 to 3.9 percent this year, up from the previous forecast of 3 to 3.6 percent.Although food and energy prices have increased, the Fed minutes said, especially in fast-growing emerging markets, the committee did not have a consensus on whether that development would lead to higher inflation in the United States.The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has been adamant in saying that the Fed was ready and willing to curb inflation — and could even raise interest rates at a moment’s notice if it needed to.On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that producer prices in the United States rose in January. The core index, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, rose 0.5 percent, the biggest jump in 27 months, the agency said.Food companies, retailers and manufacturers have begun warning that rising prices are expected to start hitting consumers, with economists forecasting inflation in the United States to run about 2.5 percent this year.Economists have also been watching for any resurgence in hiring by companies, hoping that stronger consumer spending will help the recovery gain momentum. On Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of people filing for unemployment benefits rose to 410,000 in the most recent week, up 25,000 from the previous week. The figure is 10,000 higher than the consensus forecast of economists.Prices for commodities, including cotton, corn, steel and copper, have surged in recent months. Global food prices hit record levels in January, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and many emerging countries are taking steps to control inflation caused by those increases.In Britain, inflation hit its highest level in two years when it reached an annual rate of 4 percent in January, above the Bank of England’s inflation target of 2 percent, according to the Office for National Statistics. Higher commodity and energy prices and an increase in the sales tax were blamed.China said this week that consumer prices rose 4.9 percent in January, and many economists predict that China’s inflation will not peak for two or three more months, forcing the government to take stronger measures that could slow economic growth.'"

"'11-02-19,'0','WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Friday against one of the largest money exchange houses in Afghanistan, along with 15 of its executives, on charges that it used billions of dollars transferred in and out of the country to help hide proceeds from illegal drug sales.The authorities designated the New Ansari Money Exchange a “major money-laundering vehicle,” under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, saying that the exchange used its subsidiaries in Dubai to funnel drug money out of Kabul and into American and other international financial institutions. They also imposed sanctions on New Ansari’s senior managers, including some who have ties to President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan.With these actions, the United States has seized any assets New Ansari and its managers hold in the United States. American banks and businesses are prohibited from transactions with those named in the order.The move is part of a delicate balancing act by the Obama administration, which aims to crack down on the corruption that reaches the highest levels of the Afghan government without derailing the counterinsurgency efforts that are dependent on Mr. Karzai’s cooperation.It comes as Afghanistan struggles to overcome the turmoil caused by the near collapse of its largest financial institution, the Kabul Bank. The Afghan government’s failure to take steps to deal with the bank’s corruption and fraud has been a major factor in a decision by the International Monetary Fund to delay indefinitely the renewal of its credit program with Afghanistan.'"
"'11-02-19,'0','“He was going to a transition house on Wards Island,” Ms. Eliot said. “He was with me on weekends, and came to visit a day here and there.”Shaun has mental illness, not diagnosed with a specificity that Ms. Eliot credits, and emotional problems, after the deaths of two brothers, that she believes were not given attention in the treatment he received. He has been medicated since being sent to the first of three psychiatric hospitals more than five years ago. “They don’t do talk therapy anymore,” she said. “It’s like Freud never existed.”He was released to transitional housing last summer, and was making progress with a tutor, Ms. Eliot said. After coming home for an appointment with the family doctor two weeks ago, he stayed over an extra night with his mother to avoid returning to Wards Island during a siege of frigid weather.“He still didn’t want to go back,” she said, “but I made him.”Her conversation here is an act of faith in the people who may see his picture and get help if they spot him. “My hesitancy in talking about this was that people so judge, and they see this as, ‘Uh-oh, someone’s crazy,’ ” she said.Her son Phil died in 1992, at 32, from debilitating kidney problems. His death came on a Sunday, and she began the concerts as a bridge past the day; the music became a prayer that answered itself. In 2006, another son, Michael, 47, fell ill with meningitis; his health collapsed and he died. Ms. Eliot was raised as a regular churchgoer — “we weren’t fanatics, but Sundays we went to church” — and still has faith, though not in a particular house of worship.When each of her sons became sick, she said: “Oh no. Not my kid, that’s not going to happen.”As their illnesses progressed, she found that letting go allowed her to be present for what was happening, not locked every moment into her own longing. “Just trying to make that day pretty,” she said. “I’d pray: ‘God, I don’t want to bargain with you, but I want to be there. Please let me be there. I won’t ask for anything else.’ So I was holding Michael and Phil when they left.”Shaun’s disappearance has forced her to renegotiate. “Now, I say: ‘God, I promised I wouldn’t ask for anything else. Here I go again. Please give me a chance to be a better mother to him.’ ”On Sunday, she will ring the buzzer again, as the guests arrive. When the concert ends, she said, she will give each a flier with Shaun’s picture.'"

"'11-02-19,'0','“Ultimately, we want to have confidence, for ourselves, and for the public, in the data we use to measure schools,” Mr. Fleischer said. The new audit procedures, he said, “will be much more data-driven and systematic.”About 60 high schools will be selected for the first round of audits, based on whether their data showed suspicious patterns, like sudden rises in scores, he said. Allegations of misconduct would be referred to the special commissioner of investigation for city schools. In the first year, however, the emphasis will be on providing guidance and training to schools so that employees understand what is expected.Despite the increased scrutiny, Mr. Polakow-Suransky has said he does not believe there is widespread cheating. He said last week that the city aggressively investigated the “tiny handful of cases” where there were allegations. On the question of Regents scoring, a process determined by the state, he said, “We feel an obligation to work on this issue, despite the fact that they are not our tests.”But observers of the school system, including those who have been skeptical of rising test scores and graduation rates, said officials seemed to acknowledge issues with some of the data.“It seems to me that the D.O.E. is realizing that they have a credibility problem with their numbers and they’re trying to address that,” said Kim Sweet, executive director of Advocates for Children of New York, which has questioned whether some schools tally dropouts incorrectly to help graduation rates.Officials said that they started working on toughening auditing procedures more than a year ago, but that in recent months they approached the issue with greater urgency.The state comptroller recently completed a review of the city’s graduation rates, which has not yet been released to the public, though it has been submitted to city officials for their response.The city had already begun investigating grading at the school that had the highest score on the department’s annual report cards, the Theatre Arts Production Company High School in the Bronx. Its teacher handbook indicated that failing grades were only for students who never went to class.And an analysis by The New York Times found that on the English and history Regents exams in the past two years, students in the city’s public high schools were roughly five times as likely to score 65, the passing grade, or slightly above it than to score just below it.Statisticians say that such a difference is out of line with the smooth scoring curve that should normally result. A recent report in The Wall Street Journal came to a similar conclusion.Even on the algebra exam, where there are no essays, 8,451 students got grades of exactly 65, while only 7,145 students combined ended up with a score of 61, 62, 63 or 64.Regents exams are graded by teachers within schools, and teachers are not barred from grading their own students. While the practice is controversial, some say it is appropriate to give students the benefit of the doubt.There is ambiguity in grading essays, and even in mathematics tests, in which extra points can be given for students’ showing their work.At one Queens high school, the number of students scoring 65 to 69 last year in the five most popular Regents exams — integrated algebra, global history, biology, English and United States history — was more than five times the number who scored 60 to 64.“If you have a kid with a 64, you want to look at the paper again to give the kid an even chance,” said the school’s principal, who spoke only on condition that her name, and the name of her school, not be published. “We’re not talking about changing the grade where the kid got it wrong to make it right.”David M. Steiner, the state education commissioner, acknowledged in an interview in January that the state had known for years of the spikes in scoring patterns.The department has made some changes, like required training for teacher-scorers, and it is phasing in computer scoring for multiple-choice questions.But of the practice of teachers’ grading their students’ exams, Dr. Steiner said, “obviously, it’s not ideal.”The state, he said, was focused on building the next generation of exams, to come into use in three to five years, which may be completely graded by computer.'"
"'11-02-19,'0','“Frank Sciame is doing incalculable harm to the Seaport Museum,” said one furloughed employee, who did not want to be identified because of fear of reprisal for speaking publicly. “He has refused overtures from the city to help stabilize the museum and has driven away trustees who resent his high-handed and confrontational manner. It’s hard to kill a nonprofit, but Sciame is well on the way to accomplishing just that.”The museum — at 12 Fulton Street and formerly named the South Street Seaport Museum — explores the city’s maritime history through artifacts and a fleet of 11 vessels, including historic ships and service boats. It has always been small, catering to tourists and to New York maritime buffs. In the wake of 9/11, it weathered particularly rough seas.In 2004 it closed its library building and gave away its collection of two million artifacts excavated in Lower Manhattan. It also eliminated several major staff positions to reduce its budget by $1 million. In 2005 it offered its antique ships for adoption, asking New Yorkers to pay for maintenance of a favorite ship.In 2008 it ran a deficit of $1 million and the following year had revenue of just $280,000 on a budget of $5.2 million. For 10 years the museum has been in arrears to the city’s Economic Development Corporation for rent and utilities.The situation has grown more urgent over the last year. Between March and December Mr. Sciame made a $1.5 million loan to the museum. In July Mary Pelzer, the museum’s president and chief executive, asked the city for assistance, according to city officials; Mr. Sciame reiterated that request at the end of September.In May the museum asked the city to buy back its lease on a lot at the corner of John and South Streets for $7 million. This would allow the museum to pay off $1.8 million in back rent and utility payments to the development corporation and would generate an additional $3.2 million, to be paid at the closing in 2012, according to the city.Meanwhile, the museum sought a bank loan of $2.7 million against the city’s option to buy back the lease, and the board in December authorized using up to $1.4 million of the loan to pay back Mr. Sciame. When the loan did not come through, Mr. Sciame said, he provided bridge loans, “to keep the museum operating.”“When the bank didn’t loan against the option, I just basically became the bank,” Mr. Sciame said.The city also objected to funds being used to pay back loans from board members (others beside Mr. Sciame have lent the museum a total of $500,000) and said it would not allow the museum to borrow against the lease buy-back.“It’s a bad sign when board members start making loans to organizations,” said a city official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the negotiations. “Their interest in repayment will trump their judgment about what’s best for the organization.”In January the City Department of Cultural Affairs and individuals interested in the museum’s future proposed that two new trustees join the board in leadership positions: Doug Kreeger, a business consultant who is married to the sister of the developer Douglas Durst, and Brendan Sexton, a consultant on environmental sustainability and a former sanitation commissioner. No action has been taken on the appointments of those two men.After studying the museum’s financial records, Mr. Kreeger and Mr. Sexton agreed to help secure a loan to the museum to cover some operating costs, with the understanding that the museum would undertake a major debt-reduction plan. Under that plan, board members would not have preferred status among the museum’s creditors.Some people involved with the museum suggest that Mr. Sciame resisted this assistance in part because Mr. Kreeger is affiliated with a competitor, the Durst Organization — though the two developers collaborated on Historic Front Street at the Seaport. But Mr. Sciame said this was not the source of his objections, but rather that Mr. Kreeger and Mr. Sexton “had some plans that I thought were not operable,” adding that he could not “get into the particulars about it.”“We’re considering different ways of running the museum,” Mr. Sciame said. “There were some good ideas that Doug and Brendan had, and they’re under discussion.”Three weeks ago trustees began resigning, with the most recent resignation on Wednesday.For his part, Mr. Sciame — said he had simply tried to sustain the institution, whose travails he said were largely due to the recession.“Like many cultural institutions, this is a tough time in terms of the economic downturn,” he said. “But this museum has been here before.”Several of the trustees who resigned did not return calls seeking comment. Ms. Pelzer, who runs the museum and was formerly its general counsel, also did not return calls.“We hope the museum will find a constructive solution,” Commissioner Levin said.Mr. Sciame said “it’s always difficult” to lay people off, adding “We intend to hire them back.”He also said the board had established an austerity committee that is working to reduce costs and increase revenue. There have also been discussions about sharing space with another of the city’s smaller museums or establishing an alliance with a larger institution, though no formal talks have been held.As for his tenure, Mr. Sciame said he was open to passing the torch.“We have a road map, and my intention is to have that road map implemented, either by myself or someone else,” he added. “I’m not saying it has to be me.”'"
"'11-02-19,'0','Investigators have discovered tens of millions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts belonging to the ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, his family or five prominent associates, officials in Switzerland announced Friday. The officials said the accounts had been frozen, but declined to break down who controlled the vast sums.“What has been blocked is funds in the area of several dozen million Swiss francs,” said Adrian Sollberger, a spokesman for the Swiss Foreign Ministry. “We are not specifying what their value is or whose money it is.”Mr. Sollberger said the search for funds would continue.After Mr. Mubarak’s resignation on Feb. 11, Swiss officials ordered all banks in the country to search for and freeze his assets and those of his family, four former ministers and a wealthy party insider.Egypt’s new military-led government has asked countries across the Western and Arab world to freeze the assets of the four former ministers, the party insider and their families, American officials said. But it has not asked countries to freeze the assets of Mr. Mubarak and his relatives.Switzerland is acting on its own against the Mubarak family’s assets, under a new law that allows government officials to freeze accounts belonging to any former leader suspected of corruption. The law was enacted to change the country’s reputation as a haven for illegally acquired money.'"

It was set up to advise regulators after the sharp fluctuation in the stock market on May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 600 points in a matter of minutes before recovering just as quickly.The committee’s report said the growing dominance of high-frequency and algorithmic traders had made markets fragile and emphasized the increased interconnectedness between equities and derivatives markets, which could transfer sharp swings in one market to the other almost instantaneously.“We cannot overstate the importance of addressing the most pressing issues here,” the advisers said in the report. “While many factors led to the events of May 6, and different observers place different weights on the impact of each factor, the net effect of that day was a challenge to investors’ confidence in the markets.”In putting forward 14 recommendations of its own, it praised some of the measures imposed by regulators since the flash crash, like circuit breakers for individual stocks, which pause trading if a stock moves wildly, and moving toward a consolidated audit trail to give common information about trading across different stock exchanges.'"
"'11-02-19,'0','MOSCOW — Russia’s powerful finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, said in a speech on Friday that economic advantages in Russia were too often granted based on relationships with government officials, and warned that economic reforms would not be possible without political change.It was an unusual criticism coming from a technocrat who has worked closely with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin for more than two decades. Mr. Kudrin is often credited with helping cushion Russia from the collapse of oil prices, and has repeatedly pushed for the country to diversify the economy away from oil and gas.The speech, delivered at the Krasnoyarsk Economic Forum, comes amid intrigue over what path Russia will take after President Dmitri A. Medvedev’s term ends in 2012. Though Russia’s leadership has embraced the broad goal of “modernization,” there are major differences over whether political liberalization is necessary.Mr. Kudrin, who also holds the rank of deputy prime minister, weighed in on that question, saying the coming elections should be “just and fair” and involve “all the leading political forces and representatives of society.”He went on to say that only credible elections “will give the mandate of trust that is necessary to undertake economic reforms,” according to a transcript of the speech released by the Russian government late Friday night. “If distrust develops, we will not be able to fully achieve our goals.”'"
"'11-02-19,'0','MADISON, Wis. — The fight over a bill to slash collective bargaining for Wisconsin’s public workers came to a standstill on Friday, as Democratic state senators refused to appear at the Capitol, members of the State Assembly delayed a vote until next week and thousands of protesters, their numbers still growing, marched, screamed, sang and sat.“We’re waiting until we can find a way to take these draconian measures off the table,” Chris Larson, one of 14 Democratic senators who left Wisconsin to prevent a vote from taking place, said in a telephone interview. So far, Mr. Larson said, there had been conversations between Republican lawmakers, who control both chambers of the State Legislature, and Democrats — but no compromise.Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who proposed the bill that would reduce public workers’ abilities to negotiate their contracts and would require them to pay more for their pensions and health care, showed no sign of retreat. In an interview on Friday, he continued to say that his bill, which he said would help spare the state from budget gaps this year and in the coming two years, would ultimately pass.In the end, Mr. Walker said, most people — even public workers — will agree with him, and life will return to normal here.For now, Madison looked anything but normal. National leaders, including the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., rallied the swelling ranks here nearly all day, and continued to make speeches outside the Capitol into the night.'"
"'11-02-19,'0','As the Libyan clashes worsened, a violent crackdown continued in Bahrain on Friday, where government forces opened fire on hundreds of mourners marching toward Pearl Square and at least one helicopter sprayed fire on peaceful protesters. There were also violent confrontations on Friday in Yemen and Jordan.Since seizing power in a coup in 1969, Colonel Qaddafi has imposed his idiosyncratic rule on Libya, one of the world’s biggest exporters of oil. With a population of just 6.4 million, the country is one of the region’s wealthiest, though eastern Libya and Benghazi have witnessed periodic uprisings. Tripoli, the capital, has also had sporadic protests but remains firmly in the government’s grip, residents say.“I don’t see them being easily overpowered, especially at this point, because of the powers of the Libyan security forces and their tendency to crack down very brutally on protests,” said Heba Morayef, a researcher for Human Rights Watch in contact with residents in Libya. “I’m not saying it will never happen, but it won’t happen today.”Residents reached by telephone said the most intense unrest was in Benghazi and Bayda, a city about 125 miles to the northeast. As many as 15,000 people gathered in front of the courthouse in Benghazi on Friday, and security forces withdrew from at least part of the city by the afternoon, residents said. The residents saw the withdrawal as a sign of withering authority.“Security has retreated to allow the protesters to march because the masses are in a state of extreme anger,” said one of the protesters, Idris Ahmed al-Agha, a writer and activist. “I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I think it’s going to escalate.”In the background, demonstrators’ chants could be heard. “The people want to topple the government!” they cried, an expression first heard in protests in Tunisia, then picked up by the demonstrators in Cairo’s uprising.Judging by funerals and residents’ accounts, Mr. Agha put the toll at 50 in Benghazi. Other opposition activists said 60 had died there and dozens more in Bayda, though Libya’s isolation made the numbers difficult to verify. Citing doctors’ reports in Benghazi, Samira Boussalma, a member of Amnesty International’s North Africa team, said a majority of those killed were shot in the head and the chest. An opposition figure, citing a source at the Jalaa Hospital there, said that most of the dead were 13 to 36 years old and that as many as 50 people had been wounded.Opposition groups said protesters had wrested control of several towns, including Bayda and Darnah, a northeastern port, though the degree of their authority seemed ambiguous. They said several police stations had been burned across Libya, and Mr. Agha said a military building was attacked in Benghazi.In Kufrah, an oasis town in Libya’s southeast, protests were planned after Friday Prayer, but security forces deployed outside mosques, forbade demonstrations, then allowed worshipers to leave one by one, said Badawi Altobawi, an activist there.He said the military had deployed in force to counter a second day of demonstrations, where protesters chanted Thursday, “Long live a free Libya.”“We will keep protesting until the regime falls,” he said. “There is no going back. This is a protest led by the youth. They went out, as did their counterparts in Egypt and Tunisia. It was a spontaneous move, but now we are getting organized.”Another protester reached by phone, who declined to be identified, citing safety concerns, said demonstrators had burned a building in Kufrah belonging to the so-called revolutionary committees, one of the instruments of Colonel Qaddafi’s peculiar brand of authoritarian leadership. Pictures circulated on the Internet showed protesters tearing down a statue for his Green Book, a three-volume tract that outlines his vision of that rule.Known officially as the Brotherly Leader and the Guide of the Revolution, Colonel Qaddafi has gone from a self-styled prophet of third world liberation to an erratic partner of Europe and the United States, which re-established ties with Libya in 2006. In September 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Libya in a tour of North Africa.His relations with his Arab neighbors are unstable. While he lashed out at Tunisians for overthrowing President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in January, his rambling rants at Arab League meetings have long ruffled counterparts, Saudi Arabia among them.The Libyan news agency said he toured parts of Tripoli early on Friday to rally support for his government, which seemed fully ready to use force to crush dissent. After nightfall, opposition figures said hundreds had gathered to protest in the capital — reports that, if true, could mark a noteworthy turn in opposition.“Any risk from these minuscule groups — the people and the noble revolutionary power will violently and thunderously respond,” said a pro-government newspaper, Al Zahf Al Akhdar. It called Colonel Qaddafi one of several red lines in the country. “Those who try to cross or come near these lines are suicidal and playing with fire,” it added.Meanwhile, protesters turned up the pressure on other Arab governments on Friday. A demonstration in Amman, Jordan, turned violent as government supporters clashed with protesters calling for political change, injuring several, witnesses said.Antigovernment protests, though rare for Jordan, have become routine on Fridays since uprisings swept Egypt and Tunisia. But this was the first time that one ended in confrontation.The protest began peacefully outside the King Hussein Mosque in Amman, according to participants, with the demonstrators calling for an end to corruption and constitutional monarchy and for the lowering of prices. Then, participants said, more than a hundred government supporters surrounded and attacked them.Similar clashes between demonstrators for and against the government broke out in Yemen, where turmoil continued for an eighth day. The violence began when thugs with sticks ran down rivals calling for the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.Rival groups also engaged in street fights in the city of Taiz, 130 miles south of the Yemeni capital, Sana. Reuters reported that a grenade exploded in a large crowd of protesters who had gathered in the city’s Hurriya, or Freedom, Square. At least eight people were wounded in the blast, the agency reported.The protests in Taiz, where thousands of students have set up encampments, have appeared more intractable than the daily skirmishes in Sana. The police there have arrested more than 100 demonstrators in recent days as the nation fights over the future of Mr. Saleh’s 32-year-old American-backed government.'"
"'11-02-19,'0','MANAMA, Bahrain — At exactly 5:18 p.m. Friday, the pro-democracy demonstrators, mostly young men, came to a fork in the road. Turn right, and they would head to a hospital that has cared for protesters. Turn left, and into Pearl Square, the symbolic center of the nation, where the army was waiting.The crowd paused, just briefly, to let out a cheer, and turned left. Within minutes they were screaming, “Live fire, live fire,” as the military began shooting — from a high-rise building, from a helicopter and from the road in front of the demonstrators. King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa’s government had warned them: march and you will be shot. The opposition had warned the king that it would never give up.Both sides held fast in a confrontation that continued to escalate by the day as the king, a Sunni, showed his increasing willingness to use lethal force to preserve his absolute authority, and the opposition, mostly from the majority Shiite community, showed that it was increasingly galvanized by that use of force.“My friend, my brother, he just got shot in the head,” said Mazen Al Smeh, 27, as he struggled to catch his breath on the side of the road, his face covered in tears, his hands painted with blood. “I tried to take him, but they kept firing. He’s dead, he’s dead now. We were just here to demand our rights.”When ambulances arrived for the injured, the army opened fire. When the shooting seemed to stop, a few young men dropped to their knees to pray on the bloodstained road, and the army started to shoot at them, again.There are many details that remained unclear on Friday night, including how many died, how many were injured, and what kind of munitions were fired: live ammunition, rubber bullets or both. Doctors at Salmaniya Medical Complex said at least one young man was dead and four or five critically wounded with head and chest injuries.What was clear though, was that if the king’s goal was to intimidate his critics into staying home, he appears to have miscalculated, at least so far. The politics of the Shiite community — which already felt disenfranchised — are deeply and inextricably linked with a faith that reveres martyrdom and holds social justice as a principal value. With each outrage this week, more people turned to the streets, perpetuating the cycle Bahrain now seems caught in, with no obvious way out.Friday night, thousands of angry demonstrators gathered outside the hospital, chanting “Death to Khalifa,” referring to the king.“We are not going to stop and we are not scared at any time,’ said Raed Aman, 31, one of the demonstrators who escaped uninjured and was at the hospital checking on his friends. “If anybody in my family dies, I will have more power. Even if I lose my life, I will be there every time.”This small Persian Gulf nation, a strategic ally of the United States, has long strained against the pressure of the political tensions between a Shiite majority and a king and ruling class of the Sunni minority. That tension has been supercharged in recent weeks as demands for democracy, rule of law and social justice have rocked the Middle East with popular movements that have forced the resignation of the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt.By Friday night, the royal family appeared to be trying to find a more peaceful solution, with the king authorizing the crown prince, his son, to begin a dialogue with the opposition, but it was unclear if the protesters would accept talks. In an appearance on Bahraini TV, the prince, Sheik Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, pleaded for calm and offered “condolences to the people of Bahrain for the painful days they are living.”After the violence erupted, President Obama condemned the use of violence by governments throughout the region, including Bahrain, where the United States’ Fifth Fleet is based. The White House said the president had spoken with the king on Friday evening, urging the government to show restraint, especially against peaceful protesters, and pressing for meaningful reform.On Monday, young people began their protests, organizing Bahrain’s own “day of rage,” hoping that peaceful protests could force the evolution of their nation from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy.But on that day, the king unleashed his police force, and every effort at demonstrating was met by a wave of tear gas and rubber bullets. By the end of the night, one young man, Ali Mushaima, 21, was dead, shot in the back by the police. The next day, as thousands gathered to mourn, another young man was killed.'"
"'11-02-19,'0','Beyond confining Mr. Chen, the authorities are mobilizing to choke a resurgence of activism supporting him. On Wednesday, the police in blocked a number of rights campaigners from attending a strategy session and assaulted one lawyer, Jiang Tianyong, at a stationhouse, he said.The campaign of extrajudicial intimidation seems to have taken an especially heavy toll on political prisoners who had previously been released, among them Zheng Enchong, a lawyer in who has spent the last four years virtually confined to his 14th-floor apartment, and Gao Zhisheng, a once fearless defender of dispossessed peasants who has been abducted several times and is presumed to be in the custody of state security personnel. Before he disappeared again last year, Mr. Gao told The Associated Press that he had been repeatedly brutalized during 14 months in captivity.Liu Xia, the wife of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, has not been seen since the prize was announced last October. Ni Yulan, a lawyer in Beijing who was left crippled by a police beating in 2002, says security officials arranged for water and electricity to be cut off from the hotel room she shares with her husband in an effort to force them onto the streets.“Making lawyers disappear and subjecting dissidents to constant harassment makes it hard to take seriously the government’s claims that it is devoted to rule of law,” said Jerome A. Cohen, a senior fellow at the and an expert on Chinese law.In recent decades, even as it tentatively embraced Western-style legal reforms, the Communist Party never completely shed its reliance on extralegal tactics to rein in critics. Former political prisoners could expect tightened confinement during important state occasions, and practitioners of , the banned spiritual movement, were regularly sent to labor camps if they refused to renounce their faith. Over the years, human rights advocates say that scores have died in detention.But during the last five years, legal scholars say the country’s powerful security apparatus has leveraged events like the Olympics and a spike in social unrest to institute more sweeping measures and fatten policing budgets.“The police are progressively trying new techniques, and it seems that Beijing is ready to go along,” said Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in . “We used to worry about people getting arrested and losing their jobs. Now we have to worry about them losing their lives.”Legal experts say that even though Communist Party leaders down the line have ultimate control over the police, the prosecutors and the courts, they face mounting internal pressure and incentives to quash threats to stability at the grass-roots level, often making it more expedient to circumvent the legal system with highly intrusive surveillance or temporary disappearances.Teng Biao, a lecturer at University of Political Science and Law, said security officials were partly responding to the surge in popular activism that, despite their best efforts at censorship, manages to bubble up through the Internet. Questioning and arresting the growing ranks of well-educated and wired activists, he said, can be a bureaucratic for those charged with maintaining internal security. Instead, they resort to stealth.“There are too many people doing too many different things, and the authorities know if they use so-called legal methods, it will only provoke a greater domestic backlash and more international pressure,” he said.Mr. Teng says he has had firsthand experience with extrajudicial punishment on numerous occasions in recent years, including a “disappearance” last October during which he was pummeled and kicked by police officers who repeatedly reminded him that they were above the law. “Let’s beat him to death and dig a hole to bury him,” one officer said to another, according to an account he published.Officials are also increasing their use of collective family punishment, legal experts say, a practice rooted in imperial China that destroyed countless families during the Cultural Revolution. The relatives of dissidents are periodically kept under house arrest, as in the case of Zeng Jinyan, the wife of the imprisoned rights activist , or they are subjected to travel bans.In December, the public security bureau in Beijing told Ilham Tohti, an outspoken critic of Chinese rule in Xinjiang, that his daughter would not be allowed to go overseas to attend the American school where she planned to study English.The authorities in Shandong Province appear to have spared little expense in their confinement of Mr. Chen and his family, setting aside millions of dollars, according to figures publicized by his wife, to pay for surveillance cameras, cellphone signal-blocking equipment and rotating crews of dozens of men who guard all entrances to tiny Dongshigu village.It was unclear who smuggled out the video, but China Aid, a Christian organization in that posted it online last week, credited a “sympathetic government source.” In it, Mr. Chen’s wife, Yuan Weijing, bleakly described the strictures of their existence: men peer through their windows or barge in unannounced; at night, an iron rod keeps them locked indoors.Her elderly parents and her son cannot visit, her young daughter cannot attend school, and her husband, who suffers from chronic , has been prevented from seeing a doctor.Human rights groups say the couple was badly beaten after the video became public. In it, Mr. Chen said local officials told him that their goal was to provoke him into stepping over some invisible line, providing a legal pretext for his return to jail.“If they merely say you are guilty, then you are guilty,” he said.His contention is not far-fetched. In 2006, after a flock of supporters held a protest against his house arrest, he himself was convicted of blocking traffic and destroying public property.The authorities deny that the family is under any restrictions. Confronted by European diplomats, Chinese officials have insisted there is no such thing as house arrest in China. Reached by phone on Wednesday, Xue Jie, the director of the Yinan County propaganda bureau, suggested that a reporter could simply call Mr. Chen or just drop by.But those who try to visit him encounter a very different reality. Gao Xinbo, 33, a veteran supporter of Mr. Chen who sneaked into the village on Monday night, said he was pummeled senseless, robbed of money and his cellphone, and dumped on a dark road 40 miles away. Last December, Western diplomats were jostled and forcibly searched before guards forced them to flee.Earlier this week, several journalists, including reporters and a photographer from , were roughed up by a dozen or so men who menaced them with sticks and confiscated their camera chips. The men wore plain clothes and refused to show identification as they tried to erase photographs and video footage.Asked what law authorized their actions, one of them grunted dismissively. “This has nothing to do with law,” he said.'"

"'11-02-20,'0','On March 6, the university will begin a cycle of seven five-week classes. After that, Mr. Kaufman said, students can expect both 5- and 10-week courses. Another teach-in is scheduled for June.Mr. Kaufman, who has long bridled against traditional education, came up with the idea for a free university in December. With the encouragement of Mr. Gonzalez, who is best known nationally as Ralph Nader’s Green Party vice-presidential running mate, the project was born.A loose collective of about 50 people is the institution’s sole decision-making body.Mr. Kaufman is working on a plan that would expand the concept even further. Nine colleges within the university — including a law school with Mr. Gonzalez as dean and an art school headed by Chuck Sperry, a printmaker — will be put to the collective for approval. Each school will have one female dean and one male dean to achieve gender parity.“Call us crazies, San Francisco crazies, but we’re doing it anyways,” said Mr. Kaufman, his Brooklyn accent apparent even after 20 years of Bay Area residence. “We believe that we are a system-changing revolution.”The makeshift school may be unusual but is hardly unique. “There’s a long history of free universities in this country, and the Bay Area in particular,” said John Hurst, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.But today’s rising cost of higher education makes the project newly relevant. According to the Project on Student Debt, a nonprofit research organization, the average California student holds about $17,000 in debt; student debt totals nearly $1 trillion nationwide. College tuition has increased 400 percent since the 1980s, a faster rate than that of escalating health care costs.Robert Cohen, a professor of history and education at New York University, compared the Free University to the Freedom Schools established in the South during the civil rights movement of the 1960s — although then the issue was access more than cost.“This is a kind of response to commodification of knowledge,” he said. “There’s no free public higher education in California anymore.”The big question, of course, is how long the Free University can remain in session with volunteer teachers. Mr. Hurst wasn’t hopeful about Free University’s long-term survival without any financial exchange.“The model has to be built on sustainability,” he said. “None of the ones that have been free-free have served for very long. Would that they could. Sooner or later, people have to live.”Still, students and teachers — often interchangeable roles at the Free University — are hopeful.“I didn’t know what to expect,” admitted Evan Karp, a writer and Web site founder. Along with Andrew Paul Nelson, Mr. Karp taught a class on Friedrich Nietzsche. “Everyone was passionate,” Mr. Karp said of his students. “Certainly, that was what I wanted out of a university experience that I didn’t get.”Even if the Free University doesn’t last, its concept could spread. “Once you show that there’s a hunger for these kind of courses, maybe other institutions will pick up on it,” Mr. Cohen said, “Lawyers do pro bono work. Why can’t universities?”'"
"'11-02-20,'0','It forces lawmakers to balance the financing of schools where property values are high with those where the values are low, all without dictating local school property tax rates. It ends up in court every few years, with the state getting sued by whichever group of schools feels mistreated at the time.The state’s red budget could set off the next round. The Texas Education Agency asked lawmakers for $10.4 billion more than those lawmakers included in their proposed two-year budgets. That’s a little more than $1,000 per student, and the first set of printouts detailing what that might mean to each of the state’s school districts was a sea of negative numbers. According to the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association’s estimates, per-student spending would drop to $7,850 in 2013 from $9,200 in 2010, or about 14.7 percent.Wealthier districts that already send locally raised tax money to the state — so-called recapture districts — would send more. Districts that get money from the state would get less. And depending on how it’s done, some districts that now get money from the state would have to turn around and write checks instead.According to Moak, Casey & Associates, a school finance and accountability consulting firm in Austin, a budget cut of that size could shift 30 districts onto the recapture rolls, bringing the total to 195 districts and raising the amount sent by that group to the state to $1.4 billion from the current $959 million.Daniel Casey, a partner at the firm, said the details of what would happen to each district would be unclear until the Legislature decided how to distribute money, what to allow districts to do with their own taxes and so on. But there’s no way to absorb cuts of that size without affecting the whole system.That’s enough numbers to numb most lawmakers, but the politics of it could wake them back up. The obvious way to make up for the cuts in state aid would be to increase financing from the federal government or to raise local property taxes. The state and the feds are arguing over $830 million in federal money that Gov. Rick Perry refused because of requirements it would impose on state education spending, but that doesn’t cover a $5-billion-a-year hole. And the financial problem is only half the trouble; getting the money almost always forces some change in the balancing formulas.One trial balloon rises with every school finance crisis and generally takes 24 to 48 hours to crash. In the early 1990s, it came from State Senator Carl Parker, Democrat of Port Arthur. Senator Bill Ratliff, Republican of Mount Pleasant, gave it a try a decade later. And this week, it was Senator Robert Duncan’s turn.A statewide property tax could replace the local property taxes and end, for the most part, the fight over where the money comes from. Mr. Duncan, a Lubbock Republican, shot the idea down himself, talking to The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. “It’s just a discussion,” he said. “It’s not a proposal.”Something like that might keep the state out of court on school finance. But it wouldn’t solve the other, bigger problem.'"
"'11-02-20,'0','Gery Chico and the other mayoral candidates were similarly vague. Rather than outlining a plan to change the pension system, Mr. Chico emphasized his experience negotiating with labor leaders and fashioning budgets as city school board president and mayoral chief of staff.“This will be an enormous issue that will require tough decisions by all parties,” Mr. Chico said in his questionnaire. “There is a shared pain in any solution, but based on my history, I am confident we will be able to reach a consensus that is fair for all parties.”The candidates’ reluctance to address the issue directly is no doubt due to the lack of an obvious, politically palatable answer.The city’s budget deficits, which grew to $655 million for 2011, are expected to continue and do not include the estimated $363 million that taxpayers would have to contribute each year for the next 50 years to adequately fund employee pension plans, according to a report last year by a mayoral panel. And that tab would be even higher if not for sharp cuts in pension payments for current employees as well as for new hires.There are more than 35,000 city workers, and they are thought to turn out at the polls more readily than other Chicagoans, forming a significant bloc of votes. Yet, it appears difficult to balance the books definitively without affecting the cost of their wages and benefits. Personnel costs represent 60 percent of the city’s annual budget of more than $6 billion, while 90 percent of the payroll is represented by unions.Chicago labor leaders say Mr. Emanuel told them in a closed-door meeting in December that he favored cutting pensions for current employees as well as for new hires. Unhappy with that possibility, the labor organizations representing most employees, including the unions for police, firefighters and garbage crews, endorsed Mr. Chico.A nationally renowned Democratic strategist, Mr. Emanuel is certainly aware that the tough economic times have left many voters here, and across the country, particularly displeased with the possibility of paying higher taxes to help finance the salaries and pensions of public workers. Mr. Emanuel seemed to try to capitalize on that mindset in a campaign TV ad in which he said that City Hall “is not an employment agency” and that all city workers should know “they are actually a public servant.”At the same time, Mr. Emanuel is mindful of the longstanding influence of organized labor in Illinois politics, and he has blanched at rivals’ efforts to portray him as an anti-union politician in the mold of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and others who have moved to slash employee costs. Mr. Emanuel has gone out of his way recently to assert that he is not trying to get elected on the backs of city workers.After his TV commercial generated a fierce backlash from union leaders, Mr. Emanuel said that as mayor he would not ask city workers to continue taking furlough days, a contract concession that has amounted to a 9 percent pay cut for most employees.Putting off confronting the pension problem could result in no pensions at all for employees, said Mr. Emanuel, who was White House chief of staff until shortly after Mayor Daley announced in September that he would retire this year. He said the only way to solve the issue was to “start to level with each other and not play politics about it.”Mr. Chico offered only one specific suggestion in his questionnaire response, saying, “Even labor has acknowledged that they must increase contributions.”Carol Moseley Braun said her mayoral campaign had lacked the time and money to devise a plan for grappling with underfinanced employee pensions.“We just got started three months ago,” Ms. Braun said. “We have limited resources to develop these kinds of plans and put them out there. I would expect, as part of transition, to bring in the best minds I can find, to get these people to talk to one another to help develop these plans.”Ms. Braun, a former United States senator, added that she would be hesitant to reduce pensions for current as well as new workers. “We have a moral obligation to see to it that the people who are already in the system do not get their retirement security blown up or diminished,” she said.Miguel del Valle, the city clerk, said he would not support reducing pension benefits of current employees, but he backed increasing employee contributions and delaying the retirement age for new hires.Patricia Van Pelt-Watkins, a community activist and political neophyte, was no more specific about how to help finance pensions than her better-known rivals. “I do not support reducing benefits for current employees,” she said. “The city must do its part to identify and provide stable revenue streams to fund their current and future pension obligations.”As for the budget deficit, Mr. Emanuel’s campaign recently released a list of plans that he said would save $500 million. Among the items were saving $110 million through an effort to “streamline bureaucracy” and trimming as much as $65 million through changes in the garbage-collection system.“It was the most detailed speech to date not just in this campaign, I would say in other campaigns, pre-election, that goes through line by line and says how you can achieve balance,” Mr. Emanuel said in an interview.Mr. Chico’s campaign released a list of proposed cost-cutting measures and said, “We have some of our own internal numbers,” but Mr. Chico said he would not release those figures publicly because they were estimates. He mocked Mr. Emanuel’s $500 million platform, saying it was impossible to make thorough calculations until taking office.“If somebody came in to me with some of this kind of numbers, I would have to fire him,” Mr. Chico said. “Putting a budget together is an art, not science.”Ms. Braun’s proposals include generating $100 million by increasing fines on owners of abandoned or neglected properties. When it was suggested that the owners of such properties may lack money for upkeep, much less to pay higher fines, she said, “Even if we collected only half of it, it would go a long way.”Only Mr. del Valle readily conceded that his proposals to cut costs would be insufficient to deal with the shortfall.After discussing budget ideas like cutting middle management and eliminating half of the mayoral public relations aide positions, Mr. del Valle said, “Does that get us to $650 million? Not right now. But once you get in there, you’re going to have to find $650 million.”'"
"'11-02-20,'0','Defense Secretary Robert Gates understands that the country cannot keep issuing blank checks to the Pentagon and that the Pentagon needs to spend more rationally and efficiently.He is committed to equipping American forces for the wars they are actually fighting. He has terminated some costly and unneeded weapons programs, held errant contractors accountable, and pressed the services to find savings to help pay for new spending.Mr. Gates is right that there is no way to restrain Pentagon spending without addressing health care costs, which now account for almost 10 percent of the budget. He has proposed that working-age military retirees pay higher health insurance premiums — $520 a year, up from $460 now — the first increase in 16 years.Some of that same managerial sense is evident in the Pentagon’s latest $553 billion request ($118 billion more is requested for Iraq and Afghanistan). But Mr. Gates did not go far enough. The $78 billion in spending cuts he announced last month were not really cuts, but merely reductions in projected hefty increases.Cuts in all areas of federal spending will be needed to bring down the deficit, and the Pentagon cannot be exempt. There are ways to cut that will not compromise national security. And the sooner those cuts begin, the less disruptive they will be to military planning, and the more savings they will yield.'"

Boy, was that filmstrip wrong, and now it seems that , the board game manufacturer, agrees.The company has unveiled a new version of Monopoly, that Depression-era invention that along with screwball comedies made Americans in the 1930s think they might one day laugh non-psychotically and own property again. Monopoly Live has done away with dice, as well as the Chance and Community Chest Cards. Instead, standing in the center of the board is an ominous infrared tower that speaks to players like some regulatory Yahweh, keeping track of their money and making sure they move the right spaces and stick to the rules. No more Uncle Wilbur demanding to be banker so he can slip some bright bills under the board for later. No more illegal renting or avoidance of the auction rules.Actually, with the dark ziggurat running the show, nobody has to worry about even knowing the rules: “Getting rid of the instruction book encourages a lot more face-to-face interaction,” Jane Ritson-Parsons, the global brand leader for Monopoly, told The Times earlier this week. “If you’re not having to read as much, you are all chatting more.”The same holds true, I gather, for the Constitution, your lease or your employment contract. Forget the fine print: chat!The tower of power also has ways of speeding up the game, or throwing random curveballs, like a hastily announced horse race upon which everyone must bet. No plans for a terrorist attack or market crash have been mentioned so far, but those could certainly add urgency and excitement to the game.Most important, however, is that the tower prevents cheating; indeed, its mandate to monitor transactions and investigate irregularities seems to be going the distances the Obama administration has only gestured toward. People will differ on the consequences of this for our 8- to 12-year-olds, to whom the new game is pitched. It might instill good citizenship, but some experts believe it will stifle the creativity and socializing so necessary in our chatty era. Chiseling your family and friends trains you for the real world.But even if the game really does prevent cheating, it also might inadvertently reveal the Big Cheat, the entire matrix of money and land and development and that’s already locked down, and show the overwhelming majority of young players how they will never share a board with the ultra-elites. Why have Chance cards, after all, when each one would have to read: “Congratulations, you belong to the half of 1 percent of the population that owns most of the wealth!”So maybe I love cheats — cheats who are doing it for the common good, who are flouting the rules that bind us to an unfair system. That’s why I can’t wait to play the new version of the game with my own children: Monopoly Live might just prove a wonderful incubator of little resisters to the stale and broken ideas we keep trotting out about our level American playing field of dreams.The truth is that most children follow rules if they are fair. Kids like order, or structure, as long as it’s not oppressive. But they can sniff out the fix, the rigged game, better than many political scientists and economists. Look at how the young people in and other Middle Eastern countries have managed to call their despots’ bluffs.However friendly and interactive that Monopoly tower might seem, maybe our own kids will work together to do an end run around the authoritarian monolith in the center of their world. And after they’ve torn down that huge plastic hegemon, they can all pass Go and head to the kitchen for equal shares of oatmeal .'"
"'11-02-20,'0','HAVANA (AP) — Cuba’s government has agreed to free seven more prisoners, the Roman Catholic Church announced on Saturday.Six of the prisoners, who were charged with crimes against state security, would be sent to Spain, the church said. The seventh prisoner said he planned to stay in Cuba.The government has recently released dozens of prisoners, most of them political dissidents, at the behest of the church. Almost all of them have been quickly sent into exile.But the Havana archbishop’s office said that Ivan Hernández, one of the men on the latest list or freed prisoners, had refused exile. Mr. Hernández, an independent journalist, was among 75 people arrested in a crackdown on dissidents in 2003. The inmates who have vowed to remain in Cuba have been the last to leave prison.“This is what we have been waiting for so long!” Asunción Carrillo, Mr. Hernández’s mother, said from her home in Matanzas, about 85 miles east of Havana.'"
"'11-02-20,'0','Brent is a global benchmark crude oil that is produced in the North Sea and traded in London. It is typically the benchmark that is used to set the price for most of the oil from the Middle East. Another benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, closed at $86.20 a barrel on Friday. Each benchmark has an impact on gasoline prices in the United States, with the East Coast more affected by the Brent prices than other regions.The reserves in the Middle East and North Africa (known as the MENA countries), while long important, have grown even more critical as demand for oil increases. Prices have risen about 30 percent since September, reaching their highest level since September 2008.Those who track oil prices are especially worried about the renewed turmoil in Iran and the possibility of unrest spreading from Bahrain to Saudi Arabia, which could have a major impact on oil’s price and its availability.Richard H. Jones, the energy agency’s deputy executive director and a former American diplomat in the Middle East, said that about 17 million barrels of oil passed through the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz every day. “So if that shuts down, we’re in big trouble,” he said.But so far, Mr. Jones said, the effects of the regional turmoil have been small. Egyptian production and transportation of natural gas have continued despite an explosion at a pipeline in the Sinai as the demonstrations against President Hosni Mubarak were under way. (An Egyptian investigator said four gunmen bombed the pipeline.) Although there have been labor protests among workers at the Suez Canal, so far analysts have said there is no danger of the vital waterway being affected by the country’s political upheaval.The unrest in Libya, while serious, has not disrupted its production of oil. Mr. Jones and Didier Houssin, who runs the directorate for energy markets and security at the International Energy Agency, said that Libya was not a major producer, selling “only a little over one million barrels a day” and representing about 2 percent of world production. If there were to be a disruption of supplies from Libya, “We can cope,” Mr. Jones said.Still, a Deutsche Bank commodities analyst, Soozhana Choi, said, “As antigovernment protests have spread from Tunisia and Egypt to the streets of Bahrain, Yemen and OPEC member countries Algeria, Libya and Iran, concerns about geopolitical risk and the potential for supply disruptions have returned aggressively” to the oil market.The International Energy Agency monitors strategic oil reserves that total about 1.6 billion barrels, Mr. Tanaka said. The agency has sometimes released reserves to smooth out global oil prices, including in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.The agency’s chief economist, Fatih Birol, said that with Brent crude over $100 a barrel, “we are entering a danger zone,” he said, with oil prices “creating inflationary pressures and risk for economic recovery.”For now, although oil stocks are declining with increased consumption, “there is still plenty of spare production capacity, especially in OPEC countries,” Mr. Tanaka said.Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, speaking on Saturday at a Group of 20 meeting, said that the Saudis in particular had indicated that they had significant spare capacity, which may help to keep markets calm.But over the past two years, Mr. Zoellick said, “There is a much closer connection between food and energy prices.” Part of the reason is biofuels, he said, but oil is also vital for fertilizers, transportation and agricultural equipment, especially in the developing world, where demand is increasing.While the world is moving toward more renewable energy sources and re-examining nuclear power, it will be dependent on fossil fuels for years to come, Mr. Birol said. For the future, “90 percent of growth in oil production will have to be met by MENA countries,” he said. “If not, we’re in trouble.”'"
"'11-02-20,'0','JOHANNESBURG — Madagascar’s ousted president, Marc Ravalomanana, was prevented from boarding a commercial flight here on Saturday, stymieing his attempt to return home after two years in exile.“I am going to Madagascar for peace, not war. Why are they stopping me here now?” he said to reporters who had accompanied him to the airport.Mr. Ravalomanana, with tickets in hand for himself and his family, arrived two hours early. But officials from the airline South African Airlink informed him that the Malagasy government had requested that he be turned away.He was shown a letter from the island nation’s civil aviation board. It read in part: Mr. Ravalomanana “and company are non grata persons in Madagascar. So to preserve public order don’t take them aboard.”His return would most likely have provoked a confrontation. The former president, deposed in a military-backed coup in March 2009, was last year convicted in absentia of murder, a case stemming from the deaths of at least 25 antigovernment protesters shot by Mr. Ravalomanana’s presidential guard. He would face arrest if he came home.But Mr. Ravalomanana, elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2006, retains a sizable following. Expecting his return, a large crowd already had gathered at the airport in Antananarivo, the nation’s capital, witnesses said.Madagascar, with a population of 20 million, lies off Africa’s southeastern coast. Its current government was installed by mutinous military officers and is led by Andry Rajoelina, the former mayor of Antananarivo.'"
"'11-02-20,'0','“It came out as a joke, but he doesn’t know what we’re going through,” said Darcy Linklater, the mayor of this faded railroad town just a few miles from the Snake. “It’s just such a mess.”It seems everyone wants a piece of the river system that the salmon travel, and agreeing on ways to share it is harder than coming up with one-liners.On Feb. 1, huge trucks began hauling oil-production equipment to Montana from Lewiston, Idaho’s only seaport, located 465 miles east of the ocean and made possible by a series of navigation locks connected to massive concrete dams that control the Columbia and Snake. Soon the trucks are expected to ship much more equipment farther north, to the oil sands of Canada, against opposition from groups who say the route, once traveled by Lewis and Clark, should not be used to advance the future of fossil fuels.Even as advocates for salmon want some dams removed to ease fish migration, major renovations are under way this winter at three dams to ensure that the barge traffic they enable can continue for decades to come.“Activity fosters activity,” said Dave Doeringsfeld, the manager of the Port of Lewiston. “The opportunity to meet future United States energy needs will benefit from the Columbia-Snake river system.”At the other end of the river basin, in Longview, Wash., commissioners of Cowlitz County recently approved a permit to build an export facility on the Columbia that would allow Montana to haul coal to the river by rail, below the dams, then transfer it to barges so it could be shipped to Asia. Major environmental groups have filed a lawsuit that has delayed the project. Among their arguments is that exporting coal would undercut goals outlined by Northwest political leaders for reducing emissions and producing clean energy.Documents recently released in the case suggest that the company that would build the facility had hoped to eventually make it far larger than what it had proposed to the state. A crucial factor shaping the company’s plans is the limited construction period each year, known as the “fish window,” because it is arranged around when salmon are least affected.To the frustration of advocates for salmon and the rivers, many in the Northwest have long boasted that the region gets much of its power from a renewable resource: hydropower from the dams on the Columbia and Snake. The advocates say there is nothing clean about dams that kill fish and clog rivers.The prospect of now using the rivers to export coal and import oil-production equipment only deepens the tension.“We’ve got so-called clean energy fostering dirty-energy sources,” said Amy Kober, a spokeswoman for American Rivers, which is celebrating the removal of dams from several rivers this year. “How does that impact our overall climate goals?”Others worry about local economics. Mr. Linklater, the mayor of Starbuck, makes his living from the river system — and from more than one side of the debates surrounding it. He runs a tackle shop that depends on a strong salmon run but he also rents space in an r.v. park to workers repairing the dams that impede the fish.Some of his tenants represent still other interests in the salmon-river-energy nexus. They help install wind turbines rising quickly along the rivers and whose power is intended to complement energy produced by the dams. Or they scour future wind farm sites to avoid disturbing American Indian burial sites deep in the remote and treeless hills that surround much of the Columbia and the Snake in eastern Washington.These kinds of negotiations are nothing new.“Make a realistic bargain that preserves what can be saved of the Columbia and its salmon and its spirit,” Blaine Harden wrote in his book, “A River Lost.” “Make an agreement and abide by it honestly.”The passage, published in 1996, was a paraphrase of the pragmatic philosophy practiced by the leaders of the tiny Wanapum tribe, centered on the banks of the Columbia near Vantage, Wash. A century earlier, the tribe had been known for spreading a controversial religion built on the idea that white settlers would one day vanish and the river and the region would return to its previous existence.Over time, the Wanapums learned to live with change. Now, the core of the tribe, three extended families, lives in the shadow of a huge hydroelectric dam through an agreement brokered with a local electrical utility. They are surrounded by land sealed off by the former Hanford Nuclear Reservation.Rex Buck Jr., a Wanapum leader, said in an interview that his people had made concessions to stay on a changing river. One is that while only wild salmon are acceptable for ceremonial purposes, salmon from hatcheries can be eaten for regular meals.Mr. Buck said he had not heard the president’s speech or his salmon joke. But he said he had no expectation that salmon, or the river system, could be addressed quickly through government streamlining. Like many other interests on the Columbia and the Snake, the Wanapums, he said, plan to maintain their claim to them.“All we’re asking is that we live like neighbors,” Mr. Buck said. “My grandfather said maybe that’s the way the great maker wants it to be.”'"
"'11-02-20,'0','When Hasbro showed a new version of Monopoly last week at the Toy Fair, people were aghast that an infrared tower in the center of the board would squawk instructions, track players’ money and make sure that everyone abided by the rules.A generation of children may never learn to make change. They may never learn to argue about rules and change them. And they may never, as I and a group of Monopoly fanatics in college did in a great all-night game, learn important economic lessons. “There might not be the attention span for that anymore,” said Mike Zelenty, one of the players.Monopoly was taken seriously in Shorey House at the University of Chicago in the late 1970s. A room was set aside as “The Monopoly Room.” But in that post-Vietnam, pre-Reagan era, all assumptions were questioned and a game our parents played was no exception. Rules were meant to be altered. The house even convened a “constitution convention” to change the official rules of the game to allow a person to build a hotel on a property without first having to own four houses. Mr. Zelenty, now a corporate lawyer in his native New Jersey, remembers holding a sign that said, “New Jersey Espouses / Hotels Without Houses.”The other thing taken as seriously in that dorm was free-market economics or, more precisely, Milton Friedman, the University of Chicago economics professor. This was a house that frequently invited Professor Friedman and his wife, Rose, to sherry hours. House members ran a snack bar in the basement of the dormitory called Tanstaafl, an abbreviation of a saying favored by Mr. Friedman, that “there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.”Mr. Zelenty owned the greatest of treasures any of us could imagine because it combined those two passions. He had asked Mr. Friedman to sign his Monopoly board at one of those sherry hours. The Nobel laureate did so, writing, “Down with” above the game’s name. We didn’t play on that board. No one ever played on that board. (Mr. Zelenty said he still has it and wants to donate the relic to the university one day. “It’s in a place of safety more than a place of honor,” he said.)'"
"'11-02-20,'0','“But the government’s obligation is to obey the Constitution all the time,” said Catherine Crump, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. “Moreover, controversial government programs often start small and then grow,” after which “the government argues that it is merely carrying out the same policies it has been carrying out for years.”One of the regular targets is Pascal Abidor, a Brooklyn-born student getting his Ph.D. in Islamic studies, who reported being frisked, handcuffed, taken off a train from Montreal and locked for several hours in a cell last May, apparently because his computer contained research material in Arabic and news photographs of Hezbollah and Hamas rallies. He said he was questioned about his political and religious views, and his laptop was held for 11 days.Another is James Yee, a former Muslim chaplain at the Guantánamo Bay prison, who gets what he wryly calls a “V.I.P. escort” whenever he flies into the United States. In 2003, Mr. Yee was jailed and then exonerated by the Army after he had conveyed prisoners’ complaints about abuse, urged respect for their religious practices and reported obscene anti-Muslim caricatures being e-mailed among security staff.Years later, he evidently remains on a “lookout” list. A federal agent stands at the door of Mr. Yee’s incoming plane, then escorts him to the front of the passport line and to secondary screening.Arriving in Los Angeles last May from speaking engagements in Malaysia, he was thoroughly questioned and searched, he said, and his laptop was taken for three or four hours. He was not told why, but after it was returned and he was waiting to rebook a connecting flight he’d missed, a customs officer rushed up to the counter. “We left our disk inside your computer,” he quoted her as saying. “I said, ‘It’s mine now.’ She said no, and sure enough when I took the computer out, there was a disk.”Customs won’t comment on specific cases. “The privacy rights that citizens have really supersede the government’s ability to go into any depth,” said Kelly Ivahnenko, a spokeswoman.In general, “we’re looking for anyone who might be violating a U.S. law and is posing a threat to the country,” she explained. “We’re in the business of risk mitigation.”Yet the mitigation itself has created a sense of risk among certain travelers, including lawyers who need to protect attorney-client privilege, business people with proprietary information, researchers who promise their subjects anonymity and photojournalists who may pledge to blur a face to conceal an identity. Some are now taking precautions to minimize data on computers they take overseas.“I just had to do this myself when I traveled internationally,” said Ms. Crump, the lead attorney in a lawsuit challenging the policy on behalf of Mr. Abidor, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National Press Photographers Association.During a week in Paris, where she lectured on communications privacy, she had legal work to do for clients, which she could not risk the government seeing as she returned. “It’s a pain to get a new computer,” she said, “wipe it completely clean, travel through the border, put the new data on, wipe it completely clean again.”In simpler days, as customs merely looked for drugs, ivory, undeclared diamonds and other contraband that could be held in an inspector’s hand, searches had clear boundaries and unambiguous results.Either the traveler had banned items, or didn’t. Digital information is different. Some is clearly illegal, some only hints at criminal intent, and under existing law, all is vulnerable to the same inspection as hand-carried material on paper.Most pirated intellectual property and child pornography, for example, cannot be uncovered without fishing around in hard drives. “We’ve seen a raft of people coming from Southeast Asia with kiddie porn,” said Christopher Downing, a supervisor at Dulles. If a person has been gone only two or three days and pictures of children are spotted in a bag, he explained, the laptop is a logical candidate for inspection. Such searches have been fruitful, judging by the bureau’s spreadsheets, which list numerous child pornography cases.But terrorism is an amalgam of violence and ideas, so its potential is harder to define as officers scrutinize words and images as indicators of attitudes, affiliations and aspirations. Random searches are not done, Mr. Downing said, although courts so far have upheld computer inspections without any suspicion of wrongdoing. In practice, something needs to spark an officer’s interest. “If you open up a suitcase and see a picture of somebody holding an RPG,” he noted, referring to a rocket-propelled grenade, “you’d want to look into that a little more.”The search power is preserved by its judicious use, Mr. Downing said. “If you abuse it, you lose it.” he added. The A.C.L.U. doesn’t want customs to lose it, Ms. Crump explained, but just wants the courts to require reasonable suspicion, as the Supreme Court did in 1985 for examinations of a person’s “alimentary canal.” The court distinguished such intrusive inspection from “routine searches” on the border, which “are not subject to any requirement of reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or warrant.” The justices added in a footnote that they were not deciding “what level of suspicion, if any, is required for nonroutine border searches” of other kinds.Laptop searches should be considered “nonroutine,” Ms. Crump argues, something the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to do in 2008, when it reversed a judge’s decision to suppress evidence of child pornography obtained during a suspicionless airport computer search.With the search powers intact, Mr. Abidor no longer dares take the train home from his studies at McGill University in Montreal. He doesn’t want to be stranded at the border, waiting hours for a bus, as he was in May. So on Dec. 22, his father drove up from New York to get him for vacation. The men were ordered to a room and told to keep their hands on a table while customs officers spent 45 minutes searching the car, and possibly the laptop, Mr. Abidor said. “I was told to expect this every time.”'"

"'11-02-20,'0','MY father, Tino, started our family business, an electronic assembly and manufacturing company, in 1991 because he was tired of all the reorganizations and layoffs at high-tech companies where he worked. He’s Hispanic and a Vietnam veteran and always wanted to be an entrepreneur. The layoffs pushed him to do it.I was a sophomore studying accounting at Portland State University in Oregon. I thought I’d always be able to find a job with that degree; I wasn’t thinking about working at the company.My mother, Joy, was an assembler at another company. In the beginning, my dad would call her at her job and ask that she call him at work because no customers were calling. He wanted to make sure the phone was working. Shortly afterward, she quit her job and joined him, and I’d help her build assemblies when I could.I was working in the corporate office of a Honda dealer that had five or six dealerships, however, and I had no time. I did the bookkeeping and learned everything from payroll to accounts payable to warranties. I could answer a 30-line telephone switchboard like no one else.Every semester, I’d take my class schedule to work and arrange my work schedule with the managers. I’d get up before 6 a.m. for school, leave campus around noon and work at the office until about 6 p.m. Then I’d either leave for a night class or answer the phones. Those years are a blur. I lived on Doritos and candy bars.When I graduated, my parents asked me to join the family business full time. I really liked the car dealer, but there was no career path for me there, so I started at our business as the controller. I was promoted to chief financial officer and president in 2003.About five years after I started, my parents and I had to admit we had a problem working together. We slammed doors a lot, and whoever yelled the loudest won any argument. Dad came from a purchasing and sales background, Mom had a manufacturing and quality background, and my background was accounting and general business. We just weren’t communicating, so we called in a family business counselor.I learned that my father and I have similar communication styles. We want just the facts, and we talk almost in bullet points. My mother, on the other hand, likes to explain a bit before getting to the point. I was using a hand motion to signal Mom to hurry up, and our employees picked up on it and started doing it, too. I had to change; I hadn’t even realized I was doing this. I was so motivated to learn more that I went back to school at night and on weekends for a master’s in organizational behavior at Marylhurst University in Oregon.My parents are semiretired now. We could have all made more money over the years, and I could have received two or three times my salary if I had worked at another company. But we have enjoyed the flexibility of making our own hours instead. Once we got a call from an organization conducting an annual salary survey, wanting to double-check the salary figures we had given them. When I told the person that the figures were correct, he said that they couldn’t use them then. We were throwing their curve off.When I was 3, my father took me to the library every week. That must have had a big influence on me because I’m always reading novels. I become so engrossed that I don’t always hear my husband and son talking to me. My husband tells me that I should write the next great novel and make us millionaires. I tell him that just because you’re an avid reader doesn’t mean you can be a great writer.'"
"'11-02-20,'0','The more Hughes — and C. C. Sabathia — talked on Friday about Good Old No. 46, the more Pettitte sounded like a man with letters after his name.Maybe Dr. Pettitte, staff shrink, would be too much of character stretch, but even Sabathia was reluctant to claim the necessary credentials for the job.“Andy was just one of those guys; he could get to anybody,” Sabathia said. “I feel like I can talk to guys, but I don’t think I’m in the position yet where I can fill the void Andy left. I don’t think anyone can. Hopefully one day I can get to that point, but I don’t know if this is the year for that.”What would it take?Sabathia laughed and said, “Win five World Series?”The Yankees do not have time to wait for Sabathia to win four more. Their rotation is partly in disrepair, presumably steered by Sabathia and anchored by Hughes. After them, it floats in uncharted waters.A. J. Burnett has proven talent but was a tattooed mess by the conclusion of last season. To fill the fourth and fifth spots, tryouts are being conducted for the young and erratic (Ivan Nova and Sergio Mitre) and the aging and infirm (Bartolo Colon and Freddy Garcia). Adding to the unfamiliarity and uncertainty is a new pitching coach, Larry Rothschild.“People see how big a guy is, how talented, but what they don’t see or know is where their head’s at,” Hughes said. “And that’s where it really helps to have that guy who pulls you aside and says, ‘Hey, let’s try to work on some stuff.’ It’s not anything these guys don’t know, but it’s not always so easy in the bright lights to say, ‘O.K., move on.’ ”Saying he is “not at the point in my career where I can step up and be that guy,” Hughes nominated Sabathia and Burnett, if only by inheritance. “It’s going to be important for guys we have coming up now like Nova,” he said. “They’ll need a guy like that.”In camp as a special instructor, David Wells recalled that the young Pettitte didn’t need much counseling but once grew insecure with trade rumors swirling.“Andy always seemed like a veteran because of his work habits,” Wells said. “But I remember one time after he’d had a bad game and was worried about getting traded, and I told him, ‘It’s just rumors until it happens.’ I said: ‘Don’t beat yourself up. Go get a good workout; go out there next time with conviction.’“You know, the days between starts can seem like forever. It’s a grueling time, especially if you’re a mental case, which a lot of us are.”That was the beauty of Pettitte, whose competitive alter-ego bordered on obsession to the point that the Yankees’ pitchers jokingly called him by another name, Lloyd, on days that he pitched.“His personality would just flip,” Sabathia said. “There are a lot of guys like that, but not with how Andy was off the field. Some of the stuff that would come out of his mouth — though he wouldn’t curse because he’s a devout Christian — was hilarious.”In the dugout, Hughes would sit next to Sabathia, watching Pettitte fire his glove into the wall and gosh-darning his way through the Yankees’ half of the inning.“And this was after a 1-2-3 inning because he wasn’t happy with his location,” Hughes said. “I’d say to C. C., ‘I’d be throwing a party if I had an inning like that.’ ”Sabathia added: “Yeah, and then the next day he’d sit down next to me, back to his normal self, and say, ‘Talk to me, what’s going on?’ You’d see how emotionally involved he was, and that’s how you knew Andy was so real and why everyone would listen to him.”Asked if such presence could be acquired or grown into, Sabathia agreed that Pettitte was just a rare breed.“I’m not saying that I won’t do that for one of the younger guys,” he said. “I am saying that you can’t expect any of us to be the way Andy was.”The Yankees will just have to deal with the fact that their doctor of pitching psychology has left the clubhouse.'"
"'11-02-20,'0','“I guess it shows the respect they have for us — and that we’re going to get everyone’s best shot no matter what,” Mack said.Perhaps the Bulldogs should have expected that kind of reaction after last season. Dealing with it has been an entirely different matter.For the first time in Howard’s career, the Bulldogs lost three in a row. For the first time in four years, they will probably have to play the conference tournament outside their home gym, Hinkle Fieldhouse. And for the first time in a long time, they may need to win the tournament title just to make the N.C.A.A. field.That is not the way Butler usually does business.“I’d be lying to you if I said it didn’t bother me at all,” Howard said. “Every single loss eats at me.”Such frustration is not new for national runners-up.Since 1985, when the N.C.A.A. tournament expanded to 64 teams from 48, only seven teams made it back to championship game the next season: Duke returned to the final game after its 1990 and 1991 championship appearances, Michigan did it after its 1992 appearance, Arkansas after 1994, Kentucky after 1996 and 1997, and Florida after 2006. Only 13 of the 25 advanced beyond the second round. Four teams — Seton Hall in 1990, Duke in 1995, Syracuse in 1997 and Ohio State in 2008 — missed the next year’s tournament, a list Butler does not want to join.But the long road back has been tougher than most Butler fans expected, even after losing the conference player of the year, Gordon Hayward, early to the N.B.A. draft, and Avery Jukes and Willie Veasley to graduation.“The bottom line is we’re playing good teams and we’re playing them in a Super Bowl-like atmosphere,” Coach Brad Stevens said. “And in one possession games, we’ve just come up a little short a couple of times. It would have been the same story the last couple of years if we hadn’t figured out how to win those games.”Butler has nobody to blame but itself for the problems. The biggest has been a failure to follow its blueprint for success . Usually, the Bulldogs rank among the national leaders in scoring defense, allowing fewer than 60 points a game. This year, it had given up an average of 66 points before Saturday.Players and coaches acknowledge that until recently the focus, on each possession has not been there. Injuries hurt, too, and when the battered Howard left the court with his face covered in blood two weeks ago, some fans wondered what more could go wrong this season.“It’s been really hard to swallow,” said Nored, a junior point guard. “Those are things you don’t want to be remembered for. We still feel the effects of the losing streak and even in some of the wins, we got lucky. They didn’t feel right.”Now, things have turned again.The Bulldogs (19-9, 11-5 entering the weekend) rebounded from the three-game skid with the five-game winning streak they took to Illinois-Chicago on Saturday. They had not allowed more than 65 points in any of those games, and another victory would give Butler its sixth consecutive 20-win season.The recent run of success has put the Bulldogs back in the N.C.A.A. discussion — even if the disbelievers do not think they deserve one of the 37 at-large bids — and Howard, Mack and Nored are starting to take over again. It is a combination that has Stevens thinking big again.“It doesn’t surprise me they responded the way they have,” he said. “I’m upbeat right now because I feel like we’re playing well at the right time.”Just like last year?'"
"'11-02-20,'0','The “up to” has its own fine-print qualifications, and the value of the buyback drops steeply over time. The customer receives only “up to 10 percent” if the television is sold back between 25 and 49 months. For other products — mobile phones, laptops, netbooks and tablet computers — the offer ends 25 months after purchase.There is a risk, however, that new, improved versions of technology won’t arrive as quickly as the commercials suggest. You may end up without a compelling reason to buy a new TV within months of spending that initial $2,179.In the buyback plan’s terms and conditions, Best Buy explains that “time is of the essence.” If the buyback option isn’t exercised by the deadline, it loses all value. That’s not the case with a conventional trade-in arrangement, which Best Buy also offers and doesn’t entail buying a sell-back option in advance.If the customer has the company buy back the product, Best Buy pays not with cash but with the gift card. If the customer never redeems the option, all the better for the retailer. “Collecting a fee for a service that isn’t used is a wonderful business,” says Matthew Fassler, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.In the fiscal quarter ended Nov. 27, Best Buy reported a 5 percent decline in comparable-store sales in the United States and Puerto Rico, versus the year-earlier quarter. A category with a large drop was consumer electronics, down 10.6 percent. Best Buy’s services, which include extended warranties, proved more durable, down only 1.5 percent.Mr. Fassler says Best Buy has not disclosed for many years how much extended warranties contribute to its profits. Consumer electronics retailing is “historically a low-margin business that is dependent on extended warranties for profitability,” he says. “Perhaps extended warranties have become even more valuable to Best Buy recently, as its content businesses — like movies and music — have shrunk.”Consumers who elect the buyback option must hope they have a clearer view of the future — and the new technology it will bring — than those who buy extended warranties to guard against unexpected problems. Mark Kotkin, director of survey research at Consumer Reports, says, “The salesperson often tells you, ‘This will give you peace of mind in case you need an expensive repair. I would get it.’ But the odds of a product breaking down during a typical extended warranty period are low.”Even if the product does break, the cost of repair is not much more, on average, than the cost of the warranty, he says. He concludes that extended warranties “are a bad bet.”AJAY KALRA, a marketing professor at Rice University, agrees. “All the statistics are compelling: in almost all cases, you shouldn’t buy the extended warranty,” he says.Professor Kalra was co-author of a 2009 article published in the Journal of Consumer Research that examined purchase records from the electronics department of an unidentified retailer.An extended service contract was bought in about 3 of every 10 transactions. The authors noticed subjective considerations: customers were more likely to add the warranty if the product was to be used mostly for fun. Such products, the authors hypothesized, “elicit feelings of guilt and heighten risk aversion.”I’d like to know that Best Buy is not making ridiculously higher margins on extended warranties and other services, compared with those on the sales of the products themselves. Here’s a picture of a better future: Best Buy again breaks out the margins earned by each add-on service.It may be long past the day Ozzy gets his bloody 6G.'"
"'11-02-20,'0','The rules of the Stop N Swap are punishingly strict: Bring whatever you want, or don’t bring anything at all; leave with as much as you care to, or nothing; come whenever you feel like it; go whenever you’re done. Oh, and it’s free — not just the stuff you pick up; there is no entry fee.Not exactly the usual mess of governmental red tape. Then again, GrowNYC is not your usual government agency; it’s a nonprofit organization run out of the mayor’s office. Its first swap meet was in 2002; this year, it plans to do five in each of three “cleaning seasons” — post-New Year’s, spring and before the winter holidays.“What we’re doing transcends economic times in many ways but is probably even more important now,” said Marcel Van Ooyen, the group’s executive director. “Trying to get people to think of their stuff as not junk, but something of value that could be useful to other people — then you get people thinking about maybe not buying things, maybe getting something repaired, reducing consumerism and, as a result, reducing their impact on the overall environment one item at a time.”During the last major economic downturn, after 9/11, city officials told us the best thing we could do for New York was to go out and shop. This time, the message is to conserve and repurpose and share.It’s not just the traveling swap meets — the last of which is Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Middle School 113 in Fort Greene, . There’s also NYC Stuff Exchange, a city-sponsored guide to places to donate or find used goods; freecycle.org, a Web site that has for some become a social network and a way of life; and, of course, , without which no first apartment could ever again be furnished. Park Slope, Brooklyn, home of a thousand stoop sales, has even given rise to Junk Slope, a tumblr account showing photographs of things people have left out on the street to be free-cycled.The behavioral economist Dan Ariely has written about how lowering the price of an item from cheap to free can make it almost infinitely more attractive, even when much better alternatives might be available for just a few cents more. The prospect of getting something for nothing can short-circuit our ordinary sense of what we want, what we like and certainly what we need, a fact that helps keep the parallel economy of free stuff circulating nicely.At the Staten Island swap meet, , a self-described freelance anthropologist from Bushwick, Brooklyn, brought books, shirts, computer parts — some of which, he admitted, he had acquired at other swap meets. He said a successful swap was one in which he found not only things he knew he wanted but desires he didn’t know he had.But a price tag of zero can have the opposite effect, too: price is one way we measure value. When everything has the same price — free — it can be hard to distinguish between useful used objects and everyday junk.In the end, 225 people made it to the Staten Island event (fewer than the high-water mark in , which a few weeks later drew 350, but enough to be regarded as a great success). As I looked over the bounty of their basements and closets, surely rich with opportunity, nothing caught my eye. Not the salt-and-pepper shakers in the shape of little fish; not the his and hers boogie boards. Sadly, someone beat me to “The of Swan Point Cemetery.”Michela Traetto, who came to Staten Island by way of and , was enraptured by all of it. “Oh, it’s extremely interesting!” she exclaimed. “They have Dante, , ‘An Introduction to the Apocrypha.’ ”What really captured Ms. Traetto’s imagination was a French translation of “Buddenbrooks.”“I was going to take this one,” she said wistfully, “but then I think, if I take it, someone else won’t have it.”'"
"'11-02-20,'0','Mr. Walton, who has played with a long list of luminaries like Art Blakey and John Coltrane, sketched out an approach to solo playing based more on exploring reharmonization than on experimenting with form. Typically, he said, he opens a tune with an arrangement or “premise,” to which he returns at the tune’s closing, establishing musical markers along the way.“I lean on cornerstones to get me through to the next part of the piece,” he said.Modeling his treatment of some tunes on those of the seminal bebopper Bud Powell, Mr. Walton will alter chords but rarely venture into the keyboard’s lower registers with “walking” tenths or single-note lines. His solo playing relies more on implying than “replacing” instruments in the sound palette.“I find myself reverting back to just imagining the bass and drums,” he said.Ms. Uehera, a native of Japan known professionally by her first name, is more explicit in her approach. Though she is the youngest of the three musicians on the bill, she is perhaps the one most likely to incorporate vintage styles like stride into her performance. Like other aspects of her playing, her stride has been noted for its technical brilliance.Occasionally Ms. Uehera has faced criticism for overreliance on technique, but she seems hesitant to rein it in at the expense of simulating orchestral fullness. Asked about her priorities for solo playing, she focused on distinguishing it from her trio efforts.“The thing that I want to be careful of,” she said, “is that it doesn’t sound like the music without the bass and drums.”For Mr. Terrasson, who was raised in France, the focus is more on the freedom solo playing offers. Much like the pianist Martial Solal — a fellow Frenchman and Peiffer’s counterpart in the clubs of postwar Paris — Mr. Terrasson is known to play loosely with structure.Though his solo playing may make less use of so-called extended techniques than his combo playing does — the Village Vanguard engagement at which he played the piano’s strings was a trio date — it will probably be no more predictable. Favoring suggestion more than outright statement, he weaves oddly placed melodic bits and metric shifts into a fluid soundscape.“Form can be flexible; time can be stretched,” he said. “I try not to lock myself into formats that are too limited.”All three pianists have released albums of solo playing, and all three said they were likely to draw from those albums for their solo concerts. The albums all mix original and standard material, with little overlap in song titles. Should the pianists decide on any given night to play the same standard, the treatments are likely to contrast sharply.Meanwhile, Mr. Mehldau’s Sunday show at the Garde will offer some contrasts of its own. He has lately been delving into the world of classical song, having written cycles for the sopranos Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter. At the same time, he has been mining the music of bands like Nirvana and Stone Temple Pilots. All of which may be reflected in his solo playing, which, he wrote in an e-mail, is relatively “less tied to a genre.”But whatever its adherence to genre, his solo playing will follow the jazzman’s ethos. Echoing the sentiments of the other three pianists, he wrote that final decisions about repertoire may not be made until the day, or even the moment, of performance — and, once those decisions are made, his fealty will be to the improvisatory spirit.“I want the listener to feel like he or she went somewhere,” he wrote, “and then returned with something new.”'"

"'11-02-20,'0','I knew this gritty reputation to be unfair. The northern French are famously warm and friendly, the countryside is beautiful and the region’s estaminets — the word probably derives from the Germanic word “stamen,” a post to which a cow is tied at the feeding trough — charmed me from the first time I went to one 20 years ago.On a trip to Lille last year, I’d read that one of the area restaurants, L’Estaminet du Centre in Godewaersvelde, had for the first time entered the Michelin Guide as a Bib Gourmand (a place offering good eating at affordable prices).Intrigued by this benediction, I decided to return — with a true Ch’ti by my side.At this lively, candlelit estaminet, Bruno and I began with a sampler of five pork pâtés, flavored by an array of seasonings, each indelibly northern French: rhubarb, beer, Maroilles cheese, apple and prune. I loved the Maroilles, while Bruno favored the rhubarb.‘T Rijsel served as a good primer for the estaminet experience, thanks to that trio of classic entrees: carbonnade, beef braised in dark beer; waterzooi, chicken in a cream and egg yolk sauce, served with carrots, leeks, onions and celery; and the pot’je vleesch. This hearty dish of boned rabbit, veal, pork and chicken arrived at the table on a bed of white vinegar aspic with a huge bowl of frites, a soothing and satisfying segue from the trencherman’s portion of pâté.My entree, chicken in Maroilles sauce, disappointed; the leg arrived sauce-less under a slice of melted undistinguished, pre-sliced cheese. Knowing we had many estaminets before us, we went easy on dessert, splitting a crème brûlée, which was seasoned with powdered speculoos, the spice cookies popular in northern France and Belgium, and glazed with a crust of raw brown sugar. We finished our meal with two shots of genièvre de Houlle, a gin-like digestif.Estaminet ‘T Rijsel, 25 rue de Gand, Lille; (33-3) 20-15-01-59; ruedesrestos.com/restaurateurs/rijsel. Dinner for two, 50 euros, or $67 at $1.34 to the euro. (All prices do not include drinks or tip.) Closed Sundays.The next day, we headed east, to the pretty little village of Hondeghem. Following back roads through lush pastures and past the occasional windmill, we soon arrived at L’Estaminet de l’Ancienne Maison Commune, with its immaculate white-painted brick facade and terrace with potted boxwoods.Seated at a wooden table in a rustic room dominated by an open fireplace, we ordered a bottle of Bracine, a superb dark beer brewed just a few miles away, and somewhat warily snacked on smout, a spread of lard with chopped shallots. “At this rate, I’ll have to go to the gym twice as often next week,” said Bruno, while I silently decided it would be easier just to let my belt out another notch.We watched the owner, Dominique Hardy, grill plump farm-house sausages and racks of ribbekes, baby pork ribs sprinkled with a “secret” burnt-orange spice mix that I’d wager contained nutmeg, turmeric, pepper and cloves, over the embers of a wood fire.The pork ribs — from a small organic farm just down the road, Ms. Hardy told us — featured meat that was well-crusted, with a juicy, tangy interior; it arrived with a side of grilled Bintje potatoes that I heedlessly slathered with butter and crème fraîche. The sage-flavored sausage, which came with excellent frites, was succulent.“We’ve never been so busy,” Ms. Hardy told me as we each finished up with a bistouille, an espresso with a shot of genièvre on the side. “If older people always went to estaminets, a new generation loves their history and good locally grown country food.”Atop a steep hill with stunning views over rolling fields, Cassel is among the prettiest towns in French Flanders and the location of the renowned Het Kasteelhof, which occupies an old yellow-painted brick house with two cozy bare-wood floored dining rooms chock-a-block with flea-market finds.Arriving for dinner on foot during a squall that rendered my umbrella useless, Bruno and I were happy to sit by the chimney fire and start off with a bottle of La Rouge Flamande, an amber beer from the nearby village of Esquelbecq. It’s a good thing I’d developed a fondness for the local suds, too, since this resolutely Flemish spot doesn’t serve wine.The owner, Emmanuel de Quillacq, recited the specials, which included a soup made with organically grown pumpkin and leeks that Bruno pronounced “super bon”; I tucked into a slice of tarte flamande made with three local cow’s milk cheeses. Before our main courses arrived, Mr. de Quillacq took to the floor and recounted the tale of the Reuze Papa, a legendary giant who once lived in a cave on this highest point in Flanders. Since he used a lot of northern French slang and the occasional Flemish word, much of the merriment went over my head, but from the communal laughter, his storytelling skills were apparent.Back to the plate. My carbonnade was ruddy, soothing and fork-tender, while Bruno loved his gratinée au Maroilles, a casserole of sliced potatoes and ground pork baked with slices of cheese. Beer-and-brown-sugar tart and crème brûlée with chicory finished off this very good meal, which required an extended post-prandial stroll.Het Kasteelhof, 8 rue Saint-Nicolas, Cassel; (33-3) 28-40-59-29; lvermeersch.free.fr/kasteelhof. Dinner for two, 60 euros. Closed Monday to Wednesday, the first week of July, the first two weeks of October and last three weeks of January.On the Sunday of our visit, the streets of the tiny, well-scrubbed village of Godewaersvelde were surprisingly busy when the church bells chimed noon. We headed to L’Estaminet du Centre, hoping to see what had won those Michelin kudos.Inside the restaurant, sun streamed into a warren of pretty dining rooms, decorated with sepia photos on its sea-blue and white walls. After a warm greeting, the owner, Béatrice Cleenewerck, showed us to a bare wooden table where we could see the interior terrace lined with planters of scarlet geraniums. Bruno studied the chalkboard menu with a frown — he’d had his fill of estaminet classics and wanted to try the other regional specialties on offer — so I let him off the hook.He started with a large, deep-fried croquette filled with béchamel sauce and tiny gray North Sea shrimp, and followed with meaty Dutch mussels steamed with wine and shallots and served with the weekend’s best frites. For an estaminet finale, I began with pork muzzle in a shallot-and-parsley vinaigrette of red-wine vinegar and olive oil — earthy, crunchy and very good — followed by the “flamiche du Mont des Cats,” a delicate open tart of cream, lardons and two cheeses, Gruyère and Mont des Cats, the latter made by monks at a nearby abbey.“I hope you enjoyed your lunch,” said Ms. Cleenewerck as I went up to the zinc bar to pay the bill. When I complimented her on her restaurant’s atmosphere, she grinned. “Ici, Monsieur, la convivialité est toujours sur la carte,” (“Here, Sir, conviviality is always on the menu”), she said — a slogan that well-suited all the estaminets we visited in this delightful corner of France.L’Estaminet du Centre, 11 rue de Steenvoorde, Godewaersvelde; (33-3) 28-42-21-72; estaminetducentre.com.

"'11-02-20,'0','Condominiums are not the dominant form of housing in Williamsbridge, though a few have popped up in recent years. Instead it is mostly single- to three-family homes, few of them more than 50 or 60 years old.One evident ethnicity is Caribbean. Immigrants from Jamaica and other islands began moving to Williamsbridge in the ’80s, and today their influence is tangible up and down White Plains Road, a commercial strip under elevated train tracks. In addition to Caribbean restaurants, there is a dizzying number of African hair-braiding salons.Caroline Sinclair has worked at the Kingston Tropical Bakery on White Plains Road for 31 years and can remember a time when there was only one nearby competitor. That is definitely no longer the case.Shirley Fearon, 65, and a vice president of the Williamsbridge branch of the N.A.A.C.P., describes Williamsbridge as a work in progress. Drugs and crime remain a problem, she said, adding, “We’ve never had a lot of wholesome activities for our young people.”Ms. Fearon, who lives in a single-family attached brick house for which she paid $26,500 in 1971, is working with local politicians on bringing an intergenerational center to the area, where retirees could mentor youths, and adults could take classes toward the graduate equivalency diploma.Over the last seven to eight years, said the Rev. Richard Gorman, the chairman of Community Board 12, which covers the area, the 47th Precinct has stepped up safety efforts. Before that, he recalled, “It was getting bad.”Still, he argued, crime occurs everywhere. “I was mugged once in the Woodlawn area of the community board,” which he described as “basically all Catholic, and I’m a Catholic priest.”Father Gorman would like to see better lighting on White Plains Road, and zoning to protect architecture. He sees a work in progress: “I think you could have a very vibrant, alive, mixed community that will be a nice place to live.”One couple who are recent arrivals already seem to see the place that way. Adrian Munroe and his wife, Shelly Bryce-Munroe, who had been renting nearby for 11 years, especially appreciate the shopping and transportation options. They closed last month on a three-family detached house on Willett Avenue, paying $475,000, and have already rented out one of the units. Mr. Munroe, 40, moved to New York 17 years ago from Jamaica; he works as a retail manager in Fairfield, Conn. “Two or three years ago in the housing boom,” he said, “we weren’t able to afford what they were offering. With interest rates as low as they are now, it was time to get into the market.”A north Bronx neighborhood about a square mile in size, Williamsbridge sits just east of the Woodlawn Cemetery and south of Wakefield. It straddles parts of three ZIP codes; one of them, 10467, has almost 95,000 people, according to a 2009 census estimate.City boundaries are invariably subject to interpretation, and those of Williamsbridge are no exception. In the words of Father Gorman: “Do I live in Williamsbridge? Or did I sneak into Wakefield? Do I live in Williamsbridge? Or did I sneak into Olinville? People would be fluid about that.”Bearing that fluidity in mind, Williamsbridge is often described as being bounded by Gun Hill Road to the south; 233rd Street to the north; the Bronx River Parkway to the west; and, to the east, Eastchester and Boston Roads and Laconia Avenue. Some of the area’s single-family detached homes have architectural details like turrets and second-floor outdoor porches. Among other commonly seen properties are attached red-brick multifamilies dating to the 1970s, with monochromatic awnings.The housing is mostly 35 or older; of the properties for sale, many are advertised as needing “T.L.C.”But Allison Jaffe, a broker with Key Real Estate Services, describes a building boom of multifamily properties from 2000 to 2008. So much so, in fact, that the community board has asked that zoning be reviewed, to prevent overbuilding, said Karl Stricker, chairman of the land use committee.“We want to maintain what the community is, one- and two-family houses with setbacks and space between the buildings,” Mr. Stricker said. “We want a suburban-type atmosphere.”Manny Pantiga of the Pantiga Group, says co-ops on the market in the area range from $74,900, for a one-bedroom, to $125,000 for a three-bedroom in an elevator building with a doorman. Single-family homes range from $149,000, for a two-bedroom detached frame house, to $370,000 for a brick four-bedroom.According to Ms. Jaffe, 67 two-family homes have sold in Williamsbridge since about this time last year, with an average price in the mid-$300,000s.Dorothy Namdar, an agent with Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty, said that over the last three years, houses in Williamsbridge had taken an average three months to sell.A recent Craigslist search of rentals in Williamsbridge found a two-bedroom unit off White Plains Road listed at $1,400 a month, and a newly renovated three-bedroom apartment for $1,600.The neighborhood is almost an hour by subway from Midtown Manhattan on the 2 or 5 train. It is close to thoroughfares, including the Bronx River Parkway, the Hutchinson River Parkway and Interstate 95. It also has a Metro-North Railroad stop.WHAT TO DOBetween Williamsbridge and the Bronx River is a strip of green known as Shoelace Park. Fifteen years ago the river was in bad shape, and many wouldn’t have considered the area a park at all. “It was a sea of asphalt and some metal guardrails,” said Maggie Greenfield, the deputy director of the Bronx River Alliance, a nonprofit.Thanks to the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Bronx River Alliance, Shoelace Park now has a new entrance at 219th Street and another in the works at 211th Street. Goals include linking the 1.5-mile park path more closely to the Bronx River Greenway.Judy Hutson, a Williamsbridge resident who is an avid runner, remembers feeling solitary 15 years ago in the park. “Now, even in the winter,” she said, “you’ll see the die-hard runners, and we know each other and we say hi.”Last fall Ms. Hutson helped found Friends of Shoelace Park. The group hopes to draw attention to the area and promote further improvements to it. They are planning their first 10-kilometer run/walk for the end of April.In 2006, a launch for boaters down by the river was renovated. “It’s really beautiful, even if you don’t canoe, just to sit on that launch and to look down that river,” Ms. Hutson said. “You don’t even think you’re in the city.”Primary schools include Public School 21, which got a C on its progress report. Of fourth graders, 29.4 percent met standards in English, 42.8 percent in math, versus 45.6 and 58.4 citywide.Middle School 113 was closed for poor performance in 2007 and now houses four schools, including the Forward School, which got a B on its progress report. Of eighth graders, 26.7 percent met standards in English, 19 percent in math, versus 37.5 and 46.3 citywide.Williamsbridge was once served by Evander Childs High School, which had a dangerous reputation. In 2002, its graduation rate was 30.7 percent.By 2008 the school had been replaced with six smaller ones, among them Bronx Lab School and High School for Contemporary Arts. The average 2009 graduation rate was 80.3 percent.Jack Zarin-Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the Department of Education, said in an e-mail, “The Evander campus is one of the best examples of our strategy to replace large, failing high schools with rigorous small schools.”At Cardinal Spellman High School, a private school in nearby Baychester, annual tuition is currently $6,800. Justice Sonia Sotomayor of the United States Supreme Court was valedictorian of the class of 1972.Williamsbridge is named after a bridge built over the Bronx River in Colonial times by a local farmer named John Williams. In 1841 the area was connected to Manhattan by the New York and Harlem Railroad.'"

"'11-02-21,'0','Public surveys suggest that most voters do not share the Republicans’ fervor for the deep cuts adopted by the House, or for drastically slashing the power of public-sector unions. And independent voters have historically been averse to displays of political partisanship that have been played out over the last week.“If Republicans push too far and overreach their mandate, they will be punished by independent voters, just as they were in 1996,” said Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist who was a senior adviser to President George W. Bush. “Voters said they wanted bold action. They are getting bold action. But Republicans need to be constantly reminded that the last election was a referendum for change, not a referendum for the G.O.P.”Mr. McKinnon said that although Mr. Obama had claimed a mandate after his election, it turned out to be exaggerated, The president had paid a price for it, he said, and was adjusting.Russ Feingold, the Democratic senator from Wisconsin who was turned out of office in the Republican sweep last year, said the new crop of Republicans was drawing false conclusions from the party’s victory.“They are taking some kind of public expression of deep concern about the economy and turning it into something entirely different,” Mr. Feingold said. “They are making a mistake. They say: ‘Well, we won the election. Elections have consequences.’ And I say, yes, and we are going to have another election next year.”Republicans have presumably taken some lessons from Mr. Obama’s experience. Several Republicans argued that the party was doing what Americans wanted — reining in an out-of-control government — and would ultimately be rewarded.“I don’t think there is an overreach,” said Senator Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin freshman who defeated Mr. Feingold, adding, “What we are facing is an American public that is really on the Republican side in their desire, on a macro basis, to cut spending, balance the budget and show real fiscal restraint.”Governor Walker is counting on that interpretation of the voters’ wishes. “It’s about time somebody stood up and told the truth,” he said. “And the only way for us to balance the budget at the state level or at the local level is to make sure that we give those local governments the tools they need to balance the budget, and that’s what we’re proposing.”Mr. Walker’s plan includes banning unions from bargaining over issues other than wages, stopping the deduction of union dues from state paychecks and requiring annual elections for unions to stay in existence.Other Republicans are making similar efforts. In Ohio, Gov. John Kasich has signaled support for a law that would end collective bargaining rights for state workers and restrict those rights for teachers, police officers, firefighters and other local government employees. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott is demanding that public workers pay 5 percent of their salaries toward their pensions.At the very least, the huge demonstrations in Wisconsin over Mr. Walker’s efforts suggest that the Republicans have succeeded in doing what Mr. Obama was unable to do last year: energize the Democratic base.In addition, several Democrats pointed to Republican efforts to cut back abortion rights as another example of an issue that made them subject to the same criticism that Democrats faced: pursuing their party’s base agenda while ignoring the central concern of Americans, jobs.“I know what I have been hearing from my constituents,” said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House. “This seeming meanness and disdain — people want us to work together. They want us to solve problems. They want us to create jobs. They want to take care of their families. And I just hope they are watching this, because I don’t think this agenda that I see playing out on the evening news is doing any of that.”Things are very much in flux in all legislative arenas, and it is hardly clear what the final results of these actions will be. In Washington, with Democrats still controlling the Senate and the White House, much of the Republican agenda is likely to be stymied.In a New York Times/CBS News poll in January, 43 percent of respondents said job creation was the most important issue for Congress; 14 percent cited reducing the federal deficit.Michael Dimock, the associate director of research for the Pew Research Center, said its polling had found that while voters were eager to reduce the deficit, they also supported increases in spending on Social Security and Medicare and believed that tax increases would be needed to balance the budget.“The spending-deficit issue is the trickiest issue for Republicans,” Mr. Dimock said. “It’s clear that the public is with them in principle — smaller government doing less — but it’s unclear whether they’re with them in practice.”The unemployment rate that proved to be a liability for Democrats in November remains high as officials, so far, have mostly failed to agree on shared economic policies. And some centrist lawmakers — who had hoped that the elections of 2008 and 2010 would be interpreted as a hungering among voters for moderation — say a new spirit has yet to take hold as Republicans have instead focused on the interests of their party’s base.For instance, not a single Democrat voted in favor of the Republican spending bill the House passed on Saturday — mirroring the often unanimous Republican opposition to Democratic bills last year.“The first thing you have got to realize is that real bipartisanship has to be a verb not a noun, and it means getting people talking about specifics,” said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who with Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican who is now retired, drafted legislation last year for a sweeping overhaul of the tax code.“I do interpret this election as one where people were saying: ‘Knock it off! We’re tired of this food fight,’ ” Mr. Wyden said. “To me, if you are dealing with big issues where there is a history of folks being divided, of real polarization, the day you pass something folks are going to start to work to unravel it.”Congress has yet to fully engage on issues like a tax overhaul, education standards, trade policy or even modest energy initiatives, on which lawmakers in each party had predicted they could find common ground and make real progress in an era of divided government.Ted Strickland, a Democrat who lost a bid for re-election as governor of Ohio, said one reason Democrats lost was because of public backlash to what many perceived as Mr. Obama expanding the government to an extent they had not anticipated, especially in the areas of stimulus spending and health care.“I think that could very well be happening now,” Mr. Strickland said. “I think the electorate is in a volatile mood. I think there’s a continuing concern regarding the economy. And I’m watching what’s happening in Washington. I think the Republicans are doing pretty much what they accused Democrats of doing, and that is not focusing on the economy and job creation.”But John C. Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, said Republicans were in fact focusing on what was of concern to voters — a bloated government — something Mr. Obama had not done.“They have to do it,” he said. “They have to do a good job laying out the facts and the alternatives, and I believe the public is ready for it.”'"
"'11-02-21,'0','To me, this feels like the Arab version of 1776. And don’t buy into the pernicious whisper campaign from dictators that a more democratic will be fundamentalist, anti-American or anti-women. For starters, there have been plenty of women on the streets demanding change (incredibly strong women, too!).For decades, the embraced corrupt and repressive autocracies across the Middle East, turning a blind eye to torture and repression in part because of fear that the “democratic rabble” might be hostile to us. Far too often, we were both myopic and just plain on the wrong side.Here in Bahrain, we have been in bed with a minority Sunni elite that has presided over a tolerant, open and economically dynamic country — but it’s an elite that is also steeped in corruption, repression and profound discrimination toward the Shia population. If you parachute into a neighborhood in Bahrain, you can tell at once whether it is Sunni or Shia: if it has good roads and sewers and is well maintained, it is Sunni; otherwise, it is Shia.A 20-year-old medical student, Ghadeer, told me that her Sunni classmates all get government scholarships and public-sector jobs; the Shiites pay their own way and can’t find work in the public sector. Likewise, Shiites are overwhelmingly excluded from the police and armed forces, which instead rely on mercenaries from Sunni countries. We give aid to these oligarchs to outfit their police forces to keep the Shiites down; we should follow ’s example and immediately suspend such transfers until it is clear that the government will not again attack peaceful, unarmed protesters.We were late to side with “people power” in and Egypt, but Bahrainis are thrilled that called the king after he began shooting his people — and they note that the shooting subsequently stopped (at least for now). The upshot is real gratitude toward the United States.The determination of protesters — in Bahrain, in , in , in — is such that change is a certainty. At one hospital, I met a paraplegic who is confined to a wheelchair. He had been hit by two rubber bullets and was planning to return to the democracy protests for more.And on the roundabout on Sunday, I met Ali, a 24-year-old on crutches, his legs swathed in bandages, limping painfully along. A policeman had fired on him from 15 feet away, he said, and he was still carrying 30 shotgun pellets that would eventually be removed when surgeons weren’t so busy with other injuries. Ali flinched each time he moved — but he said he would camp at the roundabout until democracy arrived, or die trying.In the 1700s, a similar kind of grit won independence for the United States from Britain. A democratic Arab world will be a flawed and messy place, just as a democratic America has been — but it’s still time to align ourselves with the democrats of the Arab world and not the George III’s.'"
"'11-02-21,'0','The estate was governed by the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association of the Union, but much of the daily work was performed by African-Americans who had been owned by Washington’s descendants. They guarded the premises, sold souvenirs and refreshments and spoke with visitors about bygone days.Gray-haired Edmund Parker, who had been brought to Mount Vernon as a teenage slave in 1841, stood at the tomb, recounting Washington’s last days and the history of his final resting place. At the old kitchen, Parker’s niece Sarah Johnson sold glasses of milk.Parker, Johnson and others fostered an image of Mount Vernon as an antebellum Eden, complete with happy, welcoming slaves, an impression that sat well with post-Reconstruction America, where civil rights had taken a back seat to sectional reconciliation.Living links to the past, they held forth with visitors on a range of subjects — but not the painful realities of slavery. Parker never mentioned the grueling field labor he had once performed, or that he had run away to Union lines during the Civil War. Sarah Johnson didn’t explain that Washington’s heirs had sold her and her 6-month-old child in the first year of the war.And they did not disclose that their ancestors had not belonged to Washington at all; rather, they had come to Mount Vernon after the president died, brought by Washington’s nephew and great-nephews, who had inherited the place. When asked about their origins, the former slaves would simply reply, “Belonged to the family.”These and other omissions helped paper over Washington’s views on slavery, including his hope that the institution would one day disappear. Black employees sold copies of his last will and testament, but they never mentioned that Washington had used that will to free his own slaves.However, if Parker and Johnson played down Washington’s anti-slavery legacy for white visitors, they honored it privately by building new, financially secure lives for themselves. When Hayes returned as president for an overnight stay in 1878, Johnson served him a simple meal in Washington’s small dining room. Earlier that day, she and her husband had managed the estate’s crowded lunchroom, coordinating a team of waiters and collecting money.A few miles off the historic grounds, the black employees of Mount Vernon sent their children to public school, attended a new church and shopped for staples in town. And they saved their earnings to purchase land of their own: when Johnson left Mount Vernon in 1892, she owned four acres just up the road.Washington probably would have appreciated the sight of freed slaves pursuing their own goals on his estate. As an innovative farmer and astute observer of human nature, he had no wish to make Mount Vernon a shrine to a bygone past. He might instead have challenged white tourists to question why, in an era of supposed racial equality, its black employees felt the need to mask their life stories and aspirations behind a veil of old-style servitude.The new Mount Vernon humanized Washington, but only by eclipsing the true meaning of him and his home for a changing nation: not a refuge from modernity but an incubator of it.'"

"'11-02-21,'0','“Everybody complains about property taxes, but not everybody’s on the same rung on the financial ladder,” Mr. McCall said. Still, he said: “There are definitely people who can’t afford it. They’ve cut as much as they can from their budgets and there is just no more to give.”The New York Times recently interviewed four families who said that rising property taxes were sending them over the edge of financial stability. They included a couple moving to Nova Scotia to pay lower property taxes, and an 81-year-old woman from the Rochester suburbs who was mentioned by Governor Cuomo in his State of the State address last month because she continued to work in a school cafeteria so she could pay her taxes.Here are their stories.Jacqueline Cohen and Vaughan Smith moved their pottery business and 12 cats to the Ulster County, N.Y., community of High Falls from Columbus, Ohio, in 1994. They paid $210,000 for an 1824 farmhouse on 1.9 acres, and spent $70,000 to build a studio out back. They later invested an additional $10,000 to add a gas kiln.After 17 years, though, they are moving to Nova Scotia — driven, they say, by the taxes on their home, which have tripled to $10,065 a year while their net income has fallen to $35,000.“I think property taxes are destroying our community,” Mr. Smith, 55, said, adding, “Families have to choose between paying their property taxes and buying health insurance and putting food on the table.”After paying their property taxes, the couple had about $25,000 left over for food, utilities and other living expenses. Health insurance was $8,000. Water was $700 a year, and garbage pickup $600. Switching to a wood stove lowered their heating oil bills to $600 a year from $2,000.As sales of their hand-crafted bowls, mugs and tableware have slowed, they have withdrawn $5,000 to $10,000 a year from their savings to cover their costs. “We’ve tried to hang on,” said Ms. Cohen, 54. “We’re self-employed and we don’t have a safety net of pensions. We have to be able to save, and that’s why we don’t see a future here.”The couple used their remaining $300,000 in savings to buy a 2.5-acre waterfront property in Nova Scotia, where they will pay just $1,440 in property taxes that include water and garbage pickup. They plan to sell their High Falls home, which is assessed at $430,000.They will pay a sales tax of 15 percent on items in Nova Scotia, compared with 8 percent in New York. But Mr. Smith calculated that income taxes would be about the same — roughly a third of their income.With Canada’s socialized medical system, they will no longer have to spend $8,000 a year on health insurance. Add what they will save in property taxes — more than $8,000 — and Mr. Smith said: “We’ll win by thousands. For regular working people, you’re better off.""Geraldine Sullivan has spent her 81 years in the Rochester area, the last 50 of them in a 1928 Dutch Colonial-style house in Irondequoit that she bought for $15,000. The house is now valued at $73,000, according to property rolls.But while Ms. Sullivan’s home is paid off, she said, she has to work part-time as a kitchen server at a local high school to help pay the property taxes. In 2010, she paid $1,748 in school, town and county taxes (it would have been $3,276, but she benefited from a tax break for the elderly).Ms. Sullivan also paid $970 in property taxes on 23 acres of woods in the nearby town of Sodus that she and a friend bought as an investment for $14,000 more than two decades ago.She said the taxes on both properties claim about 17 percent of her net income of about $16,000 from the part-time job, Social Security and a small pension and 401(k) from Bausch & Lomb, where she worked in accounts payable for 25 years before retiring in 1995.The rest goes to groceries, doctor’s bills and repairs on her home, she said; in 2009, a water line break cost her $1,000. She does not have a television, a cellphone or a computer. She shops at dollar stores and keeps the second floor of her house closed off to save on heat.Ms. Sullivan said she had always lived modestly, raising three children by herself after a divorce. She said she hoped to preserve her land for conservation and to leave the money in the 401(k) to her three children, who are financially struggling themselves.Ms. Sullivan does not intend to move anytime soon but worries that she will no longer be able to afford to stay in her home.“I have everything in boxes,” she said. “When the day comes I can’t work anymore, I’ll just leave.”Jacquelyn and Charles T. Fike moved their young family to the suburbs of Westchester County in 1974. They bought a three-bedroom house in Bronxville for $98,000 and, in 2005, took out a $350,000 mortgage to build a second floor for their son, Charles, 40, who has developmental disabilities on the autism spectrum.The Fikes each worked for more than 30 years at IBM; they have a net income of $130,000 annually from their combined pensions, Social Security and investments. They have also saved $850,000, which they hope to leave for their son’s care.But Mrs. Fike, 72, said that while they had planned carefully for retirement, they have had to dip into their savings to pay their property taxes, which have increased eightfold, to $34,181 a year from $4,200 when they moved in. The taxes claim 26 percent of their income, with annual mortgage payments of $22,800 absorbing an additional 17 percent.“We have done the best we can and we have been careful,” Mrs. Fike said, adding that they had forgone vacations and were sharing a 2001 Mazda since their second car had been crushed by a tree.As they grow older, medical bills have become a growing concern. Mr. Fike, 77, has Alzheimer’s disease and requires costly nursing care, which is currently covered by long-term care insurance that will eventually be exhausted. “Then some difficult decision will have to be made,” Mrs. Fike said.The Fikes also support their son, who receives about $800 a month in disability payments, some of which is used for therapy. He also works part time in the summer, maintaining tennis courts in the village, and collects cans and bottles for recycling.Mrs. Fike said she was reluctant to sell the house, now assessed at $1.5 million, because it is the only home that their son has ever known. “My son has made a life for himself in Bronxville,” she said. “He’s comfortable and he can be more competent when his home life and community are stable.”Still, Mrs. Fike said that she might have no choice some day.“It’s so upsetting that I don’t want to think about it,” she said. “Moving is all down sides; there’s no positives to it.”For Gregg and Kimberly Smith, the rising property taxes on their four-bedroom house in Walden, in Orange County, were one more in an avalanche of financial troubles.Mr. Smith, 41, a former telecommunications executive, was laid off twice after moving to New York in 2005. He said he and his wife had since depleted $50,000 in savings, racked up $60,000 in credit card charges from paying living expenses, and are filing for bankruptcy protection.Taxes on their 1.5-acre property rose 24 percent to $6,079 in five years, even as the market value went down; it was recently appraised for $267,000 by a local Realtor, or $82,000 less than they paid for it, the Smiths said.The couple gave up their home in November, defaulting on a $290,000 mortgage that they said they could no longer keep up with. They moved with their three younger children to Lakeland, Fla., where they stayed at first with relatives and now rent a house for $1,650 a month.Mr. Smith said they had always felt obligated to pay their property taxes, even when that meant cutting back on something else, like movies or groceries. In 2010, their property taxes claimed 9 percent of the family’s net income of $69,000. (The mortgage cost $2,465 a month until they stopped paying.)“It’s not like we saw an increase in services or better roads,” Mr. Smith said. “When nothing improved — and actually got worse — and my property value went down, it just made no sense.”'"
"'11-02-21,'0','In Rossini’s operas coloratura is character. When critics mention singer X’s trills, Y’s roulades and Z’s runs, they are not just being nitpicky. Qualities like joy and anger are expressed here entirely through those purely vocal means. The emotions are in the notes.This is particularly true for the title character of Rossini’s “Armida,” an Arab sorceress who falls in love with a Christian crusader and is finally abandoned by him. Armida dominates the opera, encompassing seduction, happiness, despair and rage, and Rossini translates her magic powers and charisma into dazzling music.In recordings, especially one from a 1996 performance at Carnegie Hall, the soprano Renée Fleming brought to the notoriously difficult role the bright flexibility and plush, penetrating tone of her prime, and also a thrilling riskiness. Armida lay on the outskirts of her repertory, but it was a triumph.Now in a later stage of her career, Ms. Fleming seemingly wanted to recapture some of that earlier magic, and last year the Metropolitan Opera mounted its first production of the opera for her. Her performance then was uneven, and she fares little better in a dull, disappointing revival that opened on Friday evening.With a voice of reduced agility, size and power, Ms. Fleming now paces herself cautiously, simplifying or dodging many of the coloratura fireworks. In the first and second acts she limits her singing in full voice, clearly saving herself for Act III, in which Rossini ingeniously relaxes the ornamentation as Armida’s powers disappear, and she is left a mere woman. Here, the line lyrical and the range congenial, Ms. Fleming is finally persuasive.But caution isn’t what you want in an Armida, and singing the opera like a one-act misses Act I’s glittering runs and the great Act II aria “D’amore al dolce impero,” moments that establish the commanding and loving sides of this complex character. Ms. Fleming acts naturally, but in this repertory acting and singing are even more unified than elsewhere in opera. Since she doesn’t seduce or dazzle — do what Rossini has built into the music — her later humiliation and rage lose their impact, and the character loses its depth.Mary Zimmerman’s wanly Neo-Classical production doesn’t help locate the depths of an opera about intense emotions and the possibilities and limits of illusion. Instead of passion or fantasy, Ms. Zimmerman tries cuteness: animatronic insects, demons in tutus, a winsome girl personifying love.While adorable may suffice for the frolics in Armida’s enchanted garden, when the opera takes on more heart-wrenching dimensions, the production is stumped. Ms. Zimmerman seems more interested in winking at operatic style — with antiqued footlights, Italianized placards reading “Ballo” and “Fine,” the conceit that Armida is reading her aria from sheet music — than in believing in its complexities.'"
"'11-02-21,'0','MONTGOMERY, Ala. — One hundred and fifty years and one day later, the South did it again.Before a cheering crowd of several hundred men and women, some in period costume and others in crisp suits, an amateur actor playing Jefferson Davis was sworn in as president of the Confederacy on the steps of the Alabama Capitol on Saturday, an event framed by the firing of artillery, the delivery of defiant speeches and the singing of “Dixie.”The participants far outnumbered the spectators, but it was to be the largest event of the year organized by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and one in a series of commemorations of the 150th anniversary of the Confederacy and the War for Southern Independence. (Referring to the Civil War as anything other than an act of unwarranted Northern aggression upon a sovereign republic was rather frowned upon.)The Sons’ principal message was that the Confederacy was a just exercise in self-determination that had been maligned by “the politically correct crowd” through years of historical distortions. It is the right of secession that they emphasize, not the cause, which they often describe as a complicated mix of tariff and tax disputes and Northern attempts to politically subjugate the South.The other matter of subjugation — that is, slavery — went unmentioned on Saturday. (Davis himself did not refer to it in his inaugural address, but he emphasized the maintenance of African slavery as a cause for secession in other high-profile settings.). And the issue of slavery was largely brushed aside in interviews as a mere function of the time, and not a defining feature of the Confederacy.Asked about the prominent speeches and documents that described the protection of slavery as the primary cause of secession, Joe Dupree of Mobile, Ala., said the question itself was wrong.“African slavery is a 4,000-year-old African institution that affected us a couple of hundred years,” he said. “It is, historically, an error.”Though the swearing-in was a re-enactment down to the antique buttons, there were contemporary political overtones. More than one speaker, insisting that “the South was indeed right,” extolled the Confederacy as an example of limited government that should be followed now, and said vaguely that the Southern cause was vindicated by a glance at the headlines every day.But even the politics on Saturday were tied up in a larger sense of grievance, a feeling of being marginalized and willfully misunderstood. Expressions of this feeling led to some rather unexpected analogies, like when Kelley Barrow, a teacher from Georgia, declared that people of Confederate heritage “have been forced to go to the back of the bus.”The participants know, however, that they will have to live with such frustrations over the four years of the war’s sesquicentennial.“I really wish we didn’t have to defend what we do,” Chuck Rand, an engineer from Monroe, La., who is the adjutant in chief of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said in an interview on Friday night. “This doesn’t have to be a fight.”Mr. Dupree, who was sitting with Mr. Rand, agreed.“What is it in a man,” he asked, repeating the question for emphasis, “that would cause him to deny his fellow man the pride and dignity of his heritage?”The parade began shortly after 11 a.m. and marched to the Capitol along Dexter Avenue, past abandoned storefronts and empty government buildings and the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, now called the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church after the young Martin Luther King Jr., who arrived at the church in the 1950s and was tapped to lead a citywide bus boycott from his basement office.Inside, a dozen fifth-grade students from Monrovia Elementary School in Huntsville, Ala., were beginning a tour. Their guide dismissed the events outside with an eye roll, but Jesse Schmitt, a teacher who arranges for his students to visit the church every year during Black History Month, saw a potential lesson.“Unfortunately, we haven’t gotten to the Civil War yet,” he said, though he added that his students had told him that the march was, in their words, “messed up.”But there was a lot more to discuss. So, Mr. Schmitt said as he left Dr. King’s old basement office, he was still thinking of ways to talk to his students about history, about the reasons for commemoration, about causes that were lost and causes that were won.'"
"'11-02-21,'0','MANAMA, Bahrain — Teachers, lawyers and engineers marched into Pearl Square on Sunday, joining an emboldened opposition whose political leaders demanded that the king dissolve the government and fire his uncle, who has held the post of prime minister for 40 years, before they agree to enter into talks.After deadly crackdowns and demonstrations over the past week, an anxious calm prevailed, with a standoff continuing between an absolute monarchy determined to preserve its full range of powers and a peaceful opposition demanding a transition to democracy with an elected government and representative Parliament.Protesters continued to occupy the symbolic center of the nation at Pearl Square, and by Sunday evening, tens of thousands of people had jammed into the square in the largest of the week’s demonstrations.The crown prince, Sheik Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, continued to call for a national dialogue and period of mourning as a step toward reconciliation. But officials with the leading opposition party, the Shiite movement called Al Wafeq, said that with six people dead, one brain dead in the hospital, hundreds injured and many still missing, King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa would first have to convince them that he was willing to compromise after repeatedly unleashing his security forces on civilians.The party called for the dismissal of the long-serving prime minister, Sheik Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, and the appointment of an interim unity government.“You can’t send your troops with machine guns, kill people and then expect to start a dialogue,” said Abdul Jalil Khalil Ebrahim, one of the 18 party members to withdraw from Parliament in protest over the deaths. “The cabinet has to go. This government has failed. How can we trust them in a dialogue?”The government has repeatedly declined requests for comment or to make an official available for an interview. The crown prince’s office also did not respond to an interview request.There are three main players besides the king in the royal family, part of the Sunni minority that controls the country. They are the crown prince, known as the most moderate among the group; the prime minister, who is said to be wealthy, but whose power has ebbed as popular anger at him has peaked; and the minister of the Royal Court, Sheik Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa, known as the hard-liner of the three, opposition leaders say.At the moment, the crown prince apparently has the upper hand in discussions among the king’s close aides, but opposition leaders say that the king has been known to play members of his inner circle against one another and that the dynamic could change at any time.With the army removed from Pearl Square, where only two days earlier it opened fire on a group of peaceful demonstrators, and the police withdrawn under intense pressure from the United States, the opposition acted as if it were in a position of strength. Seven opposition parties have called for a demonstration on Tuesday, which Mr. Ebrahim said he believed could draw the largest crowds to date.“The government has to step down, and the people who killed our people must be punished,” said Mr. Ebrahim, a member of the Al Wafeq Council of Representatives. “Is it that easy to turn the page? You kill people and then you say you want to talk?”Members of the opposition, a popular movement centered in Bahrain’s majority Shiite community and set off by young people, were elated at their ability to camp in Pearl Square on Saturday night, but also somber over the toll of dead, wounded and missing.“Our martyrs in our hearts,” read a sign carried by teachers from the Duraz School as they marched into the square to join the protesters who had stayed in tents under the stars.“I can’t sleep at night because I want to know, where are our people?” said Ahlam Yousef, 32, a middle school English teacher who joined the demonstration. “Right now, that is our first demand. I want to know where these people are. I have to know.”The issue of those unaccounted for has until now been largely overlooked as events careened from violence to hope, as the authorities vacillated between attacking protesters and withdrawing security forces. But by Sunday, demonstrators and opposition leaders were pressing for answers, with reports of about 20 people still missing.The government did provide some answers. By midday, about 10 people had been freed from jail, including Abdel Amir al-Basry, 37, who limped into his house in the village of Karranna, his body badly bruised, his right eye black and his ankle possibly broken. He said he had been grabbed by police officers as he tried to flee Pearl Square early Thursday morning, when security forces attacked without warning while thousands of demonstrators slept. He said he had been handcuffed with a hard plastic band, beaten with a club, stomped and punched, and then locked in a jail for several days.“I want a constitutional monarchy,” he said, sitting with his mother, Zeinab Mehdi Mandan, 68, moments after he returned home. “I want the government to be for the people, whether they are Sunni or Shiite.”His mother, who is blind and cannot walk, sat beside him on the floor. “What he did, is a good thing,” she said of her son. “We are demanding and asking for our rights in our country. Let him continue.”A few blocks away, Salman Abdullah, 27, and his brother, Jaafar, 21, said they were worried about their younger brother, Hussein, 16, who went to a demonstration five days ago and had not been heard from since. They fear the worst because his phone is off and he has never been out of touch for so long.“I don’t know where he is; of course I am worried,” Salman Abdullah said. “I am scared for him.”'"

"'11-02-22,'0','MADRID — Spain’s central bank on Monday classified 46 percent of the exposure that the country’s savings banks had to the construction and real estate sectors as “problematic.”But Miguel Ángel Fernández Ordóñez, the governor of the Bank of Spain, insisted that such a risk level — 100 billion euros ($137 billion) of the 217 billion-euro total — did not endanger the Spanish financial sector as a whole.At a news conference, Mr. Fernández Ordóñez also described new rules on capital requirements approved by the government Friday as “essential and necessary” to avoid a collapse in Spanish banks’ access to external financing, which in turn could cause a much more severe domestic credit crunch.The latest risk assessment by the central bank is an attempt to reassure investors that huge and as yet unrecognized losses linked to reckless real estate lending are not threatening to sink the savings banks, known as cajas.Next month, the central bank will also publish a breakdown estimate of the financing needs of each caja. Such additional transparency comes as the cajas prepare to seek more private financing to meet the tougher capital requirements set by the government, in some cases through initial public offerings.Mr. Fernández Ordóñez was somewhat more optimistic about the situation than the finance minister, Elena Salgado, who said recently that any forced state rescue of collapsing cajas would be no more than 20 billion euros. He said it would be “clearly” less than that amount.'"
"'11-02-22,'0','That’s where I came in. Someone had to reply to Splash’s e-mails, in his voice, lest the children think the dog had let the thrill of being a published author and Washington power broker go to his head.I’d taken Splash on walks on more than one occasion. Once, near the Russell Senate Office Building, we happened upon a mysterious pile of pellets that appeared to be some kind of fertilizer. Splash lurched toward them and devoured a mouthful before I could stop him. As I ferociously tugged on his leash, a headline ran through my head: “Intern Returns Poisoned Dog to Living Legend.”But beyond Splash’s indiscriminate eating habits and love of tennis balls, he was little more than a furry mystery to me. What would he say in response to the hundreds of e-mails that came to him from children across the country? School simply hadn’t prepared me for this.Most of his messages went something like this:My teacher read us your book. You are so cute! Can you come over and play with my dog? What kind of dog food do you like? My mom says your senator is a great man. I hope he feels better.After checking with the senator’s assistants on Splash’s preferred dog food brand, and then reading the book myself to better prepare for my role, I answered every single e-mail, ending each reply with the mandatory “WOOF WOOF!! Splash.”My feelings on this assignment were conflicted, to say the least. On the one hand, I was impersonating a dog. On the other, I was heartened by the warmth that people from so many other states felt for the senator from mine.In time I found a strange satisfaction in writing back to these puppy-crazed children, one that I never got from answering the office phones. None of Splash’s correspondents cared about or even knew Senator Kennedy’s position on the estate tax, or whether he’d invoke cloture on a resolution to incrementally finance the defense budget. In fact, a simple “Woof!” seemed to be all the constituent outreach they needed to be assured that the senator was on their side.Of course Senator Kennedy demonstrated his loyalty to the youth of America in many ways. He pushed to finance Pell grants for college scholarships and to ensure all children were covered by health insurance, and fought to lower the voting age to 18.Today would have been Senator Kennedy’s 79th birthday. In December, Splash died, a little more than a year after his master. Reading that sad news, I remembered the “liberal lion” sitting at his desk while Splash slobbered away on a grimy tennis ball in the corner. It was an image that had soothed nervous interns and disarmed even Kennedy’s fiercest critics in Congress. Then I remembered the letters to Splash, and I realized those children felt the same way that I had as a kid in Boston, and still do — that we were all a small part of the Kennedy family.'"
"'11-02-22,'0','Buried deep beneath the stories about executive bonuses, the stock market surge and the economy’s agonizingly slow road to recovery is the all-but-silent suffering of the many millions of Americans who, economically, are going down for the count.A 46-year-old teacher in Charlotte, Vt., who has been unable to find a full-time job and is weighed down with debt, wrote to his U.S. senator, :“I am financially ruined. I find myself depressed and demoralized and my confidence is shattered. Worst of all, as I hear more and more talk about deficit reduction and further layoffs, I have the agonizing feeling that the worst may not be behind us.”Similar stories of hardship and desolation can be found throughout and the rest of the nation. The true extent of the economic devastation, and the enormous size of that portion of the population that is being left behind, has not yet been properly acknowledged. What is being allowed to happen to those being pushed out or left out of the American mainstream is the most important and potentially most dangerous issue facing the country.Senator Sanders is a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democrats. He asked his constituents to write to him about their experiences coping with the and its aftermath. Hundreds responded, including several from outside Vermont. A 69-year-old woman from northeastern Vermont wrote plaintively:“We are the first generation to leave our kids worse off than we were. How did this happen? Why is there such a wide distance between the rich and the middle class and the poor? What happened to the middle class? We did not buy boats or fancy cars or diamonds. Why was it possible to change the economy from one that was based on what we made and grew and serviced to a paper economy that disappeared?”A woman with two teenagers told the senator about her husband, a building contractor for many years, who has been unable to find work in the downturn:“I see my husband, capable and experienced, now really struggling with and trying to reinvent his profession at age 51. I feel this recession is leaving us, once perhaps a middle-class couple, now suddenly thrust into the lower-middle-class world without loads of options except to try and find more and more smaller jobs to fill in some of the financial gaps we feel day to day.“All we want to do is work hard and pay our bills. We’re just not sure even that part of the American Dream is still possible anymore.”'"
"'11-02-22,'0','Shares in Tokyo are also about 20 percent off their levels before the financial crisis hit in 2008 — one of the few major markets that have yet to rebound.Prices are so depressed that, at the end of December, nearly two-thirds of the 1,700 companies listed on the Tokyo exchange’s main section had price-to-book ratios below 1. That means, in effect, if one of those companies was dismantled and sold off for its parts, it would fetch more than its market value.“These stock prices are saying there’s no hope whatsoever for Japanese companies, and that’s simply not true,“ said Tony Roberts, who manages a $2 billion-dollar Japan fund for London-based Invesco Perpetual. “There are lots of great companies in Japan that add a lot of value,“ he said.Certainly Japan can still give investors reasons for doubt — like the long-term effects of the government’s high debt and aging population. There is also the paltry profitability of companies like Sony, which has averaged a 3 percent return on equity over the last five years while its Korean rival, Samsung Electronics, has surpassed 13 percent by the same measure.Yet “foreign investors who were once automatically giving Japanese stocks a pass are now taking a second look,“ said Junya Naruse, chief strategist at the Daiwa Institute of Research.For one thing, the economic recovery gaining strength in the United States is emboldening investors, while helping brighten the outlook for Japan’s export-led economy. At the same time, turmoil in the Middle East, rising food inflation and tighter money policies in fast-growing economies like China are prompting some global investors to think twice about emerging markets.In fact, now that China is Japan’s top trading partner, Japanese export stocks seem a less risky way to invest indirectly in Chinese growth.And while corporate earnings are far from booming, total net profit at Japan’s publicly listed companies has more than doubled this fiscal year, according to a Nikkei tally.More Japanese companies have also tried to counter investors’ longstanding complaints that companies here hoard too much cash, instead of investing it or returning it to shareholders. Some companies have raised dividends. Others, including Japan Tobacco and the semiconductor maker Rohm, have announced share buybacks in recent months — moves that help elevate the value of the companies’ remaining shares in the market.Meanwhile, if the inflation threatening other countries spills over into Japan, it could finally help the country reverse depressed prices, with positive spillovers for the stock market.Still, investors caution that making money on Japanese stocks requires an intimate knowledge of Japan’s corporate landscape. Instead of sticking to well-known global companies like Toyota or Sony, investment managers aim to ferret out small- and medium-size companies trading below their potential.International Value Advisors, for example, has invested in relatively obscure companies like Kanamoto, which leases construction material, and Milbon, which makes hair care products.“With proper stock-picking, the Japanese stock market is a place where one can make money,“ said Mr. de Vaulx of International Value Advisors.Some activist investors, meanwhile, are trying to coax Japanese companies into creating more value for shareholders, rekindling an issue that ignited contentious battles between foreign investors and Japanese management in the mid-2000s.Earlier this month, Governance for Owners, an investment firm and shareholder advocate based in London, and Tokio Marine Asset Management of Japan said they would jointly start a fund that would invest 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in underperforming small- to mid-cap Japanese companies and take an activist role.“We feel that there are opportunities in Japan, but there are issues that need addressing,“ said Simon Wong, a partner at Governance for Owners, pointing especially to the cash hoarding that he said still characterized many Japanese companies.Domestic investors have started to mirror these moves to home in on underperforming Japanese shares. In late January, Nomura Asset Management set up the Undervalued Japan Stocks Investment Trust, attracting 73 billion yen ($878 million) in retail money, more than double the size of the largest new Japan stock fund last year, according to the research company Lipper.Renewed investor interest is welcome in a market that has lost its thunder to faster-growing regional rivals. By share turnover, the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost its standing as Asia’s top bourse to Shanghai in 2009, although Tokyo still has the continent’s biggest exchange by market value.“Japan offers a very attractive environment: our banks are stable, we are a democracy, and our markets are open and transparent,” said Atsushi Saito, chief executive of the stock exchange. “Investment hot spots might be fun for short-term money play. But for the stable management of funds, Japanese equities are much better,” he said.At least until they aren’t.Currently, global markets are volatile over the Middle East turmoil. And some political events could sway Japanese stocks. The Japanese government has promised to decide by June whether it will participate in negotiations for a pan-Pacific free trade zone — a potential boon for industry, but opposed by farmers.The same month, the government plans to outline steps to raise its consumption tax, which, if executed poorly, could hurt Japan’s economic recovery.“The rally should continue until June — after that, it all depends,“ said Mr. Naruse, of Daiwa. “It’s a fragile recovery, and investors could lose faith in Japan again, all at once.”TOKYO (AP) — Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday downgraded its outlook for Japan’s credit rating because of concerns over its national debt. The rating agency changed its outlook for Japan’s Aa2 rating from stable to negative. The move was not unexpected. Last month, Standard & Poor’s cut Japan’s credit rating from AA to AA-.'"
"'11-02-22,'0','A Honduran teenager gained fame as the star of a documentary film that showed the dangers faced by children who ride across Mexico atop freight trains to cross illegally to the United States. But the boy, Kevin Casasola, rode the trains again, and now he has been granted asylum in the United States, his lawyer said on Monday.The documentary, “Which Way Home,” directed by Rebecca Cammisa, won an Emmy award for HBO last year and was nominated for an Oscar. Ms. Cammisa took her cameras onto the lurching trains, filming a cohort of children riding north as they dodged tunnels, trees and criminal predators, fighting loneliness and hunger. It tells of several children who died or disappeared along the way.Kevin, who was 14 in the film, was its most appealing protagonist, with his daring clowning on freight car roofs and his determination to make it to the United States to find work so he could send money back to his mother. During the filming he was detained by American border agents and deported to Honduras. The documentary showed the desolation and need that drove him to leave his home village in the first place.The documentary drew an outpouring of concern for the children to its Facebook page. Some Americans offered to adopt Kevin, although his mother figured prominently in the film and in his motives for riding the trains.In Mexico, the impact was even greater, and Kevin became something of a legend. Ms. Cammisa sent the film to rural villages as a warning to restless teenagers that they should not attempt a similar trip. The country’s first lady, Margarita Zavala, helped distribute it, and during a state visit to Washington last May, she said that Mexican babies were being named Kevin as a result of its popularity.Ms. Cammisa said she tried to persuade Kevin to stay in Honduras, using donations raised by the film to pay for him to take a course in mobile phone repair.'"
"'11-02-22,'0','Other lawmakers, including at least one Democrat, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, suggested that new regulations requiring third-party testing of all children’s products for safety and lead were too broad and needed to be revised.“Let’s focus more on real dangers to our children,” said Representative Mary Bono Mack, Republican of California, at the subcommittee hearing, “instead of perceived ones.”It remains far from certain that House members will succeed in cutting the budget for the consumer database or scaling back consumer product regulations. Democrats retain the majority in the Senate and are determined to block such measures.Nonetheless, the battle over consumer regulations is one slice of a much larger war being waged in Congress to determine how much the federal budget should be slashed and where to make the cuts.The Consumer Product Safety Commission — never popular with manufacturers — is a ripe target.The commission has been criticized by consumer groups for years for being toothless and largely ineffective, a problem some attribute to major cutbacks under Republican administrations. The commission staff had been whittled to 385 employees in 2007, down from nearly 1,000 in 1980.But 2007 brought about a “summer of recalls” in which millions of toys and children’s products, mostly manufactured in China, were pulled from store shelves because they contained lead paint or potentially ingestible magnets, among other hazards.In 2008, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which gave the commission vastly more authority and money. Its staff, for instance, is now up to 540.The legislation was also supported by many of the manufacturing groups that are now fighting to revise the regulations, including the Toy Industry Association and the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.Rick Locker, a lawyer who represents many of the toy and children’s product groups, said the industry still supported the main points of the law, like giving the commission more money and limiting the amount of lead. But he said certain parts of the law were confusing and others illogical, while some of the ways the commission had carried out the law — including the consumer database — had been problematic.The law, for instance, now requires lead testing of all products used by children, including things like bicycles, instead of limiting it to products where lead could be ingested by children, he said.“The problem was not in the concepts,” he said, referring to the 2008 law, “but in the language Congress chose to implement the concepts, combined with the agency’s own inability and unwillingness to exert authority to clarify confusion and chaos in a common-sense manner.”The debate has created an increasingly sharp rift between the five members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, three of them Democrats and two Republicans.The commission’s chairwoman, Inez Tenenbaum, a Democrat, said there was a need to make some adjustments in the law, like giving the commission more flexibility to exempt certain products, like bicycles and books, from lead testing. She said she was also seeking ways to provide relief to small toy manufacturers who had complained about the cost of third-party testing.Still, Ms. Tenenbaum said she opposed wholesale changes to the law and was determined to move forward with a lower lead level for most children’s products, noting that research had shown there was no safe level of lead.But Anne M. Northup, a Republican commissioner, is calling for much more drastic changes, including eliminating third-party testing of products. She said the cost of such testing was prohibitive, a point echoed by several manufacturers.Representatives of consumer groups, meanwhile, are fretting. They said they were worried that the tougher standards they fought for, and seemed to have finally won, were now in jeopardy.“You have folks who are seeing that there is a chance to undo consumer protections that they never liked in the first place,” said Ami Gadhia, policy counsel for Consumers Union.'"
"'11-02-22,'0','PepsiCo’s work with the corn farmers reflects a relatively new approach by corporations trying to maintain a business edge while helping out small communities and farmers. Begun as a pilot project by the foundation affiliated with the company’s Sabritas snack foods division, it is expanding to about 850 farmers to develop a local source of sunflower oil, which the company needs to improve the nutritional quality of its products.The corn project saved PepsiCo transportation costs because the farms were close to two of its factories, and the use of local farms assured it access to types of corn best suited to its products and processes. “That gives us great leverage because corn prices don’t fluctuate so much, but transportation costs do,” said Pedro Padierna, president of PepsiCo’s operations in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.The social benefits of the corn program are obvious in higher incomes that have improved nutritional and educational standards among the participating farmers, not to mention its impact on illegal immigration and possibly even the reduction of marijuana production.The sunflower farmers are expected to see similar benefits — but PepsiCo insists those benefits are ancillary to the business rationale for the program.A growing number of major companies have adopted similar business tacks aimed at profitability that also prove to be economically and socially beneficial for needy people. One of the earliest examples was Danone’s development of a vitamin-enhanced yogurt product that sells for 11 cents in Bangladesh. The product is profit-neutral, but has given the company valuable insights into the 2.5 billion potential consumers who live on less than $2.50 a day.“These are markets,” Harry Verhaar, head of strategic sustainability initiatives at Philips Electronics, said of countries with sizable populations of impoverished consumers.Philips has begun selling low-cost, solar-powered lighting products in Africa to people who lack access to the electrical grid. “We are developing products to address them that are economically good for us as a company and also good for ecology and good for consumers,” Mr. Verhaar said.The products reduce the use of kerosene, the fuel of choice among the world’s poorest consumers. Because they light homes that previously went dark at sundown, they may enable a child to study longer or a community to enjoy an evening soccer game.And they have spawned business. “A guy will set up a small shop with a large solar panel on the roof or behind and charge a small fee for recharging the solar light,” Mr. Verhaar said.“We are seeing an increased focus by companies looking to see how they can use their core capabilities for public good rather than simply writing a big check,” said Gaurav Gupta, regional director for Asia at Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm focused on international development. “They’re starting to realize that the marginal cost of doing a little extra good produces such a great impact — and not only in terms of good will, but also because it’s good for business.”Mr. Gupta stressed that what was emerging was not “corporate social responsibility,” a loosely defined concept typically driven by corporate marketing departments, which he said was “largely nonsense.”“This is about a company’s core activity, which is something it is constantly thinking about and working to improve,” he said. “Its impact on business can be defined and measured.”Derek Yach, the former World Health Organization official who is now PepsiCo’s senior vice president for global health and agriculture policy, said firmly: “This is a business. All the good things we want to do have to be financed out of the profits of the company, so why not do them while we are doing our business?” Mr. Padierna described the program in the state of Jalisco as Act II of a three-act play, which started when the company needed a way to mitigate its impact on the potato market. Through a guaranteed purchase system similar to the one it uses with the small farmers, PepsiCo enticed big agribusinesses to invest in the development of potato varieties better suited to Mexico’s tropical climate and also mitigated its impact on potato prices, which swung wildly because its demand was so large.Today, the company is the largest buyer of potatoes produced in Mexico, accounting for some 22 percent of total potato purchases there.Working with small farmers was a bigger challenge. Mr. Guzmán and Mr. Ramos, for instance, had little experience with pesticides, having previously relied on the local priest to bless away worms.Nor did they maintain bank accounts, a hurdle to payment by wire transfer. “We didn’t have money to put in the bank,” said Bonifacio Villalvazo, who together with Mr. Guzmán and Mr. Ramos is a member of one of the cooperatives created by the program.The company teamed up with a Mexican nonprofit group, Fundación Sembrando Trabajo, which extended to farmers in Jalisco a program it had begun in Chiapas. “The levers we use in this program are tiny, but they have tremendous impact,” said Alberto Castelazo, chairman of Sembrando Trabajo.A team of engineers from the nonprofit did soil and other tests to determine what seeds and fertilizers would work best. The engineers live nearby and so are frequently on hand to offer farmers advice and services, like delivering the seeds, instructing farmers on how to plant them and counseling on the safe disposal of pesticide containers, which in the past had been re-used to store water and other things.“They taught us to first triple-wash them and then to poke holes in the bottom so they can’t be reused,” Mr. Guzmán said. “Now we use them to make fences” — which in turn reduces the need to cut down trees, thereby reducing soil erosion.Other members of the group repeatedly stressed how helpful it was to know they would receive their seeds and supplies on time. In the past, they worked through intermediaries who would sell them what they needed to plant their crops, financing some or all of their purchases.The intermediaries decided when to deliver seeds and fertilizer and when the farmers would harvest. And almost invariably, the price an intermediary would pay for that crop was less than the amount a farmer owed him — assuming he even agreed to take the crop. “I planted a lot less because I didn’t know if I could sell it and I didn’t want to end up with a big debt,” said Germán Rodríguez Estrada, the youngest member of the cooperative. “Now that I have a secure buyer, I plant twice as much.”Indeed, the farmers said Pepsi’s purchase guarantee was the most valuable aspect of the program, benefiting even farmers who did not participate. “My neighbors come to me and ask what Sabritas is going to pay me for my crop,” Mr. Ramos said. “Now everyone is getting that price.”The farmers said the price was higher than they ever got from any intermediary, which means they end up with money in the bank after a crop is harvested. Sembrando Trabajo estimates that while their output has increased by about 160 percent, their incomes have tripled over the three years the program has been in place.“Well, it depends on the year and the crop, but, yes, we all have higher incomes in general,” said Matías Estrada Figueroa, the treasurer of the cooperative.They now maintain bank accounts, which Ellis J. Juan, representative of the Inter-American Development Bank in Mexico, considers one of the primary “macro” benefits of the program. “The minute one of these farmers gains access to the financial system, he in a sense has to become legal,” Mr. Juan said. “He may have to pay taxes, which is good for Mexico, but he also develops a credit history that might later give him access to a loan he could use to send his child to college.”Other broad benefits Mr. Juan cited were the program’s potential to reduce illegal immigration to the United States and the cultivation of marijuana. “The minute you can have a crop that provides higher profits, that becomes a possibility, though of course it’s hard to measure,” he said.The bank has struck an agreement with PepsiCo to provide up to $5 million in credit guarantees to support a program similar to the corn project. The new project has enlisted farmers in the states of Jalisco and Durango grow sunflowers, the first time since 1970s that the crop has been grown for anything other than floral arrangements and bird seed, according to PepsiCo.The company will spend roughly $52 million over the next seven years to buy crops that may eventually produce 40,000 tons of sunflower oil. That oil will begin replacing the 80,000 tons of palm oil it needs each year for products made in Mexico. The new oil will improve the nutritional quality of the foods it makes and will lower transportation costs, since palm oil must be imported from Asia and Africa. That, in turn, will have environmental benefits.As for the San Gabriel cooperative, its members are applying for a government grant to buy a tractor, which they say will increase productivity and yields. “Yes, a tractor or some other machinery, maybe a cooperative where we could sell seeds and fertilizers to other farmers,” Mr. Ramos said. “It’s just the beginning of what we might do.”'"
"'11-02-22,'0','MADRID — Spain’s central bank on Monday classified 46 percent of the exposure that the country’s savings banks had to the construction and real estate sectors as “problematic.”But Miguel Ángel Fernández Ordóñez, the governor of the Bank of Spain, insisted that such a risk level — 100 billion euros ($137 billion) of the 217 billion-euro total — did not endanger the Spanish financial sector as a whole.At a news conference, Mr. Fernández Ordóñez also described new rules on capital requirements approved by the government Friday as “essential and necessary” to avoid a collapse in Spanish banks’ access to external financing, which in turn could cause a much more severe domestic credit crunch.The latest risk assessment by the central bank is an attempt to reassure investors that huge and as yet unrecognized losses linked to reckless real estate lending are not threatening to sink the savings banks, known as cajas.Next month, the central bank will also publish a breakdown estimate of the financing needs of each caja. Such additional transparency comes as the cajas prepare to seek more private financing to meet the tougher capital requirements set by the government, in some cases through initial public offerings.Mr. Fernández Ordóñez was somewhat more optimistic about the situation than the finance minister, Elena Salgado, who said recently that any forced state rescue of collapsing cajas would be no more than 20 billion euros. He said it would be “clearly” less than that amount.'"
"'11-02-22,'0','“The circumstances that have led to the difficulties in Central Falls may actually be widespread,” said Christopher W. Hoene, director of research for the National League of Cities. “But not very many cities are in that dire straits.”Mr. Moreau, 47, is suing the state, asserting that the law allowing the takeover of financially troubled cities violates his constitutional right to due process, among other things. He appealed to the Rhode Island Supreme Court after losing the first round and is awaiting a ruling. Meanwhile, the blunt-talking mayor is working at his brother’s real estate office, down the street from City Hall, and stewing about the situation he finds himself in. He has rebuffed calls to step down and, in fact, said he was already planning his 2013 re-election campaign.“My bumper stickers are ready to be printed,” he said. “I’d win re-election with 90 percent of the vote if the election was today.”His confidence seemed striking, in part because Mr. Moreau is the subject of a state and federal corruption inquiry involving his hiring of a friend to board up dozens of abandoned buildings in town for about $2 million. The friend, a contractor, also installed a new furnace in the mayor’s house in 2009, according to The Providence Journal, possibly charging less than it was worth.Mr. Moreau, a factory worker’s son and former restaurant owner known around town as Chuckie, would not discuss the investigation except to call it “all political” and “all nonsense.” He said he had done nothing wrong.Mr. Moreau’s administration took the state by surprise by declaring fiscal insolvency last May. The city became the first in Rhode Island history to seek state bankruptcy protection, citing a deficit and retiree benefit obligations so profound as to seem insurmountable.That alarmed the state, which feared that other beleaguered cities would follow suit, and bond rating agencies, which downgraded Central Falls’s debt to junk status. So the legislature swiftly enacted a law allowing indefinite state oversight, a measure Mr. Moreau initially supported.The receiver, Mark A. Pfeiffer, a retired state judge, did not move into Mr. Moreau’s office when he arrived on the job, laying claim to a conference room instead. The office remains locked, a curtain over the door.Mr. Pfeiffer said he saw no choice but to demote Mr. Moreau to advisory status.“You couldn’t have somebody come in and perform the duties of the mayor and have somebody else being the mayor,” he said. “It doesn’t work very well, and particularly it doesn’t work well in a distressed community.”Mr. Pfeiffer tried to build a relationship with the City Council, but within months it deteriorated and he reduced its members to advisory status. He went to court in September to stop the mayor and the Council from making new appointments, and soon after, Mr. Moreau sued. He said he had hired lawyers with his own money; Mr. Pfeiffer said he had refused to authorize city funds.The suit calls the receivership law “undemocratic,” saying it violates the separation of powers doctrine by giving Mr. Pfeiffer executive and legislative powers.“Obviously here the people have been completely disenfranchised,” said Michael Kelly, Mr. Moreau’s lawyer. “We have what I would suggest is a form of dictatorship.”A Superior Court judge upheld the law as constitutional in October, partly because the receivership was temporary, although without a specific term. The law is not without precedent — Massachusetts put the city of Chelsea under receivership in 1991, removing the elected mayor and reducing other officials to advisers.At oral arguments before the Supreme Court this month, some justices appeared skeptical of Mr. Kelly’s reasoning, with one saying of Mr. Moreau and the City Council, “Those were the people in charge when the ship hit the shoals.”Yet the justices also questioned the state’s lawyer aggressively, asking what was to stop Mr. Pfeiffer from unilaterally changing city policies, like zoning, that had nothing to do with finance. They also questioned whether anyone would run for office if the city remained under receivership, with Justice Francis X. Flaherty, a former mayor himself, asking, “What do you run for? Advisory mayor?”His status notwithstanding, Mr. Moreau said he still talked to the city’s police chief and public works director daily, met with constituents and pursued economic development projects. Asked whether other city officials and residents still addressed him as mayor, he cracked, “They’d better.”Mr. Moreau is known around town as a bare-knuckled politician who rewards allies — often, critics say, with city jobs — and punishes enemies. Early in his tenure, he made waves by ordering a search of computers at the city library for campaign materials that favored a political opponent. Later, he championed the expansion of a detention center, cracked down on street violence and easily won re-election.Mr. Moreau said he had not bothered reading a lengthy report that Mr. Pfeiffer submitted to the state in December with recommendations for averting fiscal collapse, including the possibility of merging the city with neighboring Pawtucket. The report said the city’s problems were rooted in more than a decade of elected leaders’ approving generous union contracts without figuring out how to pay for them.The troubles worsened because of state aid reductions and inaccurate budget assumptions. For example, the city anticipated $1.2 million in revenue from the detention center in 2009-10 and got none. The city has started paying its bills again, but Mr. Pfeiffer warned that Central Falls, with an annual budget of about $18 million, faced annual deficits of $5 million and combined pension and retiree health benefit obligations of about $80 million.“I think it’s all nonsense,” Mr. Moreau said of Mr. Pfeiffer’s recommendations.Mr. Moreau also said he was galled by Mr. Pfeiffer’s salary of $200 an hour, and while at one point he said his court battle was “not about the money,” he also lamented that his wife had been forced to return to work and his youngest child to enter day care.“This was not my family plan,” he said.Some residents clearly share the mayor’s outrage, while others are hopeful about the receivership or indifferent. Sparky Chippis, a restaurant owner and Moreau ally who has known the mayor since childhood, described Mr. Moreau’s situation as “an injustice.”“The guy was elected by people,” Mr. Chippis said. “He had the trust of the people to be in the office over there.”But James Diossa, the only Council member who did not join Mr. Moreau’s lawsuit, said many residents appreciated the change. “The prior administration didn’t do a great job as far as keeping the community informed, and the community really lost faith,” said Mr. Diossa, who heads an advisory council to the receiver.Mr. Pfeiffer said few citizens had complained to him, but Mr. Moreau said that was because people were afraid. “They should be marching in the streets as to what’s been done to me,” he said.Mr. Pfeiffer stepped down earlier this month; his term was up and the new governor, Lincoln D. Chafee, an independent, wanted to appoint “a trusted adviser,” a spokesman said. With the pick, Robert G. Flanders Jr., a former State Supreme Court justice, in charge, Mr. Moreau said he was hoping to get a call.“I will send him a letter and be very frank with him that I’m here to help,” he said.'"
"'11-02-22,'0','Still, the problems abroad are becoming harder to overlook. After the toppling of leaders in Egypt and Tunisia, antigovernment protesters in Yemen and Libya are seeking to oust their leaders. Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s government in Libya on Monday struck back at dissenters, using warplanes and militiamen to fire on protesters.Market stability in the United States and abroad depends on the price of oil leveling off, which seems unlikely given all the turmoil.Western countries fear being cut off from the oil supply in Libya, which exports about 1.5 million barrels of oil a day, making it one of Africa’s largest holders of crude oil reserves. There was ample reason for concern, as oil companies — including Eni of Italy, the largest energy producer in Libya — began to evacuate employees.In turn, oil prices soared. Brent crude, a global benchmark for oil that trades in London, jumped more than 2 percent to above $105 a barrel. The price was almost a three-year high. As the crisis in Egypt dragged on in late January, the benchmark rose above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2008.If the world is, in fact, cut off from Libyan oil, prices are likely to rise even higher. The problem could ultimately hit American consumers at the gas pump.“The U.S. is not immune from this,” Mr. Urquhart Stewart said. “If you see a significant rise in the oil price for a long period, that could easily choke off any U.S. recovery that is still weak.”Yet even if Libyan oil exports were shut down, larger oil producers like Saudi Arabia have enough spare capacity to keep prices from skyrocketing.In hopes of finding a solution to price fluctuations, Saudi Arabia is holding a meeting on Tuesday for energy officials from more than 90 nations, including the United States.“History shows that political turmoil in a country does not necessarily mean that the flow of oil will be impacted,” said a research note published by JPMorgan Chase on Monday.Analysts also said that American investors did not panic when Egypt was on the brink of collapse for several days.In the United States, light sweet crude oil futures rose more than 5 percent, to $91.42 a barrel. Another important American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, closed at $86.20 a barrel on Friday. Gold prices rose above $1,400 an ounce, also as a result of the unrest.“There’s reason to get spooked on oil, and U.S. investors aren’t doing it yet,” said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at Standard & Poor’s. Instead, he said, American investors have been focusing on strong earnings reports and encouraging sales figures from retailers and other major companies in the United States. “We’ve done well and it looks like that’s going to continue,” he said.European investors, on the other hand, showed signs of impatience on Monday. Shares of European companies dropped, amid the turmoil in the Middle East and some disappointing earnings reports from European companies.The DAX, a German stock market index, closed down 1.44 percent, at 7,321.81. The FTSE Eurofirst 300, an index that includes some of Europe’s largest companies, slid 1.32 percent to 1,171.41. On Tuesday, markets in Australia, Taiwan, Singapore and mainland China also retreated.Thomas Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan, remained optimistic that American investors would not panic. “U.S equity markets have taken this in stride,” he said. “It’s not going to be that bad.”'"
"'11-02-22,'0','Objectively, Mauer has a better case, with three Gold Gloves, three batting titles, a Most Valuable Player award and a $184 million contract. But McCann is the National League’s answer: a left-handed hitter drafted from a local high school, a reliable run producer and a leader.McCann, whose three-run double made him the All-Star Game’s most valuable player last summer, is a .289 career hitter with a .360 on-base percentage. He has hit from 18 to 24 home runs in each full season, and he was 6 for 14 (.429) in the Braves’ first-round playoff loss to the San Francisco Giants last fall.Even so, he remains something of a secret. As catchers go, Mauer is king, and Yadier Molina of St. Louis and Buster Posey of San Francisco have caught the last out of the World Series recently. The Braves have been defined by starting pitching, Chipper Jones and Bobby Cox. Jason Heyward gained fame as a rookie last season; he did a photo shoot for Sports Illustrated last week.McCann’s consistency obscures him nationally, but he said he did not care. The aces have retired, Jones is nearly 39 and Fredi Gonzalez has replaced Cox as the manager after 21 years. The Braves are becoming McCann’s team.“Everybody respects what he has to say because he brings it every day,” Jones said. “You know that when he’s saying something, he’s not blowing smoke. I think the guys really respond to him.”McCann has deep roots with the Braves. Born in Athens, Ga., where Howie was an assistant for the University of Georgia, McCann and his brother, Brad, would go to Braves games at Fulton-County Stadium, when the team was still bad.The family moved to West Virginia when Howie coached for Marshall University, then settled near Atlanta when Brian was 12. Howie runs a baseball academy there with Brad, who is 14 months older than Brian and played four years in the Marlins’ system. The family business is baseball.“We were always at the field,” Brian said. “My childhood memories, a big portion of those are watching my dad coach. I just loved to be around the game. I loved everything about it.”Howie played second base at Mississippi State in a career that ended in 1978, when he hit .202 in the New York-Penn League. Brian played mostly second base, too, until switching to catcher in high school.Considering that pedigree, Brian had an unlikely idol growing up. It was not a catcher or a second baseman or even a member of the Braves. It was outfielder Tony Gwynn, the hit machine of the San Diego Padres.“I thought he was the greatest hitter on the planet, what he was able to do with the bat,” McCann said. “When I was 13, 14, 15, that’s who I wanted to be. I wanted to hit like Tony Gwynn.”The Braves told the McCanns they hoped to draft Brian with the 64th pick of the 2002 draft, and that is what happened. Even so, McCann was still in the background. Atlanta’s first-round pick was a different Georgia high school player, Jeff Francoeur.After McCann’s strong major league debut, he came to camp the next spring in the shadow of another catcher, Jarrod Saltalamacchia, who was ranked by Baseball America as the 18th-best prospect in the game.“Everybody was talking about Saltalamacchia,” Perez said. “When I saw Mac, I said, ‘Well, he’s O.K.’ But when I started to know him and talk to him, I said, ‘This kid’s going to be good, because he wants to get better, he wants to learn.’ He was 21 or 22, but he was ready to go and he was asking questions: ‘What do I need to do to get better?’ Something the other guy never had. I never saw that from anybody, especially another catcher.”McCann said he tried to absorb as much as he could from Jones, who taught him to tap his front toes twice at the start of his swing. Now, Jones said, McCann is as smart a hitter as he knows, with more power than Jones expected and the ability — like Gwynn — to lash the ball to all fields.“He just has so much plate coverage,” said Yankees catcher Russell Martin, a teammate of McCann’s on two All-Star teams. “He doesn’t really have a go-to spot where you can get him out.”When he does slump, McCann’s hitting guru is nearby. In 2007, after returning from a 3-for-22 trip, Brian called Howie after 10 p.m. on a Sunday night, Father’s Day. They met at the academy, blasted Brian’s favorite music from high school — ZZ Top — and hit until 1:30 in the morning. Brian homered in his next game.At various points in each of the last two seasons, father and son have held similar impromptu sessions. Though they talk nearly every day, Brian said he was always the one to seek help; Howie does not push.“He’ll never call me and say, ‘It looks like you’re doing this, it looks like you’re doing that,’ ” Brian said. “If he did that, I would never come to him. I’ve had success in the big leagues, at the highest level. If I can’t figure it out, then I go to him. And what makes it so good is he gets that. He understands how hard this game is.”McCann is finding ways to make it easier. His vision improved after he cut his caffeine consumption last season when he learned it was dilating his pupils. He ate healthier this winter and dropped 15 pounds, and says he believes his best years are ahead.Then again, he has always believed in himself. When McCann won his first Silver Slugger award, in 2006, he gave his father the trophy.“Brian, this is yours,” Howie said. “You’ve worked for this your whole life.”“Dad, you keep the first one,” Brian said. “I’ll keep the rest of them.”'"
"'11-02-22,'0','TUNIS — The head of a Tunisian government commission on political reform warned Monday that the country risked falling into “anarchy” as it passed through what he described as a very dangerous postrevolutionary transition toward multiparty democracy.“We might lose our freedom, because we become too drunk on freedom,” said Yadh Ben Achour, a prominent lawyer who is the head of Tunisia’s Higher Political Reform Commission. “The risk is that everyone says what they want and does not think of the common good.”Mr. Ben Achour’s commission is tasked with dismantling the repressive laws of the government of the former president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who fled the country in January, leaving a vacuum of power.Tunisia faces enormous challenges in rebuilding its political system. The country’s caretaker government has been confronted with nearly daily protests by a variety of groups, the police force has been badly weakened by mass desertions and the firing of top officials, and provincial government offices remain dysfunctional. The judicial system is hobbled by its links to the ousted regime.Abdelrazek Kilani, president of the Tunisian Bar Association, estimated that “about 100 judges are totally corrupt” and needed to be removed. “They took bribes and followed orders from the Ministry of Justice,” Mr. Kilani said in an interview. “They convicted people because the ministry told them to.“Our worry is that the Ben Ali system is still in place,” he said.Mr. Ben Achour of the Higher Political Reform Commission said Tunisia would miss the two-month deadline stipulated in its Constitution for a presidential election to replace Mr. Ben Ali. “Every judicial system knows the concept of force majeure,” he said, referring to unforeseen or uncontrollable events. It would be impossible to organize elections before the March 15 deadline, he said.'"

However that is a topic for another day, what I want to focus on today in this blog post is the adoption of AppSense style branding in their go to market messaging… let me give you a few examples.We live in a creative and digital age – diversity is everywhere, everywhere apart from the graphic design and branding departments at Liquidware Labs (LWL) and RES Software…It would appear the boys at LWL spend more time creating inaccurate comparison tables and positioning their product as a second class half price alternative to AppSense instead of creating some original corporate branding.  Below you will see an image showing a portion of the welcome screen in the AppSense product console.And below is our AppSense Management Suite offering:I think many of you will be familiar with the above, it’s been in our software for years and we have been presenting this Suite for years at industry events. So I was a little surprised, well, flattered to see our branding on the LWL website homepage:Notice the similarities to both layout and product icons?  I guess the boys at LWL must have sore throats from shouting all the incorrect statements about AppSense, because wow, they really like their Lozenges.Ok, so you may be thinking that’s not so much of a big deal, so what if LWL copied layout and product icons… but what about adopting a very similar image that AppSense is well known for – the virtualized user head:Most of you will have seen the above images; it was our latest branding up until our recent uplift.  Admittedly, when most of you first saw it you asked “What is it?!” but that’s good – it provokes thought and opens doors to conversation.A while ago I received a LWL email newsletter, with a rather striking, and familiar image…  some form of virtualized or digital user?! Surely not?  First the lozenges and now the head?  You can see it in the screenshot below, what do you think?After product icons and virtual head images comes the graphics used in web pages and banners.  Below is a sample of one of the old pages on the www.AppSense.comAnd the below graphic is what was created for AppSense Strata in mid-2009 (what is AppSense Strata is another story – look out for a post from Harry Labana soon! ;) )The below sample was taken from the RESguru blog homepage – admittedly this blue themed banner was used prior to the recent RES rebrand to orange.. But color aside.. Looks nothing more than add a few bright particles and change the words?!And today we have the slogan ‘More Technology – Less Koolaid!’ – Mr. Guru, I suggest something more fitting, ‘More Copying – Less Originality!’ perhaps? ;-)Messaging and branding aside, which are in fairness only references to similarities between our branding styles, the more alarming content copying comes in the form of content and wording used in Admin Guides and Job Postings:How many times have you heard or said ‘RTFM’?  Well, what if I were to suggest if the ‘The’ in RTFM was in fact ‘THEIR’?, because if you are a RES Software customer, and you want to learn about Windows Appearance and Control Panel Settings, you may as well read the AppSense Environment Manager How To document, because that is where they copied the wording from.  Below is a short snippet from our document:With the above in mind, now look at the wording in the below snippet take from a Workspace Management product document… almost word for word replication:I mentioned earlier that imitation is a form of flattery, but this is bare faced lazy copying, and certainly is not flattering… imitating our features 12 months later is one thing, but please – write your own admin guides for them :-)Hands up who has ever used Copy + Paste? Everyone yes?Ok, hands up if you have had the nerve to Copy + Paste direct from your competitors website, and then post it under the context of your company.. In full public view?! – Everyone No? – Everyone, apart from a corner cutter at RES Software.Below is a screen shot of an old job description from AppSense.com, a standard job description we have used for years, in fact the job I first joined AppSense as almost 8 years ago.Now, I noticed a few folks at RES Software had posted comments in the AppSense group on LinkedIn – no problem there, I’m all for discussions and ideas (keep it up).However from there I clicked onto the RES Software group and saw, what I can only describe as (I would say shocking, but I am not shocked, I have already seen the use of our content in their product documents) embarrassing – Advertising a job, using your competitors job description. Please see below.I know it may seem only a small thing, but please, come on. That isn’t cricket.I am all in favor of additional vendors joining this space, the market potential is huge – the more we have, the more focus and recognition as to the importance of the user component of the desktop, the more innovation, and the more options available to end user customers – what I do object to is the recycling of AppSense created content.. if you’re going to join the table… at least come with your own chips.For now, sit back – and enjoy your favourite song guys..'"

"'11-02-23,'0','“It’s absolutely clear that the governor’s budget bill is all about taking away our right to bargain collectively and organize into unions,” said Mr. Beil, 64, who first took a job with the state of Wisconsin in 1969, as a probation officer. “It’s difficult for us to understand how stripping people of their collective bargaining rights will help close a hole in this fiscal year’s budget.”His battle with Mr. Walker is the toughest fight of Mr. Beil’s career. Already, the union has agreed to Mr. Walker’s demands to have public employees pay more toward their pensions and health coverage, translating into a 7 percent cut in pay.Those concessions drew a moment of gloating from Mr. Walker at a Monday news conference. “That’s an interesting development, because a week ago they said that’s not acceptable,” he said.Mr. Walker says passing his “budget repair” bill will give the state, cities and school districts the flexibility they need to cut costs while minimizing layoffs, not just this year, but in future ones, too.“It sets the table to make sure we can balance the $3.6 billion budget we face,” he said Monday. “On top of that, we need to make sure that we are giving local governments the tools they need to balance their budgets.”Mr. Walker has made no secret that he believes Mr. Beil and his parent union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which has 68,000 members in Wisconsin, are obstacles to necessary change.Back in December, before taking office, Mr. Walker lobbied hard to persuade the Legislature to vote down a tentative contract that Mr. Beil had negotiated, saying it did not save enough money despite its two-year wage freeze.Mr. Beil hung tough at the time, likening Mr. Walker to “the plantation owner talking to the slaves.”Speaking of Mr. Beil’s stance then, William Powell Jones, a labor historian at the University of Wisconsin, said: “My sense is his position was, ‘We’re in a position of power. We don’t negotiate.’ It’s certainly not the kind of thing to make an anti-union public sympathetic to the union movement.”With the nation watching, Mr. Beil reversed course last week and accepted Mr. Walker’s demand that public employees pay 5.8 percent of their salaries toward their pensions and double their contributions toward health coverage. Union leaders said that since they had now met the governor halfway, he should compromise by dropping his plan to curb bargaining rights.But Mr. Walker has held firm. For his part, Mr. Beil said his union would never agree to the bargaining limits.“It’s all about taking our rights away,” he said. “Whether you’re a teacher, a state employee, a municipal employee, under his bill, your rights are gone to sit down as an equal at the bargaining table to work out issues like work schedules or how to transfer to another job or where do you work. All that would be gone.”A key Walker ally in the Legislature, Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, a Republican, called Mr. Beil “very combative” and added: I think Marty has unfortunately been out of touch for a while. He has probably led his members in the wrong direction.”Last month, Mr. Beil called Mr. Fitzgerald and his brother, Scott, the new Senate president, “lightweights” as well as “crybabies and whiners.”Such comments anger not just legislators, but also members of the public. A recent letter to The Wisconsin State Journal, a Madison daily, began, “Memo to Marty Beil: Take a vacation — a long one — and quit your never-ending sniping at Gov. Scott Walker and anyone else who disagrees with you.”Mr. Beil acknowledged, “I can be a lightning rod.” He said he upset many rank-and-file workers in the 1990s when he twice endorsed Tommy Thompson, a Republican, for re-election as governor.“I will support Republicans or Democrats, whoever is good for us,” he said.Mr. Beil says he just tells it like it is. His role is to fight for labor, he said, and he seems stunned that much of the public has turned so suddenly against public-employee unions.“The average working person is under a lot of pressure from the economic downturn,” he said. “There’s a lot of anger out there, a lot of fear, and that was played by the right wing against us.”“We’re as much a victim as anybody else,” he continued. “Public employees did not create the recession and the deficit here in Wisconsin. It was Wall Street.”Ever since Mr. Walker announced his plan to curb bargaining rights, Mr. Beil has worked closely with other Wisconsin labor leaders. Every day, he confers with Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin State A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Mary Bell, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, which represents 98,000 school employees, to strategize on how best to mobilize support, often by using phone banks, e-mail blasts and Facebook.“Marty is very passionate and cares deeply about what happens to his members,” Mr. Neuenfeldt said.Asked whether Mr. Beil sometimes goes too far, unnecessarily alienating people, Mr. Neuenfeldt answered, “As I said, he’s very passionate.”'"
"'11-02-23,'0','“States Aim Ax at Health Cost of Retirement” (front page, Feb. 14) describes steps taken by cities and states to control employee health care costs. One city, Wauwatosa, Wis., requires its employees to undergo “colonoscopy at age 50, to help forestall cancer and potentially high treatment costs,” you report.Colon cancer screening with colonoscopy — viewing the entire colon — has almost completely replaced more limited sigmoidoscopy, which costs as little as one-tenth as much. Yet studies have repeatedly failed to show that colonoscopy reduces the risk of death from colon cancer more effectively than sigmoidoscopy.Indeed, two national multidisciplinary task forces state that sigmoidoscopy is just as effective. Nonetheless, the American College of Gastroenterology recommends colonoscopy over sigmoidoscopy, and national health care legislation mandates that new coverage include screening colonoscopy.And therein lies a clue to controlling health care costs. To do that, we need the discipline to apply scientifically based medical knowledge, without commercial interference.The writer, a doctor of family medicine, is a lecturer in health care policy at Harvard Medical School and the author of “Overdosed America.”'"

The deaths, an unusually large number, are being studied as possible casualties of oil that fouled the Gulf of Mexico after a BP drilling platform exploded last April. The bodies of 20 infant and stillborn dolphins have been discovered since Jan. 20, most of them during the past week, on islands and beaches along a 130-mile stretch of coastline from Gulfport, Miss., east to Gulf Shores, Ala.

"'11-02-23,'0','“We felt the penalties imposed on the head coach are adequate and fair to the allegations and penalties,” Thomas said. “The head coach should be aware, but, also in the same frame, the head coach obviously cannot be aware of everything that goes on within the program. However, the head coach bears that responsibility.”“I am very disappointed with the N.C.A.A.’s decision in this case,” Calhoun said in a statement released by the university. “My lawyer and I are evaluating my options and will make a decision which way to proceed. In the meantime, I will not make any further statements about the case as our program prepares for what I hope will be an exciting and successful postseason.”The infractions committee cited a substantial list of violations UConn committed in the recruitment of Miles by a former student manager, Josh Nochimson, who was a registered N.B.A. agent and helped guide Miles to UConn. Nochimson paid for part of Miles’s foot surgery, his tuition at a basketball academy and the registration fee for his SAT examination. He paid for strength, conditioning and basketball training.“The men’s basketball staff was aware of the booster’s status as an agent and his relationship with the prospect,” the N.C.A.A. said in a written statement. “In fact, the coaches had frequent contact with the booster through approximately 2,000 phone calls or text with the agent throughout the recruitment process. Despite this regular contact, the men’s basketball coaching staff did not question the booster about his relationship with the prospect.”Two members of last season’s staff — Beau Archibald, the director of basketball operations, and the assistant Patrick Sellers — were accused of lying to N.C.A.A. investigators during the probe and have lost their jobs. The Committee on Infractions also levied a two-year show-cause penalty for Archibald.The report also quotes the Connecticut athletic director, Jeff A. Hathaway, saying it was the “most intense” he had ever seen Calhoun in his pursuit of a student-athlete. In his 25th season, Calhoun, 68, has won 595 games and 2 national titles at Connecticut. Last season, he signed a five-year, $13 million contract extension.In response to the N.C.A.A. when the allegations first arose last year, UConn distanced Calhoun from involvement in the recruiting scandal, though he was accused of impermissibly providing UConn tickets in 2007 to high school coaches and individuals connected with recruits.Miles enrolled at UConn in June 2008 but never played for the Huskies. He was expelled the next October after he was charged with violating a restraining order in a case involving a woman who said he assaulted her.“The only thing I’ve ever told anyone is my program didn’t cheat,” Calhoun told The New York Times recently. “Everything they’ve accused us of would be secondary violation. They seem to think something was going on.”'"

"'11-02-23,'0','On Monday, however, a Wintek spokesman denied that the company was pressing workers to resign or sign papers absolving the company of future liability.The company said it was working with medical professionals to assess the health of workers. Jay Huang, the spokesman, even suggested that Wintek would pay for medical care should the symptoms persist after workers resign.“Wintek’s policy of handling this is to put workers’ benefit as the first priority,” he said.Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., declined to discuss the Wintek case but said the company was committed to the highest standards of social responsibility in its supply chain. “We require our suppliers to provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect and use environmentally friendly manufacturing processes whenever our products are made,” she said.Many workers, though, say they do not trust the factory because some managers continue to press injured workers to resign, sometimes by insisting they work longer hours even though their health is impaired.Mr. Jia, a machine repair worker, was among a group of Wintek employees who gathered Sunday to discuss the case in a worker’s bare, unheated one-room apartment a few miles from the factory.Some members of the group said they were still suffering health problems while working at the factory, which employs 18,000 workers at an average monthly wage of about $200, after overtime.Wang Mei, 37, a quality inspection supervisor at Wintek, said she was hospitalized for 10 months because of n-hexane poisoning. She said she would like to leave the factory, but only after receiving assurances that Wintek would cover her medical bills if her health problems persisted.“It’s not that we want to work here,” she said Sunday, as she tried to explain why she remains at the factory despite recurring symptoms, such as soreness in her limbs and fatigue. “We want to fight for our legal rights.”Another woman came into the room waving a letter from a Chinese insurance company, turning her down for life insurance because she had been poisoned at the Wintek factory.Although many workers said they had not heard from Apple and had been pressed to leave Wintek, one worker said that an Apple employee had arrived at the Suzhou factory on Tuesday and had met with a few affected workers.The workers also said Wintek managers appeared to be softening their position early this week by telling several injured workers that they would no longer be required to sign documents if they choose to resign.The Wintek injuries underscore the challenges Apple faces in trying to source goods from China, which dominates electronics manufacturing with low-cost labor and highly efficient factories that often operate around the clock.But China is also known for factories that routinely flout labor and environmental laws.About 18 months ago, workers at the Wintek factory started complaining of sore limbs and extreme weakness. Some employees had difficulty climbing stairs or even buttoning a shirt; others said they had dizzy spells and pounding headaches. “My palms started sweating and my legs got numb,” Mr. Jia said. “At first, I didn’t think it was related to work.”According to Wintek, doctors later discovered that the factory’s workers, scores of them, were suffering from heavy exposure to n-hexane, a toxic agent the factory had begun using to clean the sophisticated touch-screen glass panels it makes for the Apple iPhone. Some workers said they were hospitalized for months with what doctors told them was nerve damage. Because the workers had insurance, Wintek and the government paid the medical costs and some compensation during their sick leave.Wintek said it began using n-hexane in early 2009, after the factory received a large order for the glass panels. The company says n-hexane evaporates quickly and was considered more efficient than other cleaning agents.But the compound is also considered a narcotic, which in high concentrations can disrupt the central nervous system of humans and induce vertigo and muscular atrophy, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a division of the United States Department of Labor.To draw attention to their plight, some affected workers organized a protest early last year. They also hired a lawyer, lobbied local government officials and even set up a microblogging site with links to their medical records.In its report, Apple said n-hexane was no longer being used at the Suzhou factory and that Wintek had repaired its ventilation system.But Debby Chan, project officer at Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, a labor rights group in Hong Kong, said Apple and Wintek were slow to address the problem. “We heard rumors about the poisoning in 2009, and after a strike at the factory in January 2010, we went to the No. 5 hospital and found some of the workers,” Ms. Chan said. “When I visited workers in the hospital they said the Wintek management did not care about the situation. And after this case was exposed by the media, Apple never approached the workers or made an apology for their suffering.”Apple’s first mention of the case came last week, in its annual overseas supplier assessment, which the company has released since 2007.This year’s review was particularly sensitive because it was the first since several suicides last year among workers at Foxconn Technologies, one of Apple’s biggest suppliers in China. Some labor rights advocates had attributed the suicides to harsh working conditions at its huge factory compounds, some of which employ 300,000 people.In the report, Apple praised Foxconn for its response to the deaths. Foxconn hired counselors, raised salaries and even put up nets on some of its buildings to prevent suicide attempts.But Apple also said it had discovered that some of its other Chinese suppliers had employees younger than 16, the legal working age. One supplier factory had 42 under-age workers, the company said.Well aware of the pitfalls of outsourcing manufacturing to China, Apple and other global brands often hire independent auditors to make surprise visits to supplier factories. They also press factories to agree to strict codes of conduct and to ensure worker safety and compliance with China’s labor and environmental laws. One of the injured Wintek workers who agreed to be interviewed Sunday, Yao Xiaoping, 22, a migrant worker from Shaanxi Province, said he had left the factory and had accepted compensation of about $12,000 but now feared for his future because of the n-hexane poisoning that he said had left him with sweaty palms and weak limbs.“I went back to my village but everyone knows what happened to me,” he said, fighting back tears. “So it has made it difficult for me to find a wife there.”'"

That is only a fraction of the country’s production, but with foreign oil companies beginning to shut down operations and evacuate workers and with local ports closing, more output could be lost.“OPEC is ready to meet any shortage in supply when it happens,” the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said at a news conference after a meeting of ministers of oil producing and consuming nations in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. “There is concern and fear, but there is no shortage.”Europe appears most immediately vulnerable to the strife in Libya, which produces almost 2 percent of the world’s oil. More than 85 percent of its exports go to Europe; more than a third goes to Italy alone. Libya sends only a small fraction of its oil to the United States, but because oil is a world commodity, Americans are not immune to the price shock waves.In New York, crude oil for March delivery gained $7.37, or 8.6 percent, to $93.57 a barrel, while oil for April delivery rose 6.4 percent, to $95.42 a barrel. Brent crude, a European benchmark traded in London, rose 4 cents, to $105.78. Refineries on the East and West Coasts also depend on Brent crude, meaning that the higher prices paid by Europeans are also pushing up gasoline and heating oil prices paid by many New Yorkers, New Englanders and other Americans.Tom Kloza, the chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, estimated that the Saudis could pump an additional 1 million to 1.5 million barrels in a matter of days. As the largest producer, Saudi Arabia is by far the most influential member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with a reserve capacity to deliver an additional four million to five million barrels to the world markets after several weeks of preparation. That is more than twice the oil that world markets would lose if production were halted completely by unrest in Libya.“Unless this unrest spreads to the streets of Jeddah and Riyadh,” Mr. Kloza said, “I think it’s a very manageable situation and prices are closer to cresting than they are to exploding higher.”While Libya has been the immediate cause for the spike in oil prices recently, oil experts said traders were driving up prices because of concerns that a long period of instability in the Middle East was just beginning. They identified the protests in Bahrain in particular as a disturbing sign that neighboring Saudi Arabia might not be immune to the spreading political contagion.Bahrain produces little oil, but it is connected to the oil-rich eastern region of Saudi Arabia by a 15-mile causeway. The island nation has a majority Shiite population with cultural and religious ties to the Saudi Shiite minority that lives close to some of the richest Saudi oil fields.Saudi rulers have long feared that its regional rival, Iran, could try to destabilize Bahrain as a way to cause trouble for the Saudi royal family. Iran’s intentions became all the more worrisome to the Saudis when it decided this month to send two warships through the Suez Canal for the first time in more than 30 years.“No one knows where this ends,” said Helima L. Croft, a director and senior geopolitical strategist at Barclays Capital. “A couple of weeks ago it was Tunisia and Egypt, and it was thought this can be contained to North Africa and the resource-poor Middle East countries. But now with protests in Bahrain, that’s the heart of the gulf, and it’s adding to anxieties.”Middle Eastern oil fields are generally well defended and far from population centers, but energy analysts say the continuing turbulence potentially threatens supply lines and foreign investment that producers like Libya and Algeria depend on to increase production.World oil prices started rising sharply when demonstrators overwhelmed downtown Cairo earlier in the month because of concerns that unrest could block the Suez Canal and Sumed pipeline through which three million barrels of crude pass daily. Labor unrest continues to roil the canal, though shipments have continued without incident.Unrest in Yemen potentially threatens the 18-mile-wide Strait of Bab el-Mandeb, a shipping lane between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East that serves as a strategic link between the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean through which nearly four million barrels of oil pass daily. Security for tanker traffic in the area became a concern after terrorists attacked a French tanker off the coast of Yemen in 2002.'"

"'11-02-23,'0','As protesters again filled the halls of the Capitol on Tuesday, the Republican-led Legislature returned to work. But the story here remained one of obstruction.Senate Democrats remained in hiding in , preventing the chamber from taking up a budget bill that includes provisions they view as an attack on public sector unions. And Assembly Democrats began a marathon session of debate on the bill, promising to offer more than 100 amendments in an apparent stalling tactic.The debate occurred against the constant noisemaking of protesters engaged in a de facto occupation of the Capitol now entering its second week.In the gallery people were quiet and well behaved; several people had taped their mouths shut in protest. The same could not be said for the representatives, who traded accusations and threats.Passage seemed inevitable in the Assembly. The entire Republican caucus, and one independent, appeared together to reiterate support of restrictions on unions.'"
"'11-02-23,'0','Mr. Shiller’s colleague, the economist Karl E. Case, a professor emeritus of economics at Wellesley College, says he does not think the outlook is so dire. He said in the conference call on Tuesday that he thought the housing market was at “a rocky bottom with a down trend.”The S.& P./Case-Shiller index of 20 large metropolitan areas fell 1 percent in December from November, although the drop was just 0.4 percent when the data was adjusted for seasonal variations. Eleven cities in the index posted their lowest levels in December since home price peaks in 2006 and 2007, up from nine cities in November. Phoenix and New York joined a list that includes Atlanta, Chicago and Seattle.The only city in the index that posted a monthly gain on an unadjusted basis was Washington. Five cities posted a gain on an adjusted basis.One data point that favored Mr. Case’s optimism: The adjusted declines in December and November were about half the drops in the previous two months, indicating the slide might be slowing.Most analysts seem to fall between Mr. Shiller and Mr. Case in their forecasts.“Even though affordability is exceptionally high and housing is incredibly cheap, the double-dip in house prices that began last year will continue throughout this year,” Capital Economics, a consulting firm, said Tuesday. Their estimate was that prices would drop another 5 percent unless a “vicious circle” of falling prices and rising foreclosures developed, in which case prices would be worse.Also released Tuesday was the Case-Shiller quarterly index that covers all homes in the country. It showed prices fell 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.1 percent for all of 2010.The Case-Shiller index is a three-month moving average, which means it changes slowly. It is now less than 3 percent above the low recorded in the spring of 2009, when there was widespread hope that the market was starting to recover.To accelerate the process, the Obama administration offered a carrot for new buyers: a tax credit. The credit did its job, enticing hundreds of thousands of buyers to accelerate their purchases in the fall of 2009 and the spring of 2010. But the credit did not lay the groundwork for a permanent rebound.“Every place is pretty much getting hit a second time for essentially the same reasons,” said Andrew LePage, an analyst with DataQuick Information Systems. “Slow economic recovery, little job growth, still-tight credit, no more government stimulus, a pervasive and gnawing sense that prices could fall more, too few people getting jobs and too many worrying about losing the one they have.”Amid all this gloom, one group thinks the situation is much better than generally portrayed: the National Association of Realtors. Its data shows the median existing single-family home price rose in 78 out of 152 metropolitan statistical areas in the fourth quarter of 2010 from the fourth quarter of 2009, including 10 with double-digit increases.But even as the group asserts that the market’s decline has been overstated, it is being accused of having bad numbers of its own.The blog Calculated Risk wrote last month that the real estate group was planning major downward revisions to the last three years of house sales data. CoreLogic, a data company, said last week that it estimated 2010 home sales at 3.6 million, much less than the 4.9 million the National Association of Realtors was claiming. If accurate, the CoreLogic numbers would indicate a market even more troubled than is generally assumed.Against this welter of conflicting claims and dark predictions, many would-be sellers are opting out until that distant moment when they can get what they think they deserve. Some are renting their home after moving to new quarters; others are simply turning down that new job and staying put.This can work to the advantage of those who plunge ahead. Jordan and Caitlin Van Horn bought their house in the fashionable Seattle neighborhood of Ballard three years ago. Ever since then, the market has slumped. The couple is moving to Alabama and feared the worst when they put their home on the market.They were pleasantly surprised. Their four-bedroom house fetched $545,000 after less than a week, only 5 percent less than they paid.“The lack of inventory really worked to our advantage,” said Mr. Van Horn, a co-developer of a bookkeeping system for small businesses. “We feel thankful for the way things turned out.”'"

"'11-02-24,'0','Felix Salmon (“Wall Street’s Dead End,” Op-Ed, Feb. 14) overstates that the stock market is “little more than a place for speculators and algorithms” and that only “plutocrats,” not civilians, control and benefit from corporate performance as reflected in the stock markets.The American public today, in a different form from the past, is vested in corporate performance as reflected in stock markets. While the stock market is certainly not a perfect reflection of corporate performance, it is one measure, and while privatization may be growing in America, it won’t ever become exclusive.In the last few decades public stock ownership has become increasingly concentrated in institutions like mutuals, public and private pension funds, banks, insurance companies and the like. According to a recent McKinsey study, only 35 percent of equities are dealt with by “traders.”Millions of everyday Americans, therefore, are beneficiaries of these institutional owners who depend on public tradeable equity, which are empowered to actively participate in the United States stock markets and corporate governance.If the American public, as fund beneficiaries, does not have a proper voice in corporate America, it is not the fault of the stock markets or “plutocrats.” Rather, it is due to a failure of the institutions to carry out their fiduciary duties to identify, align and manage equities in the best interests of their beneficiaries.Contrary to Mr. Salmon, there is no current threat to shareholder democracy by stock markets.

"'11-02-24,'0','It seemed as if Port Chester, N.Y., was finally about to end a bitter chapter in its history — after four years of voting-rights litigation against the federal government, more than $1.2 million in legal fees, the creation of a new voting system and the election of the municipality’s first Latino to its board of trustees.But this week, the village’s elected leaders decided that they were not done fighting.On Tuesday night, Port Chester’s trustees voted to hire a law firm to appeal the federal court ruling that created the new system, which was devised to give the Westchester County village’s large Latino population a better chance of electing one of its own to the board.In a 4-to-2 vote, the board authorized spending $225,000 for the law firm, though members acknowledged that additional fees would have to be authorized should the case be retried.One of the appeal’s main proponents was Joseph Kenner, a Republican trustee who, in the inaugural election under the new voting system last June, became the first black candidate to be elected to the board. He said in an interview on Wednesday that although he had won under the new system, he had never thought the federal government’s lawsuit, filed in 2006 under the Voting Rights Act, or a federal judge’s decision to throw out the old system were justified.Voting data, he said, showed that the preferred candidates of Latino voters had won under the old system, which elected six at-large board members. The Justice Department had argued — and the federal judge agreed — that the at-large system denied the Latino population fair representation. In the new system, called cumulative voting, voters could use six votes however they chose, including casting all six for one candidate.'"
"'11-02-24,'0','Lawmakers who support Boeing contend that the Pentagon’s formula for judging the bids favors the larger European plane over Boeing’s smaller one. They also complain that EADS, which is partly owned by European nations, could use subsidies to underbid Boeing even though the EADS plane would normally cost at least 10 to 15 percent more to build.“I think the Air Force has bent over backwards not only to get EADS to bid, but to give it an advantage,” Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington State, said Wednesday in an interview.Pentagon officials declined to comment on Wednesday. They have said they steered the bidding “straight down the middle” to get the best deal for the military and to push forward on a project that began in 2001. EADS and its supporters dismiss Boeing’s concerns, saying the rules of the contest have been clear for more than a year and their plane is more modern.“It is my hope that the Air Force will soon put thousands of Alabamians to work building the clearly superior aircraft our war-fighters deserve,” Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, said in a statement on Wednesday.Both companies said they had adjusted their bids in submitting their “best and final” offers on Feb. 10. When reporters asked last week how much EADS had lowered its price, Ralph D. Crosby Jr., the chairman of its North American unit, quipped: “Just enough to win.”EADS also has substantial political backing, particularly among Republican lawmakers. So the fight could also offer another test of how the new Republican majority in the House will handle spending and job issues. And some analysts believe that Congress could still order the Pentagon to split the purchase between the two companies.The bidding marks the third attempt by the Air Force to start replacing hundreds of aging tankers, which date back to the Eisenhower and Kennedy years. They transfer fuel in flight to fighters, bombers and cargo planes.Even some military officials note sardonically that the Allies won World War II in half the time it has taken the procurement process to get to this point.The first effort collapsed after Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona, blew the whistle on corruption involving an airplane-leasing proposal with Boeing. Northrop Grumman and EADS, the parent of Airbus, then won in 2008, only to have government auditors block the award after Boeing protested that the evaluation had been too subjective.Northrop dropped out last year, prompting the Pentagon to extend the bid deadline to give EADS more time out of concern that Boeing could charge a higher price if it were the only bidder.Another complexity was that the EADS plane, based on an Airbus A330-200 commercial jet, could carry more fuel than Boeing’s offering, which is derived from its 767 jetliner, but also could have higher operating costs.So the Pentagon has relied on a mathematical scoring system to adjust the price of each plane, determined by how well it would meet various war-fighting situations and how much it would cost to operate the fleet over 40 years.Boeing’s supporters say that while they initially thought the system might give the smaller plane some advantages, it did not always turn out that way.Representative Jay Inslee, a Democrat from Washington State, said that under one simulated war situation, some of the EADS planes were allowed to fly from bases closer to the battle areas than Boeing’s planes, reducing the amount of fuel that the EADS planes would have to burn to make deliveries.He also said the Air Force had projected that fuel costs would increase by an annual average of 2.5 percent over 40 years, while consultants hired by Boeing thought the rate would be higher. He said that reduced a possible cost advantage for Boeing.Guy Hicks, a spokesman for EADS North America, said his company had been hurt by other factors, and both companies were allowed to seek changes in the rules. “But now it seems that some people are taking steps in the ninth inning to try to change the rules,” he said.Boeing’s supporters have also long been rankled by the Pentagon’s insistence that it could not weigh the effects of government aviation subsidies while the World Trade Organization considers cases against both Europe and the United States. That issue is likely to flare up again if Congress debates the Pentagon’s tanker choice.'"
"'11-02-24,'0','MIAMI — Drug Enforcement Administration agents and other law enforcement officials on Wednesday raided six South Florida pain clinics accused of illegally dispensing potent prescription drugs across the United States. Twenty-two people, including five doctors, were arrested on state and federal drug trafficking charges.The one-year undercover inquiry, dubbed Operation Pill Nation, focused on storefront clinics in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties that the authorities say have become a national clearinghouse for illegal prescription drugs and highly addictive painkillers like oxycodone. Investigators described the operation as the federal government’s most aggressive effort to shut down the so-called pill mills they say have contributed to sharp increases in overdoses and addiction.South Florida has long been a place where prescription drugs could be obtained easily and cheaply. In recent years, such pill mills have flourished in strip malls from Miami to Palm Beach Gardens, with the highest concentration of rogue clinics in Broward and Palm Beach Counties, officials said.“This is a completely profit-driven operation that has no medical regard for anyone,” Mark R. Trouville, the special agent in charge of the Miami field office for the D.E.A., said in an interview. “These clinics have nothing to do with the welfare of the community.”Mr. Trouville said that since the operation began a year ago, a task force had taken action against 66 doctors at 83 locations and seized more than $25 million worth of property.'"

"'11-02-24,'0','So far, thanks to growing demand from both business and leisure passengers, the airlines have not had any trouble selling seats. Because they have not added much new capacity as the economy has picked up, their planes are still flying full, especially during peak hours. And as airlines continue to find customers for their most expensive fares, analysts said, they are reducing the number of their cheapest seats — and even those are not so cheap anymore.“Airlines are raising their fares because, right now, they think they can,” said Jeff Straebler, a strategist at RBS. “People will actually buy the tickets at those fares.”In January, the cheapest round-trip fare from any of the top 50 airports in the country averaged $367 — 10 percent higher that the average of $333 for the same time last year, according to FareCompare.com, a consumer airline research Web site.Rick Seaney, FareCompare’s chief executive, said each increase in the last three months had averaged $5 to $12 for the least expensive tickets.The increases have been far steeper at the front of the plane, in business and first class, as well as for last-minute travelers. American Airlines, United, Continental and US Airways all raised their fares by $20 to $60 on Monday for first- and business-class tickets, and seven-day advance. Last week, Delta Air Lines increased its fares for these high-end tickets by $40 to $120 for a round-trip ticket, according to fare watchers.On top of that, some airlines are also increasing their fees. US Airways recently raised its fees for a variety of overweight and oversize bags — those weighing 75 to 100 pounds — to as much as $175 a bag, from $100. It also raised the cost of a third checked bag, to $125 from $100.“We’ve had a lot of airfare hike activity compared with the last two years,” Mr. Seaney said.In recent weeks, the carriers have also bumped up their base ticket prices for travel during the summer by as much as $250, in Virgin Airlines’ case. In addition, the airlines have introduced “peak travel” surcharges of $20 to $60 round-trip on some summer departure dates.Airlines executives have long dreaded the return of higher fuel prices. In 2008, when oil soared above $147 a barrel in New York, the airlines were forced to ground thousands of planes, including some of the least fuel-efficient planes, in a desperate bid to stem their losses.But the rise in fuel prices once again hangs over the industry’s profits. Last year, the top eight airlines earned $4 billion with total revenue of $122 billion, showing a meager profit margin of 3.3 percent.Oil prices jumped more than $12 a barrel this week, rising above $98 a barrel in New York on Wednesday, after the violent uprising in Libya, a major oil producer. In London, Brent crude futures rose to $111.25 a barrel.The price of jet fuel, which is now $2.99 a gallon, has soared 58 percent since last summer’s lows of $1.89 a gallon.“Airlines are under a lot of pressure,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor of public policy at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. “Demand is recovering but rising fuel prices may short-circuit that.”The Air Transport Association said last week that passenger revenue had grown 10 percent in January compared with the same time last year. That was the 13th consecutive month of revenue growth for the airlines.“We have slightly fuller planes and stronger pricing,” said John Heimlich, the chief economist at the Air Transport Association. “There is no question we are enjoying the coattails of a stronger global economy after a very depressed period. We are making up for lost years.”Some analysts pointed out that one reason traditional carriers could get away with increasing fares was that Southwest, the largest domestic airline, also saw the need to bolster its own fares.“Southwest has been acting more like a legacy airline,” Mr. Seaney said.Prices are inching toward their highest levels, reached in 2008. Still, flying remains relatively affordable, once ticket prices are adjusted for inflation. The average air fare in the third quarter of 2010 — the latest period for which government estimates are available — was 20 percent lower than in 2000 after inflation is taken into account, according to the government’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics.The airlines, meanwhile, have been resisting an Obama administration proposal to increase ticket fees to help finance airport projects. The president’s budget, released on Feb. 14, would raise the passenger facility charge to a maximum of $7 per flying segment, from the current $4.50, to offset a cut of $1.1 billion to airport grants.Delta has argued that this increase means that a family of four will pay $112 in ticket fees, instead of $72, assuming they buy round-trip tickets with one stop.A world of higher fuel prices and higher fees might substantially change the way passengers think of air travel — less a convenient mode of mass transportation and more a luxury, one analyst said.“Flying is getting more expensive, there is no question about it,” said Robert Herbst, a former commercial pilot and independent airline analyst. “These rising energy costs have to be passed on to consumers. For some, this means flying will become less affordable.”'"

"'11-02-24,'0','The E.P.A. withdrew the earlier rule in December, saying it needed another 15 months to refashion the rule to respond to complaints and new data. A federal judge rejected the extension, saying the agency had already spent three years developing the regulation, and ordered it to produce a new rule by this week.The agency grudgingly met the deadline but said it would remain open to comments and proposals for changes from lawmakers, businesses and citizens.Agency officials said the new rule was consistent with an executive order issued by in January calling for a broad review of environmental, health, safety and to ensure that they were not imposing too heavy a cost on the economy. Changes to the boiler rule could foreshadow a less muscular approach to air pollution rules due for power plants next month and a series of regulations of greenhouse gases to be rolled out over the next several years.The power plant rules are currently being scrubbed by the White House .The rule issued on Wednesday affects roughly 200,000 boilers, small power plants and incinerators operated by factories, chemical plants, municipalities, universities, churches and commercial buildings.About 187,000 of these are relatively small sources of the target pollutants — lead, mercury, soot and toxic gases — and will have to do little more than perform routine “tune-ups” every year or two to meet the new standard. They will be allowed to achieve the cuts using readily available control technology at what the E.P.A. said was a reasonable cost. The agency said the earlier version, which would have required boiler operators to apply “maximum achievable control technology,” set too high a bar.“The original standards for these have been dramatically refined and updated to ensure maximum flexibility for these sources,” the agency said in a press release.The 13,800 larger facilities, including refineries, chemical plants and large factories, will have to meet numerical targets for pollution reduction, although the agency said it had narrowed the standards to lower compliance costs. The government will provide technical assistance in meeting the new standards and grant incentives for switching to cleaner-burning fuels such as natural gas and biomass.Bob Bessette, president of the Council of Industrial Boiler Owners, said it appeared that the E.P.A. had provided some relief for operators of smaller units but nonetheless called it a “terrible disappointment” because it was not clear that its standards could be met at a reasonable cost.He noted that because the new rule was so different from the previous version, E.P.A. would immediately reopen it to comment.“This is a good plan given our nation’s current economic challenges,” Mr. Bessette said. “It makes much more sense for E.P.A. and all stakeholders to revisit key challenges, take additional time and get the rule right.”'"
"'11-02-24,'0','Should the turmoil in Libya last for more than a few weeks, oil experts predict that European refiners will be forced to buy sweet crude from Algeria and Nigeria, two principal sources of sweet crude for the United States. That would probably push up American gasoline prices, which have already risen 6 cents a gallon over the last week to an average of $3.19 for regular grade.“It will force all sweet crude refiners into a bidding war,” said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, an organization partly financed by the oil industry. “Quality matters more than quantity.”Sweet crude is particularly well suited for producing diesel fuel, which is far more popular as a transportation fuel in Europe than in the United States. Sour crudes are more expensive to refine, but American refineries are typically outfitted with equipment to refine them because so much oil imported to the United States comes from Latin America, where many oil reserves are sour.The last time there was a shortage of sweet crude, in 2007 and early 2008, oil prices surged to more than $140 a barrel, although that shortage was caused mostly by spiraling demand and not a sudden cut in supply.The price of the benchmark American oil, West Texas Intermediate, briefly touched $100 on Wednesday before settling at $98.10 in New York trading, up $2.68 from Tuesday. In London, the benchmark Brent crude rose $5.47, to $111.25.A gauge of jet fuel prices, known as Gulf Coast jet fuel, soared 10.7 cents, to $2.99 a gallon in the spot market on Wednesday, putting pressure on airlines to raise fares. Meanwhile, diesel prices have risen 4 cents in the last week, to $3.57 a gallon, the highest level since October 2008.Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consultancy firm, said the Brent benchmark was headed for $120 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate would reach $110 “in the near term.”That could easily push the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline to $3.50, which economists say would cut into consumer discretionary spending, like dining out. Typically, every one-cent increase in the pump price of gasoline takes more than $1 billion out of consumer pockets over a year.Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, said in a research note that the turmoil “will slow the economic recovery this year, as both consumers and businesses look on with concern and begin to reconsider their spending plans.”Still, the United States remains less directly vulnerable than most European or Asian nations because its large refineries can process both sweet and sour crudes. A versatile refinery fleet makes the United States an exporter of both diesel and jet fuel.If supplies of sweet oil become tight, the United States can release supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but that would probably have only a marginal effect on prices.Europe is most immediately affected by the Libyan crisis. More than 85 percent of Libya’s exports go to Europe, with more than a third of that going to Italy. Most of the rest goes to Asia. About 5 percent is sent to the United States.ENI, the Italian oil company, Repsol of Spain, Total of France, Statoil of Norway, and BASF, the German chemical and energy company, have halted much if not most of their oil production in Libya and moved personnel out of the country.In a research note, Barclays Capital estimated that around one million barrels a day of production had been shut down, or more than half the country’s total. Much of Libya’s oil producing capacity and its port facilities are in the eastern part of the country, where the government has lost the most control.That leaves the eyes of the oil world on neighboring Algeria, another country with a history of unrest. Algeria is the seventh-biggest source of American oil imports.There have been sporadic protests against high food prices and unemployment in Algeria over the last several weeks, including at least two large demonstrations in Algiers demanding the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.“You have a powder keg in Algeria with social problems, ethnic problems and an Islamist organization blended together and overlapping,” said Michael J. Economides, a professor of engineering and energy economics at the University of Houston. “Many refineries would go into paroxysm if they lose Libyan and Algerian oil.”Most Middle East oil production is controlled by national oil companies that operate as virtual state agencies and coordinate their security needs with the national militaries.But that is not the case in either Libya or Algeria, where American and European oil companies have invested heavily over the last decade to bolster production that had been lagging. Foreign companies have shown in Libya, and to a lesser extent in Egypt, that they will shut down exploration and production and close their offices rather than jeopardize the safety of their employees.'"
"'11-02-24,'0','Hahn-Bin is a rare bridge between Carnegie Hall, where he will make his mainstage debut on March 13, and the Boom Boom Room, where he performed at a party hosted by V Magazine during New York Fashion Week. He is the latest in a series of classic-musical provocateurs who have included the German virtuoso Anne-Sophie Mutter, famous for her strapless ball gowns; and Nigel Kennedy, a genre-bending, hard-partying Brit.“The classical-music world needs to be shaken up a little bit,” said Vicki Margulies, artist manager for Young Concert Artists Inc., which selected Hahn-Bin to perform at the Morgan. “And he’s the one to do it.”Hahn-Bin credits Mr. Perlman and the star architect Peter Marino, who financed his New York concert debut in 2009 at Zankel Hall, part of Carnegie Hall, for teaching him how to straddle two cultural worlds. “The only person that understood that I was a genre of my own was Mr. Perlman,” he said. “He gets that I have always been a performance artist who sings through the violin.”In a phone interview, Mr. Perlman said: “He is an extremely talented violinist who is very, very individual. He combines music with drama and a visual element. It’s very personal to him. When an artist feels it that personally, the audience does, too.”Hahn-Bin’s diverse group of fans also includes the fashion personality André Leon Talley, the art maven Shala Monroque, the magazine editor Stephen Gan and the gallerist Barbara Gladstone. “In the context of classically trained musicians, he is quite startling, as they are hardly given to personal theater,” Ms. Gladstone said.He collaborated with the video artist Ryan McNamara on “Production,” a performance at the Louis Vuitton store during Fashion’s Night Out last year, and he walked the runway for the designer Elise Overland last September. This month, he performed at the Stone, an art space in the East Village, in a show curated by the musicians Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson; and played soliloquies inspired by the exhibition “Andy Warhol: Motion Pictures” at the Museum of Modern Art.“The movement, his body, his clothes, his style, his dramaturgy and the music, of course, form one strong, complex, multilayered audio-visual image,” said Klaus Biesenbach, chief curator at large for the museum.Hahn-Bin said that defying genres in this manner is an intrinsic part of his personality. “I have never identified as Asian or American, boy or girl, classical or pop,” he said.He was born in Seoul, South Korea; his family moved to Los Angeles when he was 10 so he could study at the Colburn School of Performing Arts. As a teenager, he would tell his mother he was going there to practice the violin, then sneak off to see performances by Ms. Anderson or the avant-garde playwright Robert Wilson. He moved to New York in 2004 after being accepted into Juilliard, where he quickly felt like “a strange fruit,” he said. His classmates didn’t understand why he studied the work of the musician Björk and the photographer Nick Knight along with Kreisler and Dvorak. “They would tease me endlessly,” he said.Between classes, he’d shop at downtown boutiques like Seven New York and Yohji Yamamoto, then return to class decked out in Bernhard Willhelm and Martin Margiela. “Everyone’s jaws would just drop,” he said. “I fought with the deans constantly about what I could wear. They finally told me I can wear something all black. Naturally, I went onstage wearing a top that had a very deep V-neck. I will never forget when the orchestra manager ran to me backstage with a safety pin in horror.”Hahn-Bin said that his use of fashion is part of an attempt to make classical music (“the new underground genre,” he said) relevant to a group of young people who may have been dragged to concerts by their grandparents. He also posts relentlessly on his Web site, Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. “He is speaking directly to his generation,” Ms. Margulies said. “This is his world.”With these bells and whistles comes the occasional accusation that his persona distracts from the music. “There are many people in my field who have tried to tell me what I should and shouldn’t do with Mozart or Beethoven, even to this day,” he said.But Mr. Perlman dismissed any idea that Hahn-Bin’s self-stylization is gimmickry. “It’s not like he is following a trend in classical music right now,” he said. “He is setting the trend.”At the Morgan, this trendsetting included three costume changes from the kimono: a Karl Lagerfeld-esque tuxedo with an oversize flower pin; an asymmetrical shirt dress with an eye mask made from feathers; and a boxy red blouse with a plunging V-neckline, accessorized with a pair of Jeremy Scott sunglasses and thigh-high Rick Owens boots.“Honestly, to get onstage and balance in my shoes is a lifetime achievement in of itself,” Hahn-Bin said. “Dancers have arms to help find their balance, but one of my arms, you see, is doing the most ridiculous things with the violin.”'"
"'11-02-24,'0','On Madison, it seems, the shop is all dressed up to role-play as Kiki de Montparnasse. The interior is black and classy. There are sumptuous dressing rooms with billowing silk curtains and cherry blossoms crawling up the walls. A sitting room is furnished with vampire-luxe Victorian club chairs. Murals sweep up the staircase: Aubrey Beardsley meets Edward Gorey in an evil garden full of nude Vargas pinups.The saleswomen still sport the old uniform: a tightly tailored pink shirtdress, black tights and pumps: equal parts sexy nurse, roller-skating waitress and lab assistant. It’s a look conveying the message: we’re licensed underwear technicians, here to aid your scientific research.The Madison inventory seems geared to undress women in a particular “Mad Men” fantasy, classic stuff that appeals to the stag-film-and-martini-marinated male. To wit: marabou peep-toe slippers; lace merry widows in ivory and red. No black leather, no latex. In short, it’s the stuff you buy the chorus girl with whom you are cheating on your proud Madison Avenue wife.Who, then (besides sex workers, for whom such dainties are, arguably, a professional expense), buys this tricked-out, candy-apple shellacked hot rod of outlandishly expensive yet adolescently cartoonish love for sale, on Madison Avenue? The women I saw seemed to want nothing more than to throw beige cashmere cardigans over these rococo brassieres. The store uncomfortably exposes people for their exact level of sexual maturity — or not.While I was trying to solve the labyrinthine conundrum of tiny straps on a red lace “playsuit” ($370), a dapper couple in their 50s walked in, all matching glen plaid and horn rims. “Look, $280 — for just the bra!” the woman squealed, too gamely.Her companion overcompensated by trying to act devil-may-care. The Russian beauty working the floor explained that the loftier Soirée collection was on the second floor (e.g., French lace nightie, $1,990).“Oh, so you work your way up to the luxury line?” he asked, too loudly, using the bra as a prop. “I guess that’s when you rip this one apart!”It was an uncomfortable moment — his cool was already blown, and so quickly. The saleswoman gave him a polite golf-chuckle.The main problem of the Madison Avenue Agent Provocateur: it’s on Madison Avenue, a shopping area for ladies-who-lunch of a certain age. I’m guessing that porn gear isn’t at the top of their shopping lists. It’s probably not even in the middle of their lists — and those are very long lists. In fact, chafing dishes, dog jewelry and even decorative pine cones would probably appear on most of their lists before pink leather spanking paddles.“I didn’t look good enough in these to pay that for them,” a 40-ish woman exiting a dressing room said, with a joyless giggle. “But I’ll be back!”I didn’t believe she’d be back. I doubt the saleslady believed it. She sounded as if she had seen her own shadow in that dressing room.BEAUTY is relative, certainly, and in the eye of the beholder. And men, bless them, can be amazingly dumb. A set of sequined pasties with tassels doing a double whirlybird is apt to get their attention on a slow afternoon, to say nothing of gilded handcuffs or seamed stockings that spell “Whip Me” in cursive on the calf ($70).Bottom line, girls: it ain’t fashion. Fashion is about glamour, which is about seduction, which is about intrigue, which is about suggestion. In this joint, all of fashion’s ingeniously composed double and triple entendres are burned down to one big fat entendre.I’d wrap it up for you, Johnny Dearest, but the only girl I know who wears anything that skimpy is my gun, and she only wears leather. Here’s where I beat it.'"
"'11-02-24,'0','Sohier and Brian Simmons, the deputy visa chief at the American Embassy in Caracas, said drunken driving was the most common criminal offense for ballplayers, with substance abuse issues, including the use of performance-enhancing drugs, close behind. And though neither transgression is in itself grounds for denying a visa, offenders must submit to a medical evaluation. A typical delay to sort it all out, consular officials say, is two to three weeks, though some cases can take much longer.Teams often appeal to immigration officials to help resolve or even to head off visa problems. Major League Baseball sometimes gets involved, too, and at the end of each season sends out a memo providing teams with immigration guidelines, alerting them to changes in the law and reminding them to file early for players who have criminal records.Still, some holdups result from mundane mistakes: clubs filing paperwork late, errors in the application process or players forgetting to renew passports or simply failing to show up for their interview.“We try to start the process early,” said Grace Guerrero Zwit, who handles visa issues as senior director for minor league operations for the Chicago White Sox, “but filing for the visa is like filing taxes: if you miss one box, it gets sent back; but they don’t call you, they’ll send it in the mail. Or if you miss a signature on one sheet, they’ll send it back.”The player most likely to miss significant time this season is the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Ronald Belisario, a reliever from Venezuela who was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving in 2009 and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving. Belisario has also been treated for substance abuse. This is the third year in a row that he has had problems getting a visa. His agent said recently that Belisario could miss all of 2011.Other crimes can have more serious consequences. In 2005, two pitching prospects for the Texas Rangers, Omar Beltre and Alexi Ogando, became ineligible for visas after taking part in a smuggling ring.“They got their visas and then they brought in people they claimed were their wives who really weren’t,” Sohier said.The two were barred from the United States until last year, when the embassy decided to support a waiver recommendation, which was ultimately granted by United States Customs and Border Protection.According to Lou Melendez, baseball’s vice president for international baseball operations, some visa delays are a result of an overall greater level of scrutiny given to ballplayers’ documents in the wake of numerous identity fraud scandals. One was that of a Nationals shortstop prospect, Carlos Alvarez, who in 2009 was found to have falsified his identity in order to appear four years younger before landing a lucrative contract.From 2003 until shortly after the Alvarez incident came to light, baseball recommended that each team conduct its own investigations before signing players. Some chose to do so, but others did not, so baseball intervened.“What we found in the D.R. was that it was too easy to alter documents, too easy for local officials to become complicit in fraud, so in July 2009 our department of investigations took over the process for all the teams,” Melendez said.Since that time, no Dominican player can sign a major league contract or obtain his visa until an investigation is complete. Still, the State Department is not outsourcing its antifraud detail to baseball — consular offices remain vigilant in vetting cases for potential instances of fraud, for players young and established.Moises Alou, who played in the majors for 17 years and now mentors young players as the general manager of Escogido in the Dominican League, believes that baseball executives have a double standard in recruiting, which puts pressure on players to appear younger than they are.“Scouts only want to sign Dominican guys at 16, and that’s part of the problem,” he said. “In the U.S. they’ll sign guys much older, but down here, a guy is seen as past his prime by 18, and it creates pressure on these guys.”Many baseball executives believe it has become more difficult for players and the agents who represent them, known as buscones, to commit identity fraud. But with millions of dollars at stake in a developing country where corruption is rife and poverty endemic, fraud is difficult to eliminate.“You still cannot trust many of these buscones,” Zwit of the White Sox said. “They find corrupt people at the schools and hospitals to falsify records.”Zwit said that a recent baseball investigation of a young Dominican player the White Sox hoped to sign revealed that he was a year older than they thought. The player, whom she would not identify, is now barred from signing a major league contract for one year.Despite all the potential visa pitfalls, most players do show up on time, and virtually none are denied visas outright. Most apply for visas that, according to United States law, require them to demonstrate that they do not intend to abandon their residence abroad. But in practice, no player is denied because a consular official notices that he has a high earned run average or a low batting average and thus might be cut from the team, presenting a visa overstay risk.“If the team wants a player, we will let them bring the player, assuming there are no criminal problems,” Sohier said.Zwit acknowledged that many Dominican players who are released do remain in the United States illegally.“After someone is released, I give them a few days to catch on with another club, but if they can’t, I have to inform D.H.S. that their visa is canceled, and then we have to book their ticket home,” Zwit said, referring to the Department of Homeland Security.She added: “But most of the time, they have to make a connection, and often they don’t make that connection. Can you blame them?”Zwit said last week that she believed that all of the White Sox’ international players would be in camp this week. “But until I get there, and see them all in person, you never know,” she said.'"
"'11-02-24,'0','WASHINGTON — President Obama , in a striking legal and political shift, has determined that the Defense of Marriage Act — the 1996 law that bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages — is unconstitutional, and has directed the Justice Department to stop defending the law in court, the administration said Wednesday.Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced the decision in a letter to members of Congress. In it, he said the administration was taking the extraordinary step of refusing to defend the law, despite having done so during Mr. Obama’s first two years in the White House.“The president and I have concluded that classifications based on sexual orientation” should be subjected to a strict legal test intended to block unfair discrimination, Mr. Holder wrote. As a result, he said, a crucial provision of the Defense of Marriage Act “is unconstitutional.”Conservatives denounced the shift, gay rights advocates hailed it as a watershed, and legal scholars said it could have far-reaching implications beyond the marriage law. For Mr. Obama, who opposes same-sex marriage but has said repeatedly that his views are “evolving,” there are political implications as well. Coming on the heels of his push for Congress to repeal the “don’t ask, don’t tell” law barring the military from allowing gay people to serve openly, the administration’s move seems likely to intensify the long-running cultural clash over same-sex marriage as the 2012 political campaign is heating up.“This is a great step by the Obama administration and a tipping point for the gay rights movement that will have ripple effects in contexts beyond the Defense of Marriage Act,” said Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “It will reach into issues of employment discrimination, family recognition and full equality rights for lesbian and gay people.”But some conservatives questioned Mr. Obama’s timing and accused him of trying to change the subject from spending cuts to social causes. Others portrayed the Justice Department’s abandonment of the Defense of Marriage Act as an outrageous political move that was legally unjustified.“It is a transparent attempt to shirk the department’s duty to defend the laws passed by Congress,” Representative Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. “This is the real politicization of the Justice Department — when the personal views of the president override the government’s duty to defend the law of the land.”While the issue at hand is whether gay couples in the eight states that already legally recognize same-sex marriage may be discriminated against by the federal government, the administration’s decision raised anew the more fundamental question of whether same-sex couples should have a right to marry.Mr. Obama takes a nuanced position on same-sex marriage, and the White House was careful to say on Wednesday that his position on that issue — he favors civil unions — remains unchanged. Many advocates of same-sex marriage, though, perceived the administration’s new legal stance as a signal that Mr. Obama would soon embrace their cause.Polls show the public is broadly supportive of equal rights for gay people — with the exception of the right to marry. Nearly 90 percent of Americans favor equality of opportunity in the workplace, and more than 60 percent favored overturning “don’t ask, don’t tell.” But the public remains evenly divided on same-sex marriage.Tobias B. Wolff, a University of Pennsylvania law professor who has advised Mr. Obama on gay rights issues, said Wednesday’s decision may have bought the president some time with gay rights leaders, many of whom have been deeply critical of his position on the marriage issue.“He has said that he has been struggling with the issue, and I think he has earned a certain benefit of the doubt,” Mr. Wolff said.But the move also sharpened criticism of Mr. Obama from the right. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said the shift was “clearly based more on politics than the law.”While Mr. Obama has called for Congress to repeal the marriage law, in court his administration has supported the constitutional right of Congress to enact such a measure. But his legal team was forced to take a second look at the sustainability of that position because of two recent lawsuits challenging the statute. The Justice Department must file responses to both suits by March 11.For technical reasons, it would have been far more difficult — both legally and politically — for the administration to keep arguing that the marriage law is constitutional in these new lawsuits. To assert that gay people do not qualify for extra legal protection against official discrimination, legal specialists say, the Justice Department would most likely have had to conclude that they have not been historically stigmatized and can change their orientation.The development floored Edith S. Windsor, an 81-year-old widow who filed one of the two new lawsuits in New York. Ms. Windsor is seeking the return of about $360,000 in estate taxes she had to pay because the federal government did not recognize their marriage when her wife died two years ago. The couple married in Toronto.'"
"'11-02-24,'0','WASHINGTON — As president of the American Chamber of Commerce of Nicaragua , Róger Arteaga Cano routinely dealt with business issues and trade practices affecting members like ExxonMobil or Citigroup. But he also led an unusual campaign: organizing secret meetings with opposition party leaders in an effort to oust President Daniel Ortega in an election this year.A former official in the previous government led by a rival party, Mr. Arteaga turned the chamber into a harsh critic of Mr. Ortega, the leftist Sandinista party leader and longtime adversary of the United States.On the group’s behalf, Mr. Arteaga issued fiery denunciations of the Nicaraguan government and its governing party, calling its policies unconstitutional and its style that of “gangsters” or “terrorists.” He briefed officials at the United States Embassy in Managua, the capital, and in Washington on his efforts to spur an effective challenge to Mr. Ortega, winning their tacit approval.The chamber’s activities over the past two years — detailed in interviews with Nicaraguan officials and business executives and in State Department cables obtained by WikiLeaks — illuminate the remarkable role the foreign affiliates of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sometimes play in the politics of their host nations. Occasionally, they are at odds with United States policy. But often, the chamber groups are so aligned with it that they appear to act as unofficial instruments to advance the American government’s goals.Created more than a century ago to promote the interests of American corporations, the groups — nicknamed AmChams — today operate in more than 100 countries. While many affiliates appear to restrict their activities to issues like opening access to government contracts or combating the counterfeiting of name-brand goods, others, like the Nicaraguan group, seek broader influence, echoing the role increasingly played in Washington by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.In Honduras, for example, executives at the American-affiliated chamber expressed support for the June 2009 coup d’état that forced out President José Manuel Zelaya, the State Department cables say. After leaders in the group applied pressure on the Obama administration, American officials retreated from their initial demands that Mr. Zelaya be allowed to return to power.In Taiwan, the chamber got into a nasty public dispute with a pro-independence party there, suggesting that the party was holding the island hostage to its belief that trade between China and Taiwan should be limited, the cables say.Kevin Casas-Zamora, who served as a minister of economic policy and second vice president of Costa Rica until 2007, said that overt political action by a United States-affiliated business group was almost always counterproductive.“It is a really bad idea, and it tends to backfire,” he said, noting that the logo for the American Chamber of Commerce of Nicaragua included the United States flag. “You are simply handing on a platter a rhetorical weapon that someone like Ortega will surely use against you.”Indeed, the political intervention embraced by Mr. Arteaga — he has just stepped down after his two-year term as the chamber’s president — has been denounced by the Nicaraguan government and other supporters of Mr. Ortega as unwelcome meddling by the United States.“Every time outside forces have sought to interfere in Nicaragua’s internal affairs, the result has been harmful to the Nicaraguan people,” Francisco Campbell, the Nicaraguan ambassador to the United States, said in an interview.Executives at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, who came under scrutiny last year for spending tens of millions of dollars on advertising that helped Republicans in the midterm Congressional elections, said it had played no role in instigating political activity by foreign chamber groups.“AmChams are independent of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in terms of the policies they advocate,” a chamber spokeswoman said in a statement. The United States chamber collects dues from its international members, and approves the creation of any new foreign affiliate.In 2009, when Mr. Arteaga took over as the unpaid president of the chamber in Nicaragua — his small consulting firm has a corporate client based in the United States, making him eligible for membership — he began challenging Mr. Ortega almost from the start. The former top federal tax official under a previous administration, Mr. Arteaga was driven by disdain for Mr. Ortega, who was elected in 2006, after serving as president from 1985 to 1990 and as a leader of the post-revolution junta from 1979 to 1985.'"
"'11-02-24,'0','Turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa continued to send stocks lower and oil prices up on Wednesday as crude operations were disrupted in Libya.Energy stocks rose almost 2 percent in the broader market, but other sectors vulnerable to turbulence in oil prices, like airlines, declined as crude traded around $100 a barrel.Investors are concerned about the effects on the global economic recovery if the unrest, which has already unseated governments in Tunisia and Egypt, is sustained or spreads to other critical suppliers like Saudi Arabia. With oil prices at a two-year high, some analysts say higher gasoline prices could bear down on consumers in the long term.The major indexes were dragged down for a second day.

"'11-02-24,'0','The indictment said that the four bankers also worked with three other banks to conceal the assets of wealthy Americans.Although the indictment did not name the three other banks, a person close to the matter identified them as Bank Leumi, the big Israeli bank; and Bank Frey and Maerki Baumann, two smaller Swiss private banks.The three other banks did not immediately respond to calls or e-mails for comment.Mr. Walker said Credit Suisse was not a target in the American investigation.The bank, which has been under investigation for about a year, could be heading toward a nonprosecution agreement with the Justice Department that would require it to pay a large fine, according to several tax lawyers with knowledge of this type of case.Another big Swiss bank, UBS, averted an indictment by entering into a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in 2009 over its sale of questionable offshore private banking services. The bank paid a $780 million fine.The indictment came on the same day that authorities in Germany raided offices and homes of four Credit Suisse employees in that country. The German investigation, which has been under way since last summer, initially focused on five others — four current bank employees and one former employee.“This is a very, very extensive investigation,” Ralf Möllmann, a prosecutor in Düsseldorf, Germany, said. He declined to speculate about how much longer the investigation would take.German prosecutors are looking into charges that Credit Suisse bankers helped German clients to evade taxes at home by keeping assets in Swiss bank accounts, Mr. Möllmann said. The prosecutor raided offices in the German cities of Hamburg, Hanover, Cologne, Frankfurt and two smaller locations, which Mr. Möllmann said he did not want to name because it could give away the identity of the people under investigation.Marc Dosch, a spokesman in Zurich for Credit Suisse, said the bank was aware of the raids. The people at the center of the investigation continue to be employed by the bank and Credit Suisse was “of course fully cooperating” with prosecutors, he said.The raids follow the news Monday of the arrest in New York of Christos Bagios, a senior private banker at Credit Suisse, in connection with a federal investigation into the bank’s work with questionable offshore accounts, according to two people briefed on the matter. Mr. Möllmann said he did not know about that arrest and that his office was currently not working with the United States on the investigation.The Swiss banking industry benefited for decades from its reputation as a safe and discreet haven for the rich around the world. But that was shaken around 2010 when the Swiss government agreed to work with other countries on investigating possible tax evasion cases.The indictment and people briefed on the matter said that Mr. Adami, a citizen of Italy who lives in Switzerland, had worked with high-net worth North American clients at Credit Suisse from 1994 until the present, and managed three other private bankers with similar clientele.Mr. Agustoni, a citizen of Switzerland, is a former Credit Suisse private banker who then worked as an assistant vice president at the two other Swiss banks, according to the indictment and the people briefed on the matter.Mr. Bergantino, a citizen and resident of Switzerland, worked for Credit Suisse from about 1982 to 2009. Mr. Schaerer, a Swiss citizen and resident of the United States, was a director and senior representative of Credit Suisse’s New York representative office.The bankers worked on behalf of 17 clients, including two in Beverly Hills, Calif. — one an Iranian national — and several in New Jersey and New York, to set up offshore accounts with fictitious names and sham entities to evade taxes. Some of the bankers met the clients in the Bahamas, Paris and elsewhere, and at hotels in New York and Los Angeles.The work involved shifting client money from Credit Suisse accounts to the smaller Swiss private banks and in providing offshore credit cards whose activity could not be detected by the I.R.S., the indictment said.Most of the work took place over the last decade or so, though one account was opened in 1953, it said.The charges signal that the authorities are rapidly broadening their investigation of offshore banks of all sizes that sell private banking services that allow wealthy American clients to evade taxes.The investigation of UBS hurt the bank’s reputation, and many clients of its private bank took their money elsewhere.After the UBS case, the Justice Department started a broad investigation of offshore banking activities, including some Swiss cantonal banks, as well as HSBC, one of Britain’s largest lenders, which also offers private banking services in Switzerland and elsewhere.Last month, Rudolf M. Elmer, a former executive at the Swiss bank Julius Baer, gave WikiLeaks a disc that he said included details of more than 2,000 prominent individuals and companies that had engaged in tax evasion. WikiLeaks has yet to publish any of the details.'"
"'11-02-24,'0','BAIDA, Libya — As rebellion crept closer to the capital and defections of military officers multiplied, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi called on thousands of mercenaries and irregular security forces on Wednesday to defend his bastion in Tripoli, in what residents said was a desperate and dangerous turn in the week-old uprising.Distrustful of even his own generals, Colonel Qaddafi has for years quietly built up this ruthless and loyal force. It is made up of special brigades headed by his sons, segments of the military loyal to his native tribe and its allies, and legions of African mercenaries he has helped train and equip. Many are believed to have fought elsewhere, in places like Sudan, but he has now called them back.Witnesses said thousands of members of this irregular army were massing on roads to the capital, Tripoli, where one resident described scenes evocative of anarchic Somalia: clusters of heavily armed men in mismatched uniforms clutching machine guns and willing to carry out orders to kill Libyans that other police and military units, and even fighter pilots, have refused.Some residents of Tripoli said they took the gathering army as a sign that the uprising might be entering a decisive stage, with Colonel Qaddafi fortifying his main stronghold in the capital and protesters there gearing up for their first organized demonstration after days of spontaneous rioting and bloody crackdowns.The fall of other cities to rebels on Wednesday, including Misurata, 130 miles east of the capital, left Colonel Qaddafi more embattled — and his opponents emboldened.“A message comes to every mobile phone about a general protest on Friday in Tripoli,” one resident of Tripoli said. Colonel Qaddafi’s menacing speech to the country on Tuesday — when he vowed to hunt down opponents “house by house” — increased their determination “100 percent,” the resident said.Dozens of checkpoints operated by a combination of foreign mercenaries and plainclothes militiamen lined the road west of Tripoli for the first time, witnesses said, requiring not only the presentation of official papers but also displays of flag-waving, fist-pumping enthusiasm for Colonel Qaddafi, who has long fashioned himself as a pan-African icon.“You are trying to convince them you are a loyalist,” one resident said, “and the second they realize that you are not, you are done for.”The overall death toll so far has been impossible to determine. Human rights groups say they have confirmed about 300 deaths, though witnesses suggested the number was far larger. On Wednesday, Franco Frattini, the foreign minister of Italy — the former colonial power with longstanding ties — said that nationwide more than 1,000 people were probably dead in the strife.Egyptian officials said Wednesday that nearly 30,000 people — mostly Egyptians working in Libya — had fled across their border. People fleeing west into Tunisia said the rebellion was now taking off far from its origins just a week ago in the eastern city of Benghazi, Libya’s second largest city, which fell over the weekend.There were reports for the first time of protests in the southern city of Sabha, considered a Qaddafi stronghold.On Wednesday, in addition to the northwestern city of Misurata, protesters claimed victory in nearby Zawai, where local army units are said to have joined them. Some said there had been intense fighting in the past few nights in the town of Sabratha, home of an important Roman archaeological site 50 miles west of Tripoli, where witnesses on Wednesday reported a heavy deployment of machine-gun toting foreign mercenaries and Qaddafi loyalists known as revolutionary committees.“The revolutionary committees are trying to kill everyone who is against Qaddafi,” said a doctor fleeing Sabratha, declining to give his name for fear of reprisals if he returned.But amid spreading rebellion and growing defections by top officials, diplomats and segments of the regular army, Colonel Qaddafi’s preparations for a defense of Tripoli also reframed the question of who might still be enforcing his rule. It is a puzzle that military analysts say reflects the singular character of the society he has shaped — half tribal, half police state — for the past 41 years.“It is all shadow and mirrors and probably a great deal of corruption as well,” said Paul Sullivan, a professor at Georgetown who has studied the Libyan military.Colonel Qaddafi, who took power in a military coup, has always kept the Libyan military too weak and divided to do the same thing to him. About half its relatively small 50,000-member army is made up of poorly trained and unreliable conscripts, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.'"

"'11-02-25,'1','YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn on Friday ruled out a merger between Renault and Nissan, the two auto giants he heads, but said he would review the capital structure of the partnership after pressure from investors in the struggling French car maker.The issue of Renault’s (RENA.PA) capital tied up in Nissan Motor (7201.T) has become a major talking point in the financial market, which was disappointed that Renault’s six-year business plan, announced this month, lacked a more immediate catalyst to free up cash for the company’s growth.In an interview with Reuters at Nissan’s headquarters in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, Ghosn professed to being surprised at the level of expectation for a structural change, saying the issue would be addressed, hopefully within three years.“We will be reviewing the financial structure not to end up with a merger ... but to respond to the main concern of investors saying, ‘Maybe you’re using too much capital for your financial structure,'” Ghosn, the CEO of both Renault and Nissan, said.“Hopefully it will come before (the halfway point of the Renault business plan through 2016).”Investors have punished Renault shares since the February 10 announcement, with the stock falling almost 10 percent since then.Some analysts were disappointed with the plan, saying the current alliance structure was inefficient and the companies would benefit from much closer business ties, including a merger.After Ghosn’s comments, Renault shares were trading up 1.4 percent in Paris.He did not elaborate on the new structure, but some analysts have suggested an outright merger while others say a divestment of part of Renault’s 43.4 percent stake in Nissan -- worth about $20 billion -- would make sense. Renault only needs one-third of Nissan to retain a controlling stake in it.Nissan holds 15 percent of Renault, which has a total market capitalization of around $18 billion.“You have to study all the consequences,” Ghosn said, calling the market’s dissatisfaction with the capital structure his biggest challenge.“This is a very delicate balance between the two companies. You need something that makes all the shareholders happy, both at Renault and Nissan,” he said.'"

"'11-02-25,'1','The sharpest reaction came from Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, in an interview here during a stop to promote his new book, who called the administration’s decision “utterly inexplicable.”A few years ago, the president’s decision might have set off an intense national debate about gay rights. But the Republicans’ reserved response this week suggests that Mr. Obama may suffer little political damage as he evolves from what many gay rights leaders saw as a lackluster defender of their causes into a far more aggressive advocate.“The wedge has lost its edge,” said Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist who worked for President George W. Bush during his 2004 campaign, when gay marriage ballot measures in a dozen states helped turn out conservative voters.Mr. Obama’s move provoked some outrage, especially among evangelical Christians and conservative groups like the Family Research Council. In a statement Wednesday, Tony Perkins, president of the council, condemned the president’s decision as pandering.But Republican strategists and gay rights activists said on Thursday that the issue’s power as a political tool for Republican candidates is diminishing. While surveys suggest that Americans are evenly divided on whether the federal government should recognize gay marriages, opposition has fallen from nearly 70 percent in 1996.Prominent Republicans like Dick Cheney, the former vice president, and Barbara Bush, daughter of the former president, have defended the right of gays to marry. And Mr. Obama has been emboldened by the largely positive response to his recent, and successful, push for Congress to repeal “don’t ask, don’t tell,” the military’s ban on gays serving openly.At the same time, the rise of the Tea Party movement, and the success that Republicans had last year in attacking Democratic candidates on economic issues, has pushed the debate over abortion and gay rights to the back burner.“I don’t think this is the issue that it once was,” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. “I think that the economic issues are so big that this one pales in comparison.”In his first two years in office, Mr. Obama drew criticism from gay rights advocates who thought he was dragging his feet on their issues. Those same advocates see the shift as evidence that with an eye on the 2012 campaign, the president has calculated that the benefits of responding to his base outweigh the risks of upsetting conservatives who wouldn’t be voting for him anyway.Among them is John Aravosis, the founder of Americablog.com, who in a 2009 blog post called the administration’s first legal brief in a Defense of Marriage Act case “despicable” and “homophobic.” Mr. Aravosis said on Thursday he is “much happier” with Mr. Obama, adding: “I think the gay community got to him. I’m not convinced we got to his heart, but I think we got to his political head.”Others, like Kerry Eleveld, editor of EqualityMatters.org, a new Web site, say Mr. Obama appears to be evaluating the politics of gay rights issues differently since the positive response to the don’t ask, don’t tell repeal from people on the political left, many of whom have criticized him over issues like health care, climate change and immigration.“He got this big bump from it in terms of the progressive base, and didn’t get a whole lot of heat, and I think that has given him a little more heart in feeling like L.G.B.T. issues aren’t as toxic as a lot of people have been painting them for the past 20 years,” she said.While Mr. Obama has changed his legal position on the Defense of Marriage Act, his personal views on same-sex marriage — he opposes it, but favors civil unions — have not changed, the White House says.A big question is whether they will. Mr. Obama has said his views are “evolving,” and some expect he will announce his support for same-sex marriage as he campaigns for re-election. But that could complicate Mr. Obama’s efforts to appeal beyond his liberal base.“It’s still part of Obama’s record now,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist, who has advised Mr. Romney. “It’s one where it looks like he’s changing his position.”'"
"'11-02-25,'1','While there are those who will insist that this is not the right time for a reversal of the Defense of Marriage Act, it is important to remember that there is never, ever, a wrong time to do away with discrimination, whether officially sanctioned or otherwise.Our president has clearly earned the thanks of every fair-minded citizen.The writer is a former president of the PEN American Center.Like most Americans, I periodically receive a statement of estimated benefits from the Social Security Administration. And like all gay Americans, I read the lines that detail spousal payments knowing full well that no spouse of mine will ever see a dime from the federal government, no matter how much of my salary has been diverted for just such a purpose. It is always a sad reminder that I am not quite a citizen of the country I love.So I would like to thank Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. His decision not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court sets the stage for a day when I might open these statements and feel fully a member of the American family.While delighted by the change, I add the Obama administration’s shift on the so-called Defense of Marriage Act to the long list of disappointments this president has chalked up.While Attorney General Eric H.

"'11-02-25,'1','“We’ve gone beyond responding to the sort of brutal Technicolor of the crisis in Libya,” said Daniel H. Yergin, the oil historian and chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. “There’s also a strong element of fear of what’s next, and what’s next after next.”Before the outbreak of violence in Libya, the Federal Reserve had raised its forecast for United States growth in 2011, and a stronger stock market had helped consumers be more confident about the future and more willing to spend.But other sources of economic uncertainty besides oil prices have come into sharper focus in recent days. After a few false starts, housing prices have slid further. New-home sales dropped sharply in January, as did sales of big-ticket items like appliances, the government reported Thursday.Though the initial panic from last year has faded, Europe’s deep debt problems remain, creating another wild card for the global economy. Protests turned violent in Greece this week in response to new austerity measures.Budget and debt problems at all levels of American government also threaten to crimp the domestic recovery. Struggling state and local governments may dismiss more workers this year as many face their deepest shortfalls since the economic downturn began, and a Congressional stalemate over the country’s budget could even lead to a federal government shutdown.“The irony is that we just barely got ourselves up and off the ground from the devastating financial crisis,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, who had been optimistic about the country’s prospects. “The recovery itself is less than two years in, and we haven’t yet seen jobs make a decent comeback. Now we’re being hit with this new, very ominous event, so the timing couldn’t be worse.”Most economists are not yet talking about the United States dipping back into recession, and it is too soon to tell how far the pro-democracy protests that have roiled Egypt, Bahrain and Libya will spread. For now, most analysts are not predicting that Iran and Saudi Arabia, repressive governments that also happen to be two of the world’s biggest oil producers, will catch the revolutionary fever.“But revolutions are notoriously difficult to forecast,” said Chris Lafakas, an economist at Moody’s Analytics who focuses on energy. Disruptions of oil supplies in Saudi Arabia and Iran in particular, he said, “would be catastrophic for prices. Saudi Arabia alone could cause maybe a 20 to 25 percent increase in oil prices overnight.”In the last week, oil prices have risen more than 10 percent and even breached $100 a barrel. A sustained $10 increase in oil prices would shave about two-tenths of a percentage point off economic growth, according to Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital. The Federal Reserve had forecast last week that the United States economy would grow by 3.4 to 3.9 percent in 2011, up from 2.9 percent last year.Higher oil prices restrain growth because they translate to higher fuel prices for consumers and businesses. Mr. Lafakas estimates that oil prices are on track to average $90 a barrel in 2011, from $80 in 2010, an increase that would offset nearly a quarter of the $120 billion payroll tax cut that Congress had intended to stimulate the economy this year.Rising gasoline prices have already led Jayme Webb, an office manager at a recycling center in Sioux City, Iowa, and her husband, Ken, who works at Wal-Mart, to cut back on spending.In the last month, they have canceled their satellite television subscription and their Internet service. They have also stopped driving from their home in rural Moville to Sioux City on weekends to see Ms. Webb’s parents.Along with making their commutes to work more expensive, rising oil prices have driven up the cost of food for animals and people. So the couple have stopped buying feed for their dozen sheep and goats and six chickens and instead asked neighboring farmers to let them use scraps from their corn fields.“It’s a struggle,” said Ms. Webb, 49. “We have to watch every little penny.”A cutback in consumer spending reverberates through the economy by crimping businesses, making it less likely that employers will commit to the additional hiring needed to lower the 9 percent unemployment rate.“Revenue is down, costs are up, and you can’t make any money,” said R. Jerol Kivett, the owner of Kivett’s Inc., a company that manufactures pews and other church furniture in Clinton, N.C. “You’re just trying to meet payroll and keep people working, hoping the economy will turn. But it just seems like setback after setback after setback.”And the money that consumers and businesses spend on oil often does not stay within the American economy. Nor do the expanded coffers in oil-producing countries raise demand for American exports, because they often bank it as reserves.“The countries that are getting this bonus basically get an enormous benefit,” said Raghuram G. Rajan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago. “But if they can’t spend it quickly, it doesn’t add to aggregate demand.”The rise in oil prices could also create a vicious cycle, as higher energy costs propel already rising food prices, which in turn can lead to more political unrest and more global uncertainty.Even without the Middle East, the domestic economy has a number of weaknesses that have proved hard to overcome. The recession was provoked by housing and worsened by housing, and housing is likely to remain frail in parts of the country until the end of the decade.After a couple of brief growth spurts, home prices have started declining again in earnest.This week, the Yale economist Robert Shiller speculated about another drop as large as 25 percent. Anything close to that would push millions more households to the point where they owe more on their houses than the houses are worth, generating a lot of sour moods — which can depress consumer spending — more foreclosures and potential job losses.Even absent such a decline, lenders remain cautious, punishing those who never indulged during the boom.Maria Schneider and Roger Westerman have plenty of equity in their Brooklyn home, and a 17-year record of paying on time. Last fall, the couple tried to capitalize on historically low mortgage rates and refinance.They estimated they would save $360 a month. But their lender said they were a bad credit risk. The couple, both 48, are self-employed.“We could be sending all three of our kids to camp this summer instead of just one,” Mrs. Schneider said.There are some signs that the economy could weather this latest round of buffeting. Revenue at many companies is back to prerecession levels, said Scott Bohannon, a general manager at the Corporate Executive Board, a research and advisory firm. That suggests companies may start adding equipment, factories and, eventually, workers.“Of course, if a war breaks out in a significant way or something like that happens,” he said, “then I would give you a different answer. Then you’re talking about huge shocks to the system.”'"
"'11-02-25,'1','Harvard and Princeton each announced Thursday that they would revive their early-admission programs, allowing high school seniors who apply by next Nov. 15 to get a decision by Dec. 15 without having to promise to attend the college if admitted.In September 2006, when both universities decided to eliminate early admissions for those starting college in 2008, Harvard and Princeton said they wanted to start a trend that would help even the playing field between wealthy applicants and those who needed to compare financial-aid offers from different colleges. But only the University of Virginia followed their lead — and it announced last year that it would reinstate early admissions.“In eliminating our early program four years ago, we hoped other colleges and universities would do the same, and they haven’t,” said Shirley M. Tilghman, Princeton’s president. “One consequence is that some students who really want to make their college decision as early as possible in their senior year apply to other schools early, even if their first choice is Princeton.”Meanwhile, with the economic downturn, a growing number of applicants sought early admission, leading the universities who had abandoned their programs to lose out on some top students.“The very people we were targeting, people from modest economic backgrounds, were sent into a high state of anxiety and uncertainty by the economy and it reached the point where, this past year, record numbers of people were applying early,” said William R. Fitzsimmons, Harvard’s dean of admissions. “At many high schools it was very common to have 60, 70, 80 percent of the students applying early, and we heard rumors that in some cases, it went up to 100 percent.”'"
"'11-02-25,'1','Critics say that removing teachers is nearly impossible because of the obstructions that unions have put up. Administrators also bear some blame. Most evaluations are perfunctory — a drive-by classroom observation by a vice principal — and hearings to prove incompetence can be long and costly.In Ms. Weingarten’s proposal, which she presented at a meeting of union leaders and researchers in Washington on Thursday night, teachers would be evaluated using multiple yardsticks, including classroom visits, appraisal of lesson plans and student improvement on tests.Teachers rated unsatisfactory would be given a detailed “improvement plan” jointly devised by school administrators and experienced master teachers.Some improvement plans — like maintaining better classroom order — could last a month. Others would take a full school year. The results would be considered separately by administrators and the peer experts, whose judgments would be sent to a neutral arbitrator.The arbitrator would be required to decide within 100 days whether to keep or fire the teacher.Ms. Weingarten said the process represented a major advance over current systems, which do not include detailed improvement plans and often end up in tortured hearings “litigating the teacher’s competency.”“We have figured out an operational blueprint so people can’t use tenure as an excuse anymore not to engage in legitimate evaluations of teachers,” she said in an interview.Kati Haycock, president of the Education Trust, which seeks to narrow the achievement gap for poor students in part by raising teacher quality, said, “The overall proposal is a big step forward.”But, she added, only school administrators should create improvement plans for a poorly rated teacher; otherwise, unions might use the process to obstruct their removal.Michael J. Petrilli, vice president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education policy group, agreed. “In any other field,” he said, “this would be considered completely nuts that a manager would not have rights and responsibilities to evaluate their employees and take action.”He added that the proposal did not address the most pressing issue: how to lay off thousands of teachers because of budget cutbacks without losing promising newer teachers.“Her strategy of making sure all teachers who get a negative review will get a year and 100 days, it strikes me as a delaying tactic,” he said.Ms. Weingarten responded that if a rational evaluation process were in place, ineffective teachers would be weeded out naturally.“All these folks now really concerned about layoffs of newer teachers never spent a minute talking about how to keep good teachers in our profession,” she said.'"

"'11-02-25,'1','Lawmakers from Washington State, where Boeing assembles a substantial portion of its planes, had complained that the Pentagon had given EADS extra time to bid and had put in place several evaluation rules that seemed to favor the European company, which had submitted its bid through a North American subsidiary.And the choice could still face opposition from lawmakers on the Gulf Coast, who were counting on EADS’s promise to build an assembly plant in Mobile, Ala., that would have created thousands of jobs.“I’m disappointed but not surprised,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said. “Only Chicago politics could tip the scales in favor of Boeing’s inferior plane. EADS clearly offers the more capable aircraft. If this decision stands, our warfighters will not get the superior equipment they deserve.”Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, called the decision “a major victory for the American workers, the American aerospace industry and America’s military.”In a phone interview from her state, she said, “Everybody here is ecstatic. Our economy has been struggling, and this is a good news announcement that we really needed.”EADS had contended that its plane was bigger and better. EADS had also lined up companies from other politically important states, like Ohio, to supply parts.The company has 10 days to decide whether to protest the decision. But it gave no indication of its plans in a statement Thursday. EADS said only that it was concerned that the Air Force had selected a “high-risk, concept aircraft” over its “proven, more capable” refueling tanker.Under the contract, Boeing will eventually build 14 planes a year at plants in Washington and Kansas. The victory will also enable the company to keep open the 767 production line at its assembly plant in Everett, Wash.EADS’s confidence that it could win the competition stemmed partly from the success that its A330 series had in commercial sales over Boeing’s 767 jetliners. And Boeing had planned to phase out the 767 when its new 787 Dreamliner is ready for delivery.The contract, which could be the largest awarded for many years as military budgets tighten, could eventually reach $100 billion. The tankers are like flying gas stations. They transfer fuel in mid-flight to fighters, bombers and cargo planes.Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said the victory could also help Boeing in its battle with Airbus in their much larger fight over sales of passenger jets and freighters.If EADS had won the tanker contract, it planned to eventually assemble commercial freighter planes at the plant in Mobile, giving it a manufacturing foothold that could help expand other sales in the United States.And with sharp budget cuts in Europe, “EADS also faces a home defense market that is imploding like a black hole,” Mr. Aboulafia said. “So it was imperative that they get this contract.”The award could signal the end of a long and often embarrassing effort by the Air Force to replace its aging tankers, which date to the Eisenhower and Kennedy years.The bidding represented the service’s third attempt to obtain new tankers since 2001. The first effort collapsed after Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, blew the whistle on corruption involving an airplane-leasing proposal with Boeing.Northrop Grumman and EADS then won in 2008, only to have government auditors block the award after Boeing protested that the evaluation had been too subjective.Northrop dropped out last year, prompting the Pentagon to extend the bid deadline to give EADS more time out of concern that Boeing could charge a higher price if it were the only bidder.Boeing had complained that EADS could rely on subsidies from European governments to undercut Boeing’s price or to absorb losses if it won the contract with a low bid. Boeing’s concerns were heightened after a World Trade Organization panel concluded last year that Airbus could not have fielded all its models, including the A330 series, when it did without the subsidies.Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., had said it would be hard for Boeing to match EADS’s price while still meeting shareholder expectations for a reasonable profit.And at an investment conference this month, Mr. McNerney described Boeing’s final offer as “an aggressive but responsible bid.” He also told the investors: “I think the people in this room would be glad if we won at the bid level we put in and would be happy if we lost at a lower level.”Under the proposed leasing deal in 2001, the Air Force would have paid Boeing over $20 billion for 100 tankers, or more than $200 million a plane. Northrop Grumman has said that the bids fell to around $184 million in 2008. Most analysts thought they could come in 5 to 10 percent below that this time, and that Boeing would have to accept low profit margins to win the contract.But Boeing’s triumph could also irritate European leaders. And it could set back Pentagon efforts to encourage bids from foreign companies to create more competition and bring down the cost of weapons systems.The mayor of Mobile, Samuel L. Jones, said city officials had been confident that EADS would win. “It’s very, very disappointing,” he said, “especially since we had won this competition in 2008.”'"
"'11-02-25,'1','But individually and in aggregate, all four drinks speak to how cleverly allusive cocktails can be and illustrate the kind of thought processes that go into their making. Even if none of them suits your fancy — the recipes are all on The Times’s Web site, where there’s also a video providing glimpses of their assembly — one or more may well give you ideas of your own or lead you back to a classic that seems just right for that unfailingly electric moment when the best song victor is revealed.Let’s start with the Natalie, which fell to Eamon Rockey, the general manager of Compose, a new restaurant and bar in TriBeCa. I e-mailed these instructions to him:“This assignment should be a cakewalk. Make that a cake prance. Tutus, feathers, anorexia, pregnancy, an intergalactic princess who has also done time on the pole — between Natalie’s character in the movie, Natalie the mother-to-be and Natalie’s past roles, there’s an awful lot to work with. Duality! You’ve got that, too! I have it on good authority that the working title of ‘Black Swan’ was ‘Dance of the Doppelgängers,’ but a studio head nixed it. Said it sounded like German animation or something.”Mr. Rockey took the feathers part to heart. His Natalie not only included frothed egg white — the indirect bequest of a bird — but also involved a feathery design on its surface. As for duality, the drink had discernible layers: the top white one and, below it, a well of dark red. Mr. Rockey accomplished this by using a funnel to channel red wine into the bottom of the drink.“An incredibly complex character demands an incredibly complex cocktail,” he told me as he made it, using not only the wine and egg white but also what he called “a very pretty gin,” befitting a ballerina, along with Triple Sec, gum syrup, lemon juice and Angostura bitters.Did I mention the absinthe mist? I liked that touch, suggestive of madness, which is a central theme of “Black Swan.” The absinthe also connected the drink to a classic that Mr. Rockey was deliberately using as a springboard, the Corpse Reviver No. 2. Another of the movie’s major themes, he noted, is rebirth.To capture James Franco in “127 Hours” was the task of Demetrios Saites, who tends bar at the Hurricane Club near Madison Square Park.“I’m not one to micromanage or plant suggestions,” I wrote to him, “but I could, for example, foresee a situation in which the drink you come up with isn’t on the rocks, plural, but something with one big rock. And is that a gherkin I see under it, wriggling to be free?”Mr. Saites did me one better. Instead of putting a block of ice in the drink, he put a smooth black stone that had spent time in the freezer and performed the same function.He created a cocktail in two parts: the main drink, which had that stone, and a coconut-flavored chaser of sorts, in a shot glass. The main drink combined gold rum, lemon juice, tea, cocoa nibs and Thai chili and bitters to produce what he said he intended to be “the hue of the desert,” a nod to the movie’s setting. The tea, caffeinated, was an oblique reference to the peppy schedule Mr. Franco keeps as actor, writer, student and more.“He seems like an energetic guy,” Mr. Saites said. And the plight of his “127 Hours” character was captured by presenting two drinks in one. Hydration-deprived, the character would want all the fluid he could get.What would Mr. Renner’s character in “The Town” want? Or what would do that character justice?“It had to be dark, stirred, bitter and a little strong,” said Leo Robitschek, the head bartender at the elegant restaurant Eleven Madison Park, noting that Mr. Renner played a tormented, tormenting hothead. So Mr. Robitschek came up with something along the lines of a Manhattan, though in place of bitters he used Cynar, a bitter Italian liqueur made with artichoke and a bevy of herbs.And this Manhattan manqué arrived by way of Boston, where “The Town” is set. To reflect that city’s Celtic pride, Mr. Robitschek used Jameson Irish whiskey in the drink, which could be relatively simply reproduced by the neophyte mixologist at home.So could the cocktail conceived by Meaghan Dorman in honor of Ms. Bonham Carter’s performance in “The King’s Speech.”Ms. Dorman, the head bartender at Raines Law Room, near Union Square, said she based her drink loosely on one called the Self-Starter, as described in “The Savoy Cocktail Book,” named for the regal British hotel.For a base she used gin, solidifying that British association, and to that she added apricot liqueur, for sweetness.“She’s amazingly sweet in the movie,” Ms. Dorman said, referring to Ms. Bonham Carter’s character, “really looking after her family and her husband and kind of being a self-starter and going out of the royal bubble.”The drink’s other main component is Cocchi Americano, an aperitif wine similar to Kina Lillet. And because the drink is meant to be “elegant, like a lady,” Ms. Dorman said, it is stirred rather than shaken.“Stirred drinks are really silky,” Ms. Dorman observed, adding that hers “looks like a pearl” and the actress “was wearing pearls.” So she was, and so can you, as you draw sustenance from the Helena and experience the Oscar-caliber elation that she — or, for that matter, the Natalie, the James and the Jeremy — can bring.'"
"'11-02-25,'1','The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down almost 300 points in the two previous days of trading, lost 37.28 points, or 0.31 percent, at 12,068.50. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 1.30 points, or 0.10 percent, at 1,306.10 and the Nasdaq gained 14.91 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,737.90.In London, the FTSE 100 dropped 3.55 points, while the CAC-40 in Paris declined 3.48 points. The DAX shed 0.89 percent, or 64.10 points, in Frankfurt. Most Asian markets closed lower on Thursday.This week, companies halted oil and gas production in Libya, and economists said investors and businesses in the non-oil sector elsewhere, like retailers and manufacturers, were trying to assess how the unrest would affect future costs and operations.The chief financial officer of Procter & Gamble, J. R. Moeller, said Thursday that the company, which has factories in Egypt, expected to raise prices this year to absorb higher commodity costs. Procter & Gamble fell 1.7 percent to $63.05.Retailers were concerned about how much consumers would be able to spend on clothing or discretionary goods, for example, if food and gas prices soared. Hospitality companies feared higher prices at the pump would damp travel.“Everybody is trying to juggle all these variables,” Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, said in a phone interview.On Wall Street, energy stocks led the declining sectors on the broader market. Companies with operations in international oilfield services fell. Schlumberger closed at $89.65 and Halliburton was down to $45.55. Each declined more than 3 percent.Refiners also absorbed some of the volatility as crude prices rose. Tesoro was down 5.35 percent at $23.01, and Valero Energy fell 3.42 percent, to $26.80.Mr. Youngberg said there was some profit-taking in the energy sector and concerns over whether the higher energy costs would hurt consumer demand, especially if gasoline prices kept rising toward $4 a gallon.General Motors, which reported $4.7 billion in earnings in 2010 declined nearly 5 percent to $33.02.Consumers in the United States will probably feel the price increase at the pump more quickly and directly than their European counterparts, where a much higher portion of that price is in taxes — about 80 percent in some countries.Various economic data released in the United States on Thursday did not sway investors.The weekly unemployment data, showed that the number of laid-off workers applying for unemployment benefits dropped by 22,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 391,000.That figure was encouraging, Mr. Baumohl said in a research note. “But we have to wonder whether it will be sustained if employers begin to question the future strength of the recovery.”The latest housing data, however, was weaker than expected. New single family home sales fell 12.6 percent in January, the Commerce Department said, to a 284,000 unit seasonally adjusted annual rate.Jason D. Pride, the director of investment strategy at Glenmede, said the data might have been better received had it not been for the drag on sentiment from concerns over the Middle East.The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 10/32, to 101 15/32. The yield fell 3.45 percent, from 3.48 percent late Wednesday.'"
"'11-02-25,'1','BENGHAZI, Libya — Rebels seeking to overturn the 40-year rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi repelled a concerted assault by his forces on Thursday on cities close to the capital, removing any doubt that Libya ’s patchwork of protests had evolved into an increasingly well-armed revolutionary movement.The series of determined stands by rebel forces on Thursday — especially in the strategic city of Zawiyah, near important oil resources and 30 miles from the capital, Tripoli — presented the gravest threat yet to the Libyan leader. In Zawiyah, more than 100 people were killed as Colonel Qaddafi’s forces turned automatic weapons on a mosque filled with protesters, a witness said. Still, residents rallied afterward.Colonel Qaddafi’s evident frustration at the resistance in Zawiyah spilled out in a rant by telephone over the state television network charging that Osama bin Laden had drugged the town’s youth into a rebellious frenzy.“Al Qaeda is the one who has recruited our sons,” he said in a 30-minute tirade broadcast by the network. “It is bin Laden.”Colonel Qaddafi said, “Those people who took your sons away from you and gave them drugs and said ‘Let them die’ are launching a campaign over cellphones against your sons, telling them not to obey their fathers and mothers.”The violence on Thursday underscored the contrast between the character of Libya’s revolution and the uprising that toppled autocrats in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia. Unlike those Facebook-enabled youth rebellions, the insurrection here has been led by people who are more mature and who have been actively opposing the government for some time. It started with lawyers’ syndicates that have campaigned peacefully for two years for a written constitution and some semblance of a rule of law.Fueled by popular anger, the help of breakaway leaders of the armed forces and some of their troops, and weapons from looted military stockpiles or smuggled across the border, the uprising here has escalated toward more violence in the face of increasingly brutal government crackdowns.At the revolt’s starting point, in the eastern city of Benghazi, Fathi Terbil, 39, the human rights lawyer whose detention first ignited the protests, drew a map of rebel-held territory in striking distance of Tripoli. “It is only a matter of days,” he said.A turning point in the uprising’s evolution was arguably the defection of the interior minister, Abdel Fattah Younes al-Abidi, an army general who had been a close ally of Colonel Qaddafi.The break by General Abidi, who has family roots near the revolt’s eastern origins, encouraged other disaffected police, military and state security personnel to change sides as well. “We are hoping to use his experience,” said Mr. Terbil, who some called the linchpin of the revolt.Opposition figures in rebel-held cities like Benghazi have been appearing on cable news channels promising that opponents of Colonel Qaddafi are heading toward Tripoli to bolster the resistance there. Their ability to carry out those assertions remains to be seen.In parts of the country, the revolutionaries, as they call themselves, appear to have access to potentially large stores of weapons, including small arms and heavy artillery, automatic weapons smuggled from the Egyptian border and rocket-propelled grenades taken from army bases, like the Kabila in Benghazi.Tawfik al-Shohiby, one of the rebels, said that in the early days of the revolt one of his relatives bought $75,000 in automatic weapons from arms dealers on the Egyptian border and distributed them to citizens’ groups in towns like Bayda.So far, at least in the east, many of the weapons appear to be held in storage to defend against a future attempt by Colonel Qaddafi’s forces to retake the territory. At a former security services building in Benghazi on Thursday, men in fatigues prepared to transport anti-aircraft and antitank weapons to what one said was a storage depot.Like their counterparts in Tunisia and Egypt, the rebels in Libya have shown tech-savvy guile in circumventing government efforts to block their communication. To sidestep the government’s blocking of the Internet and curbing of cellphone access, for example, some of the more active antigovernment protesters distribute flash drives and CDs with videos of the fighting to friends in other towns and to journalists.Mr. Shohiby began helping lead an effort this week to shuttle foreign journalists from the Egyptian border to towns across eastern Libya.'"

"'11-02-26,'0','Two Conservative members of the Senate, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s former campaign manager, and two former Conservative party officials were charged with several violations of campaign finance laws, Elections Canada announced Friday. The agency said the Conservatives exceeded campaign spending limits by $1.3 million in the 2006 election. According to the agency, the party improperly channeled spending for national campaign advertising through the budgets of local candidates. Fred DeLorey, a spokesman for the party, said it followed all financing rules. “We did nothing wrong,” he said.'"
"'11-02-26,'0','The brief did not say when the government obtained the records about Mr. Risen, and the Justice Department declined to discuss the matter. Its investigation into Mr. Sterling dates to the administration of George W. Bush, and Mr. Risen was twice subpoenaed — once under Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey, and again under the current attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., Mr. Mukasey’s successor in the Obama administration.Mr. Risen has refused to talk about his sources. The first subpoena lapsed when a grand jury expired, and a federal judge eventually quashed the second subpoena. It remained unclear whether prosecutors would try to subpoena him again for Mr. Sterling’s trial.Under Justice Department rules, prosecutors may seek subpoenas of journalists for testimony or for their phone records only if the information sought is essential and cannot be obtained in another way.In addition, the attorney general must personally sign off after balancing the public’s interest in the news against its interest in effective law enforcement. Those regulations do not cover other kinds of personal records for journalists, however.It also remained unclear whether the phone records came from Mr. Risen’s account. Justice Department rules require notifying a reporter within 90 days if his or her phone records have been subpoenaed. Mr. Risen said that he had received no such notification, but that he believed that the Justice Department had been “harassing” him because of his reporting during the Bush administration.“This seems to bolster the view that I was targeted by the government,” Mr. Risen said. “They basically tried to get everything about me. I’m not sure what else they could have gotten except my kids’ birth certificates.”Lucy A. Dalglish, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, portrayed the scrutinizing of Mr. Risen as part of a crackdown on leaking that is making it increasingly difficult to report on security and intelligence matters. (The Obama administration, in its first two years, indicted more officials for leaking information to reporters than any previous one.)“Is it creepy? You bet it is,” Ms. Dalglish said. “But that’s how the feds investigate crimes. The problem is that Jim and other reporters are going to have a much more difficult time in the future having government whistleblowers talk to them, and that’s the reason they do this.”'"
"'11-02-26,'0','The only two people on Wall Street to have been prosecuted for their roles in the crisis are a pair of minor Bear Stearns executives, Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, whose internal hedge fund, stuffed with triple-A mortgage-backed paper, collapsed in the summer of 2007, an event that anticipated the crisis. A jury acquitted them.Two and a half years after the world’s financial system nearly collapsed, you’re entitled to wonder whether any of the highly paid executives who helped kindle the disaster will ever see jail time — like Michael Milken in the 1980s, or Jeffrey Skilling after the Enron disaster. Increasingly, the answer appears to be no. The harder question, though, is whether anybody should.Aficionados of financial crises like to point to the savings-and-loan debacle of the 1980s as perhaps the high-water mark in prosecuting executives after a broad financial scandal. When the government loosened the rules for owning a thrift, the industry was taken over by aggressive entrepreneurs, far too many of whom made self-dealing loans using savings-and-loan deposits as their own personal piggy banks.In time, nearly 1,000 savings and loans — a third of the industry — collapsed, costing the government billions. According to William K. Black, a former regulator who teaches law at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, “There were over 1,000 felony convictions in major cases” involving executives of the thrifts. Solomon L. Wisenberg, a lawyer who writes for a blog on white collar crime, said, “The prosecutions were hugely successful.”That is partly because the federal government threw enormous resources at those investigations. There were a dozen or more Justice Department task forces. Over 1,000 F.B.I. agents were involved. The government attitude was that it would do whatever it took to bring crooked bank executives to justice.The executives howled that they were being unfairly persecuted, but the cases against them were often rooted in a simple concept: theft. And as prosecutors racked up victories in court, they became confident in their trial approach, and didn’t back away from taking on even the most well-connected thrift executives, like Charles Keating, who owned Lincoln Savings — and who eventually went to prison.Today, Mr. Black says, the government doesn’t have nearly as many resources to pursue such cases. With the F.B.I. understandably focused on terrorism, there isn’t a lot of manpower left to dig into potential crimes that may have taken place during the financial crisis. Fewer than 150 of the bureau’s agents are assigned to mortgage fraud, for instance. Several lawyers who represent white collar defendants told me that outside of New York, there aren’t nearly enough prosecutors who understand the intricacies of financial crime and know how to prosecute it. It is a lot easier to prosecute people for old-fashioned crimes — robbery, assault, murder — than for financial crimes.Which leads to another point: as Sheldon T. Zenner, a white collar criminal lawyer in Chicago, puts it, “These kinds of cases are extraordinarily difficult to make. They require lots of time and resources. You have some of the best, highest-paid and most sophisticated lawyers on the other side fighting you at every turn. You are climbing a really high mountain when you try to do one of these cases.”Take, again, the one big case that prosecutors have brought, against Mr. Cioffi and Mr. Tannin. The Bear Stearns executives had written numerous e-mails expressing their fears and anxieties as the fund began to sink. Prosecutors viewed those e-mails as smoking guns, proof that the men had withheld important information from their investors. Thanks largely to those e-mails, prosecutors saw the case as a slam dunk.But it wasn’t. For every e-mail the executives wrote predicting the worst, they would write another expressing their belief that everything would be O.K. Besides, expressing such fears publicly would have doomed the fund, because liquidity would have instantly vanished. Instead of viewing Mr. Cioffi and Mr. Tannin as crooks, the jury saw them as two men struggling to make the best of a difficult situation. By the time the trial was over, the e-mails, in their totality, made the defendants seem sympathetic rather than criminal.It seems safe to say that the government’s failure to convict those two Bear Stearns executives has caused prosecutors to shy away from bringing other cases. After all, the case against Mr. Cioffi and Mr. Tannin was supposed to be the easy one. By contrast, a case against Angelo Mozilo would have been, from the start, a much harder one to win.Although the Justice Department never filed charges against Mr. Mozilo, one can assume that its case would have been similar to the civil case brought earlier by the Securities and Exchange Commission. (On the eve of the trial date last fall, the S.E.C. blinked and settled with Mr. Mozilo.) One of the S.E.C.’s charges was insider trading — that Mr. Mozilo sold nearly $140 million worth of stock after he knew the company was in trouble. But the defense countered by pointing out that Mr. Mozilo was selling his stock under an automatic selling program that top corporate executives often use — thus mooting the insider trading accusation.Like the Bear Stearns executives, Mr. Mozilo had written his share of e-mails expressing worries about some of Countrywide’s loan practices. He called one of Countrywide’s subprime products “the most dangerous product in existence, and there can be nothing more toxic.” The government argued that Mr. Mozilo had a legal obligation to share that information with investors.But this case, too, would have been awfully difficult to make. Countrywide’s descent into subprime madness was hardly a secret. It made all sorts of crazy adjustable rate mortgages that required no documentation of income; its array of products was also well known and disclosed to investors. Indeed, Mr. Mozilo was quite vocal and public in saying that the housing market was due to fall, and fall hard. But he always assumed that whatever its losses, Countrywide was so strong that it would be one of the survivors and would feast on the carcasses of its former competitors. No internal e-mail he wrote contradicted that belief.Was there outright fraud at Countrywide? Of course there was. That is a large part of the reason that Bank of America, which bought Countrywide in early 2008, has struggled so mightily with the legacy of all the Countrywide loans now on its books. But most of the fraudulent actions at Countrywide took place at the bottom of the food chain, at the mortgage origination level. It has been well-documented that mortgage brokers induced borrowers to take loans that they never understood, and often persuaded them to lie on their loan applications.That kind of predatory lending is against the law — and it should be prosecuted. But going after small-time mortgage brokers isn’t nearly as satisfying as putting the big guy in jail, especially a big guy like Mr. Mozilo, who symbolizes to many Americans the excesses and wrongdoing embodied in the subprime lending mess. The problem is that Mr. Mozilo, though he helped create the culture that made such predatory lending acceptable, never made the fraudulent loans himself. Legally, if not morally, he’s off the hook.A few days ago, I listened to a recording of a lengthy interview with Mr. Mozilo conducted by investigators working for the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission and posted recently on the commission’s Web site. It was a remarkable performance; Mr. Mozilo expressed no regrets and no remorse. He extolled subprime loans as a way to allow lower-income Americans to get a piece of the American dream and “really build wealth” — just like people used to do during the housing bubble. He bragged that Countrywide, unlike the too-big-to-fail banks, never took a penny of government money. He said that Countrywide had helped put 25 million Americans in homes.His voice rising passionately, he said finally, “Countrywide was one of the greatest companies in the history of this country.”Which is a final reason Mr. Mozilo would have been difficult to prosecute. Delusion is an iron-clad defense.'"
"'11-02-26,'0','By late 2000, the price advantage had moved sharply in the other direction. That was when California briefly experienced a shortage of electricity generation, and prices for gas to fuel power plants went through the roof. But the advantage did not last long, and with the American economy in recession the price of gas fell rapidly in 2001.More recently, something similar has happened. In mid-December 2008, with world trade flows plunging and virtually all economies stumbling, oil and gas prices neared parity. But since then oil prices have risen by about 175 percent, adjusted for inflation, while gas prices are down by more than 25 percent.While the lack of rising demand has played a role in holding down the North American price for natural gas, increased supplies from exploitation of shale oil have also played a role. Josef Auer, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, speculated this week that efforts might be made to build an infrastructure that would allow the United States to export liquefied natural gas in ships. But any impact of that on markets would be years off.A generation ago, the developed world, and particularly the United States, provided the marginal demand for oil. That gave the United States something of a self-correcting mechanism. If high oil prices damaged the American economy, that would in turn reduce demand and help to bring world oil prices back down.But now the marginal demand is more likely to come from China. In 2009, the last year for which figures are available, the world consumed 11 percent more oil than it had used a decade earlier. The regional pattern changed sharply in that time. The United States, Japan and the developed countries of Europe all used less oil. The rest of the world increased consumption by about a third.As a result, the stronger recovery in developing countries has helped to push up oil prices over the last 15 months, even though the Western economies have been stumbling. Oil can be shipped anywhere, and tankers can be diverted rapidly from one country to another if demand patterns change. For now, at least, natural gas in North America can move only in pipelines.Over the last several weeks, the upward price pressure on oil from a booming China has been supplemented by worries about a reduction of supply as revolutions grip the Middle East. The run-up to $100 oil came as Libyan production was falling. The price retreated a bit when Saudi Arabia promised to produce more if necessary to offset a cutoff of Libyan exports.Signs of Mideast stability would no doubt reduce upward pressure on oil prices. But sharp price declines may be unlikely unless, and until, Asian economies stumble and decrease their demand for oil.'"
"'11-02-26,'0','There are those who insist that no great work of cinematic art will ever be presented in 3-D. The most persuasive among them — Roger Ebert, for example — offer learned arguments grounded in science and aesthetics. None of that really has anything to do with “Drive Angry,” which at least in its 3-D version makes a loud, incoherent but oddly compelling case for the enhancing effects of stereoscopic projection on certain treasured objects of the cinematic gaze, like classic Detroit muscle cars, women’s breasts and Nicolas Cage.Last things first. Mr. Cage’s acting style — if that is still the right term — seems these days to require not an extra dimension, but rather an entire parallel universe. In this movie, he plays a grandfather from hell (I mean that literally, though to say more might count as a spoiler) with lank blond hair, a haunted demeanor and the poetical name of John Milton, a sop to the English literature grad students who are sure to flock to this movie.The details of his character are both preposterous and beside the point, as “Drive Angry,” directed by Patrick Lussier (“My Bloody Valentine 3D,” “Dracula 2000”), from a script he wrote with Todd Farmer, lets Mr. Cage continue his exploration of the mysteries of the universe. His companion is Amber Heard, playing a hard-luck waitress who can both throw and take a mean punch and whose very short denim shorts compete for attention with the 1969 Dodge Charger she drives.You can guess how she drives it, though there is plenty of anger to go around, and a lot of action, some of it pretty inspired. And also a gooey heap of plot, which is revealed efficiently and without too much concern for plausibility of any kind. Milton is on a mission to rescue a baby from a Satanic cult led by a neorockabilly messiah (Billy Burke) with long fingernails and what may be a prosthetic soul patch. Giving chase is a dapper fellow who identifies himself as “the Accountant” (William Fichtner) and who is invulnerable to everything except the magical antique gun that Milton keeps with his gear.Apart from some half-cartoonish digital effects and the whole 3-D thing, “Drive Angry” could almost be mistaken for a raunchy, cheesy exploitation programmer of the same vintage as some of its cars. Or rather, a whole retrospective of disreputable ’70s B pictures, what with the cars, the supernatural mumbo-jumbo, the churning, anonymous heavy-metal guitars of Michael Wandmacher’s score and the nudity.All of these elements combine in one extraordinary sequence, during which Milton manages to gun down about a dozen Lucifer-loving, farm-implement-wielding thugs, while smoking a cigar and taking slugs from a bottle of whiskey. And, through the whole bloody barrage, having sex. “That never happened to me before,” his partner says later, recalling the episode more graphically and succinctly than I can here. “Has it ever happened to you?”'"
"'11-02-26,'0','Mr. Quinto, 55, helped start the firm in 1986, and now handles most of the firm’s day-to-day Oscar work. (The core Oscar enforcement team also includes John B. Quinn, a founding partner at Quinn Emanuel; two of the firm’s other partners; an associate; a contract lawyer; a paralegal and a private investigator.) Copyright and trademark enforcement make up most of Mr. Quinto’s Academy-related tasks, as he, almost daily, dispatches letters to companies in apparent violation. Some of the more memorable culprits: shops peddling pornographic Oscar statuettes; a Brazilian cigarette maker brandishing the Oscar on its packaging; and a winemaker that used the Oscar in its advertisements. (That last example was “quickly corked,” Mr. Quinto, who has a fondness for corny jokes, wrote in an e-mail.)Scrambling to intercept the occasional Oscar that pops up on eBay or at an auction house can also take up a lot of his time, he said. (Anyone wanting to sell an Oscar must first offer it to the Academy for $1.)The firm’s enforcement tactics are hardly high-tech. It often comes down to trolling the Internet. Mostly, though, the group must rely on serendipity, diligence and tips from friends.Mr. Quinto, for instance, once came across a DVD in a store while on vacation in Hanoi that purported to contain 100 films that had won the Academy’s best picture award. Sunday’s show, however, will only be the 83rd Academy Awards. Mr. Quinto bought a copy of the DVD and then sent the store a letter asking it to stop selling it.Among their lesser-known duties, Mr. Quinto and the firm review the show’s script each year, managing the delicate balance between funny, inappropriate and illegal.One year, ABC’s censors tried to cut a joke that “suggested that an unnamed player, who obviously was Barry Bonds, might possibly have dabbled with steroids,” Mr. Quinto said. The network thought the joke was slanderous.Mr. Quinto said he argued that there was no way Mr. Bonds would sue because if he did, “all his medical records are open to discovery.”ABC eventually won the argument, but not because of legal concerns.During rehearsals, Mr. Quinto explained, the joke was cut because “not enough people laughed.”But the watchdog role does have its limits.The part of his job that Mr. Quinto said he takes most seriously — security — also provides some of his most head-shaking memories.As he has almost every year since the Academy hired his firm in 1987, Mr. Quinto will be on the red carpet Sunday, playing the role of doorman to the hottest club in town. When people show up without tickets, or without identification to match the name on their tickets (which may not be transferred), the case goes to Mr. Quinto. His power is greater than that of a bouncer’s. Not only can he turn someone away, he can have that person arrested for trespassing as well.He makes about 15 trespass arrests at the show each year, Mr. Quinto said. But of course, the arrests come only after the perpetrators lay out their excuses.“Gee, I thought I could just buy tickets.” “I’m a member of Actors’ Equity. Doesn’t that entitle me to get in?”Last year, one man made a particularly creative effort to slip past the gatekeepers. He registered a domain name for the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (which oversees the Emmys), created an e-mail address and sent himself a confirmation e-mail message granting permission to attend the show. The motion picture Academy does not send out confirmation e-mails. The man was turned away, Mr. Quinto said.A few years ago, a man accompanied by two women showed up and claimed he was the famously white-haired Jack Valenti, apparently confusing the Motion Picture Association of America, which Valenti was then president of, with the Academy.“There was a strong resemblance,” Mr. Quinto said of the impostor.Nonetheless, Valenti was not a guest that year. So the man and the women were taken to a substation for questioning, where they continued to explain that they had forgotten their identification.“I just said very loudly, ‘O.K., these are the first three arrests of the evening,’ ” Mr. Quinto said.One of the women asked why they were being arrested, and Mr. Quinto said he told her it was for trespassing. Then the truth came out.“But we crash events all the time,” the woman said. “This has never happened. When we crashed the Globes we weren’t arrested.”'"
"'11-02-26,'0','“We hope the Senate is going to finally join us in these common-sense cuts to keep the government open and not continue to play chicken,” said Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and majority leader.Senate Democrats indicated they would be willing to go along with the proposal despite their insistence earlier this week that any temporary measure should be free of spending reductions. They had portrayed such a maneuver as a back-door way for House Republicans to begin enacting $61 billion in cuts that have met objections in the Senate.“We are encouraged to hear that Republicans are abandoning their demands for extreme measures like cuts to border security, cancer research and food safety inspectors,” said Jon Summers, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader.If approved, the measure would buy time for more talks on the depth of spending cuts.If the House and Senate do not reach a deal by March 18 under the latest proposal, they will once again face the prospect of closing federal agencies or be forced to enact another temporary extension.Republicans said their willingness to fashion a measure that involved relatively uncontroversial cuts and was free of the more ideologically charged provisions included in the $61 billion plan showed that they were sincere when they said their main interest was reducing spending, not shutting down the government.“This is to get the government moving forward but to cut spending in government,” said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 3 Republican. “I don’t see how Democrats can’t take these basic steps toward reining in government while keeping our government operational.”But Democrats said their efforts to raise the alarm about a possible shutdown due to Republican demands for deep cuts in a variety of federal agencies had paid off. They said Republicans instead chose to advance a temporary measure with the same kind of spending trims that Democrats had been advocating.""They feared a government shutdown, and so they are adopting some of our suggestions on what to cut,"" said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate.The House is expected to approve the temporary measure on Tuesday, leaving a few days for the Senate to act and send a measure to President Obama before the current stopgap bill expires at midnight Friday. The time frame leaves little opportunity for the Senate to alter the measure and send it back to the House.Senate Republicans said Democrats had few good options with the clock ticking and encouraged them to accept the bill and move on to the negotiations over the broader spending legislation as well as the budget for 2012.“By supporting the House bill, our friends on the other side of the aisle will have the chance to ensure that the government remains operational while we work with them to identify additional ways to shrink Washington spending this year,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.Striking a final deal will not be easy. Democrats contend that the $61 billion cut by the House in its marathon floor debate earlier this month reaches far too deeply into essential federal programs and strikes out at favored Obama administration initiatives like the new health care law. Senate Democrats have begun assembling their own package of cuts and expect to bring it forward next week as an alternative to the Republican plan.At the same time, the new House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, has little room for negotiation given the insistence by his rank and file, including 87 newly elected Republicans, on standing firm on the $61 billion in reduced spending that has already cleared the House.But both sides agree that federal agencies face some level of significant spending cuts from the budgets they are currently operating under, a result that could cause some disruptions.'"
"'11-02-26,'0','LONDON (AP) — Investors were left in limbo for four hours on Friday as the London Stock Exchange halted trading because of a technical problem — the latest embarrassing lapse to hit the bourse as it tries put a new system in place.The exchange suspended dealings shortly after the opening auction, blaming issues with market data technology just two weeks after it introduced its new platform, called Millennium.It restarted trading shortly after midday, with the chief executive, Xavier Rolet, expressing “sincere regret” at the inconvenience caused.The apology did little to appease many traders on what was expected to be a busy morning, after the release of data showing that Britain’s economy was faring worse than previously thought and amid the volatility stemming from the Libyan political crisis.The outage is the latest in a string of blackouts caused by technical problems at the exchange in recent years — including a full-day shutdown in September 2008 and a three-and-a-half-hour knockout in November 2009 — and comes just days after Borsa Italiana, the London exchange’s Milan platform, was hit by a five-hour blackout.“At a time of uncertainty in the markets, where traders are having to keep on their toes with the situation in Libya, the last thing they need is an unexpected halt to trading,” Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index, said.'"
"'11-02-26,'0','Kraft Foods lost on Friday an appeals court ruling that upholds a decision allowing the Starbucks Corporation to end a deal under which Kraft distributes Starbucks coffee to grocery stores.“We conclude that Kraft has failed to show that it faces an actual and imminent risk of injury that cannot be compensated by money damages,” the appeals judges said in their ruling, which came several hours after they heard arguments from both sides at a hearing in Manhattan.Kraft sued Starbucks in December to prevent it from terminating their deal before they could resolve the dispute in arbitration. Judge Cathy Seibel of United States District Court in New York rejected Kraft’s contention in January that it would be irreparably harmed if Starbucks were allowed to end the agreement.The appeal was heard before the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan.“The Second Circuit did not rule on the fundamental issue of whether Starbucks can exit our contract without paying the fair market value, plus a premium,” Marc Firestone, Kraft’s general counsel, said in an e-mailed statement. “That question will be decided in arbitration.”“We are pleased that the court of appeals has confirmed the district court’s ruling,” Alan Hilowitz, a spokesman for Starbucks, said in an e-mailed statement.Starbucks granted Kraft the exclusive right to sell its coffee to grocery stores and other retailers in a 1998 agreement that was superseded by a new deal in 2004.'"
"'11-02-26,'0','OTTAWA — An evacuation flight chartered by the government of Canada made it into Tripoli, the Libyan capital, on Friday morning, but after its crew was unable to find any Canadians at the chaotic airport, the airplane left empty.The plane, operated by a Toronto-based company that specializes in flying in conflict zones, was the first Canadian rescue flight to reach Libya after several false starts this week. Other than citing the general confusion at the airport, Peter MacKay, the defense minister, did not explain why no one from any other country boarded the plane when he disclosed the development in brief remarks to reporters.The aviation company, SkyLink, referred all questions about the unsuccessful flight to the government.Mr. MacKay hinted that the fault rested with his government’s foreign service.“That has to do with coordination on the ground, ensuring that people are aware that an exit is available to them,” Mr. MacKay said. “We’re trying to coordinate that through the Department of Foreign Affairs and through other countries.”Many of the Canadians who have fled Libya on aircraft and ships chartered by other countries have complained that they found it difficult, if not impossible, to contact Canadian diplomatic officials in Tripoli, or that they were given conflicting messages if they did make contact.A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said she was unable to comment.The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that another chartered plane was sent to Tripoli after the flight that returned empty.'"
"'11-02-26,'0','“A week later, the old one died. We timed it pretty well,” Ms. Hauseman said with a laugh. Her cautious approach applies to other products: she is holding out on upgrading two seven-year-old tube-type TVs, and has taken to mending clothes rather than replacing them.Ms. Hauseman, 41, a general manager of an independent record label, said this mentality was the product of several factors, including bills that have swelled more quickly than her income. She said it was not so much that she could not afford new things, but that the last few years of economic turmoil had left her feeling that she could be stealing from her future by throwing away goods that still had value.“I’ve started upgrading for necessity, not vanity,” she said, adding that to do otherwise “just does feel wasteful.”Whether a broad, long-term shift in consumer habits is under way is a question tickling economists and analysts. Some insist that, as with the Depression, the recent downturn has made a lingering impression on how people view the propriety of, say, stuffing a still-working cellphone into a desk drawer in favor of a newer model.But other experts and historians argue that as spending and credit return, so will yearnings to favor brands, fashion and novelty over practicality.With some products, the upgrade cycle is actually accelerating. According to NPD, a market research firm, consumers in 2010 reported spending more to upgrade major kitchen appliances like refrigerators than they did in 2008 or 2009, when such spending fell. The firm found similar trends at work in smaller kitchen and personal care appliances.In the case of televisions, upgrades have slowed, but only because so many people snapped up flat-panel sets in recent years. There is now a lull in the product cycle, but not necessarily in consumer demand.Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, said it was simply too soon to tell whether economic recovery would bring back a more disposable society. “There aren’t enough aggregate statistics since the crash for us to know,” he said.But in some important categories there are indications of slowed upgrades. Consumers are holding onto new cars for a record 63.9 months, up 4.5 months from a year ago and 14 percent since the end of 2008, according to Polk, a research firm. In fact, the firm said, when used cars are included, the average length of car ownership stands at 52.2 months, also a record.Industry analysts also report that people on average upgrade their cellphones every 18 months, up from every 16 months just a few years ago. They hold onto their laptops an average of 4 years and 4 months, a month longer than they did a year ago, though that figure has been creeping up since 2000.And consumers are making sure to get the last drop from their household products, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers big companies like Colgate-Palmolive and Clorox.“People are squeezing the last bit out of the shampoo. They seem to be adding more water to really squeeze out the last bit,” Mr. Dibadj said, noting financial reports from major companies showing frugality with things like razor blades, laundry detergent and toothpaste. “Consumers are doing their best to conserve — we’re seeing it again and again and again.”Nancy F. Koehn, a professor at the Harvard Business School and a historian of consumer behavior, said she would bet her boot collection that the change was, if not permanent, at least lasting. She said it stemmed not just from a shaky economy but also from a sense that great institutions — like government and major corporations — might not be reliable saviors in a crisis.“We’re not going back to a time of our grandmothers’ tales of what they kept and how they used things so carefully. But we’ll see a consistent inching or trudging towards that,” Professor Koehn said. “It’s a glimmer of that, a flickering of it.”For Walt Truelson, a management consultant in Portland, Ore., that has meant a shift in his lifelong love affair with cars, specifically Jaguars. He typically bought a new or slightly used one every year or two, but has had his current car, a 1999 model in dark green, for four years. “It’s going to stay in my possession as long as it runs,” he said.Mr. Truelson, who declined to give his age because he said he acts much younger than he is, also switched 18 months ago to paying for cellphone minutes as he uses them, rather than subscribing to an expensive monthly plan.He said the changes reflect in part the fact that his business fell with the economy, but also what he says is a reassessment of the need to constantly have new things: “It’s a question of shifting values.”In a few cases, consumers who are inclined to discard less are getting some positive reinforcement from an unlikely corner: companies that profit from upgrades.Levi Strauss is telling customers to take steps that will actually lead them to buy fewer pairs of jeans. The Levi’s sustainability campaign urges customers to wash their jeans less often and in cold water, a move that the company says reduces water use.“And they absolutely will last longer,” said Michael Kobori, vice president for social and environmental sustainability at Levi’s. He said the message was part of building trust with consumers and emphasizing the durability of the company’s products.When it comes to holding onto clothing, Genevieve Tung, 28, needs no campaign to motivate her. She has recently mended ripped socks and pants, sewn buttons onto jackets and gone to great lengths to save a peach silk blouse stained by soy sauce.“I tried several home remedies involving dishwashing detergent and baking soda, had it dry-cleaned twice,” she said. “I bought fabric dye I’m going to cook on the stove and hope the dark color dye will blend in.”Ms. Tung, who lives in Brooklyn, recently left a corporate law job to go back to school, a move that curtailed her income. She is also worried about relying over the long term on the pension of her husband, a New York City paramedic, given how unreliable pensions seem.She says there are other motivations too: “Personally, avoiding waste and using things until they’re used up seems like a common-sense way to live.”'"
"'11-02-26,'0','Under the change, the Air Force agreed to project the cost of the fuel used to power the tankers over a 40-year period, rather than 25 years. Air Force officials have said that the lengthier projections made sense, given that many of its tankers have already been operating for 50 years.Mr. Dicks promoted the change publicly before the latest bidding started, and EADS officials said on Friday that they knew about it. But they say it was one of several rule changes that could help explain how Boeing, America’s top aerospace firm, reversed its prospects on the bid after faltering so badly in 2008.EADS, bidding with Northrop Grumman, won the earlier contest only to have government auditors block the award after Boeing filed a formal protest. The auditors found that the Air Force had been too subjective in evaluating the bids and had given EADS too much credit for some of the extra features of its plane.The successful protest rattled the Pentagon. It had already been embarrassed after an effort to lease tankers from Boeing in 2001 collapsed in a corruption scandal, and it was wary of the intense advertising and lobbying campaigns that both sides had mounted.So top Pentagon and Air Force officials sought to make the evaluation more objective this time, creating a mathematical formula that weighed the bid prices, how well each of the planes met war-fighting needs and the 40-year operational cost estimates.EADS executives said on Friday that they had no reason to question the Air Force’s selection. Louis Gallois, the chief executive of EADS, told reporters that he was “disappointed” and “perplexed” by the decision. But he said EADS would not consider its next steps until the Air Force briefed the company on Monday about the award.EADS has 10 days after that to protest if it decides that the Air Force deviated from the bidding rules. The company, which planned to build an assembly plant in Alabama if it had won, has strong support from lawmakers in the gulf states counting on the jobs to help the region recover from Hurricane Katrina.EADS supporters say that the size of its plane, about 25 percent bigger than Boeing’s, had impressed Air Force officials in 2008. The plane could carry up to two dozen pallets of cargo along with the fuel needed to transfer to bombers and fighters in flight.But since then, the Air Force revised its needs, saying it already had more cargo planes than required.The Air Force also penalized Boeing more substantially than EADS in 2008 for not being as far along in developing its tanker. This time, the Pentagon insisted on a fixed-price contract and did not deduct any points from either bidder for possible production delays.Representative Dicks acknowledged in an interview that his push to weigh the operating costs over 40 years rather than 25 “may have made a big difference,” and independent analysts agreed.The Air Force plans to buy 179 tankers, and it has assumed that fuel prices will rise by an average of 2.5 percent annually over those decades.Boeing’s supporters had said earlier this week that Boeing thought that rate should be higher, and they contended that parts of the Air Force’s formula seemed to favor EADS.But Edmund S. Greenslet, publisher of the Airline Monitor, an industry newsletter, said commercial models similar to the EADS tanker burned about 1,900 gallons of fuel per hour, while Boeing’s plane used less than 1,500 gallons. With fuel costs rising, that difference could have offset any advantages for the EADS plane, he said.Both the EADS and Boeing planes could carry more fuel than any of the aging tankers in use today. Analysts also said the Air Force would have had to make greater operational changes if it had bought the EADS plane.Boeing held a celebration Friday at its plant in Everett, Wash., where it made production changes last year to cut costs. As she left the rally, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said in a telephone interview that Boeing had “used sweat equity to get down to brass tacks” and lower its bid.Hundreds of Boeing workers attended the rally, cheering that the contract would save many of their jobs and add thousands more. A job at Boeing, once seen as a ticket to a comfortable life, has become dicier as competition has intensified in the aerospace industry.Boeing’s tanker is based on its 767 passenger jet, and the company had planned to end production of that plane if it had not won the tanker contract. The passenger version of the 767 will be replaced by Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner.Mr. Greenslet noted that the long delays in the 787 program had prompted Boeing to keep the 767 line open longer than planned. And if the new plane had not been delayed, Boeing might not have been in as good a position to bid for the tanker work, he said.Boeing officials had also feared that EADS, which is partly owned by European governments, could rely on subsidies to undercut Boeing’s price or to absorb losses if it won the contract with a low bid.But Guy M. Hicks, a spokesman for EADS’s North American unit, said that while the company’s bid was low, it had still projected a profit. He also said that EADS might have had a more realistic sense of the costs than Boeing, since it is building more tankers for other countries.'"
"'11-02-26,'0','“Consumers stumbled a bit to start the year, and while we expect them to pick up the pace some in coming months, the recent rise in energy prices poses a notable headwind,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase. Shortly after the Commerce Department report was released, JPMorgan cut its forecast for growth this quarter to 3.5 percent from 4 percent.One of the more significant revisions last quarter was in state and local government spending, which contracted at an annual pace of 2.4 percent rather than the 0.9 percent previously estimated. Continued government budget shortfalls indicate that more cutbacks could be coming.“There’s no denying that state and local governments are going to be a modest drag on the economy this year,” Mr. Ashworth said. “Cuts will probably go on for another few quarters, possibly a year, and then start to see a gradual rebound.”Tax revenue has already started recovering, according to the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York, Albany. But that revenue may not rise quickly enough to make up for the dwindling dollars in emergency assistance that the federal government approved for states last year.Federal spending cuts sought by Republican Congressmen could similarly threaten the economic recovery, analysts say. Economists at Goldman Sachs earlier this week estimated that a spending bill recently passed by the House — which would trim $60 billion in spending in the current fiscal year — would shave 1.5 to 2 percentage points off growth in the second and third quarters of this year.Such cuts in government spending can reverberate partly because they throw more people into the unemployment pool, and they in turn have less money to spend. They also strip government services from others who are already unemployed or who are trying to get back on their feet.The engines of economic growth last quarter were a shrinking trade deficit and consumers, who account for more than two-thirds of the economy and whose spending grew at an annual rate of 4.1 percent. The contributions to growth of both these categories was slightly less than initially estimated, however.A separate report released Friday, from Reuters and the University of Michigan, showed that an index of consumer sentiment rose to 77.5 in the February final release, from 75.1 in the preliminary report, the highest reading since January 2008.Another potentially positive indicator in Friday’s output report was that business inventories — that is, what companies keep on their stockroom shelves — were very low last quarter. That means that businesses should be increasing their orders early this year to replenish their shelves, and perhaps putting more workers into jobs in the process.The Federal Reserve recently estimated that the economy would grow 3.4 to 3.9 percent over the course of 2011.“Although the unemployment rate will rise a bit in the first half of 2011, as stronger job gains draw more of the unemployed into the labor force, it will move consistently lower toward the end of 2011,” said Augustine Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody’s Analytics.'"
"'11-02-26,'0','Stocks rose Friday as oil prices stabilized after climbing through the week. The escalating turmoil in Libya still left major indexes down about 2 percent for the week.Oil prices settled at $97.88, down from a high of $103 Thursday but still up 13 percent over the last week. Oil prices have been rising, and that has sent stocks lower over concern that the violence in Libya will spread throughout North Africa and the Middle East and affect oil production.Those concerns eased late Thursday after the International Energy Agency said the impact was far less than analysts had estimated and that any shortfall could be easily made up by tapping oil reserves in other countries.Libya is Africa’s largest producer of oil but ranks 15th among the world’s oil exporters.Boeing rose 2.2 percent after the Air Force awarded the company a $35 billion contract Thursday, one of the largest ever made by the military, for nearly 200 airborne refueling tankers. DreamWorks Animation fell 2.8 percent after the entertainment company reported revenue and earnings that were far below what analysts were expecting. Poor box-office results from the Will Ferrell movie “Megamind” were partly to blame.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.95 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 12,130.45.

"'11-02-27,'0','TAMPA, Fla. — The company line is that individual results in exhibition games matter far, far less than the process of preparation, especially on lazy Saturdays in February when the regulars spend a few innings in the field, log a couple of at-bats and escape into the sunshine. Still, judgments are formed, opinions are developed and, as Manager Joe Girardi said, “That doesn’t mean that you can’t open someone’s eyes now.”Within the Yankees’ dugout, much of the eye-opening Saturday went on during the first three innings of their 5-4 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies, when two of their spring curiosities were unveiled. Bidding for a rotation spot, Bartolo Colon struggled to command his sinker but flashed a solid changeup in allowing one run over two innings. Bidding for added responsibility in a relief role, Joba Chamberlain pitched an overpowering third inning, impressing with his velocity (94 miles per hour), command and stamina.At opposite stages of wildly different careers, Colon and Chamberlain are seeking a similar objective of sorts: a comeback. Chamberlain’s pursuit is less dramatic, if more significant: after a shaky 2010 season that left him on the cusp of irrelevance, Chamberlain has to prove himself again. And for him, camp began inauspiciously. He arrived weighing significantly more than his listed 230 pounds, which irked General Manager Brian Cashman and invited questions about his commitment. However, Girardi emphasized that Chamberlain would be evaluated strictly on performance.Chamberlain was discouraged while warming up, saying it felt as if he was throwing “bowling balls” and that his pitches came out like “grenades.”Chamberlain thought, “This isn’t good.” When he faced his first hitter, Wilson Valdez, Chamberlain invested his confidence in his simplified mechanics.Over the off-season, he adjusted how and when his hands break during his motion. They now start at his waist, not his chest, as they did during his spectacular rookie season of 2007. The hope is that he will achieve greater consistency and, Girardi said, a better downhill angle on his fastball. That pitch above all was “leaps and bounds ahead” of past years, Chamberlain said, and he also featured a biting slider. one that struck out Valdez and one that broke right at Ross Gload’s back foot. In 11 pitches, Chamberlain shifted the conversation.'"
"'11-02-27,'0','To research “The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs,” which is the artist’s 16th monologue and one of several to deal with technology, Mr. Daisey traveled to the Foxconn factory in Shenzhen, China, a massive industrial complex where nearly one million workers make electronic devices for Apple and others. He hired a translator and spent three weeks talking with employees in the area. Stories from the workers, many of whom he said were children under 16, are woven into the monologue and give the audience a rare insight into smartphones, tablet computers and other popular devices: they are made largely by human hands.“The shocking things that Mike said which brought me to tears were so because they came as a first-person story,” Mr. Wozniak said. “Mike was living the pain of what he was describing as he told it.”The issue of the conditions under which iPads and other personal devices are made is a sort of third rail of the digital industry. Apple issues an internally produced annual supplier responsibility report (the 2010 version was released last week) but there is no independent verification system to monitor labor concerns at Foxconn and other Chinese plants. Mr. Daisey’s audiences, like consumers everywhere, are generally in some degree of denial that there could possibly be ethical issues concerning their personal devices.“I definitely felt bad about using my gadgets afterward,” Dave Schumaker wrote on the personal-technology site Gdgt.com, where he is community manager. “I arrived at the show carrying my bag containing a MBP [MacBook Pro], iPad and iPhone — all of which were made in Shenzhen.”Although The Bay Citizen was unable to locate any Apple employees who would talk about the piece, Mr. Daisey said he had spoken with about 100 current or past Apple employees about “their emotional feelings that are brought up by the show.”Mr. Jobs has never communicated directly with Mr. Daisey, but word about the monologue has reached Tim Cook, Apple’s chief operating officer and acting chief executive. On Wednesday, at Apple’s annual shareholder meeting, Mr. Cook was asked about “The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs.” According to The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Cook said he had not seen it and then gave a passionate defense of Apple’s Asian supply chain practices.In an audience survey conducted by the theater, 23 percent of those questioned said the show would definitely affect their purchases of electronic equipment. But it is hard to take action.“The Mac faithful simply don’t want to think about any of this stuff in China,” Daniel Lyons, the Newsweek journalist who recently retired his Fake Steve Jobs blog, wrote in an e-mail. “They love their devices and want to leave it at that.”Even Mr. Daisey remains an Apple gadget fan. “I’m a cyborg,” he said, “and I’m tethered to my devices.”'"
"'11-02-27,'0','“We know there is no new money coming to the states,” Ms. Gregoire said, but further cuts in federal grant programs could “undermine the economic recovery in our states.”Maine’s new governor, Paul R. LePage, a Republican, said: “What the federal government can do for us is not money, but flexibility. We can slow down layoffs in a lot of private and public sector jobs if the states are given more flexibility.”Seconding that sentiment, Ms. Gregoire said states wanted “more flexibility in the classroom.”Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, a Republican, said: “If we could get Medicaid as a block grant with total flexibility to run the program as we see fit, I would be willing to take a cap on growth of 2 percent a year. Many governors feel that way.” There is no cap on federal and state Medicaid spending, and anyone who meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to coverage.The federal aid helped states survive the worst of the recession, but left a difficult legacy in some states. “The stimulus money was used to start new programs, including social service programs, and we don’t have the money to continue them,” Mr. LePage said. The Commerce Department reported Friday that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the final quarter of last year, and added that spending cuts by state and local governments had apparently held back growth.Likewise, Ms. Gregoire said Saturday, hiring by private employers has been overwhelmed by layoffs at state and local government agencies, contributing to slow growth in overall employment.Governors said their economies were still far from vibrant.“We are recovering, not recovered,” said Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, a Democrat.Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, also a Democrat, said, “Unemployment remains uncomfortably high in Connecticut at a number, 9 percent, that we are simply not used to.”The governors’ association signed an agreement on Saturday with provincial officials from China in hopes of building a relationship that will increase trade and create jobs here.The confrontation between Governor Walker and state employees in Wisconsin generated a lot of discussion at the meeting.In a pointed contrast to Mr. Walker, Ms. Gregoire said that when she negotiated with public-employee unions, they had agreed to certain sacrifices on pay and health benefits, as well as changes in their pensions.“I believe in collective bargaining rights,” she said.Governor Barbour expressed support for Mr. Walker in his effort to curb collective-bargaining rights for public workers in Wisconsin.“Mr. Walker is doing what he said very directly and repeatedly he was going to do,” Mr. Barbour said. “I support him in it. We don’t have collective bargaining in Mississippi. About half the states don’t. The idea that this is some constitutional right of the public employee unions is incorrect.”'"
"'11-02-27,'0','Republicans lawmakers face a delicate balancing act as negotiations to avert a government shutdown reach a critical phase this week. Senate Democrats have said the $61 billion in spending cuts proposed by House Republicans are too severe, although Tea Party members consider them not severe enough.If the parties cannot reconcile their differences, the federal government could be shut down for the first time in 16 years.“If these politicians don’t get the message, they had better step aside,” said Carter Brough, a retiree from Whitney, Tex. “Right now, I can’t tell the difference between the parties. I’ve chopped my credit cards. I’m watching my spending. This country needs to do the same.”Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, heard the displeasure firsthand when he addressed the conference on Friday night. He called the $61 billion in cuts that cleared the House “the largest spending cuts in history” and a “good start in the right direction,” but Tea Party activists were having none of it.Mr. Barton also drew grumbles when he urged patience. “You’re not going to get to the finish line the first time you set out,” he said.Former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a prospective Republican presidential candidate in 2012, was greeted more enthusiastically when he spoke of the need to get the country’s books in order.“The government’s too damn big,” he said, making a play on the catchphrase of Jimmy McMillan, the candidate for New York governor who ran on the Rent Is Too Damn High ticket.“Just because we followed Greece in democracy doesn’t mean we should follow them in bankruptcy,” Mr. Pawlenty said.Like many speakers, Mr. Pawlenty also slipped in a jab at the president. “Now, I’m not one who questions the existence of the president’s birth certificate,” he said. “But when you listen to his policies, don’t you at least wonder what planet he’s from?”After playing a critical role in propelling the Republicans to a House majority in 2010 — but ending the careers of some establishment Republicans along the way — the Tea Party members here were clearly eager to mix things up again in 2012.“We’re not an appendage of anyone,” Ms. Oljar said. “If someone is not a real fiscal conservative, they will be outed very quickly. There are politicians who have taken on the Tea Party mantle. That’s fine. But we care about the issues, and we’re watching them all.”The issues raised in Wisconsin and other states where Republicans are proposing cuts in state workers’ benefits clearly resonated with the audience in Phoenix. A discussion on how to curtail the political power of labor unions, which are closely allied with the Democrats, drew a standing-room-only crowd and a long line out the door.“It’s a travesty, all the protests in Wisconsin,” said Bruce Miller, a nondenominational minister from Tucson. “The unions have served us well for years, but they’re turning into nothing more than a political machine for the Democrats.”In interviews, Tea Party members who were here from across the country expressed deep displeasure with the nation’s course, in particular the way Washington spends taxpayers’ money.Many said they were new to politics in the last election but intended to stay involved. They added that they were willing to make personal sacrifices as government programs were pared back, but only if the cuts were broad based.“It’s going to hurt,” said Patricia Morlen of Albuquerque. Ms. Morlen said she was a longtime teacher and union member, but wondered, “Why don’t we share the sacrifice, act as Americans and come together to solve the national debt crisis that we have?”Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder and the national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots, called the federal budget cuts that had been approved so far “a drop in the bucket.” Talking about Governor Walker, she said, “Maybe that courage and the example he’s setting will give courage to other elected officials.”'"
"'11-02-27,'0','IN recent years more than 40 states have offered incentives for movie and television production, recapturing “runaway” film projects that had left America for places like Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Eastern Europe. This has not only brought significant economic benefits back to our shores, but also has secured America’s most important cultural export. After all, it is through film and television that many people from other countries come to know us — our values, our expressions and our freedom.I’m proud that New Mexico has been a leader in this effort.Unfortunately, a new campaign is under way to curtail or even eliminate these film and TV programs in many states, including my own. Some politicians call the incentives fiscally irresponsible, or giveaways to “liberal” Hollywood. The latter charge is mere propaganda. The former gets traction in states whose programs are not well designed. But when incentives are especially effective — as they are in New Mexico, Louisiana and Michigan — they can bring huge benefits to the state economy.In New Mexico we scaled our incentives to match our specific tax structure, and we invested in programs at our universities and community colleges to train screenwriters, directors, actors, grips, electricians, makeup artists and other film professionals. As a result, we created more than 10,000 jobs in this industry and in supporting businesses, bringing nearly $4 billion into our economy over eight years. These are huge numbers for a state with a population of only about 2.1 million — especially with the country still recovering from a recession.Yet my state’s current administration and its legislative supporters are now trying to dismantle the program by falsely pitting film incentives against what they call “children’s” interests like education and health care, and claiming that money spent on one means less for the others. Apart from the blatant illogic of this argument — after all, any program that’s a positive for the economy benefits everyone, including children — educational programs in film and related media arts are among the most popular at our colleges and universities. They inspire more young people to graduate from high school, pursue higher degrees and ultimately get excellent jobs.Governors and legislatures should call “cut!” on cynical efforts to kill forward-looking incentive programs for film and TV production, in New Mexico and in all other states.'"

"'11-02-27,'0','The New York Times collected data from more than 200 natural gas wells in Pennsylvania. Many of them are tapping into the Marcellus Shale, a vast underground rock formation. But a method being used to stimulate wells, called hydraulic fracturing, produces wastewater containing corrosive salts and radioactive and carcinogenic materials. In Pennsylvania, this wastewater has been sent through sewage treatment plants that cannot remove some of the contaminants before the water is discharged into rivers and streams that provide drinking water. The Times was able to map 149 of the wells.'"

"'11-02-27,'0','Nishioka was asked later about Casilla’s Japanese. He chuckled and said, “We’ll make another different new language between the two of us.”Gardenhire and his coaches are bracing for that.“As Joe Vavra said, he’s got his Spanglish down and now he’s got his Japanglish down,” Gardenhire said, referring to the Twins’ hitting coach. “So we’re working on it.”Casilla and Nishioka are expected to be the starting middle infielders for the Twins on opening day, but Gardenhire has not decided who will play at second base and who will be the shortstop. Either way, they will somehow have to bridge the language gap.Baseball is baseball in any language, but there is no discounting the importance of middle infielders being able to communicate. From who is covering second base on a steal to where to go on relay throws from the outfield to who has the best angle on a fly ball, all sorts of talking has to happen.The Twins are pairing Casilla and Nishioka in the same group for batting practice and fundamentals to help them become more familiar with each other. Nishioka has an interpreter with him at all times in camp, including when he is on the field for defensive drills.“Casilla’s been playing with the Twins for much longer than me,” Nishioka said through his interpreter, Ryo Shinkawa. “So for him to guide me through the practices, that will be something that will be very helpful and appreciated.”Gardenhire has long been a proponent of one of his middle infielders “taking charge” on defense. He was continually prodding the former shortstop Jason Bartlett to be more vocal, but that could be especially challenging for Nishioka, who wants to learn English, and Casilla, who has been inconsistent during his time with the Twins.“Our interpreter is going to be the biggest influence in the infield right now,” Gardenhire joked. “We’ll work our way from there.”Then there is first baseman Justin Morneau, a native of the Vancouver, British Columbia, area, who likes to say that he speaks Canadian.“All he has to learn how to say is ‘eh,’ and we’ll be all right,” Morneau said of Nishioka.In the end, success could be the most sturdy bridge for communication. The Twins are excited about Nishioka, who won the batting title in his league last year and has Gold Gloves at second base and shortstop. They paid $5 million just for the rights to negotiate a three-year, $9.25 million contract, and Gardenhire has said several times that Nishioka has nothing to prove from a skill standpoint.Casilla is a speedster who has frustrated the Twins in the past with mental mistakes and inconsistency. Nevertheless, he is being counted to replace either the steady J. J. Hardy (who was traded in the off-season) at shortstop or the productive Orlando Hudson (who left as a free agent) at second base.Hardy and Hudson, of course, both spoke English.“It’s Japanese and Spanish so there is somewhat of a barrier,” Nishioka said, adding, “We will be wearing the same jerseys and we’ll try to communicate and have it in full mode by the start of the season.”'"
"'11-02-27,'0','Robert C. Doll, global chief investment officer for equities at BlackRock, the investment manager, noted in a recent report that while growth had stalled in many parts of the developed world, emerging economies “continued to grow during the global recession and are now getting an additional growth jolt as the global recovery gains traction.”As a result, central banks in many of those regions have had to start raising interest rates in an effort to curb inflationary pressures — which were brought about by that growth.China is an example. In an attempt to keep a lid on food costs and other prices, the People’s Bank of China raised key short-term lending rates three times in the last four months.That, in turn, has held down stock prices there: Chinese equities are down roughly 5 percent so far this year. Mr. Doll noted that even though tightened monetary policies in the emerging markets had temporarily depressed stock prices, economic activity in those regions had stayed strong.According to IHS Global Insight, China’s economy is expected to expand three times faster than that of the United States this year. This would suggest that “further tightening is likely” throughout the emerging markets,” Mr. Doll said.To be sure, some developing markets that are big commodity producers are benefiting from rising prices. Russia’s stock market, for example, has appreciated by more than 18 percent over the last three months as oil prices have shot to nearly $100 a barrel.But rising fuel costs have added to food inflation throughout the world, which “can also lead to unrest in emerging markets where they spend a much higher percentage of their income on food than in developed nations,” said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. The potential for turmoil was underlined last week as growing unrest in the Middle East spread to oil-rich Libya, helping oil prices to hit a new two-year high.That growing instability served as a “stark reminder of the political risks in the emerging markets,” said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.Mr. Ablin noted that so far this year, investors have not been rewarded for exposure to greater political risks abroad.THAT explains why a torrent of money has been fleeing the emerging markets of late. A survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that only 5 percent of professional fund managers were “overweight” on emerging-market stocks in February, meaning they held a greater stake in such shares than their investment strategy would normally call for. In January, that figure stood as high as 43 percent.Of course, it’s possible that the recent troubles in emerging-market stocks may eventually turn into a buying opportunity. But these stocks have trounced domestic equities for 15 years, so it may take a lot longer for prices to reset to attractive levels.'"
"'11-02-27,'0','The downside is that if an app doesn’t catch on, there is no money in it for the employees who developed it in their leisure time. This makes it a less attractive incentive than, for example, some of those at Google, which has a policy of permitting engineers to spend 20 percent of their paid time on projects of their own choosing that benefit the company.But the rule change at Microsoft change is a departure for a company that, like so many others, has traditionally wanted its engineers to give their all to their core jobs, said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor of management and engineering systems at the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is also a co-author of “Microsoft Secrets” and the author of the recent “Staying Power,” which has several chapters devoted to the company.“Engineers work all hours; they don’t punch a 9-to-5 clock,” Professor Cusumano said. “Normally, you want your employees to pour their passions into their jobs. If they do something else on the side, you don’t cheer them on.”Mr. Watson of Microsoft said the policy change emerged in part because of a push from his group. “We tend to have strict moonlighting rules,” he said of the company. “But we’ve changed those rules so developers can do this in their spare time, and have the financial benefit and outcome of the work.”The company is offering what Mr. Watson said was a standard split on app sales: 70 percent to the developers, 30 percent to Microsoft.The incentive seems to be helping. More than 3,000 employees have registered to submit apps, he said, and about 840 have been published so far.One is Bubblegum. It was written by a recently married couple, Sriram Krishnan, a program manager working on the company’s cloud computing platform, and Aarthi Ramamurthy, a program manager on the Xbox team.Mr. Krishnan said the app work was definitely done in their spare time. “We were on our honeymoon in Hawaii when we started working on it,” he said. “But we like to write code.” (They continued working on it during Christmas vacation last year.)Mr. Krishnan said that with the app, he wanted to be among the first to capture the Windows phone user base. He hopes the app will give rise to a mini-social network at its site, bubblegum.me, where users will be able to share photos. “The value will come from how many people are on it,” he said.He isn’t worried that his side projects might raise eyebrows at Microsoft, and he has already written a second app, a Web browser, for the Windows phone. “A check shows up, and I cash it. Microsoft is O.K. with that,” he said. “They have been hugely supportive.”MICROSOFT’S new rules fit into the broader rethinking of how large companies manage research, said Josh Lerner, a professor of investment banking at Harvard Business School. “Microsoft is not just rewarding people for what they do in their spare time,” he said, but is also “harnessing that energy to the company’s ends” to catch up in the mobile market.“It’s symptomatic of a larger transformation,” he said, as companies unlock more entrepreneurial activity, granting incentives and rewards to researchers in the hope they will stay put instead of moving to other companies.Professor Cusumano agrees that the change in rules encourages entrepreneurial activity. “Firms like Microsoft that stick around for decades need to reinvent themselves periodically,” he said.“Microsoft has been knocking their heads against a wall, building more and more bells and whistles for Windows that no one needs,” Professor Cusumano said. “Instead, they can use their staff this way. It’s a way to make every programmer a potential entrepreneur, and it also helps Microsoft gain momentum with its new mobile platform.”The rule change offers an option for employees who don’t want to leave for the insecurity of a start-up but still want recognition for ideas, said Daniel H. Pink, author of “Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.”“This is another way to say, ‘Work here, and you can have the best of both worlds,’ as an employee of an established company and also as an entrepreneur,” he said.'"
"'11-02-27,'0','FEW people ever penetrate the dark side of money, but Jules Kroll is one of them.Fortunes plundered, ransoms paid, deals cut — the uncovering of such secrets, and the million smaller confidences that are his history, have made Mr. Kroll a rich man.It was nearly 40 years ago, when he practically invented the business known as corporate intelligence, that he first came to the attention of crafty boardrooms. At a time when “private eye” still conjured images of cheating spouses and seedy hotels, Mr. Kroll built a sort of private C.I.A. and went corporate. If a Fortune 500 company or an A-list investment house wanted the dirt, it hired Kroll Inc. to dig it up.Which is why his latest venture seems at once so unusual and yet so very Kroll. At 69, an age when other multimillionaires are working on their backswings, he is getting into — of all things — the credit ratings business.Yes, credit ratings: gilt-edged triple-A’s, middling double-B’s, ignominious D’s. You might wonder why anyone pays attention to them anymore. After all, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 laid bare the conflicts at the heart of the ratings game. The world learned that the three dominant services — Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch — had stamped sterling ratings on mortgage investments that turned out to be nearly worthless. It was a lesson that nearly brought down the financial system.Ratings agencies, to many, seem like Wall Street’s enablers. What is Jules Kroll thinking? This is the man the Haitian government hired to track down financial assets linked to Jean-Claude Duvalier. The man Kuwait hired to ferret out the oil wealth of Saddam Hussein. One of Mr. Kroll’s cases, involving kidnapping, inspired the movie “Proof of Life,” and plans are in the works for HBO and Scott Rudin, the producer of “The Social Network,” to make a pilot for a television series loosely based on his exploits.Mr. Kroll says that if he can do all of that, why, he can get to the bottom of an investment security, too. He and his son Jeremy, 39, are staking the family name on a venture called Kroll Bond Ratings. They say the business will marry hard-nosed credit analysis with their trademark corporate sleuthing. Maybe the leading ratings agencies — a triumvirate some liken to an oligopoly — can learn a thing or two from the gumshoes of Wall Street.“They never really looked under the covers, which is what I have done all my life,” Mr. Kroll says. “If they were in any other business, they would be out of business.”THE pertinent question for Mr. Kroll is why anyone should listen to him on the subject. The fundamental problem with the dominant agencies, their critics say, is that they are paid by the companies whose securities they evaluate, under the so-called issuer-pay model.Some small ratings services have challenged the establishment by having investors — that is, the people who actually buy securities — pay for ratings. But for all his talk about shaking up this industry, Mr. Kroll is hewing to the status quo. Like Moody’s, S.& P. and Fitch, Kroll Bond Ratings will be paid by the issuers, just as the big three are.Wall Street types tend to look askance at credit ratings no matter who is providing them. Not even Warren E. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway owns about 12 percent of Moody’s, says he depends on ratings in making investment decisions. Mr. Buffett prefers to make his own judgments on companies, he said last year while appearing before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.But ratings services, despite their apparent failures, still play a crucial role in the capital markets. Virtually every investor, big or small, is affected by what they do. And even the pros have to pay attention, because ratings often figure into the investment guidelines of big money management firms, banks and insurance companies.Some wonder if Mr. Kroll is out of his depth this time.“What does he know about giving me a rating on a security?” asks Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities.Others aren’t so quick to write off Mr. Kroll. Michael F. Price, the prominent value investor, is bankrolling Kroll Bond Ratings. So is Frederick R. Adler, one of New York’s most successful venture capitalists. And William L. Mack, the big real estate investor. The venture capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners, RRE Ventures and New Markets Venture Partners have invested a combined $24 million in it. And Mr. Kroll has personally staked $5 million.That is pocket change by Wall Street standards. But Rob Stavis, a partner at Bessemer, says Kroll Bond Ratings could well pay off. “We often go after industries where there are significant incumbents when we believe they’re ripe for disruption,” he says. His firm was an early investor in Skype.Mr. Kroll, for his part, is thinking big — as he always has. He wants to grab 10 percent of this $4 billion-a-year industry within five years.But even that seemingly modest goal may be a reach. Moody’s and S.& P. each have about 40 percent of the ratings market. The remainder is spread among Fitch and several lesser-known agencies.“I think it’s a tough industry to break into, but if anyone can do it, it’s Jules Kroll,” says Michael Charkasky, the chief executive of Altegrity, which acquired Kroll Inc. last year. (Mr. Charkasky had worked for Kroll for more than a decade.)IN the aftermath of the Panic of 1907, a self-taught financial analyst named John Moody pioneered the idea of assigning ratings to public securities. For much of its history, the industry he founded was a relative backwater — a steady if unglamorous moneymaker that tended to attract wonks or analysts who might not land jobs at a Goldman or a Morgan.Then, in 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated rules that anointed a handful of Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations. The S.E.C. argued that assessing the safety of investments was so important to the soundness of the nation’s banks and brokerage firms that only respected ratings agencies should be allowed to do the job. In the early 1980s, there were seven of these organizations. By the mid-1990s, mergers had reduced that number to three. The S.E.C. has since added seven, bringing the total to 10.Kroll Bond Ratings is one of them.'"
"'11-02-27,'0','TOKYO (Reuters) — A Japanese governing party elder suggested Saturday that Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s resignation was an option to win opposition support for bills to enact a workable budget, adding to pressure on the unpopular leader as he struggles with a divided Parliament.Mr. Kan, whose public support ratings have fallen to about 20 percent, had already been facing pressure from inside and outside the governing Democratic Party either to quit or call a snap election to break a political deadlock that is keeping Japan from dealing with pressing problems including an enormous public debt.“We need to put top priority on the passage of the budget and related bills” over the Democratic Party or Prime Minister Kan, Kozo Watanabe, a senior adviser to the party, told reporters. But he added that as long as Mr. Kan wanted to stay on, it was the duty of party members to “protect” him.Rifts in the party, which deepened after its power broker, Ichiro Ozawa, was indicted last month on accusations that he had misreported political funds, have also weakened Mr. Kan’s grip on power and distracted the government from dealing with policy problems.On a television show earlier in the day, Mr. Watanabe, a veteran lawmaker, ruled out the chance of a snap election for Parliament’s powerful lower house, the Kyodo News Agency reported.'"
"'11-02-27,'0','But the international response has been limited, partly because the most promising remedies are intensely complicated and risky. Western powers, including the United States, have sent warships to cruise Somalia’s coast and discourage attacks. When a vessel is hijacked, ship owners cough up a ransom, nowadays in the neighborhood of $5 million, and most of that cost gets passed to the end user — consumers. Until recently, most hostages would emerge unharmed, albeit skinny and pale from being locked in a filthy room. The average time in captivity is around six months.But recently the pirates have been getting more vicious; reports have emerged of beatings, of being hung upside down, even of being forced at gunpoint to join in raids. And now the pirates have gunned down four Americans.“I think there’s going to be some type of retaliation,” said a European diplomat in Nairobi, Kenya, who trades ideas on anti-piracy strategies with other diplomats and was instructed not to speak publicly about the issues. “I could see the Americans going after the pirate bosses, the organizers, maybe even blockade some of the ports that they use,” he speculated. “I don’t think the Americans are going to invade Somalia, because of Iraq and Afghanistan, but they can use local allies.” Another obvious possibility would be American Special Forces, who have killed terrorism suspects in Somalia.The American government isn’t revealing its plans but officials suggest — as long as they are not quoted by name — that the killings of the four Americans could be a game-changer. “We get it,” said one State Department official. “We get the need to recalibrate.”Any course of action, however, will confront two huge obstacles: the immensity of the sea and the depth of chaos in Somalia.The pirates used to stick relatively close to Somalia’s shores. But now, using “mother ships” — hijacked vessels that serve as floating bases — they attack ships more than 1,000 miles away. Sometimes that puts them closer to India than to home. The red zone now covers more than one million square miles of water, an area naval officers say is impossible to control.Piracy Inc. is a sprawling operation on land, too. It offers work to tens of thousands of Somalis — middle-managers, translators, bookkeepers, mechanics, gunsmiths, guards, boat builders, women who sell tea to pirates, others who sell them goats. In one of the poorest lands on earth, piracy isn’t just a business; it’s a lifeline.And this gets to the real problem.“The root cause is state failure,” the American official said.Somalia’s central government collapsed more than 20 years ago, and now its landscape includes droughts, warlords, fighters allied to Al Qaeda, and malnutrition, suffering and death on a scale unseen just about anywhere else.The United States and other Western powers are pouring millions of dollars into Somalia’s transitional government, an appointed body with little legitimacy on the ground, in the hope, perhaps vain, that it can rebuild the world’s most failed state and create an economy based on something like fishing or livestock. Young men then might be able to earn a living doing something other than sticking up ships.But the transitional government has been divided, feckless and corrupt. Islamist rebels control much of the country. Few Somalis think the nation will stop being a war zone any time soon.The shipping industry seems to know this.“Until things change on land, you have to come down very hard on them at sea,” said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau in London.Shipping companies are frustrated, he said, because while many pirates are apprehended at sea by foreign navies, the vast majority are typically released unless they are caught in the act of a hijacking a ship — which is a very narrow window because once pirates control a vessel, it’s extremely dangerous to intervene.“The laws have to be amended,” Mr. Mody said. “Why would a skiff be 800 miles off Somalia with a rocket-propelled grenade, a ladder and extra barrels of fuel? What are they doing? Fishing? These people need to be arrested and prosecuted.”The last resort is military action. Many people ask: Why not storm ashore and attack the pirate bases? These dens are well known. I even visited one last year and met a pirate boss who was using millions of dollars in ransoms to build a land-based army that at first glance looked more disciplined and better equipped than Somalia’s national army.But the military option would not be pretty. The 800 or so captured seamen could be used as human shields. And no Western country has shown an appetite to send troops to Somalia, not after the Black Hawk Down fiasco of 1993, when ragtag Somali militiamen downed two American helicopters and killed 18 elite American troops. And a military attack could easily backfire. “They might kill a few pirates, but more would certainly spring up to replace them,” said Bronwyn Bruton, who wrote a widely discussed essay on Somalia. “The replacements would probably be even angrier and more violent.” In her essay, she advised the international community to essentially pull out and let Somalis sort out their problems on their own.She added that collateral damage from a raid could be severe and “a lot of civilian casualties could actually wind up aggravating a much bigger security threat to the U.S. — terrorism.”So it seems that Jefferson may have had an easier piracy problem to solve.“I can offer a couple thoughts based on the U.S.’s dealing with pirates more than 200 years ago,” Mr. Lambert said. “If the U.S. response is a vigorous military response, it is likely to be difficult, costly, and prolonged” — a reference to the war that followed bombardment of the coast.But, he warned, “If it is a continuation of the present policy (whatever that is), it is almost a certainty that we will see more or perhaps escalated atrocities. ‘’'"
"'11-02-27,'0','In any case, these unusual evening hours passed easily, and I often fell asleep right there on the sofa, dragging myself to bed only much later, usually at some point in the middle of the night. Then, after what always seemed mere minutes of sleep, I was jarred awake by the beeping of the alarm clock on my cellphone, which was set to a bizarre marimba-like arrangement of “O Tannenbaum.” In these first few moments of consciousness, in the sudden glare of morning light, my mind raced around itself, remembering fragments of dreams or pieces of the book I had been reading before I fell asleep. It was to break the monotony of those evenings that, two or three days each week after work, and on at least one of the weekend days, I went out walking.At first, I encountered the streets as an incessant loudness, a shock after the day’s focus and relative tranquillity, as though someone had shattered the calm of a silent private chapel with the blare of a TV set. I wove my way through crowds of shoppers and workers, through road constructions and the horns of taxicabs. Walking through busy parts of town meant I laid eyes on more people, hundreds more, thousands even, than I was accustomed to seeing in the course of a day, but the impress of these countless faces did nothing to assuage my feelings of isolation; if anything, it intensified them. I became more tired, too, after the walks began, an exhaustion unlike any I had known since the first months of internship, three years earlier. One night, I simply went on and on, walking all the way down to Houston Street, a distance of some seven miles, and found myself in a state of disorienting fatigue, laboring to remain on my feet. That night I took the subway home, and instead of falling asleep immediately, I lay in bed, too tired to release myself from wakefulness, and I rehearsed in the dark the numerous incidents and sights I had encountered while roaming, sorting each encounter like a child playing with wooden blocks, trying to figure out which belonged where, which responded to which. Each neighborhood of the city appeared to be made of a different substance, each seemed to have a different air pressure, a different psychic weight: the bright lights and shuttered shops, the housing projects and luxury hotels, the fire escapes and city parks. My futile task of sorting went on until the forms began to morph into each other and assume abstract shapes unrelated to the real city, and only then did my hectic mind finally show some pity and still itself, only then did dreamless sleep arrive.The walks met a need: they were a release from the tightly regulated mental environment of work, and once I discovered them as therapy, they became the normal thing, and I forgot what life had been like before I started walking. Work was a regimen of perfection and competence, and it neither allowed improvisation nor tolerated mistakes. As interesting as my research project was — I was conducting a clinical study of affective disorders in the elderly — the level of detail it demanded was of an intricacy that exceeded anything else I had done thus far. The streets served as a welcome opposite to all that. Every decision — where to turn left, how long to remain lost in thought in front of an abandoned building, whether to watch the sun set over New Jersey, or to lope in the shadows on the East Side looking across to Queens — was inconsequential, and was for that reason a reminder of freedom. I covered the city blocks as though measuring them with my stride, and the subway stations served as recurring motives in my aimless progress. The sight of large masses of people hurrying down into underground chambers was perpetually strange to me, and I felt that all of the human race were rushing, pushed by a counterinstinctive death drive, into movable catacombs. Aboveground I was with thousands of others in their solitude, but in the subway, standing close to strangers, jostling them and being jostled by them for space and breathing room, all of us reenacting unacknowledged traumas, the solitude intensified.One Sunday morning in November, after a trek through the relatively quiet streets on the Upper West Side, I arrived at the large, sun-brightened plaza at Columbus Circle. The area had changed recently. It had become a more commercial and tourist destination thanks to the pair of buildings erected for the Time Warner corporation on the site. The buildings, constructed at great speed, had just opened, and were filled with shops selling tailored shirts, designer suits, jewelry, appliances for the gourmet cook, handmade leather accessories, and imported decorative items. On the upper floors were some of the costliest restaurants in the city, advertising truffles, caviar, Kobe beef, and pricey “tasting menus.” Above the restaurants were apartments that included the most expensive residence in the city. Curiosity had brought me into the shops on the ground level once or twice before, but the cost of the items, and what I perceived as the generally snobbish atmosphere, had kept me from returning until that Sunday morning.It was the day of the New York Marathon. I hadn’t known. I was taken aback to see the round plaza in front of the glass towers filled with people, a massive, expectant throng setting itself into place close to the marathon’s finish line. The crowd lined the street leading away from the plaza toward the east. Nearer the west there was a bandstand, on which two men with guitars were tuning up, calling and responding to the silvery notes on each other’s amplified in- struments. Banners, signs, posters, flags, and streamers of all kinds flapped in the wind, and mounted police on blindered horses regulated the crowd with cordons, whistles, and hand movements. The cops were in dark blue and wore sunshades. The crowd was brightly attired, and looking at all that green, red, yellow, and white synthetic material in the sun hurt the eyes. To escape the din, which seemed to be mounting, I decided to go into the shopping center. In addition to the Armani and Hugo Boss shops, there was a bookshop on the second floor. In there, I thought, I might catch some quiet and drink a cup of coffee before heading back home. But the entrance was full of the crowd overflow from the street, and cordons made it impossible to get into the towers.I changed my mind, and decided instead to visit an old teacher of mine who lived in the vicinity, in an apartment less than ten minutes’ walk away on Central Park South. Professor Saito was, at eighty-nine, the oldest person I knew. He had taken me under his wing when I was a junior at Maxwell. By that time he was already emeritus, though he continued to come to campus every day. He must have seen something in me that made him think I was someone on whom his rarefied subject (early English literature) would not be wasted. I was a disappointment in this regard, but he was kindhearted and, even after I failed to get a decent grade in his English Literature before Shakespeare seminar, invited me to meet with him several times in his office. He had, in those days, recently installed an intrusively loud coffee machine, so we drank coffee, and talked: about interpretations of Beowulf, and then later on about the classics, the endless labor of scholarship, the various consolations of academia, and of his studies just before the Second World War. This last subject was so total in its distance from my experience that it was perhaps of most interest to me. The war had broken out just as he was finishing his D.Phil, and he was forced to leave England and return to his family in the Pacific Northwest. With them, shortly afterward, he was taken to internment in the Minidoka Camp in Idaho.In these conversations, as I now recall them, he did almost all the talking. I learned the art of listening from him, and the ability to trace out a story from what was omitted. Rarely did Professor Saito tell me anything about his family, but he did tell me about his life as a scholar, and about how he had responded to important issues of his day. He’d done an annotated translation of Piers Plowman in the 1970s, which had turned out to be his most notable academic success. When he mentioned it, he did so with a curious mixture of pride and disappointment. He alluded to another big project (he didn’t say on what) that had never been completed. He spoke, too, about departmental politics. I remember one afternoon that was taken up with his recollection of a onetime colleague whose name meant nothing to me when he said it and which I don’t remember now. This woman had become famous for her activism during the civil rights era and had, for a moment, been such a campus celebrity that her literature classes overflowed. He described her as an intelligent, sensitive individual but someone with whom he could never agree. He admired and disliked her. It’s a puzzle, I remember him saying, she was a good scholar, and she was on the right side of the struggles of the time, but I simply couldn’t stand her in person. She was abrasive and egotistical, heaven rest her soul. You can’t say a word against her around here, though. She’s still considered a saint.After we became friends, I made it a point to see Professor Saito two or three times each semester, and those meetings became cherished highlights of my last two years at Maxwell. I came to view him as a grandfatherly figure entirely unlike either of my own grandfathers (only one of whom I’d known). I felt I had more in common with him than with the people who happened to be related to me. After graduation, when I left, first for my research stint at Cold Spring Harbor, and then to medical school in Madison, we lost touch with each other. We exchanged one or two letters, but it was hard to have our conversations in that medium, since news and updates were not the real substance of our interaction. But after I returned to the city for internship, I saw him several times. The first, entirely by accident — though it happened on a day when I had been thinking about him — was just outside a grocery store not far from Central Park South, where he had gone out walking with the aid of an assistant. Later on, I showed up unannounced at his apartment, as he had invited me to do, and found that he still maintained the same open-door policy he had back when he had his office at the college. The coffee machine from that office now sat disused in a corner of the room. Professor Saito told me he had prostate cancer. It wasn’t entirely debilitating, but he had stopped going to campus, and had begun to hold court at home.

As the head of her publicity firm, Chasen & Company, she also advised studios on strategies for marketing movies and winning awards, particularly those involving music; organized promotional parties; and badgered journalists to do stories about her clients, never taking offense if they said no but not letting that deter her from calling again, and again — and again.“She was very, very, very devoted to her clients,” Mr. Cagle said. “She just really needed you to know that Hans Zimmer walked on water.”It wasn’t only journalists with whom she was persistent. “Relentless” and “dogged” are adjectives employed so frequently to describe Ms. Chasen and her working methods that they might serve as an unofficial epitaph. “There would literally be times at events where I’d hide behind a plant or a pillar because she’d be coming,” Ms. Press said, laughing. “You couldn’t get away from her until you agreed to do what she wanted.”Friends, clients and associates remain shocked by the randomness of her death. She was shot shortly after midnight while driving on a Beverly Hills side street in her black Mercedes-Benz. Following an investigation, the Beverly Hills police announced last month that Ms. Chasen’s death came during a bungled robbery attempt by a bicycle-riding assailant, Harold Martin Smith, 43. An ex-convict, he fatally shot himself on Dec. 1 as police officers approached him for questioning.At the time of her death, Ms. Chasen was headed home after attending a premiere and party for “Burlesque.” She was there because the songwriter Diane Warren, a longtime client, had written “You Haven’t Seen the Last of Me,” a tune belted out by Cher in the film. Ms. Chasen was hopeful about Ms. Warren’s award chances. “Ronni was a fierce believer in those who were lucky enough to work with her,” Ms. Warren said in an e-mail.Indeed, Ms. Warren’s composition won the Golden Globe award for best song last month. But it failed to nab an Oscar nomination, a circumstance that some of Ms. Chasen’s colleagues attribute to her absence from the scene. “I find it hard to believe that Diane Warren’s song wouldn’t have been nominated if Ronni had been alive,” Ms. Press said. (The snub is not unprecedented, however: In 2009, Bruce Springsteen’s song “The Wrestler,” from the film of the same name, won a Globe but missed an Oscar nomination.)Ms. Warren paid heartfelt tribute to Ms. Chasen upon accepting her Globe. “I want to dedicate this to someone a lot of you knew and all of us loved, to Ronni Chasen,” she said from the stage. Before she had finished the sentence, the audience erupted in applause.“The entire room went there even before Diane did,” said Chip Sullivan, the head of publicity at DreamWorks Studios. “Every table was going, ‘Ronni would be so thrilled right now!’ ”Ms. Chasen was a character, which is part of what made her so memorable and why she is missed. She knew everyone, and friends said she never bad-mouthed anyone. A petite blonde with sleek blown-out hair, boundless energy and a wicked sense of humor, she was pushy, but in an endearing way. She never, for example, settled for the first table she was given at a restaurant. “Doesn’t it feel a little drafty?” she’d say to a dinner mate as she signaled the maître d’hôtel over to make a switch.Judy Cairo, a producer for whom Ms. Chasen worked on behalf of “Crazy Heart” (2009), said: “You could walk into any party, any function, any studio, and Ronni could tell you every person in the room, their history, filmography and why they were important for you. Then she’d introduce you to them.”During awards season, she regularly schmoozed with Academy voters — she was a voter herself — talking up her movies and clients but also taking readings on how the races were shaping up. Ms. Chasen was so dedicated to gathering intelligence that, knowing that the players at a neighbor’s weekly poker night were members of the Academy, she’d drop by the game to survey how they were leaning.According to Jeff Sanderson, Ms. Chasen’s business associate, the firm’s clients garnered at least 150 Oscar nominations, and seven films it represented won the best-picture award.RONNI SUE COHEN was born in New York, where her parents were real estate brokers. She fell in love with show business early, said her older brother, Larry Cohen, a film producer and director.“I took her, when she was 5 or 6, to the rodeo at Madison Square Garden and she shook hands with Dale Evans,” he said. “On the subway home, she kept telling everyone, ‘I touched the Queen of the West.’ That was her first celebrity contact and the beginning of it all.”She majored in journalism at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., gave acting and modeling a quick whirl (ditto for an early, brief marriage) and then switched to publicity.She soon headed to Los Angeles, changed her last name to Chasen and joined the public relations firm Rogers & Cowan, where she represented clients like Natalie Wood and Allan Carr, the producer of “Grease.” In 1989, she started her own boutique firm, where her client roster included producers (Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck, Irwin Winkler and Donald De Line), directors and screenwriters (Jim Sheridan, Robin Swicord and Walter Hill) and, especially, composers and songwriters.“Ronni was the first publicist who actively tried to expose the work of film composers to the public,” Mr. Zimmer said in an e-mail. (She also spent a year, in 1993, as the head of publicity at MGM/UA before reactivating Chasen & Company.) At the time of her death, she had three full-time staff members working with her at an office in Beverly Hills, including Mr. Sanderson.Nearly 1,000 people attended her memorial service at Hillside Memorial chapel in Los Angeles. “Her funeral would have stunned her; I think she would have been speechless — for the first time in her life,” Ms. Berlin said.Even the famously abrasive Mel Gibson sent flowers. “The card said: ‘I’ll never forget you. Love, Mel.’ I didn’t even know that she knew Mel,” Mr. Cohen said.The love keeps coming. In addition to Ms. Warren’s shout-out at the Golden Globes, Ms. Chasen’s picture appeared in the “In Memoriam” montage at this month’s Grammy Awards (though her first name was misspelled as “Ronnie”). And, while a spokeswoman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said she couldn’t confirm it, Mr. Cohen said he had been told that his sister is to be included in a similar tribute to industry figures who died in the past year in the Oscar telecast.Ms. Chasen would have been thrilled to be included, albeit less so about having her age publicized. Ms. Berlin said, “I don’t think she ever lied, but she didn’t tell, either.”'"

"'11-02-27,'0','If you’re keeping score, in a legal sense, the new standards are a response to a 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. E.P.A. that compelled the agency to regulate the emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, to comply with the Clean Air Act.The stated goal of the latest CAFE regulations is to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of cars and light trucks to an average of 250 grams per mile by 2016 — an 18 percent reduction from the current fleet average of 305 grams per mile. Carbon dioxide emissions equate directly to fuel mileage: 250 grams per mile translates to 35.5 miles per gallon (based on the N.H.T.S.A. tests used in CAFE calculations, which yield numbers significantly higher than the current E.P.A. city and highway window-sticker ratings).While the purpose is to help blunt the effects of climate change, the new CAFE standards will also nudge drivers toward another long-stated national goal: decreasing dependence on foreign oil. Recent tumult in the Middle East increases the urgency of this dream, a target of every president since Richard M. Nixon. And there is definitely room for improvement: in 2009, the United States imported 51 percent of the oil it consumed.The E.P.A. says that the vehicles covered by these rules account for about 40 percent of total oil use in the United States. Assuming the 2012-16 standards remain unchanged, by 2030, the E.P.A. predicts, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles will have been reduced by a total of 21 percent. According to the E.P.A., and repeated by President Obama, that adds up, over the expected lifetime of the vehicles covered, to a saving of 1.8 billion barrels of oil.The E.P.A. also projects that the total savings will be about $240 billion, versus a cost of $52 billion in increased vehicle prices, a projected average cost of about $950 per vehicle. Net savings — fuel savings minus initial vehicle cost — will, according to the E.P.A., average out to more than $3,000 over the life of each car or light truck.These regulations are a rare example of nearly universal agreement among the major automakers. The Union of Concerned Scientists, well known for its concern over global warming, signed on, too — it actually helped to write the standards. These rules are written to accommodate cars and light trucks of all currently produced sizes and shapes, with each vehicle’s footprint — the area of the rectangle enclosed between the centers of its wheels — determining its mileage target.While an ascetic compact like the Honda Fit, with a footprint of just 40 square feet, will be required to average 41.1 m.p.g. by 2016, a bulging Chevy Silverado pickup, with a footprint of 67 square feet, will have to achieve only a 24.7 m.p.g. average.The new standards also mean the end of separate emissions requirements for vehicles sold in California and the states that have followed its lead. This is no small matter to automakers, who can now plan years into the future knowing that the mileage and emissions regulations their vehicles must pass will not change from year to year or ZIP code to ZIP code.Passenger cars — which, according to the E.P.A., will average around 33.8 m.p.g. for 2012 — will improve to around 39.5 m.p.g. by 2016. Light trucks — including S.U.V.’s and minivans — will average about 25.7 m.p.g. for 2012 and will be pushed to average 29.8 m.p.g. by 2016.These footprint-based goals will be stepped up evenly over the four-year ramp-up period, giving manufacturers time to phase in mileage-enhancing improvements with model changes.One major reason the carmakers seem enthusiastic about getting with this gas-saving program is that most of them were already headed, in a design and marketing sense, right where the government is telling them to go. Nearly every volume manufacturer is promoting improved mileage as an important sales feature.The E.P.A. and N.H.T.S.A. have also built in enough exceptions to the rules — some might call them loopholes — big enough to drive a full-size pickup through.The E.P.A. created what it calls program flexibilities that will help manufacturers comply more easily, especially in the first few years of the new standards. Each manufacturer will have its own CAFE goal, based on the mix of vehicles it actually sells. And a system of averaging, banking and trading credits will let makers conserve any extra credits earned in one year and apply them to other years if they need to. The E.P.A. will also let companies trade these credits with each other.For the near future, electric-powered and fuel-cell vehicles will get a free pass: a zero-grams-per-mile carbon dioxide rating. Plug-in hybrids like the Chevrolet Volt will also be rated at zero for the percentage of miles they run on electricity from the power grid rather than burning gasoline.Automakers get to count their first 200,000 electric-powered vehicles this way, or a total of 300,000 if they sell 25,000 or more of them in the 2012 model year, an incentive to make and sell them as soon as possible. After those numbers are reached, the E.P.A. will rate subsequent vehicles from that maker on the carbon dioxide actually produced in generating the grid electricity they use.So keep a lookout at the end of the 2012 model year: there may be a manufacturer or two that needs to push its electric-powered sales over the 25,000 mark and may be willing to take a loss on the last few 2012 electrics and plug-in hybrids to get there.Manufacturers with limited, plus-size model lines — Land Rover, for instance — will be given extra time to work their way into compliance. And compliance will be deferred completely for tiny makers like Ferrari and Rolls-Royce, which sell fewer than 5,000 vehicles a year in the United States. The E.P.A. is figuring out how to nudge these niche makers into better carbon dioxide performance without wreaking havoc in their model lines, dealer networks and fan bases.What will the American auto fleet look like in 2016? Probably not much different from how it looks today. Simple, software-dependent technologies, like auto stop-start, which shuts off the engine during long stops, will become common. Systems that deactivate some cylinders during steady cruising, as seen on some Chrysler, G.M. and Honda models, will proliferate.BMW recently announced that a frugal direct-injection 4-cylinder will be available in some smaller models. The Hyundai Sonata no longer offers a V-6 option; instead a turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder is available; the engineers managed to squeeze 274 horsepower from the smaller engine. Advanced low-pollution diesels are likely to gain increased acceptance as they have in Europe, where squeezing the last kilometer out of a liter of fuel has been a way of life for decades.Simple tricks like grille louvers that close automatically, as seen on the new Ford Focus and Chevy Cruze Eco, will reduce aerodynamic drag at higher speeds. The number of gears in automatic transmissions will continue to increase. Seven- and 8-speed transmissions are now becoming common, allowing smoother driving and better acceleration while reducing engine revs at cruising speeds.And electrics, hybrids and plug-in hybrids will, of course, become increasingly prevalent as hybrid and battery technology advances.Will the course of climate change be affected? It will be decades, maybe centuries, before the answer can be known. But we’ll no longer be able to say that nobody’s doing anything about it.'"

"'11-02-27,'0','The increase does not apply to F.H.A. loans already in place, or to F.H.A. reverse mortgages or home-equity conversion (HECM) loans.According to the housing administration, the new rate structure would raise the cost of a $157,000 mortgage, a typical F.H.A. loan amount, by about $33 a month, or $396 a year. The agency requires that all borrowers of loans it insures pay the premium. Consumers with non-F.H.A. loans who put down less than 20 percent are typically required by their lenders to take out private mortgage insurance, to insure the lender against the risk of default.F.H.A. loans are typically taken out by those who cannot qualify under the stiffer down-payment and credit-score requirements of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government-controlled buyers of most loans.The housing agency requires at least 3.5 percent, while Fannie Mae typically requires 5 to 15 percent, or more. Last November, F.H.A. began requiring a minimum credit score of 500, and for credit scores below 580 — a level at which Fannie and Freddie do not back loans — a 10 percent down payment.Last year, more than 19 percent of all residential mortgages, and more than 30 percent of all home purchases, were made with F.H.A. loans. In 2005, F.H.A. loans made up just over 4 percent of residential mortgages, and nearly 5.6 percent of home purchases.Since the mortgage crisis began in 2008, “F.H.A. has been the only haven for borrowers,” said Sean Welsh, a senior loan officer at Campbell Financial Services in West Haven, Conn.But the agency’s capital reserves have fallen below levels mandated by Congress, which is why the rise in the annual insurance premium was authorized.Mr. Welsh said the increase, while “not too bad,” was still “additional pain” atop the November change.F.H.A. loans used to be the province of niche lenders, but in recent years big banks have entered the market in a big way.In fact, Wells Fargo recently lowered its minimum required credit score for an F.H.A. loan to 500 from 600. The bank also reduced its required debt-to-income ratio, or the amount of a borrower’s gross monthly income that can go toward paying off debt, to 43 percent. For lower-credit F.H.A. borrowers, the bank raised its minimum down payment to 10 percent.“We don’t anticipate a significant impact on individual consumers from the mortgage insurance premium hike,” said Tom Goyda, a Wells Fargo spokesman. “F.H.A. is still an important source of funding for first-time home buyers and those who don’t have a lot for a down payment.”'"

"'11-02-28,'1','FEW people ever penetrate the dark side of money, but Jules Kroll is one of them.Fortunes plundered, ransoms paid, deals cut — the uncovering of such secrets, and the million smaller confidences that are his history, have made Mr. Kroll a rich man.It was nearly 40 years ago, when he practically invented the business known as corporate intelligence, that he first came to the attention of crafty boardrooms. At a time when “private eye” still conjured images of cheating spouses and seedy hotels, Mr. Kroll built a sort of private C.I.A. and went corporate. If a Fortune 500 company or an A-list investment house wanted the dirt, it hired Kroll Inc. to dig it up.Which is why his latest venture seems at once so unusual and yet so very Kroll. At 69, an age when other multimillionaires are working on their backswings, he is getting into — of all things — the credit ratings business.Yes, credit ratings: gilt-edged triple-A’s, middling double-B’s, ignominious D’s. You might wonder why anyone pays attention to them anymore. After all, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 laid bare the conflicts at the heart of the ratings game. The world learned that the three dominant services — Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch — had stamped sterling ratings on mortgage investments that turned out to be nearly worthless. It was a lesson that nearly brought down the financial system.Ratings agencies, to many, seem like Wall Street’s enablers. What is Jules Kroll thinking? This is the man the Haitian government hired to track down financial assets linked to Jean-Claude Duvalier. The man Kuwait hired to ferret out the oil wealth of Saddam Hussein. One of Mr. Kroll’s cases, involving kidnapping, inspired the movie “Proof of Life,” and plans are in the works for HBO and Scott Rudin, the producer of “The Social Network,” to make a pilot for a television series loosely based on his exploits.Mr. Kroll says that if he can do all of that, why, he can get to the bottom of an investment security, too. He and his son Jeremy, 39, are staking the family name on a venture called Kroll Bond Ratings. They say the business will marry hard-nosed credit analysis with their trademark corporate sleuthing. Maybe the leading ratings agencies — a triumvirate some liken to an oligopoly — can learn a thing or two from the gumshoes of Wall Street.“They never really looked under the covers, which is what I have done all my life,” Mr. Kroll says. “If they were in any other business, they would be out of business.”THE pertinent question for Mr. Kroll is why anyone should listen to him on the subject. The fundamental problem with the dominant agencies, their critics say, is that they are paid by the companies whose securities they evaluate, under the so-called issuer-pay model.Some small ratings services have challenged the establishment by having investors — that is, the people who actually buy securities — pay for ratings. But for all his talk about shaking up this industry, Mr. Kroll is hewing to the status quo. Like Moody’s, S.& P. and Fitch, Kroll Bond Ratings will be paid by the issuers, just as the big three are.Wall Street types tend to look askance at credit ratings no matter who is providing them. Not even Warren E. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway owns about 12 percent of Moody’s, says he depends on ratings in making investment decisions. Mr. Buffett prefers to make his own judgments on companies, he said last year while appearing before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.But ratings services, despite their apparent failures, still play a crucial role in the capital markets. Virtually every investor, big or small, is affected by what they do. And even the pros have to pay attention, because ratings often figure into the investment guidelines of big money management firms, banks and insurance companies.Some wonder if Mr. Kroll is out of his depth this time.“What does he know about giving me a rating on a security?” asks Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities.Others aren’t so quick to write off Mr. Kroll. Michael F. Price, the prominent value investor, is bankrolling Kroll Bond Ratings. So is Frederick R. Adler, one of New York’s most successful venture capitalists. And William L. Mack, the big real estate investor. The venture capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners, RRE Ventures and New Markets Venture Partners have invested a combined $24 million in it. And Mr. Kroll has personally staked $5 million.That is pocket change by Wall Street standards. But Rob Stavis, a partner at Bessemer, says Kroll Bond Ratings could well pay off. “We often go after industries where there are significant incumbents when we believe they’re ripe for disruption,” he says. His firm was an early investor in Skype.Mr. Kroll, for his part, is thinking big — as he always has. He wants to grab 10 percent of this $4 billion-a-year industry within five years.But even that seemingly modest goal may be a reach. Moody’s and S.& P. each have about 40 percent of the ratings market. The remainder is spread among Fitch and several lesser-known agencies.“I think it’s a tough industry to break into, but if anyone can do it, it’s Jules Kroll,” says Michael Charkasky, the chief executive of Altegrity, which acquired Kroll Inc. last year. (Mr. Charkasky had worked for Kroll for more than a decade.)IN the aftermath of the Panic of 1907, a self-taught financial analyst named John Moody pioneered the idea of assigning ratings to public securities. For much of its history, the industry he founded was a relative backwater — a steady if unglamorous moneymaker that tended to attract wonks or analysts who might not land jobs at a Goldman or a Morgan.Then, in 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated rules that anointed a handful of Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations. The S.E.C. argued that assessing the safety of investments was so important to the soundness of the nation’s banks and brokerage firms that only respected ratings agencies should be allowed to do the job. In the early 1980s, there were seven of these organizations. By the mid-1990s, mergers had reduced that number to three. The S.E.C. has since added seven, bringing the total to 10.Kroll Bond Ratings is one of them.'"
"'11-02-28,'1','A victory for “The King’s Speech” put the Oscar in the hands of a team of producers — Iain Canning, Emile Sherman and Gareth Unwin — from Britain and Australia. But the triumph belonged to Harvey Weinstein, a master campaigner whose Weinstein Company distributed the film in the United States. Mr. Weinstein, who left Miramax Films in 2005 with his brother Bob to form the Weinstein Company, last had a best picture with the musical “Chicago,” released by Miramax in 2002.Mr. Firth made a deep verbal bow in the direction of Mr. Weinstein. “Of course, Harvey, who first took me on 20 years ago when I was a mere child sensation,” he said in extending his thanks.Melissa Leo won best supporting actress for her portrayal of the chain-saw-tough matriarch in “The Fighter.” “Truly wow,” said Ms. Leo, before beginning a rambling and emotional speech that contained profanity. “I’m just shaking in my boots here,” she said. Asked by reporters backstage about the “stretching and stretching and stretching” done by the actor Kirk Douglas in his introduction and presentation, she replied: “He was doing us all a huge favor. The longer he strung it out, the calmer I got to be.”“The Fighter” also scored in the supporting actor category, with an emotional Christian Bale, a first-time nominee, winning for his portrayal of a lovable crack addict and former boxer.Mr. Sorkin, who won his first Oscar for his adapted screenplay for “The Social Network,” awkwardly spoke through music for a good share of his acceptance speech, which included a shout-out to his agents “who never blow my cover and reveal that I would do it for free.” Two titans of industrial rock, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, won best score for their work on that film.In an expected victory, “In a Better World,” about families and their intertwined lives in Denmark and Africa, took best foreign-language film. Pixar won the best animated feature Oscar, for “Toy Story 3,” with its director, Lee Unkrich, accepting the trophy. Randy Newman, a winner for his song “We Belong Together,” from “Toy Story 3,” said he really didn’t want to bore the audience with gratitude. “I want to be good television so badly, as you can see,” said Mr. Newman, who reckoned he had been nominated 20 times and won just twice.Unlike their tight-lipped approach of previous years, executives of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had allowed telecast details to pour onto blogs in the days leading up to the telecast, setting up the prospect of a show lacking suspense. For instance, the world was told last week, courtesy primarily of Deadline.com, that the show would open with a humorous video montage of the two youthful hosts, Anne Hathaway and James Franco, putting themselves into scenes from the 10 best picture nominees.And it did, with Ms. Hathaway and Mr. Franco learning how to go into people’s dreams (like in “Inception”), practicing to throw a punch with Mark Wahlberg (of “The Fighter”) and, trading cowboy jokes with Jeff Bridges (a nominee for “True Grit.”). The seven-minute montage ended, somewhat inexplicably, with a segment from the 1985 movie “Back to the Future.”The ceremony was shorter than in years past, clocking in at about 3 hours 12 minutes.The Academy also demystified its own ritual by opening its show to live streams, Twitter feeds and other behind-the-scenes moments that sometimes diminished the magic. Commentators like the journalist and critic Ben Mankiewicz were booked to discuss the odds on the official red carpet program, describing Mr. Firth as a lock for best actor and Ms. Portman a sure bet for best actress. The net effect was to make the show itself feel a little superfluous.In keeping with the “settled business” nature of the proceedings, the show producers actually played Mr. Firth’s climactic speech from “The King’s Speech” over a montage of scenes from the film’s competitors — as if they knew what was in that last envelope.Hollywood has continued to talk about a need to shorten the awards season, which currently gets started with the Toronto International Film Festival in early September and grinds through Oscar night, a half-year later. Though no change is planned next year, the Academy , which grants the Oscars, has said it might consider moving the show to as early as January in the future.This year’s Oscar cycle pitted young against old — the college students of “The Social Network” versus the World War II-era royals of “The King’s Speech.” The same was true in the acting categories, with Ms. Portman vying against Annette Bening (“The Kids Are All Right”) and Mr. Franco (“127 Hours”) competing against veterans like Mr. Firth.Oscar organizers played up this divide at the ceremony, which started as a heavily produced mash-up that touched on “Ben-Hur” and “Gone With the Wind” along with “Inception” and “Black Swan.” In a move that prompted some head scratching in Hollywood, producers picked two relatively untested stars — Mr. Franco, 32, and Ms. Hathaway, 28 — as hosts. To provide generational counterbalance, the mothers of nominees, called “mominees” in an Academy news release, were asked to participate (they commented on Twitter and appeared in videos), and old-school stars like Nicole Kidman, Helen Mirren and Tom Hanks were lined up to present.Ms. Hathaway used her hosting duties to show off her range, singing a Broadway-style number and even cracking an ad-lib joke after Kirk Douglas’s appearance. (“It’s the young and hip Oscars!”) Mr. Franco, on the other hand, at times appeared ill at ease and offered up one of the more awkward moments of the night, appearing in full drag. (Marilyn Monroe circa “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."") “The weird part is, I just got a text message from Charlie Sheen,” Mr. Franco said to nervous laughter from the crowd.In a high-risk move, the academy brought in Billy Crystal for a monologue halfway through the show. The audience jumped to its feet, as Mr. Crystal, a beloved past host, brought a whiff of the seemingly impromptu Vaudeville spirit that marked successful past shows. “So, where was I?” cracked Mr. Crystal, before going into some schtick that wound up with some video of Bob Hope, an even more revered host from the past.About 41.3 million people in the United States watched the Oscars ceremony last year, a 14 percent increase from the year before. The increase was mostly attributed to the Academy’s somewhat controversial decision to double the number of best-picture nominees to 10, opening the door to popular pictures like “The Blind Side,” “Up” and “District 9.”Preshow here at the Kodak Theater on Sunday, the red carpet came alive with a strong turnout of stars and executives, some of whom in past years avoided the ceremony in silent protest over of the Academy’s turn away from splashy, big-budget pictures in favor of the arty and small. The weather played along, but just barely. Frost advisories and hail, both highly unusual for Southern California, were a subject of cocktail party chatter over the weekend.'"
"'11-02-28,'1','¶Barnes & Noble, New York, selected Mullen, Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to handle the creative and media duties for its account. The assignment, with spending that could total an estimated $40 million, had been handled by Merkley & Partners, New York, part of the Omnicom Group. Mullen’s work is likely to be focused on Nook, the Barnes & Noble e-reader.¶Petco, San Diego, expanded its relationship with the Irvine, Calif., office of DraftFCB, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, by naming DraftFCB as agency of record for brand and product advertising. Spending last year was estimated at $16.8 million. Petco hired DraftFCB last year to work on projects; the company’s previous creative agency was the Los Angeles office of M&C Saatchi. Another Interpublic agency, Initiative, was recently chosen to handle the Petco media account.¶Two senior executives joined Ad Store, New York, as partners and co-owners. Gunnar P. Wilmot was named chief executive; he has held senior management posts at agencies like Gotham. Kevin Moehlenkamp was named chief creative officer; he has held senior creative posts at agencies like Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos. The executives assume duties from Paul Cappelli, the owner of Ad Store, who becomes chairman, a new post. Mr. Cappelli also becomes a minority shareholder of Ad Store as Mr. Wilmot and Mr. Moehlenkamp take a majority stake.¶Beth Ann Kaminkow, president and chief operating officer at TracyLocke, part of the Omnicom Group, was named president and chief executive. As chief executive, she assumes duties from Ron Askew, who remains chairman. Stewart Campbell, chief financial officer, will assume Ms. Kaminkow’s duties as chief operating officer. Ms. Kaminkow, who will continue to divide her time between the TracyLocke offices in Wilton, Conn., and Dallas, becomes the agency’s first female chief executive.¶Nick Bandy, chief operating officer at Engauge, Columbus, Ohio, was named chief executive, succeeding Rick Milenthal, who becomes executive chairman, a new post. Although the post of chief operating officer will not be filled, Jeff Hillmire will take on many of its duties as he becomes president, a new post, while continuing as chief digital officer.'"
"'11-02-28,'1','The number of kidneys available for transplants falls far short of the need, so there is no choice but to ration them. An emotionally difficult proposal to change the first-come-first-served transplant system makes good sense.There are nearly 90,000 people on waiting lists to receive kidney transplants, and in 2009 there were only some 10,400 kidneys from dead donors to give them. And about 6,300 kidneys were transplanted from living people who donated one of their two kidneys and usually specified the recipient.Currently the kidneys from dead donors are provided, through an organ procurement and transplantation network, to people who have been waiting the longest. That may seem fair since many transplant candidates wait for years, and some die while waiting.But the system has serious shortcomings. Some elderly recipients get kidneys that could function far longer than they will live and that could have done more good for a younger recipient. Some younger recipients get kidneys that will fail and will need to be replaced, using up another scarce kidney.These problems could be eased through a proposal under consideration at the transplant network to better match the likely longevity of the patient with the likely functional life of the kidney.The patients and kidneys would each be graded separately. About 20 percent of the kidneys predicted to have the longest functional lives would be provided to the youngest and healthiest patients. The other 80 percent of kidneys would go to patients who are no more than 15 years older or younger than the donor.'"
"'11-02-28,'1','They took advantage of the Democrats’ failure to pass a budget last year and approved a bill that makes nearly $62 billion in cuts just over the next seven months. Much of the effort pursued longstanding partisan goals like eliminating programs for disadvantaged minorities, rather than real deficit reduction.The impact of these reckless, largely ideologically targeted cuts could be even more devastating for the recovery than a brief government shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of people would lose their jobs, and not just for a few days or weeks. Those at the bottom of the economic ladder would be hurt the most.No one would have paid much attention if the stopgap spending resolution from last year did not run out on March 4. The House Republicans have exploited that leverage to the fullest, saying they won’t even consider a temporary spending resolution from the Senate that does not contain substantial cuts.The latest offer from the House, drawing on an idea that has been discussed in the Senate, would buy two weeks of government operations in exchange for $4 billion in cuts. To make the offer palatable, the House is willing to make about $2.7 billion of those cuts from earmarks, and the rest from programs that the president has already proposed cutting in next year’s budget, including highway and education spending.The House is essentially asking the Democrats to agree to all the easy cuts up front, while continuing to dangle a sword over the process that could drop again as early as March 18. The war of words would quickly begin again, as would the Republicans’ demands for their more damaging cuts. That would create ever more uncertainty in the markets and in the lives of many thousands of people who could be affected by a shutdown.Repeatedly negotiating under threat is no way to run a government. The real battle should be over next year’s budget. Accelerating some 2012 cuts to get through this year makes sense, but only in exchange for a resolution that carries the government through Sept. 30. Democrats should insist on it, and if Republicans instead choose to close the government’s doors, at least the public will know the full price of their extremism.'"
"'11-02-28,'1','Re “A Life’s Value? It May Depend on the Agency,” front page, Feb. 17) :Your article about how government agencies monetize the value of human life is disturbing. Human life, perhaps uniquely, is priceless. Placing any dollar value on life necessarily cheapens it.Remember, businesses were the first to put a price tag on life — and they did it to find out how cheaply they could make their products with the resulting savings still exceeding what they would have to pay out in wrongful death and injury suits.That’s not to say that companies should have to make products ridiculously sturdy or without risk. But we do need to get back to evaluating on a reasonable, case-by-case basis when a death or injury is due to obvious neglect or depraved indifference on the part of a manufacturer — versus when it was simply a tragic accident of immeasurable cost.'"
"'11-02-28,'1','The mystique that Apple cloaks itself in when introducing snazzy gadgets, like the new iPad it is expected to unveil this week, has served its bottom line well. But that same opacity doesn’t translate well to corporate governance.It took Apple’s board far too long last week to reveal that, with its visionary leader Steve Jobs on leave for health reasons, 30 percent of its shareholders wanted more information on how the company would be run if he did not return. Given Apple’s stunning success, the low profile of the pension fund that put forward the proposal and the board’s recommendation against it, that should send a powerful message.Apple dropped into a regulatory filing late Thursday that 172 million shares were voted in favor of a proposal put forward by the Central Laborers’ Pension Fund, which has less than $1 billion in assets. The proposal called for the company to adopt and disclose an executive succession plan. With 400 million shares cast in opposition, or 70 percent of the vote, the company clearly prevailed.But a more mainstream governance proposal from a far larger investor, Calpers, the $200 billion-plus California pension system, was passed against the recommendation of the board. And even though the Central Laborers’ effort failed, it’s still rare for nontraditional proposals from relatively unfamiliar special interests to capture so many votes. That’s particularly true when boards in good standing with their stockholders recommend against them. Apple shares have, after all, roughly doubled in each of the past five years, so shareholders should be happy.The support for the proposal on succession suggests many investors do want the company to be more forthcoming. That might also apply to the manner in which Apple reported the voting at Wednesday’s annual meeting. At the time, it said shareholders defeated the succession-planning proposal, but it didn’t reveal the vote tallies, something that is standard procedure at many big companies like Ford Motor and Goldman Sachs.'"
"'11-02-28,'1','The snag comes at an inopportune time for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who, despite having a reputation as a tech-savvy manager, has faced major information-technology problems in his third term.The biggest has been an $80 million fraud scheme involving CityTime, an automated payroll project for municipal employees, which had been dogged by complaints over delays and ballooning costs. So far, federal prosecutors have indicted seven people, most of them technology consultants. In December, the executive director of the city’s payroll agency, who was supposed to be in charge of the project, resigned.In the case of the housing authority, the glitches are connected to the latest phase of an ambitious program called NYCHA Improving the Customer Experience, or NICE. The program is designed to enable housing employees to access as much information as is available about tenants all at once, instead of using the current scattershot system, which has long been criticized as being slow and inefficient.“I feel very bad for our members who have to serve their clients,” said Lillian Roberts, executive director of District Council 37, the city’s largest municipal employees’ union, which represents many workers at the housing authority. “They’re victims of all this mismanagement. Nothing was said to them, but now they have to attempt to clean it up. When it’s all said and done, we may have another CityTime situation on our hands.”Sheila Stainback, a spokeswoman for the housing agency, said that any comparison to CityTime was “inaccurate, unfair and scurrilous.”Instead, Ms. Stainback said that the problems were just part of the growing pains of the NICE program, which was started several years ago and “covers the entire customer experience for both public housing and the Section 8 process, from application to move-ins.”The first phase of the program collated information, like maintenance requests and repair issues, and has been completed. This latest phase, which cost $36 million, is designed to centralize a database of prospective tenants applying for Section 8 apartments.“This system has been fully implemented and is experiencing the normal challenges one would expect from a major overhaul of this kind,” Ms. Stainback said.She did say that she sympathized with people who had been confused or had their lives disrupted. “We’re moving carefully to make sure that all eligible families receiving Section 8 continue to receive these funds,” she said.This is not the first time that the housing authority’s computerization processes have come under scrutiny. In 2006, William C. Thompson Jr., then the city comptroller, criticized the authority for having two separate computer systems to determine applicants’ eligibility for housing and to assign applicants to apartments. In an audit, Mr. Thompson found that when an applicant was certified as being eligible for assistance, data that had already been entered into one system was then manually entered into another one.By last May, the housing authority was “on the right track” to installing “a new system that will ensure a more timely, cost-effective and error-free process,” an audit released by John C. Liu, the current comptroller, said.But the current hiccup has raised questions, once again, about the agency’s information-technology efforts.Some New Yorkers who depend on the housing authority are worried. Dasia Stevens, 25, who lives in South Jamaica Houses in Queens, said she was desperate to prove to the agency that her share of the monthly rent for a Section 8 apartment, about $220, was more than she could afford because she had lost her job at a cellphone retailer.“I’m worried that I’ll have to go into the shelters or something,” she said.Shaqunna Duncan, a Bronx native who has sought the help of In the Spirit of the Children, a nonprofit group that helps children leave foster care, applied for public housing when she turned 21 last May. In January, she said, a housing official told her that she might soon be moving into public housing.She cannot reach anyone at the agency by phone, she said, and has been “house hopping” at friends’ and relatives’ homes. Still, she was trying to stay calm.“It makes no sense to get hyped,” Ms. Duncan said, “because people I need to yell and scream to I can’t get to.”'"
"'11-02-28,'1','For the moment, heavyweights like Saudi Arabia can make up the difference, and big consumers, like the United States, have stored millions of barrels of oil for just this kind of emergency.But few oil experts are surprised that the unrest has so unnerved the market. The world is thirsty for oil, and supply and demand are in delicate balance. There is little room for more disruptions in supplies. Indeed, spare capacity — essentially that amount of extra oil that OPEC members are able to produce in a pinch — is now about five million barrels a day. That is about 6 percent of the oil that the world consumes every day. That cushion is greater than in 2008, when it equaled about 2 percent of daily consumption, but it remains worryingly thin. And that is not even taking into account the loss of about one million barrels a day exported from Libya.“There is a vulnerability to tightness,” said David Knapp, senior energy economist at Energy Intelligence, a specialized publisher. “But for now, there are enough barrels out there in commercial storage and OPEC’s spare capacity and strategic reserves held by industrial countries to handle a medium-duration outage from Libya.”The question on everyone’s mind is what if this goes beyond Libya. Costanza Jacazio, an energy analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, says further unrest — or simply fear of further unrest — could well drive oil prices higher. “The degree of geopolitical risk now is massive.”Jan Stuart, an energy economist at Macquarie Securities, explained: “This brings back the political dimension to oil-price dynamics. For the best part of the past 25 years, the Saudis have bent backwards to make sure politics would be banned from discussions about oil supplies. The risk today is we could go back the other way again.”The price of oil had been rising steadily even before the wave of pro-democracy protests swept much of the Middle East and North Africa. A recovering global economy had convinced traders that demand for oil was going to rise by about 2 percent in 2011. Some industry experts and Wall Street seers were predicting a gradual march back to $120 and even $150. The thinking was that investors would pour money into the commodity markets.Oil futures in New York jumped nearly $12 last week to settle at $97.88 a barrel, their highest since October 2008; in London, benchmark Brent crude traded close to $115 a barrel.Now economists worry that high and rising energy prices could hurt the economy just as it is beginning to revive. The price of gasoline averaged $3.29 a gallon on Friday, up from $3.11 a month ago. As a rule, every 1-cent increase takes more than $1 billion out of consumers’ pockets a year.If prices keep climbing, consumers will in all likelihood tighten their belts. If prices stay high for long, the impact could be severe: every oil shock of the past 40 years has helped push the global economy into recession. Nariman Behravesh, senior economist at IHS Global Insight, said that every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil reduces economic growth by two-tenths of a percentage point after one year and a full percentage point over two years.In some ways, something like this was bound to happen. This is not a “black swan” event — a sudden, unexpected occurrence — but a white swan one, said Michael A. Levi, senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations.“You can’t predict what the specific disruption there will be, but you can be sure there will be some disruption,” he said.To calm markets, Saudi Arabia has started to increase its crude output to more than nine million barrels a day, roughly 700,000 barrels more than at the end of 2010, Energy Intelligence reported. Saudi officials are also asking European refiners, who are most directly affected by the drop in Libyan exports, how much and what grades of crude they need for quick shipment.And the International Energy Agency, an organization of consuming countries, also helped defuse tensions in the markets when it said Thursday that the world had “the tools at hand to deliver adequate oil to the market,” including the availability of emergency stocks held by consuming nations.Much now hinges on what happens next in the Middle East. The price spikes that accompanied the two Persian Gulf wars did not have deep impacts because of they did not last long enough. But several oil price increases have preceded economic downturns.The biggest shock followed the 1973-74 OPEC embargo, which quadrupled oil prices and helped produce stagflation, a period of slow growth, high unemployment and inflation.The 1979 Iranian revolution caused another shortage, and again American motorists were forced to wait in long lines for gasoline. Oil prices surged, but they did not stay elevated for long, as Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela expanded production and OPEC lost its unity. Oil prices remained low for years, and the economy through the later half of the 1980s and most of the 1990s was generally strong.If the current unrest helps drive the price of a barrel up by $40 to $50, back to its level of three years ago, that would really hurt.“If gasoline prices go over $4 a gallon, there could be a big psychological effect,” Mr. Behravesh said, “but it would have to last.”'"
"'11-02-28,'1','The Montana Legislature is considering a bill that would allow the state to nullify federal laws that protect endangered species. And in Georgia, a bill that would override federal monetary regulations by requiring banks to accept payment in gold or silver has survived two readings in the State House of Representatives.“There’s been a kind of ramping up,” said Michael Boldin, the founder of the Tenth Amendment Center, a research and advocacy group in Los Angeles. Last year, Mr. Boldin said, many of the bills were simply statements of dissatisfaction or intent. This year, he said, the bills are armed with teeth and recommended penalties. The Arizona bill, for instance, would make it a felony for anyone who tried to enforce federal commerce laws.Critics say the measures are mostly still just talk — rhetorical flourishes shaped to criticize the Obama administration. Federal law, by dint of multiple legal precedents, almost always trumps state law. Even worse, the critics say, the effort to wrest power from Washington is distracting legislators from making tough economic and budget decisions.“This is the theater of the absurd, and it is dangerous rhetoric,” said Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana.Mr. Schweitzer is a Democrat in a state where the Republican-controlled Legislature is considering, among a raft of antifederal proposals, a declaration that would require the F.B.I. to get the local sheriff’s permission before making any arrests. The governor, who is from a family of ranchers, said he had just registered a cattle brand that spelled out the word “veto.”“I’m going to have it red hot and ready to go,” he said.The movement’s supporters say that they are acting in the name of democracy and freedom, and that no fight could be more important. And they hope that if enough legislatures take action, their collective voice will be heard in Washington.“I’m not sure what will happen, but obviously it is our intent to get some relief,” said State Senator Brandon D. Smith of Kentucky, who is chairman of the Natural Resources and Energy Committee and sponsor of the resolution declaring sanctuary from the E.P.A.Mr. Smith said the thrust of his argument is not that agencies like the E.P.A. have no authority, but rather that they have exceeded the authority they were granted by Congress.“It sends a very clear message that there has been a lot of overreaching,” he said of his bill, adding with the confidence of an experienced head counter that he expected only two “no” votes in the Senate.Some of the measures have spread after being tried out last year on a small scale.Utah’s Legislature — often a pioneer in challenging federal laws — passed a bill in 2010 that authorized the state to use eminent domain protections to seize federal lands. It then appropriated $3 million for what state officials acknowledged would be an uphill legal battle to defend their stance.This year, six more states — Arizona, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington — have taken up the argument, according to the American Legislative Exchange Council, a nonprofit group that supports limited government and free markets.Clint Woods, the director of the group’s energy, environment and agriculture task force, said the wave of new bills had been fueled by the Department of Interior’s talk about designating “wild lands” that would be protected from development and creating new national monuments.“Legislators have seen this as an expansion by the federal government,” Mr. Woods said.Some lawmakers supporting the drive against the federal government acknowledged the possible negative consequences. But they said the system was so broken that any federal retaliation might be an empty threat.Montana, for example, could lose $500 million a year or more in federal money that goes to highways, parks, conservation and other programs if it nullifies federal authority over endangered species, legislative analysts said.But the bill’s sponsor, State Representative Krayton Kerns, said he did not care. “We are being bribed by debt to fall in lockstep behind the federal government,” he said. “It’s debt; it’s not money.”'"
"'11-02-28,'1','What impressed Manager Joe Girardi most was not Nova’s curveball, which froze Ryan Howard to finish off a three-pitch strikeout, or a fastball that reached 95 miles per hour, but the four groundouts he induced, a reflection of his heavy sinker. Nova, working with the catching prospect Jesus Montero, threw 14 of his 21 pitches for strikes.For Nova, confidence is tricky to gauge. Outwardly, he had it last season, when he went 1-2 with a 4.50 earned run average. Just rewind to his first career start, last Aug. 23 in Toronto, when he fired a fastball over Jose Bautista’s head. When Bautista glared at him, Nova glared right back.Or just have a conversation with him. His answers are sprinkled with phrases like “I have a really good chance right now” or “I’m ready,” and he smiles as he says them, unable to suppress his enthusiasm.“He should believe in himself,” Girardi said. “I believe in him.”And yet, when runners reached base last season, that poise tended to fade. The perfectionist in Nova thought that he had failed if he allowed a walk or a single or worse. Sometimes, that doubt would carry into the next batter and the next and the one after that until an inning had come apart, quickly and spectacularly.In seven starts, Nova pitched as many as six full innings only once. Asked about that pattern on Saturday, Nova nodded and said, “The fifth inning.” In the first four innings of his starts last season, Nova had a 2.57 E.R.A. and opponents hit .198 with a .542 on-base plus slugging percentage. In the fifth inning, Nova had a 15.00 E.R.A and opponents hit .400 with a 1.204 O.P.S.As for why — and how — hitters seemed to solve Nova their third time up, several theories emerged: fatigue, pitch-tipping and poor sequencing among them. Girardi could not identify one in particular, saying, “Maybe it’s not an issue and we’re making an issue out of it.”But the new pitching coach Larry Rothschild, after studying videotape of his new pupil and spending time with him, suggested that Nova still had to convince himself that he could thrive in the major leagues.“I think he’s got to pitch through some of the barriers that young kids do,” Rothschild said recently. “That’s learning how to win games at this level and push through the fact that it’s not just trying to get through the fifth, but you’re looking for the sixth or seventh and even deeper than that.”As Nova builds arm strength, he will pitch deeper. Three innings his next start, four after that, and so on. Even if he turns over the lineup a few times, success in the decidedly more relaxed environs of spring training will not necessarily translate when the season starts. That chance, the Yankees would be willing to take.“I know I can get better,” Nova said after his outing Sunday. “I know I can get deeper in the game. I have good stuff, my confidence is good. I throw strikes, I get people out.”If all that happens, Nova can look forward to even more of a homecoming after next season, perhaps as rousing as the party thrown after another native son of Palenque, Juan Uribe, won the World Series with San Francisco. When the Giants won, Nova was still in New York and, thus, missed the celebration. But he heard about it.“I want one of those for me,” Nova said.Dellin Betances, the Yankees’ top right-handed prospect, struck out the side and issued a walk in a scoreless fifth inning. “I’m just going to keep working and make a good impression,” said Betances, 22, who will begin the year at Class AA Trenton. “You never know.”... Joe Girardi said Andrew Brackman (groin) had responded well to strength and range-of-motion testing and could resume throwing off a mound as early as Wednesday. ... The Detroit slugger Miguel Cabrera, arrested Feb. 16 on suspicion of drunken driving, is scheduled to make his spring debut Monday against the Yankees in Lakeland as the Tigers’ designated hitter.'"
"'11-02-28,'1','MANAMA, Bahrain — Tunisia’s prime minister, a holdover from the government that was toppled last month, resigned Sunday after a weekend of violent protests that left five people dead in the capital, Tunis.The prime minister, Mohamed Ghannouchi, had been the target of weeks of demonstrations by protesters who felt that he was tainted by his links to the old government.“My resignation will provide a better atmosphere for the new era,” Mr. Ghannouchi said on Tunisian national television. “My resignation is in the service of the country.”Hours later, Tunisia’s interim president, Fouad Mebazaa, named a former government minister, Beji Caid-Essebsi, as the country’s new prime minister, the official Tunisian news agency, TAP, reported.Tunisia has been unsettled since the upheaval that ousted President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, an event that became a catalyst for upheavals in neighboring Arab countries. Tunisia is also struggling to manage an influx of thousands of refugees from neighboring Libya, where rebels inspired by the Tunisians are seeking to overthrow the Libyan leader, Col.
