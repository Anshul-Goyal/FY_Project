"'08-10-01,'0','In the early 1960s, as the voting rights movement coalesced around Selma, Mr. Chestnut’s experience in the local community was invaluable to civil rights leaders who visited the area. And when demonstrators arrived and were thrown in jail, it was often as not Mr. Chestnut who got them out.“I don’t know what would have happened to us in Selma if it wasn’t for Chestnut,” said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, who was jailed and beaten by the Selma police. “Selma was a vicious place, vicious. I don’t know how he survived there, I really don’t. He used the law to help liberate the black folk of Alabama. He was a lawyer, but he was also a foot soldier. He was a brave and courageous man.”J. L. Chestnut Jr. was born in Selma on Dec. 16, 1930. The initials were his name; according to his autobiography, “Black in Selma,” written with Julia Cass, his father was named after a white banker his father’s mother had admired. J. L. Sr., with his two brothers, owned a grocery; young J. L.’s mother was an elementary school teacher. J. L. Jr. He attended Selma’s segregated schools and graduated from Dillard University in New Orleans before going to law school at Howard University, at a time when the landmark Brown vs. the Board of Education was being prepared and argued. He moved back to the South with the belief that that was where the next legal battles for civil rights would be fought.In Selma, he told the writer Gay Talese, who met Mr. Chestnut in 1965 and wrote about him in his 2006 memoir, “A Writer’s Life,” that he decided early on not to kowtow to judges who disdained him, recalling one instance where a judge warned him not to be disrespectful to any of the women in his office.“I have never been disrespectful of a lady in my life,” Mr. Chestnut replied, “and unlike you, I also respect black women.”On the other hand, Mr. Chestnut often recalled that before George Wallace became the segregationist governor of Alabama, he was the one judge who treated him with respect and insisted that others do so as well.“Judge George Wallace was the most liberal judge I ever practiced law in front of,” Mr. Chestnut said in an interview for the public television documentary “George Wallace: Settin’ the Woods on Fire.” “He was the first judge to call me ‘mister’ in an Alabama courtroom.”Mr. Chestnut pried dozens if not hundreds of voting rights demonstrators out of Selma’s jails, and he was present at the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965, a day that became known as Bloody Sunday when the police beat demonstrators to prevent them from beginning a march to Montgomery. It was two weeks later that the march, led by Dr. King, was actually completed.In subsequent years, Mr. Chestnut filed civil rights cases to have blacks allowed on juries in Dallas County, which includes Selma; to desegregate the Selma public schools; and to ensure blacks the opportunity to be coaches and principals in the desegregated schools.In addition to his daughter Vivian, he is survived by his wife of 56 years, also named Vivian; two other daughters, Shandra and Gearld; three sons, J. L. 3rd, Terrance and Gregory; a sister, Johnnie Mae; six grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.“He was a legend down here,” said Michael Jackson, the district attorney for Dallas County, who is currently the only black district attorney in Alabama. “As a young attorney, he was the best trial attorney I’d ever seen. I certainly wouldn’t be in office if it wasn’t for people like him.”'"

"'08-10-01,'0','LOS ANGELES — Speaker Nancy Pelosi normally enjoys warm relations with members of the House’s black and Hispanic caucuses, but a large number of them revolted Monday against legislation, which she supported, to rescue the financial industry.Class differences were laid bare by the vote. Several members of the two all-Democratic caucuses, who are now working among themselves and with the House leadership to put forward a compromise, characterized the defeated bill as one that would have provided assistance to the rich at the expense of middle- and lower-income voters. And it is to those voters that the lawmakers must answer.Representative Xavier Becerra, whose district includes some of Los Angeles’s poorer precincts, said, “The last thing I need to do is go back home and tell people I voted for $700 billion, some of which will touch the same people that caused the problem, and I can’t guarantee taxpayers will recoup those costs.”The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, 40 percent of whose members are fellow Californians of Ms. Pelosi, voted 12 to 8 against the bailout, while the Congressional Black Caucus rejected it by 21 to 18. The overall vote was 228 to 205, meaning that a shift of 12 votes from nay to aye would have brought passage.While two-thirds of House Republicans wound up opposing the bill, Ms. Pelosi, as promised, delivered votes from half the Democratic members (actually a bit more). But her inability to corral more votes from two often reliable blocs spoke to deep misgivings about the bill’s particulars, the notion among the members’ constituents that a vote in favor would mean alignment with Republicans to help Wall Street, and a degree of confusion and uncertainty about the depth of the financial crisis.Mr. Becerra, Ms. Pelosi’s assistant speaker, defended her Tuesday, saying that while she had never pressured him, she had done all she could to gain support for the measure. He attributed its failure to a refusal by President Bush and House Republicans to include protections for people who had gone bankrupt or were losing their homes.'"
"'08-10-01,'0','Mr. Obama, who had been criticized by Republicans on Monday for failing to aggressively lobby individual House members for the bill’s passage, called skeptical House Democrats, his aides said. And Mr. McCain, whose decision to insert himself into the negotiations last week was faulted by Democrats for injecting presidential politics into a delicate mix, made calls to members of Congress between campaign stops, his aides said, but did so quietly and with an emphasis on how he could be helpful.Publicly the communications strategies of both candidates were strikingly similar on Tuesday. In campaign appearances and in television interviews both men urged putting partisan politics aside to argue for passage of the bailout plan, warning that the failure of the financial sector would have a devastating ripple effect that would cause serious hardships for Americans.Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee, told a business roundtable in Des Moines that the evaporation of credit was already making it harder to get loans for students at a technical college in Milwaukee and for Sonic, the drive-through burger chain.“When small businesses and big businesses like Sonic franchisees can’t borrow, contractors don’t get the remodeling work, equipment makers lose sales, and restaurants go out of business,” Mr. McCain said. “It hurts the entire community.”“I know that many of the solutions to this problem may be unpopular,” he said, “but the dire consequences of inaction will be far more damaging to the economic security of American families, and the fault will all be ours.”Mr. Obama adopted a similarly serious tone as he echoed those themes to thousands of supporters in Nevada.“We are now in a very dangerous situation where financial institutions across this country are afraid to lend money,” he said. “If all that meant was the failure of a few big banks on Wall Street, that’d be one thing, but that’s not what it means. What it means is that if we do not act, it will be harder for you to get a mortgage for your home or the loans you need to go to college, or a loan you need to buy a car to get to work.”Mr. McCain, whose campaign initially sought to place blame for the collapse of the bill on Mr. Obama, took a much less partisan tone on Tuesday, refraining from attacking Mr. Obama in his talking about the bailout. And Mr. Obama made the rare move of not criticizing — or even mentioning — Mr. McCain.“There will be time to punish those who set this fire, but now is the moment for us to come together and put the fire out,” Mr. Obama said, departing from his prepared text. “Think about it. If your neighbor’s house is burning, you’re not going to spend a whole lot of time saying, well that guy was always irresponsible, he always left the stove on, he always was smoking in bed. All those things may be true, but his house could end up affecting your house. And that’s the situation we’re in right now.”Mr. McCain also called on Mr. Bush to act now to use the authority of the recent housing bill to start buying mortgages, saying that there was nearly $1 trillion available to do so and that the action would shore up mortgage values.Of course, bipartisanship went only so far. While the candidates tried to stay above the fray, their campaigns traded attacks, and their harsh advertisements continued to run.'"
"'08-10-01,'0','Glossy chamber of commerce brochures from small towns and rural areas along Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River and in the Adirondack Mountains beckoned on tables in the Sheraton New York Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. But it was not the allure of hiking, fishing or wineries — or even the free cookies and coffee — that attracted scores of novice doctors to a job fair on Sunday.It was the possibility of a green card.Many of the doctors, residents at New York City hospitals, had come from abroad on visas, including the restrictive J-1 “exchange visa,” which requires them to return home for two years once they finish their studies unless they can get a waiver to work in a medically underserved area. New York State recommends about 30 doctors for J-1 visa waivers annually; typically half of the visas go to doctors working in neighborhoods like Washington Heights or the South Bronx and half to upstate communities that do not have enough physicians.Getting such a waiver is akin to winning the lottery, and to apply for a ticket, doctors must have a signed employment contract, said Caleb C. Wistar, a State Health Department planner who was at the job fair to give advice. “This is the shining prize of working in underserved areas for people who are not citizens,” he said.Visa politics helped turn the job fair into a matchmaking exercise. The 30 upstate hospitals that sent representatives, whose expenses were covered by the Greater New York Hospital Association, promoted their towns’ friendly neighbors and good schools. The immigrant doctors, willing to relocate for economic and professional opportunities, listened politely, then worked up the courage to ask what for many of them was the most pressing question: “Do you sponsor visas?”Dr. Ranka Bulajic, a Serb, analyzed the job market by ethnicity: Eastern Europeans, she explained, were willing to work in colder climates like northern New York State or Oregon, while those from Africa or the Caribbean tended to prefer Alabama or Virginia. Dr. Jiwu Sun, who graduated from China’s prestigious Third Military Medical University, said that, at the age of 40 — and with a wife, two children and limited English — he was in no position to make demands of potential employers. Dr. Nadia Ferder, 34, who was born in the United States but grew up in Buenos Aires, said she did not want to return to Argentina because the economy was so bad that “lawyers, economists, doctors, architects, they are all driving cabs.”'"
"'08-10-01,'0','As they sifted through the wreckage, the administration and its Congressional allies concluded that in their rush to fashion an enormously complicated, enormously expensive package, they did not do a good enough job explaining to the public why it should matter. They said they should have done more to make the case that upheaval on Wall Street would hurt businesses and consumers around the country.“Hopefully we can do a better job of making clear just what our goal is and what we’re trying to fix,” said Tony Fratto, a White House deputy press secretary. “Maybe more American people will be able to see that and hopefully more members of Congress.”Deeply unpopular in the polls, President Bush let Mr. Paulson be the public face of the plan at first, hoping his credibility would close the deal. But Mr. Paulson by his own admission is not a politician. His term, the Trouble Asset Relief Program, did not catch on. Since he unveiled the phrase on Sept. 19, it was used in just 23 television talk shows or public hearings transcribed in the Nexis database. By contrast, a Nexis search found 508 mentions of the phrase “Wall Street bailout” in that period.Mr. Paulson became a lightning rod for critics who viewed the plan as a power grab by the Treasury secretary and demanded more detail and accountability for how he would purchase and resell so many risky securities.“The messaging was about as wooden and wonkish as it could be,” said Patrick Griffin, a former White House lobbyist for President Bill Clinton. “Poor Paulson — that was not his forte. And they started behind the eight ball. I never understood why they took so long to have the president engage.”Peter H. Wehner, a former Bush White House aide, said he doubted the terminology made the difference. “If someone could have called it a rescue plan the first day instead of bailout, do we really think that would have changed anything in a fundamental way?” he asked. “I don’t think so. I think the public viewed this from the beginning as a bailout of Wall Street and I don’t think moving around the deck chairs would have changed that.”If there was blame to be apportioned for the marketing failure, it cut across party lines. The final leadership message delivered on the House floor as the vote drew near came from Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, who rather than sticking to the bipartisan script, delivered a scathing attack on Mr. Bush. Whether or not it cost Republican votes, as some argued, it poisoned the atmosphere.“It would have been given by the shrillest, most insignificant back bencher, but never, never should have been delivered by a speaker attempting to pass a difficult but critical measure,” said Karl Rove, the former deputy White House chief of staff. “This was a time that called for being a big leader, not a small and petty partisan.”Either way, the administration fell behind from the beginning. When it wants to roll out a major new economic initiative, it traditionally lines up allies in the business community, organizes surrogates to speak and develops a vocabulary for presenting the idea in the most appealing light. In this case, the plan came together heading into a weekend and the usual allies were not rallied until the following Monday.“We had less time for that than normally,” said Michele Davis, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury, who help devise communications strategies. “The situation that Wednesday and Thursday in the credit markets was so horrific, and with the short Congressional schedule ahead of us, we had to get out fast.”For economic issues, the administration typically reaches out to two particularly influential opinion leaders whose views carry great weight with Congressional conservatives — Paul Gigot, editor of The Wall Street Journal editorial pages, and Lawrence Kudlow, the syndicated columnist and CNBC host. In this case, both men embraced the plan, but for once they did not sway other conservatives.That was clear to anyone browsing the Web or listening to talk shows. “There has been this big, tremendous rush to spend hundreds of billions of your dollars to buy out these bad loans from these banks,” Sean Hannity said on his nationally syndicated radio show last week. “This is a manufactured crisis,” Rush Limbaugh said on his radio show as the House vote began Monday.The viral emotion was evident in the Internet traffic. Yahoo Finance, the most popular financial news site, reported a 40 percent increase in message board postings. A CNNMoney.com blog post about the Bush plan announcement generated 2,200 comments, with greed being the most common theme. The site’s news story about those comments was headlined, “Mad as hell.”CNNMoney.com recorded 44 million page views on Monday, including 6.4 million during the hour of the House vote, setting new records for the site, as did CNBC.com, The Journal, The New York Times and other news organizations. Millions of e-mail messages overwhelmed House servers.Freedom Works, an organization affiliated with Dick Armey, a Republican and former House majority leader, created its own Web site, NoWallStreetBailout.com, and collected thousands of electronic petition signatures within hours.“The biggest problem they had trying to peddle this package is they just didn’t have the credibility,” Mr. Armey said. “They said, ‘The world’s going to fall apart if we don’t get what we want.’ And the voting public and many members said, ‘We’ve heard this before and we’re not going to buy it.’ ”'"
"'08-10-01,'0','Word that the mayor was ready to announce his move brought out the kind of support that Mr. Bloomberg has generally enjoyed. But it also prompted criticism from people who said, in effect, that he had put in his time and should move on.“He’s a good mayor, but it’s enough,” said Romulo Damiano, a doorman at a building on 81st Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue. “Give a chance to other guys. He can go for governor or the Senate.”Maia Rice, who works for a private-label designer in Manhattan, also opposed rewriting the rules on when elected officials have to leave office.“Term limits were set for a reason, to prevent the abuse of power,” Ms. Rice said while sitting on a chair in Bryant Park on Tuesday afternoon. “I think it’s a dangerous way to go.”But Deb Givens, a lawyer who lives on Roosevelt Island, applauded Mr. Bloomberg’s third-term plans. “I don’t support term limits except for the president,” she said outside her office building in Midtown Manhattan.She said an attempt by Mr. Bloomberg to win more time in office would be different from Mr. Giuliani’s bid for a term extension seven years ago. Referring to Mr. Giuliani, she said: “In the midst of being an incredibly unpopular mayor, he tried to force his way to stay in the mayor’s office. Bloomberg, on the other hand, is a popular and very bipartisan person.”“I think the city would feel totally different without him,” she said. “I know I would.”Erika Piik, who works in marketing and lives on the Upper West Side, also remembered how Mr. Giuliani made the case for a three-month extension after the 9/11 attacks. But she was not ready to rewrite the rules.“I understand he has the experience and he’s financially savvy and we’re looking at big problems,” she said while walking down Columbus Avenue on Tuesday, “but I don’t know if an emergency alone is a reason to suspend established procedures.”The city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who has been planning a run for mayor next year, said voters had made their feelings clear in approving term limits in 1993 and again in 1996. “An attempt to disregard their voice sends a message that democracy has taken a back seat,” Mr. Thompson said in a statement.Mr. Green, a former public advocate in New York City and now the president of Air America Radio, the liberal talk-show network, called the mayor’s move “an undemocratic, self-dealing power grab hiding behind the alibi of the current national political crisis.”The current public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, was also opposed to the idea of a third term. “It’s up to the people of New York to decide how long they want their elected officials in office,” she said in a statement, “and they’ve already told us twice. It’s an insult to the democratic process and a slap in the face to New Yorkers to now render those votes meaningless.”A spokesman for Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens and has announced plans to run for mayor next year, said through a spokesman that term limits were the law of the city.But Edward I. Koch, the last mayor to serve more than two terms, offered to be an advance man for Mr. Bloomberg.“I’d be prepared to devote 110 percent of my time,” Mr. Koch said, adding: “Very few people will run against him, and they will lose by a huge margin. He’s a very popular mayor with a special niche in the city’s heart.”'"
"'08-10-01,'0','In a sign of how vulnerable Russia remains to contagion, officials halted trading on the Moscow stock exchange for two hours on Tuesday morning, fearing investor reaction to the House’s rejection of the Bush administration’s bailout plan. Trading resumed, and after President Bush vowed to win approval of the package, shares bounced back.“People ask, ‘What on earth is happening with Russia?’ ” said Roland Nash, chief analyst at Renaissance Bank in Moscow. “Russia is reacting to the unprecedented size, complexity and danger coming out of the U.S.”The shock waves could reverberate to the United States, experts said, since Russia has plowed its oil wealth into American debt, including Fannie Mae’s. Russia has additional problems, including unstable oil prices and a newly assertive foreign policy that is unpopular with many investors.The trigger for the loss of confidence in Europe, Mr. Mayer and other experts said, was the Treasury Department’s decision two weeks ago to let Lehman Brothers fail. That ricocheted through European markets, hurting banks and retail investors with exposure to Lehman.It took a few days longer for Europeans to digest the implications of the collapse. But now that they have, they are turning a remorseless eye on other institutions they suspect of being vulnerable.As the White House scrambles to retool its rescue plan for the financial system, the global creep of the crisis has far-reaching implications, administration officials and outside experts said.It is likely to move Europeans to mount a more coordinated effort to shore up banks, a move that the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., pleaded for last week. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France is calling for a minisummit of leaders in Paris on Friday.“We all agree that the method by which everyone comes up with ad hoc solutions in his corner the moment a crisis starts in a financial company isn’t a systematic enough method,” said Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, chairman of a group of European finance officials.On Tuesday, France and Belgium threw a $9 billion lifeline to Dexia, a Belgian-French lender — a day after Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg cobbled together $16.2 billion to rescue another bank, Fortis.Europe’s woes could place additional burdens on an American plan, as more banks fall into distress. If the Treasury wins Congressional approval to buy mortgage-related securities from banks, how it prices those assets will affect the solvency of European institutions.Some of these banks suffer a form of guilt by association by being in the home lending business. Others, like Fortis, lack a strong base of deposits, which acts as a buffer against credit-related jitters.Countries that suffered housing bubbles — like Ireland, Britain and Spain — are especially vulnerable, as are several Eastern European countries and other emerging markets, which are running steep current account deficits and low foreign currency reserves.Ireland’s finance minister, Brian Lenihan, traced his country’s predicament back to Lehman Brothers, saying that the American authorities “were mistaken in permitting that bank to go to the wall because it has had very serious consequences for the world financial system.”The Irish plan guarantees bank deposits and debt for customers and creditors of six banks. That makes the government responsible for $400 billion, twice the country’s economic output.Experts predict a rash of bank failures in Europe, though some say the process may prove less politically fraught than in the United States, given the tradition of nationalization there.So far, the hurdle to a broader plan has been the European Union’s legal and political restrictions that require burden-sharing and consensus. “The Europeans are more rigid and rule-based than the Americans,” said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. “But when things get bad enough, they’ll find the flexibility.”One red flag, he said, is UBS, the giant Swiss bank that is heavily exposed to mortgage-related securities and is headquartered in a small country that is not a member of the union. “Opinion is divided as to whether Switzerland could bail out UBS,” Mr. Johnson said.Beyond individual banks, the United States has to worry about the health of major holders of American government debt, from Russia and China to oil-producing states in the Middle East.Russia is a particular concern, experts said. With oil prices swooning and its own banks in crisis, it is coming under financial strain. If the Russians were to sell off their American debt holdings, it could depress the dollar and multiply the cost of a bailout.Russia has already begun whittling its vast foreign reserves to finance an aid program for its banks. American officials said shifts in foreign holdings of American debt were not great.Other big creditors, like China, are in better shape financially, according to experts. But even there, growth is slowing, as trans-Pacific trade dries up. Should that contraction be traumatic and cause a banking crisis, it could lead the Chinese to sell their American holdings, these experts say.The dollar has also remained remarkably stable, given the turmoil on Wall Street and in Washington — another sign, economists said, that foreign investors have not yet lost faith in the United States. Partly, though, that reflects a paucity of other safe places to invest money.“We would run into a huge problem if foreigners lost confidence,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economist at Harvard. “The rest of the world will give us several swings at the ball before they give up on us.”'"
"'08-10-01,'0','UBS declined to comment, saying only that it is cooperating with the investigation.In July, a federal judge in Miami approved a Justice Department request seeking to force UBS to turn over certain client names. The summons is thought to be the first to a foreign bank.Swiss law makes disclosure of client data or names a crime unless the Swiss authorities think that the client has committed a serious crime, like money laundering or tax fraud. Unlike in the United States, Switzerland does not consider tax evasion to be a crime, though both countries have largely similar definitions of tax fraud.Under pressure in recent months from the Justice Department, Switzerland’s justice ministry, taxing authority and banking regulator have adopted the view that some American clients of UBS may have committed tax fraud.Justice Department officials hope to prove that the American clients committed fraud and engaged in tax evasion by concealing their ownership of offshore assets, in part by creating sham entities and then filing I.R.S. forms that falsely claimed the entities were the owners of the accounts.United States law requires American taxpayers, including trusts and partnerships, to report all financial accounts held in a foreign country if their total value exceeds $10,000 during the year. Not doing so can result in a penalty of up to 50 percent of the amount in the account at the time. In a new tactic, the Justice Department is focusing on failure by UBS’s American clients to file those reports.The investigation is being aided by a former top UBS private banker, Bradley C. Birkenfeld, who pleaded guilty in June to helping a client, Igor Olenicoff, a property developer, conceal about $200 million in offshore accounts that were undeclared to the I.R.S. Both men, who are United States citizens, are cooperating with the investigation.As part of the inquiry, the I.R.S.’s criminal division is scrutinizing 12 wealthy American clients of UBS and of LGT, a private bank in Liechtenstein, and is likely to send some of those cases to the Justice Department for prosecution, according to two people briefed on the matter.In addition, about 100 clients of LGT, and of UBS are under active investigation by the I.R.S.’s civil division, but their names have not been referred to the criminal unit for further scrutiny. The I.R.S. and the Justice Department declined to comment on Tuesday.The 100 client names and data came from a former LGT employee, Heinrich Kieber, who in 2002 stole company data on 1,400 worldwide clients and later turned it over to the I.R.S. and other countries.UBS gave the client records to the Swiss taxing authority after being urged to do so by the Swiss banking industry regulator known as the EBK. The Swiss “are taking the view that the client, not UBS, is mostly to blame,” one of the people briefed on the matter said.The data includes account names, assets, contact information, records of foreign entities incorporated for the purposes of hiding assets and client authorizations of trades. Under Swiss law, the Swiss taxing authority is required to inform UBS clients of any disclosures.

Sarah Palin’s personal finances are going to have to wait just a bit longer because of an agreement between the Federal Election Commission and the McCain campaign.Federal law requires vice-presidential candidates to file a financial disclosure statement within 30 days of their nomination. But the F.E.C. and the McCain campaign differed over the date of Ms. Palin’s nomination.The McCain campaign has said it believes the 30-day deadline ends on Oct. 3, 30 days after her nomination at the Republican National Convention on Sept. 4. The F.E.C. had said that the 30-day period began on Aug. 29, when Senator John McCain named her as his running mate and changed the name of his campaign fund to the McCain-Palin Compliance Fund. By the commission’s calculations, the filing was due Sept. 29.So, letters between the campaign and the F.E.C. ensued. Trevor Potter, the McCain campaign’s general counsel, also said Ms. Palin needed extra time to prepare since she had never run for federal office before.The F.E.C., in a letter to Mr. Potter, granted an extension until 30 days prior to the general election, or Oct. 5. Since that is a Sunday, the commission said the campaign would have until Oct. 6 to comply.'"
"'08-10-01,'0','Robert Bertsch, president and co-founder of RaiseCapital, said: “Most people, to get in front of a venture capitalist, need to have a connection or be a Stanford graduate. Our investors are not going to be all over you for a balance sheet or your exit strategy. They’re looking for something that suits their interest.”Some of these sites are gathering places for investors who want a stake in companies, while others are for people who want to lend money. Whatever success they may realize, they are not expected to replace traditional venture capital or angel investing anytime soon. And whether the sites will take hold or which kind will win out is uncertain, for all of their anecdotal success stories.“Everyone has a slightly different take on things,” said Adeo Ressi, a serial entrepreneur who started TheFunded.com, a Web site where start-up chief executives can discuss investors and match them with other entrepreneurs. “It’s not clear who the winner will be or even what the right approach is.”Legal issues loom on several fronts. Companies must be cautious when offering investments to the public, and they have to be careful not to act as brokers, which are highly regulated.The companies’ approaches vary widely. RaiseCapital and others try to arrange equity investments in businesses. Prosper, Zopa, Lending Club and others bring together would-be lenders with small-business borrowers. Ideablob, an outgrowth of Advanta, which issues small-business credit cards, and Cambrian House, a Canadian company, both allow potential investors to vote on ideas and help shape businesses. SellaBand, a Dutch company, helps musicians get financial backing from fans online.Still other companies, like TheFunded and YouNoodle, are trying to build social networks in the entrepreneurial community, in the manner of Facebook or LinkedIn.How the companies expect to make money also varies. Some, particularly lending firms, earn a commission on each transaction. Others rely on premium services, sponsorships or vendors that pay for access to their sites’ users.Proponents compare the new companies to blogging, which allows the general public to publish online. The new financing companies hope to allow small businesses and entrepreneurs to bypass the limited-access corridors along Silicon Valley’s Sand Hill Road, where venture capitalists decide which start-ups get money.“People need a platform like this as an extra measure to obtain funding,” said Mr. Bertsch, the president of RaiseCapital. “In some cases, it’s a company’s last means of survival.""Mr. Bertsch said inquiries from new visitors to the site had jumped 21 percent in one month recently, to nearly 8,000.When someone seeks a loan on Prosper, the site’s participating lenders “decide who and what get funded, rather than an elite group of bankers,” said Chris Larsen, Prosper’s founder and chief executive. At Prosper, based in San Francisco, applicants state why they want a loan — to start a business, pay down credit card debt, buy a house, pay for school — and how much they want, as well as the interest rate they hope to pay. Prosper runs a credit check and publishes the rating, and members can bid to participate in the loan, as if it were an item for sale on eBay.The system worked perfectly for Marc Matthias and Benny Rivera, who needed $25,000 in April to start Diverse Desserts, a cake- and dessert-design company based in Manhattan. They needed money quickly, and they had taken out all the conventional loans they could, Mr. Matthias said. At Prosper, they received their loan in a week, at 11.5 percent interest, from more than 400 lenders who put up $50 to $500 each.Prosper has made more than 27,000 loans, totaling $170 million, since Nov. 1, 2005. Jim Bruene, editor of Online Banking Report, an industry publication, said Prosper’s pace of about $100 million in loans this year was “a decent start, but that’s 20 houses in Los Angeles. It’s not a lot. It could be the tip of the iceberg; it’s hard to know.”A crucial question, Mr. Bruene said, is how much regulation the government will impose on both the lending and the financing sites.Aaron Kornfield, a lawyer at Fenwick & West in San Francisco who advises YouNoodle, said private companies needed to be careful about any form of general advertising regarding the sale of their securities, including the solicitation of investments online.“Private companies are not supposed to advertise the sale of their securities,” he said. He added: “Investors can figure out what companies are doing on Web sites like YouNoodle, and then they can talk offline. But to go out and say, Here I am, invest in me, that’s not a smart idea.”But Mr. Bertsch, the president of RaiseCapital, said confidently, “The government does not monitor transactions between private individual investors and private business opportunities.”So the key to success may be whether a company can get attention and attract the interest of investors, then continue the ensuing dialogue in a private forum, similar to the dating services.Manoj Duggirala, 23, was pursuing a master’s degree in material science and engineering at Stanford when he signed up on YouNoodle because he had an idea for a business, but no connections. Through YouNoodle, he found an investor, Jan Leeman. After a courtship of several months, Mr. Leeman invested $70,000 in Mr. Duggirala’s company, GiveandTake, an online shopping firm that has not yet opened.“What is appealing about YouNoodle to me is the university connection,” said Mr. Leeman, an entrepreneur turned angel investor. “There are at least half a dozen stories of two grad students from Stanford starting something that turns into something wonderful.” Even though he attended Stanford and lives near the campus, “it’s difficult to get access to what the students are doing,” he said.At YouNoodle, Mr. Goodson said that, according to the National Venture Capital Association, $30.5 billion in venture capital was invested in 2007, and the University of New Hampshire has estimated that angel investors put in another $26 billion. “That’s a colossal amount, and it’s nearly all done without the use of technology,” he said. “People are still sitting down face to face and giving each other pitches. That’s a lot to be distributed without a more intelligent use of technology.”One YouNoodle investor is Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal (now owned by eBay) and a managing partner of the Founders Fund venture firm. “There’s something strange about venture capital” operating much as it did in the 19th century, he said, “when it’s investing in all of these 21st century technologies.”Mr. Sheftel, at eAssay, was running a wholesale jewelry business in New York, R. Sulimani, when the economy began to sour. People were selling their “broken, old, outdated jewelry” to raise cash, he said, and he knew he and his partner could buy it, refine it into gold bars and sell it for a small profit — if they could expand. But without the option of a bank loan, he “decided to try out RaiseCapital,” he said.He called a few prospective lenders he had met on the company’s site; one of them was Mr. Turo, managing partner of Growthink.Mr. Turo said he was drawn to RaiseCapital as a way of looking beyond Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. One Growthink investor had already asked Mr. Turo about opportunities in jewelry, and within a few weeks Mr. Turo had provided Mr. Sheftel with half a million dollars. Mr. Sheftel was then able to increase his revenue to $250,000 to $300,000 a week from an average of $150,000.The two have still not met in person; Mr. Turo said that for an investment this size, and the modest risk involved, a meeting was not necessary.“I don’t think RaiseCapital is the place to do seven-figure investing,” he said. “It’s like a dating site. You make a connection online, and you take it offline,” which in Mr. Turo’s case meant due diligence and writing a check. “There’s only marginal value in a face-to-face meeting.”'"
"'08-10-01,'0','The mission is publicized as one of national honor; the general embarks on it with due self-importance, but it is not long before he feels overwhelmed. He has only the company of an Italian priest, and an Albanian expert and work party, to perform the grueling labor of consulting villagers to locate the piles of bones, have them dug up, sorted and bagged in little nylon sacks, and then shuffle through vague records to identify them.He preserves his cocky assurance. His excellent maps and well-prepared lists of the dead are far superior to the clumsy tools of an Albanian general bent on a similar mission — and so unsuccessful that the Albanian appropriates a few Italian remains to supplement his own poor findings.And then Mr. Kadare advances wryly and dryly into the darkness. The Italian general’s blithe confidence will gradually be undermined. The priest, who knows the country, warns him that his work party’s spades are violating a taboo. It is the second time in 20 years that a foreign military expedition has invaded Albania. The silence of the countryside is not acquiescence but menace; for centuries the code has demanded a deadly reprisal for any insult to honor.“Their vendetta is like a play composed in accordance with all the laws of tragedy,” the priest warns.“Their nature requires war, cries out for war,” he says. “In peace, the Albanian becomes sluggish and only half alive, like a snake in winter. It is only when he is fighting that his vitality is at full stretch.”Mr. Kadare doesn’t do messages; he brings them to lethal life. A peasant gives voice to the dark current that the expedition releases. To bring out the remains of the Italian invaders and their Albanian collaborators is to reinforce the enemy, he complains. Dead soldiers are soldiers.Gradually — as with Kurtz in “Heart of Darkness” — a seemingly primitive spirit of place infects the seemingly superior outsider. The general begins to think of the piles of bones the same way the peasant does.“I have a whole army of dead men under my command now, he thought. Only instead of uniforms they are all wearing nylon bags. Blue bags with two white stripes and black edging, made to order by the firm of ‘Olympia.’ ” And “now we are on our way to completing regiments and divisions.” Immediately he begins to imagine this army, under his leadership, winning in Normandy, Korea, Vietnam. “He was a general who knew what it meant to command.”His dead-invader army is as warlike in him as in the recesses of the Albanian soul, where even 20 years later injury calls for revenge. At the same time — because Mr. Kadare is too subtle a writer to follow a single track — the general shakes off what stirs inside him even as it stirs outside.Arrogantly sure, he insists on attending a village wedding uninvited, despite the warnings of the priest. Dark stares and silence greet them, even as the head man receives him with ceremonious courtesy. There cannot be a threat, he boasts to the priest; witness the respect.A stunning scene follows; drama erupting like a scream after long silence. Humiliated, the general confronts all that his Western superiority had him ignore. It is doom, but Mr. Kadare knows that doom is most strongly conveyed when not quite carried out.In the book’s final section, the protagonist, his mission at an end, drinks in a hotel with his part-Westernized colleague, the Albanian general. The talk is deliberately, stupefyingly, endlessly trivial. Anticlimax is climax disguised. Mr. Kadare’s doom needed only a moment to show its terrible face before subsiding into banality.'"
"'08-10-01,'0','THE premier addresses of the Internet age include 56 Marietta Street in Atlanta, 210 North Tucker Avenue in St. Louis and 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. They go by a variety of names, like carrier hotels, Internet peering points and co-locations. And while they may not be located in the fanciest office buildings, and many of them are not in the best parts of town, they are the best places for businesses to get online, taking advantage of huge swaths of reliable bandwidth at a relatively low cost.Small businesses can lease space in a co-location building and use their own server computers and other hardware to operate Web sites, for example, or handle e-commerce. Or more likely they can use the services of companies like Slicehost.com, which has its own servers at the St. Louis building and provides access to “virtual private” areas on them for fees starting at $20 a month.Co-location buildings like these sit at major crossroads of Internet connectivity. Most, like 1102 Grand Boulevard in Kansas City, Mo., have electrical power that comes from more than one connection to the power grid, along with battery backups and diesel generators to further protect against blackouts.At 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, between 15th and 16th Streets, there is an elevator big enough to lift a fully loaded truck to each floor, in case a customer has lots of equipment to deliver. But reliable Internet connections are the main appeal of co-location buildings, particularly for companies that earn significant revenue from their Internet businesses, which need to be running all the time.“We wanted to make sure that our largest customers, like Domino’s Pizza, could have ‘five nines’ up time,” or 99.999 percent reliability, said David Schenberg, chief executive of BusyEvent in Chesterfield, Mo., which provides automated communications, online invitation and meeting registration services. BusyEvent uses Xiolink.com’s data center at another St. Louis building and has not had a single service failure, Mr. Schenberg said.'"
"'08-10-01,'0','The Rangers will face Metallurg Magnitogorsk for the Victoria Cup on Wednesday night in a one-game showdown for international bragging rights. Magnitogorsk earned its invitation by winning the European club championship last season.The game represents the first tournament between an N.H.L. team and a European team organized in association with the N.H.L., the N.H.L. Players’ Association and the International Ice Hockey Federation. It is the first game between an N.H.L. team and a Russian club in 17 years.“We know there’s going to be more emotion tomorrow since it’s the Victoria Cup game, but I think we’ll be ready,” Gomez said.Although the Rangers see their next game as something bigger than an exhibition, it will not be as important as the two N.H.L. regular-season games they will play against the Tampa Bay Lightning this weekend in Prague.“For us, these games are all about developing our team, so we’re ready for the start of the season,” Dubinsky said. “We’ll be playing for 4 points in the standings against Tampa, and that’s what counts the most. Still, we know the N.H.L. is the best league, but they will want to prove us wrong tomorrow.”On Tuesday, neither the final score nor the teams’ quality of play was particularly close. The Rangers demonstrated superior puck pursuit and skating strength, beating the Bern players to most loose pucks and generating much of the game’s offense. Still, Bern kept the game close for a little more than 40 minutes using a lineup stocked with former N.H.L. players and ambitious youngsters.Van Boxmeer, a former N.H.L. player, gave both of his goaltenders equal playing time, but neither had much success. Marco Buhrer allowed two goals, and Jonas Muller the others.The Rangers struck at 4 minutes 30 seconds, when Girardi lifted a rebound over the sprawling Buhrer. Despite a lack of much physical play, the N.H.L.-I.I.H.F. referee tandem of Don Koharski (N.H.L.) and Marcus Vinnerborg (Sweden) drew the ire of the home crowd with less than two minutes left in the period when they called separate penalties on Bern players on the same sequence. Just 12 seconds into the five-on-three power play, Redden blasted a shot from the top of the circle that beat Buhrer cleanly to the glove side for a 2-0 lead.Bern got on the scoreboard at 1:02 of the third period on a silky play by defenseman Travis Roche. He got the puck inside the Rangers’ blue line, deftly moved it around a sliding Petr Prucha and rifled a low shot that beat Stephen Valiquette to the stick side.That brought the crowd to life, but it was the last time the game was close.'"
"'08-10-01,'0','TRENTON (AP)— The pharmaceutical company, Pfizer, said Tuesday that it was shifting its research focus to diseases that have high potential for treatment improvements, like cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, and where it can be a market leader.Pfizer also is ending new research in heart disease, including treatments for high cholesterol and hardening of the arteries, as part of a standard, periodic tweaking of its research strategy, a spokeswoman, Liz Power, said Tuesday.Pfizer expects to spend $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion on research and development this year, a huge budget for the industry. Pfizer’s global research and development campuses are in Groton and New London, Conn.Like most of its rivals, Pfizer has been reorganizing and cutting costs to deal with looming generic competition and a lack of blockbusters in its pipeline.Ms. Power said Pfizer needed to focus research, particularly costly late-stage human testing, on areas where patient needs are not meant by existing treatments, where there is a sizable commercial market and where the company has expertise and a good chance for scientific success.The company has identified six high-priority areas for research: cancer, pain, inflammation, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.'"
"'08-10-01,'0','Oil prices swung higher Tuesday, recovering from the previous day’s plunge as edgy investors trickled back into the market on hopes that Congress would resurrect a failed financial bailout plan.Light, sweet crude for November delivery rose $4.27, or 4.4 percent, to settle at $100.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.On Monday, prices fell $10.52, to settle at $96.37 — the second-largest drop ever in dollar terms — after House legislators rejected the $700 billion bailout, stunning investors and raising fears of a long economic crisis that could sharply curb global energy demand.Crude has fallen about $25, or 20 percent, in the last seven days.Some recovery was to be expected after Monday’s fall, and analysts said prices would probably remain in a holding pattern until the fate of the financial rescue plan was determined. Lawmakers were expected to reconvene in Washington on Thursday, though it was unclear if they would try another vote on the bailout.Whether or not there is any agreement on a United States bailout, oil market watchers say global financial tremors have already forced consumers and businesses to scale back energy consumption, a trend that could take prices lower in coming weeks.”Oil is going to have a tough time getting back over $100 and staying there,” said Matt Zeman, head commodities trader at LaSalle Futures in Chicago. ”Even if the bailout gets done, it’s not going to solve everything immediately. The slowdown will have to work itself out for demand to take off again.”'"
"'08-10-01,'0','But House Republican leaders, who said they had been advised about the Senate plan, said the new elements would appeal to their rank-and-file, which voted strongly against the legislation Monday. A spokesman for Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, said that “Mr. Boehner was consulted and gave the green light.”Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate banking committee, said the Senate decided to move quickly, citing signs of regret from some House members after the markets plunged in response to their initial vote.“I think their will is coming back having heard from their constituents,” Mr. Dodd said.Lawmakers said the stock market response to the rejection was a sobering experience that could enhance prospects for a revised plan. Some anxiety lifted on Tuesday, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 485 points, regaining more than half of the 778 points it lost on Monday.Still, deep concern remained about credit markets, as the rate that banks charge one another shot higher — to a record high by one widely used measure — making borrowing more difficult.President Bush joined the two major presidential candidates, Senators John McCain and Barack Obama, in calling for quick action to stabilize the markets and avoid what Mr. Bush characterized as the threat of “painful and lasting” damage to the economy.Both presidential candidates and the Bush administration also endorsed the increase in bank deposit insurance.On the morning after the sell-off on Wall Street, Congressional offices reported a shift in angry calls from constituents, with some now demanding that lawmakers take some corrective action — a distinct change from the outpouring of public opposition that contributed to the defeat of the plan.“I started hearing from a lot of people who lost money on their investments thanks to the big drop on Wall Street yesterday,” said Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, who voted against the plan.As they explored ways to tinker with the proposal in consultation with the Bush administration, all sides agreed any revisions would not change the underlying concept of granting the Treasury Department access to up to $700 billion to purchase — and eventually resell — troubled securities that were clogging the financial system.It was a delicate balancing act for the architects of the proposal who had to be careful that in adding elements to entice new support they did not lose the support they already had.“Obviously you don’t want to do something to lose votes,” said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, who was among Senate Democrats who huddled Tuesday to discuss possible alterations in the proposal.Speaker Nancy Pelosi was noncommital about the new Senate plan Tuesday night, but other Democrats said it might be difficult to reject given the crisis and the array of tax breaks. “The Senate will vote tomorrow night, and the Congress will work its will,” Ms. Pelosi said. .House officials spent much of Tuesday considering their own changes, including an extension of unemployment pay and a $1,000 tax credit for less affluent homeowners.But those plans are not likely to advance given the Senate decision. While the Senate left the door open slightly to other additions to the bill, such revisions would need the agreement of the full Senate, and the House proposals were likely to be blocked by Senate Republicans.“Opening this up all over again to other things may doom it,” Mr. Dodd cautioned.The Senate proposal would cost more than $100 billion and extend and expand many individual and business tax breaks, including tax credits for the production and use of renewable energy sources, like solar energy and wind power.The bill would also extend the business tax credit for research and development, expand the child tax credit, protect millions of families from the alternative minimum tax and provide tax relief to victims of recent floods, tornadoes and severe storms.Members of the House and the Senate said the bill would create tens of thousands of jobs and reduce the nations’ dependence on foreign oil. But the two chambers have been at odds over whether and how to offset the cost of extending the many tax breaks covered by the legislation. The major obstacle has been Representative Hoyer of Maryland and other centrist Democrats.Senate and House leaders had been debating whether the Senate, where support for the proposal runs deep, should vote first to provide some momentum for a second vote across the Capital Rotunda. Some senators were leery of going on the record if the legislation could not prevail in the House, but others backed the idea of the Senate taking the lead.“I would support the Senate going first, which we would be willing to do as early as tomorrow if that would make this process successful,” Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said in a conference call on Tuesday.With no new vote in the House even possible before lawmakers reconvene Thursday at noon, strategists for both parties spent Tuesday poring over tally sheets from Monday afternoon’s 228-to-205 outcome, trying to identify lawmakers who could be persuaded to switch their votes.But winning over some determined opponents was not going to be easy.“It was one of the best votes of my career,” said Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, leader of a group of liberal Democratic opponents of the Treasury plan who on Tuesday proposed a series of regulatory and legislative alternatives to the bailout.But those Democratic opponents did say that they would be willing to back an increase to $250,000 from $100,000 in the amount of a bank deposit that would be insured by the federal government — an idea that on Tuesday gained fast currency as a consensus change in the initial plan.Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain embraced the deposit insurance proposal early Tuesday, setting off a bit of a political tiff over who deserved credit for initiating it. House Republicans claimed to have offered the insurance increase in weekend negotiations over the plan only to have it rejected.Democrats said they had no recollection of that provision being brought up in the chaotic talks, but top Democratic Congressional aides said the leadership was willing to add it to the bill and knew of no opposition. The chief uncertainty was whether it would significantly enhance the outlook for the legislation.“Everybody is on board,” said one top House aide who spoke on condition of not being identified when talking about internal deliberations. “The question is, how many votes does it bring?”With the House in recess for the observance of Jewish religious holidays, lawmakers consulted via conference call on their ideas for improving the legislation.“Some will feel very virtuous about having voted against Wall Street and then turn around and find their constituents, generally, paid a huge price for that vote,” said Senator Robert Bennett, Republican of Utah, in exhorting his colleagues to “rise to the occasion” and pass the bill.“I have faith that the members of the House and the members of the Senate will ultimately recognize their responsibility and do the right thing.”Trying to calm the markets, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid, the majority leader, released a letter to Mr. Bush, saying, “Working together, we are confident we will pass a responsible bill in the very near future.”Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, was even more emphatic. “This financial crisis is going to be dealt with by Congress, and it’s going to be dealt with by Congress this week,” Mr. McConnell told reporters.'"
"'08-10-01,'0','A closely watched index released on Tuesday showed that home prices tumbled by the sharpest annual rate ever in July, but that the rate of the monthly decline slowed.The Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller 20-city housing index fell 16.3 percent in July from the same month a year ago, the largest drop since its inception in 2000. The 10-city index plunged 17.5 percent, the biggest decline in its 21-year history.Prices in the 20-city index have plummeted nearly 20 percent since peaking in July 2006. The 10-city index has fallen more than 21 percent since its peak in June 2006.Annual prices did not gain in any city in the Case-Shiller 20-city index in July, the fourth consecutive month that has happened.The pace of monthly declines is slowing, however. Between May and July, for example, home prices fell at a cumulative rate of 2.2 percent — less than half the cumulative rate experienced between February and April.But there is “no evidence of a bottom,” said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S.& P.'"
"'08-10-01,'0','Of course, Tuesday’s rally was not unwelcome. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 5.3 percent, more than halving its 8.8 percent loss from Monday, the biggest single-day decline since Oct. 19, 1987. The Dow rose 4.7 percent to close at 10,850.66. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5 percent.Shares of banks and financial firms, which have been beaten down in recent weeks, rallied across the board. Bank of America, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch shares all rose 15 percent.Many analysts say they believe the bailout will be necessary to relieve the problems in the credit markets, which they say pose a more serious threat to the economy than the recent declines in stocks.But in the eyes of the public, the Dow can often be the most visible gauge of the economy’s health. Some analysts hoped that a silver lining of Monday’s sell-off would be an increased urgency among lawmakers to pass a revised bill.“While some policy makers don’t understand exotic funding markets, they definitely understand what nearly 1,000 points off the D.J.I.A. in one day’s time means,” Michael T. Darda, chief economist at the research firm MKM Partners in Greenwich, Conn., wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday morning.Nonetheless, problems in the credit markets were widespread on Tuesday, making it more difficult for businesses and consumers to obtain financing, and driving down the value of assets held by money-market funds.The interest rate on one-day commercial paper — usually a cheap source of financing for businesses — jumped to 3.95 percent, from 2.24 percent on Monday, pushing up the cost of these short-term loans.In a sign that banks were increasingly unwilling to lend to one another, the Fed funds rate that they charge each other to get overnight loans to finance day-to-day operations, jumped as high as 7 percent on Tuesday morning — well above the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target — before gradually falling back.In the money-market world, institutional and retail investors appeared to be seeking more safety by transferring cash to funds that invest only in government securities, considered among the safest. From Sept. 15 to Monday, $372 billion, or 19 percent of their total assets, flowed out of prime funds. That reduced the amount of money available to corporations that count on these investors to purchase their short-term notes, which help supply their daily cash needs.“The money markets have completely broken down, with no trading taking place at all,” Christoph Rieger, a fixed-income strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt, said. “Central banks are the only providers of cash to the market; no one else is lending.”Tuesday was also the close of the third quarter, a day when money managers must disclose their holdings. That tends to make them more cautious about how they manage their portfolios, which they hope to present in a favorable light.Louis V. Crandall, chief economist at the research firm Wrightson ICAP, said the end-of-quarter pressures had been even greater this month because of the problems in the credit market. Many money-market funds, he said, were lending money only for a day at a time rather than for several months.Managers of those funds have been swamped with requests from investors looking to withdraw their money after units in a multibillion-dollar money-market fund fell below a dollar last week.“Everyone is concerned even more about liquidity than about credit,” Mr. Crandall said. “As a result, everyone’s investment horizon has come in sharply.”Wrightson ICAP, Mr. Crandall’s firm, conducts a daily, anonymous survey of bank borrowing costs in New York. On Tuesday, its survey showed that banks were paying 4.356 percent for one-month unsecured loans, up from 2.499 percent a month earlier.Caution remained despite additional efforts by central banks to jump-start the flow of credit. The European Central Bank lent out 190 billion euros, or $273 billion, to banks to help unlock the hoarding mentality that has gripped them. The Bank of Japan pumped another $29 billion into credit markets.European stocks ended higher on Tuesday after a volatile session, helped along by the rise in the New York indexes. The FTSE-100 in London gained 1.7 percent; the CAC-40 in Paris rose 2 percent; and Frankfurt’s DAX index rose 0.4 percent.The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill fell 2 1/32, to 101 14/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.82 percent, up from 3.58 percent late Monday.Following are the results of Tuesday’s Treasury auction of 15-day cash management bills and four-week bills.'"

"'08-10-02,'0','The spate of abandonments has prompted an outcry about parental irresponsibility and pledges to change the state law. But it has also cast a spotlight on the hidden extent of family turmoil around the country and what many experts say is a shortage of respite care, counseling and especially psychiatric services to help parents in dire need.Some who work with troubled children add that economic conditions, like stagnant low-end wages and the epidemic of foreclosures, may make the situation worse, adding layers of worry and conflict.“I have no doubt that there are additional stresses today on families who were already on the margin,” said Gary Stangler, director of the Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative in St. Louis, which aids foster children entering adulthood.Mark Courtney, an expert on child welfare at the University of Washington, said that what happened in Nebraska “would happen in any state.”“These days there’s a huge void in services for helping distressed families,” Mr. Courtney said.When children are abused or neglected, they can be taken by the child-welfare system, and possibly enter foster care. When they commit crimes, they enter the juvenile justice system. In both cases, children and parents are supposed to receive counseling and other aid.But when troubled children do not fit those categories, they often fall through the cracks, Mr. Courtney said. Even middle-income families with health insurance often have only paltry coverage for psychiatric services and cannot afford intensive or residential treatment programs. The poorest, on Medicaid, often have trouble finding therapists who will take the low rates.And some parents are reluctant to seek whatever help does exist.Jim Jenkins, a computer network manager in Lincoln, suffered through years with his teenage son, whom he described as “out of control,”“I can see some parents getting overwhelmed and deciding that giving up the child is the best thing,” Mr. Jenkins said.The boy’s mother died when he was 8, and at age 13 he seemed to become a different person, Mr. Jenkins said, constantly in trouble at school, making threats that led to visits by the police.“It was just a living hell for years,” Mr. Jenkins said. “I didn’t know where to turn, and I took it on myself that it was my fault.”Finally, the police made him put his son in a hospital for troubled youth for several days, then told him about a respite program at Cedars Home for Children, which took the boy for a week, giving Mr. Jenkins, his daughter and his new wife a break and starting therapy for the boy.“After a while, you realize this is not going to end today, there is no 30-minute solution,” Mr. Jenkins said.But after years of therapy, his son turned a corner, has a diploma and plans to go to college.“I was lucky,” Mr. Jenkins said, adding that a parent with more children, a less flexible employer and little money may just throw his hands up.In July, Nebraska became the last of the states to enact a so-called safe-haven law. Such laws permit mothers to leave an infant at a facility with no fear of prosecution. Nationwide, more than 2,000 babies have been turned over since Texas enacted the first such law in 1999, according to the National Safe Haven Alliance in Virginia.But Nebraska’s version was far broader than all others, protecting not just infants but also children up to age 19.State Senator Arnie Stuthman, sponsor of the Nebraska bill, said some legislators had said they wanted to protect all children from harm.“The law in my opinion is being abused now,” said Mr. Stuthman, who said he would push for a revision. “There are family services out there, but some people may lack the resources to take advantage of them, and we’ve got to take a hard look at what more we can provide.”Todd A. Landry, the state director of children and family services, denied that the involved families had not had access to aid — most of the children, for example, were in the state Medicaid program and some had received psychiatric care — and he noted that well-publicized hot lines could direct families to help.“Some parents had accessed our services but weren’t getting the results they wanted,” Mr. Landry said.“The appropriate response is to reach out to family, friends and community resources,” he said. “What is not appropriate is just to say I’m tired of dealing with this and drop the child off at a hospital.”Mr. Landry said parents and guardians were mistaken if they thought they could walk away from their responsibilities. For now, such children will be placed in foster care or with relatives, but the courts could require parents to attend counseling and might even order them to pay child support.He said economic distress was a major issue in only one case, that of Gary Staton, 34, the father of 10 whose wife had died.Mr. Staton, who gave up all but his oldest child, an 18-year-old girl, remains something of a mystery. His wife died in February 2007 after giving birth to the 10th child. Both parents had sporadic employment.For nine months, in 2004, the children were taken by child welfare officials because their home was filthy and disordered, and the gas and water had been turned off. The family has since received public aid with rent and utility bills while Mr. Staton, for unclear reasons, recently quit a factory job.Their rented yellow wooden house in a low-income area of north Omaha was vacant last weekend and showed signs of disrepair, with part of the roof crumbling and a broken window covered with a blanket.In a telephone interview, with KETV in Omaha, Mr. Staton mentioned the loss of his wife of 17 years.“We raised them together,” he said. “I didn’t think I could do it alone. I fell apart. I couldn’t take care of them.”“I was able to get the kids to a safe place before they were homeless,” he said. “I hope they know I love them. I hope their future is better without me around them.”Stunned relatives offered last week to take in the children, and officials said they would probably go to two family homes as soon as background checks were complete.Joanne Manzner, the stepmother of the deceased wife, said relatives had frequent contact with Mr. Staton’s family, sometimes taking children for a weekend to give him a rest, and were puzzled that he had not asked for help before taking such drastic action.Officials and some private agencies differed this week about the adequacy of the state’s family programs.“In Nebraska, as in a lot of states, we don’t have sufficient funding to provide a really strong mental health system for kids,” said Judy Kay, chief operating officer for the Child Saving Institute in Omaha, which helps families in crisis. “But we do have resources that many parents are not aware of or are not using,” including psychiatric counseling with fees tied to family income. .Some who abandoned children last month were aunts, uncles or grandmothers who had taken custody when the parents were incapable of providing care. Several families had prior contact with social workers and psychologists, but the children remained violent and unmanageable.Judy Lopez, 48, and her husband took charge of her grandsons here more than three years ago . Both boys had been neglected and physically abused; now, ages 7 and 9, they have severe behavioral problems involving fighting, stealing and lying.“Some days I just want to pull my hair out,” Ms. Lopez said, adding that like many other families, they were slow to seek aid.The school suggested a free program managed by the schools and the Child Saving Institute, a local nonprofit organization, that combined counseling for parents and for the children. The boys see a therapist, Ms. Lopez said, and the problems have eased somewhat.“Help is out there,” she said, “but people have to know how to find it.”'"

"'08-10-02,'0','“Small businesses are sitting on their hands,” said Chad Moutray, chief economist of the . “Either they can’t get the capital or they don’t want the capital. They read what is happening, and frankly they are scared.”Even with the current turmoil in the credit markets, big established businesses generally have far greater access to credit than their smaller cousins. For borrowing, small businesses often rely on banks, credit cards and small-business loans. Big businesses have substantial bank lines of credit that they can draw down as needed if they have trouble issuing new debt, usually a less expensive option. While the markets remain cool to financial companies and those with any hint of debt problems, many corporations have been able to sustain their financing, often by selling commercial paper, a form of short-term financing, albeit at higher rates than a month ago.At Railway, a giant freight line with 40,000 employees and $20 billion in annual revenue, the biggest concern is the rising cost of all its credit, said Thomas N. Hund, the chief financial officer. “We will continue to borrow to fund expansion,” Mr. Hund said, “and if we saw growth in the economy next year, we would have an appetite for a greater expansion plan. But we don’t see growth, and we are going to be extremely cautious in our investments.”That sense of bracing for harder times is evident in little ways, at companies large and small. , the owner of Chicago Metal Rolled Products, which forms steel into supports for stadium roofs, school gymnasiums, large canopies and the like, has reduced the steel he keeps in inventory over the last month, buying only what is immediately used.That decision, multiplied across many companies, means suppliers will make less and stockpiles will shrink. There will be less production to drive the economy.Chicago Metal is saving money, and so far its customers, mainly commercial construction companies, continue to buy the curved steel supports. “When you just watch the news, everything sounds pretty gloomy,” said Mr. Wendt, who employs 85 people at a plant in Chicago. “But so far our market is still relatively strong.”Mr. Petrucci, who owns B A Die Mold in Aurora, Ill., employing 17 people to make his metal molds, also says the financial crisis has not touched him. What is more, the banks, having shed what they consider risky borrowers, are actively selling loans to those they consider creditworthy, and that includes Mr. Petrucci’s company. With $2 million in annual revenue, almost no debt and enough orders to keep busy through January, Mr. Petrucci’s lenders are coming to him, he says.The rate they offer has risen to 7 percent, a percentage point more than in mid-September, but the lenders are persuasive. Mr. Petrucci says he will soon borrow $200,000 to replace an aging computer-controlled lathe and to acquire the latest in electrical cutting gear.“We are not going to increase capacity; we are buying this equipment only because we want to do things better,” he said. “We are that this financial disaster is going to have a controlled solution, and hopefully it won’t impact us too greatly.”Die Mold’s trial by fire came in the 2001 recession. Half of Mr. Petrucci’s roughly 140 competitors in the Chicago area went under, and Die Mold’s staff shrank to 17, the present number, from 28. Orders picked up by middecade, but Mr. Petrucci, a mechanical engineer who founded Die Mold in 1968, says he resisted the temptation to expand his operation to its former size and risk going under in the next downturn.“It would have to be very severe to hurt us now,” he said, adding, for example, that his automated grinding machines operate unattended at night, and if orders were to shrink substantially, he would turn off the machines overnight as a first step.Superior Medical Supply, which Mr. Snyder, who is 30, and two relatives founded in 2004, buys all sorts of medical equipment and supplies from manufacturers, and resells them to nursing and ambulatory care facilities, private doctors and surgical centers. The customers normally pay within 60 days, Mr. Snyder said, but he must pay his suppliers in 30, which means he needs credit to bridge the gap — and more so than ever as sales rise toward the $6 million mark.Early on, a community bank gave Superior a $100,000 line of credit. Last year it raised that to $175,000. But when Mr. Snyder sought another increase late last month, he was turned down.“We are being told that the company does not appear strong enough to take on additional financing,” Mr. Snyder said. To qualify for more credit, he said, Superior would have to increase the $500,000 the partners now have invested in their company.So they turned to the Liquid Capital Corporation, which lends against “receivables.” That means Superior gives Liquid Capital the right to collect the money owed by Superior’s customers, and Superior, in return, gets a line of credit. Mr. Snyder would like to draw down $240,000 to keep his company’s expansion on track, and Liquid Capital says it is ready to lend that amount.But Mr. Snyder is reluctant to borrow so much, at 30 percent annual interest, so he will draw down only $150,000. “We don’t want to expand at a rate that causes instability for our company, and borrowing $240,000 at 30 percent would do that,” he said.The growing reluctance by conventional banks to lend is reflected in Liquid Capital’s loan activity, which has increased 40 percent since August, to $200 million, the company says. The National Federation of Independent Business, in its monthly survey of 600 members, found in August that 10 percent were having more difficulty getting bank loans than three months earlier. That was the highest level since the 1990-91 recession.“In late summer, conditions did get tougher,” said William Dennis Jr., the federation’s director of research. “Our members are nervous about going to their banks.”Some are also nervous about their sales. Michael Frome, 40, a partner in Fromeco Scale Avionics, says they are way off. He and a partner lease space in a hangar in Sandy, Ore., where they and three employees build parts for remote-controlled model airplanes — not the balsa wood variety, but steel planes with wing spans up to 10 feet. Hobbyists buy them for $5,000 to $10,000 and often race them.A month ago, Mr. Frome realized that the hobbyists, most of them men over 50 with six-figure incomes, had all but stopped buying the planes and replacement parts — including a new electronic device, developed by Fromeco, that logs flight data. Sales plummeted from a $1 million annual rate to half that level, and they are still falling.Mr. Frome attributes the sudden drop-off to the sophistication of the hobbyists, whom he describes as conversant with Wall Street, investors themselves and shocked more than most by the current debacle.“I think my customers are quickly reducing their discretionary spending to near zero and squirreling away money,” Mr. Frome said. “Fear and uncertainty grip them.”'"
"'08-10-02,'0','But the real payoff for Mr. Buffett will come if G.E.’s battered stock rebounds. As part of the financing, Berkshire Hathaway is receiving warrants to purchase $3 billion of G.E. common stock for $22.25 a share, at any time over the next five years. In regular trading, G.E. shares closed down $1 a share on Wednesday, at $24.50 a share, and rose in after-hours trading before closing at the same price. G.E.’s shares are off 13 percent in the last month, and down 34 percent so far this year.Yet despite the seemingly generous terms for Mr. Buffett, analysts say, G.E. is getting not only needed financing but also a credibility dividend.“Warren Buffett has become the new triple-A credit rating system,” said Edward Yardeni, an independent investment strategist. “It’s a big endorsement for G.E.”Mr. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, said in a statement, “G.E. is the symbol of American business to the world,” adding that he has known the company’s leaders for decades. “They have strong global brands and businesses with which I am quite familiar. I am confident that G.E. will continue to be successful in the years to come,” he said.Besides the Buffett investment, G.E. announced that it planned to sell at least $12 billion in common stock to the public. The offering is expected to be priced just before the opening of the stock market on Thursday.G.E. portrayed its financing plans as a kind of insurance policy, giving the company ballast in extremely uncertain times. Last Thursday, G.E. announced that it would report lower-than-expected profits for the third quarter, citing “unprecedented weakness and volatility in the financial services markets.” The company also lowered its earnings outlook for the year.The company also outlined steps to bolster its finance arm, GE Capital, by reducing the dividend it pays to the parent company, halting G.E.’s stock buyback program and becoming less dependent on short-term commercial paper borrowings. Last Thursday, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive, called those steps “tough decisions to further reduce risk and strengthen our balance sheet.”After a few days, however, those steps did not seem to go far enough. After Wachovia, the nation’s fourth-largest bank, reached for a lifeline and was sold to Citigroup, and the House rejection of a bailout plan on Monday, G.E. decided more drastic action was needed. Mr. Immelt, who has known Mr. Buffett for years, quickly negotiated the financing deal.G.E. is potentially vulnerable to a credit squeeze because of GE Capital, whose global portfolio spans aircraft leasing, commercial real estate, credit cards and home mortgages. It no longer has a mortgage-lending operation in the United States, it has shunned exotic securities and G.E. retains its triple-A credit rating.But G.E. has about $90 billion in commercial paper, which is short-term, low-cost borrowing made for as little as one month. Commercial paper costs have risen for G.E., as it has for others, though it has been tapping that market throughout the crisis.Yet if that lending market simply froze in a panic, analysts say, G.E. would face a liquidity squeeze and probably be forced to pull back from some businesses in a forced shrinkage.The financing from Mr. Buffett and sale of shares to the public, plus its cash on hand and credit lines from banks, analysts say, add up to about $90 billion — effectively hedging the company’s risk from a seize-up in the commercial paper market.In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Immelt said the financing gave G.E. more flexibility and liquidity in case the financial markets worsen. If things hold steady, he suggested, G.E. will be looking for opportunities to buy with its extra cash. “It gives us the opportunity to play offense in this market should conditions allow,” he said.'"
"'08-10-02,'0','Earlier on Wednesday, Undersheriff Frank Bernard said searchers needed to hurry because the area where Mr. Morrow uncovered the items was expected to receive its first snowfall of the season this weekend. Mammoth Lakes is about 10,000 feet above sea level, and snow makes already difficult terrain largely impassable and could bury plane wreckage.Mr. Morrow, 43, who did not return calls on Wednesday, told KNBC-TV in Los Angeles that he was hiking “way, way off” the established trailways in the Ansel Adams Wilderness section of the two-million-acre Inyo National Forest when he first spotted a bunch of $100 bills. He then noticed the laminated cards with Mr. Fossett’s name but did not notify the authorities until Tuesday because it took him a day to recall who Mr. Fossett was, he told KNBC.Mr. Fossett’s wife, Peggy, issued a statement on Wednesday saying she was monitoring the situation.“I am hopeful that this search will locate the crash site and my husband’s remains,” Mrs. Fossett said. “I am grateful to all of those involved in this effort.”The Fossetts were married for 39 years and had no children. Mr. Fossett was declared dead by a Chicago judge this year at his wife’s request.A Fossett spokeswoman said she did not know how the items Mr. Morrow found compared with what Mr. Fossett might have been wearing when he disappeared.Yet Cynthia Ryan, spokeswoman for the Nevada Civil Air Patrol when that agency led the original search last year, said she had been told that Mr. Fossett went on his flight in a pair of sweatpants and a T-shirt. There was never any mention that he was wearing a black fleece pullover like the one found in the vicinity of the money and identifications, Ms. Ryan said.The Inyo region was flown over repeatedly during the monthlong search for Mr. Fossett, but those who have hiked and flown over it say it is dense, mountainous forest where something as small as a two-seat light aircraft would be easy to overlook.“It’s very hard to see by air; there’s so many crevices, so many rocks, so many crazy shapes that unless you’re looking literally a few feet from it, it would be very hard to see,” said Rusty Aimer, chief executive of Aviation Experts, an aviation consulting firm based in San Clemente, Calif., who has flown the Inyo region many times. “Everybody was saying that someday some hiker would run into the wreckage of his airplane, and here it is, that’s almost exactly what’s happened.”Mr. Fossett held numerous world records and was the first person to circumvent the world in a hot-air balloon as well as the first to fly a plane solo around the globe without refueling. His close friend Richard Branson had said that Mr. Fossett was most likely flying around the Yerington area searching for dry lake beds in which to challenge the world’s land-speed record, his latest quest.'"

"'08-10-02,'0','It was the mayor himself who chose to ignore the far better solution of putting it on the ballot for a 2008 referendum.Second, Bloomberg allies are arguing that the current economic crisis justifies this extraordinary remedy. But isn’t that more an after-the-fact alibi rather than a real argument?This week’s national “crisis” will largely be politically resolved by national legislation shortly. By 2010, the only serious issue for the next mayor will be budgetary — and whoever serves in 2010-13 will have an Office of Management and Budget doing necessary belt-tightening. Neither Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg nor Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. are indispensable men.Third, your editorial doesn’t mention why the election in 2009 is inadequate voter ratification. For Mr. Bloomberg’s likely $100 million-plus campaign treasury would in reality mean that an undemocratic power grab in 2008 would be ratified by an undemocratic election in 2009.If the mayor insists on going ahead with a law vetoing voters, will he at least have the courage to opt in to the public finance system and run on his substantial record rather than on his bank account? Mark GreenThe writer was public advocate for New York City, 1994-2001, and lost the mayoral election to Michael R. Bloomberg in 2001.I am a lifelong New Yorker who voted for term limits with enthusiasm. I am one of the majority who approved them. Nothing could be a clearer expression of the democratic will of the people.Reading your editorial, which supports nullification of our votes, you must imagine that we voters are children needing parental guidance. I often hear voters express that we have little real choice. We often vote for the “lesser of two evils.” The term limits issue is unusual in that it was broadly and enthusiastically supported by the people at the ballot box. It was a pleasure to vote for it.It would be disgusting to permit City Council members to overturn it because they are self-interested. Overturning term limits may permit Council members to keep their salaries and perks and power and broaden their personal opportunities.To quote Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in the past, any attempt by self-interested government officials to overturn our vote is “disgusting.” Your not liking our vote is your privilege; nullifying our vote should not be anyone’s privilege. Michael StepperI agree with you that term limits should be reconsidered, and I’d remind people that what we used to use for term limits we once called “elections.”While incumbency confers some advantage, it can always be trumped in an election by the supporters of a more competent candidate.Term limits seem like a stereotyping problem: a given politician has been in office forever and repeatedly demonstrates how out of touch she or he is; therefore, they’re all incompetent, so let’s limit their terms to get that one out of office.This does not seem like an intelligent way to run a railroad or anything else.I agree with everything you said about term limits, with one exception: to show how disinterested they are, the politicians now in office should repeal term limits but make the vote apply only to those not now serving.I was never in favor of the term limits law, and I am not in favor of it now. It is, however, the law.Bad laws should be changed, but only in a manner that is respectful of basic principles of law. Having the term limits law amended in the manner you suggest — by the current members of the City Council, who will materially and personally benefit from the amendment — does not meet that basic test.After 9/11, some people thought that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was irreplaceable, that he should stay on as mayor beyond the end of his term despite the law. Mayor Giuliani was not irreplaceable after 9/11, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is not irreplaceable now.What is irreplaceable is our commitment to our basic principles. If this bad law is amended in the manner you suggest, we will live to regret that departure from our principles.'"
"'08-10-02,'0','The election cycle is entering a time when voters historically begin to make final judgments; this year, in fact, many of them are actually beginning early voting in states. What is more, the poll suggests voters have been guided by how Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama did in their debate last Friday, and also how they have responded to the crisis on Wall Street and the resulting deadlock in Washington about how to respond to it.In the CBS News poll, 54 percent of respondents said Mr. Obama had a plan for dealing with the economic crisis, compared with 48 percent who said Mr. McCain did. And 47 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the way Mr. McCain was handling the current economic crisis, compared with 33 percent who approved and 20 percent who said they had no opinion. For Mr. Obama, 32 percent of respondents said they disapproved of his response, compared with 43 percent of respondents who approved; the rest had no opinion.And two-thirds of respondents said the highest-profile action Mr. McCain has made in response to the crisis — announcing that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington and help negotiators strike a deal — had made no difference in the outcome of the talks.The CBS News poll suggested one sharp contrast in the view of voters of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain that might have been fed by the different ways the two men responded to the crisis. Forty-five percent said Mr. McCain acted too quickly when he made a decision, compared with 29 percent who said he did not act quickly enough. For Mr. Obama, 23 percent said he acted too quickly, compared with 41 percent who said he did not act quickly enough.The national poll findings by CBS News were echoed in polls released Tuesday by Time magazine and the . Perhaps more problematic for Mr. McCain were polls, also taken after the debate and in the midst of the financial crisis, suggesting problems for him in critical states, including Florida and , which President Bush won in 2004 and which Mr. McCain had been confident of holding, and Pennsylvania, a state that Democrats won last time and that Mr. McCain has put on the top of the list of states he has been trying to win. Complete results for all the polls are at .Polls by , taken Saturday through Monday, showed Mr. Obama ahead in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Time/CNN battleground polls also showed Mr. Obama with a lead in and Virginia, a state that has been on the top of the pickup lists for Mr. Obama.The CBS News national survey suggested a toxic atmosphere for incumbents in general, but particularly for Republicans. The approval rating for Congress is down to 15 percent, another historic low for the Times/CBS News poll.The CBS News poll found economic among Americans as high as it has ever been in the history of the poll. Nine in 10 Americans said the economy was in very bad or fairly bad shape, the highest measure on that score since The Times and CBS News began asking the question in September 1986. (The percentage who said that the economy was in very good shape was less than 1 percent.) And the number of Americans who thought the economy was getting worse, 76 percent, set another record: the gloomiest Americans have been since the question was first asked in April 1974.The CBS News poll, of 1,257 adults, including 1,113 registered voters, was conducted Saturday through Tuesday and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.The polling comes on the eve of the vice-presidential debate between Gov. of , a Republican, and Senator , Democrat of , and provides new evidence that Ms. Palin’s standing among voters has declined since Mr. McCain chose her as his running mate in August.The Pew poll found that 51 percent of respondents said she was not qualified to be president, compared with 37 percent who said she was. That is a reversal from early last month, when 52 percent of respondents said Ms. Palin was qualified to be president.'"

"'08-10-02,'0','This week, the Small Business Administration posted the final version of the rule meant to deal with Congress’s order. The rule said the 5 percent set-aside covers contracts in 31 industries, an increase from the agency’s original proposal to include only four industries, which Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, the ranking Republican on the Senate Small Business Committee, called a “sham proposal.” Still, the new number represented less than a third of the 140 industries eligible for government contracts.Ms. Snowe was among the 16 female senators to write to S.B.A. last week to urge a better remedy for the shortfall in contracting opportunities for women.The push for more contracts for female-owned businesses comes as increasing numbers of women are running their own companies and looking for ways to expand. Many women, including Ms. Bierman, argue that a lack of defined guidelines for contracts for female-owned businesses — along with complacency, inertia or just the inconvenience of switching suppliers — have reduced the opportunities for women.“I’ve knocked on doors for 20 years,” said Ms. Bierman, whose company, Colt Safety, sells products including safety glasses, masks and respirators. “But procurement is a confusing and time-consuming maze that’s so difficult to get through.”Organizations like Women Impacting Public Policy, a bipartisan group representing about 500,000 businesses owned by women, have started programs to help women navigate the complicated contracting system.“Federal government contracts are an enormous opportunity for women to help increase their revenues by billions each year,” said Barbara Kasoff, president and chief executive of the group. “Right now only 67,000 women-owned businesses are registered with the government, which is less than a quarter of the total number.”Her group’s program, called Give Me 5, started with Open, the small-business service of American Express. Give Me 5 provides a comprehensive brochure, seminars, events and online education to women business owners on how to register, qualify and identify their areas of expertise for federal government contracts.The United States Women’s Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Women Business Owners also offer assistance. And last May, the S.B.A. began running an online discussion and offering an online course to encourage women — more than 8,000 signed up — and other groups to participate in the contracting process.Still, many women remain flummoxed by the system.Laurie Simon, chief executive of Ombrella Consulting in Seattle, which helps companies like Microsoft introduce new products and systems, said she was ready to compete with big companies for contracts but was not sure how to go about it.“We’ve taken the first step — registering on the C.C.R.,” Ms. Simon said, referring to the government’s Central Contractor Registration database, which requires information like the company’s taxpayer identification number from the Internal Revenue Service and determines the firm’s areas of expertise under a system of six-digit codes.The new Give Me 5 program offers a checklist with all the registry’s requirements so that small businesses can assemble all the financial data needed to complete the process more smoothly and rapidly.Mary Schnack, president of Mary Schnack Media Services in Sedona, Ariz., enrolled in an early version of the Give Me 5 program and said it pushed her to “get my financial house in order.” That made registering easy because she already had obtained items like her company’s unique identifying number from Dun & Bradstreet. And now she is moving on to search for subcontracting opportunities for her public speaking and media training service.“In the past, I had looked at federal contracting, but I felt my business was so small that I wondered what was the point?” she said. “I could spend the same amount of money on business I really had a chance to get.”But in the last five years, she said, she has been looking harder at government contracts as a way to expand her business. When she meets other female business owners, she said, “We all talk about how difficult it is to track down what’s available and to know exactly who you are competing against.”Ms. Schnack recently sat down with Ann Sullivan, head of government relations for Women Impacting Public Policy. Ms. Sullivan helped her figure out which government codes applied to her business, who her competitors were and how to go about combing through fedbizopps.gov and other online sources to find contracts that she could realistically bid for.Female business owners said one of the stickier points in the contracting process was figuring out whether to be certified, which means accumulating certain detailed financial information and dealing with an on-site visit from the certifying agency. Groups like the United States Women’s Chamber of Commerce certify female-owned businesses. The National Association of Women Business Owners plans to start a certification service with the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council.The government’s central contractor registry allows small-business owners to certify themselves, but some have raised questions about whether all such entries are legitimate. The women’s chamber of commerce group issued a report last week that said 27 of the 50 firms owned by women listed as the top recipients of government contracts had male chief executive officers. Margot Dorfman, the chief executive of the women’s chamber, said that finding undercut the credibility of the self-certification program.The key, Ms. Kasoff and others say, is for Congress to pass new legislation specifying firm guidelines for federal government contract awards to firms owned by women.“This is the area for growth, and we need to understand it,” said Ms. Kasoff who said that in the next year, the new Give Me 5 program was seeking to double, to nearly 150,000, the number of women registered as eligible for government contracts.'"
"'08-10-02,'0','Earlier in the day he intensified his efforts to rally support for the legislation as he sought to sell the idea to skeptical voters — and members of Congress — by presenting it as a plan to ""safeguard the American economy.""""This plan is not perfect.,” Mr. Obama told thousands of people at a downtown rally in La Crosse, Wis., not far from the Mississippi River. “Democrats and Republicans in Congress have legitimate concerns about it. I know many Americans share those concerns, but it is clear that this is what we must do right now to prevent a crisis from turning into a catastrophe.""In a speech in Missouri, Mr. McCain struck a similar tone on Wednesday as he characterized the urgency of the moment, which he called, ""the greatest financial crisis of our lifetimes.""""It took Congress a while, and there were costs to these delays, but they have awakened to the danger,"" Mr. McCain told an audience in Independence, Mo. ""And today, with the unity that this crisis demands, Congress will once again work to restore confidence and stability to the American economy.""He said that ""there will be a time to fix the blame for all that has happened — especially in the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the abuses and political deal-making that corrupted those institutions, but our duty right now is to fix the problem.”“Following Sept. 11, our national leaders came together at a time of crisis,” Mr. McCain added. “Now, with this measure, we have another chance to come together to prove that Washington is once again capable of leading this country.”It is the second time in two weeks that the two presidential candidates are returning to Washington, summoned by the economic crisis. The two are expected to cast similar votes, but not necessarily speak on the Senate floor in advance of the vote on Wednesday evening.Mr. McCain, at a moment when his own running mate’s qualifications to be president are being increasingly questioned by the left and the right, came to the home of Harry S. Truman, a man many feared was unqualified when he was suddenly thrust into the presidency.""When, to his and everyone’s surprise, he assumed the office of the president and the mantle of leader of the free world, he faced the grave and difficult decisions that would end the World War and remake the world out of its ashes,"" Mr. McCain said in a speech at the Harry S. Truman Library.Mr. McCain — who seemed somewhat testy when was asked this week about the qualifications of his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, by the editorial board of The Des Moines Register — never mentioned her by name today. But he painted a vivid picture of an unlikely president who exceeded expectations.""He was a man of principle, of wisdom and a deep and abiding love for our country,” Mr. McCain said of the Missouri Democrat, who assumed the presidency upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. ""His accomplishments in war and peace are among the most significant of any president in the Twentieth Century. He succeeded beyond everyone’s expectations — perhaps, even his own — because every day Harry Truman woke up determined to put his country before party and self-interest.""Mr. Obama, on a crisp fall morning in downtown La Crosse, sought to explain the need for the economic rescue plan. But the light applause from the audience underscored the challenge facing both candidates.Mr. Obama said the plan had been ""misunderstood and, frankly, poorly communicated.""For the second day in a row, he devoted nearly an entire speech to explaining the plan, casting it as essential to warding off a crisis from rippling through the economy. He barely mentioned Wall Street as he presented his argument for the plan, portraying it instead as a necessary challenge for all Americans.""This is not a plan to just hand over $700 billion of your money to a few banks,"" Mr. Obama said. ""If this is managed correctly, we will hopefully get most or all of our money back — we might even turn a profit on the government’s investment — every penny of which will go directly back to you, the investor.""Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, used the bulk of his address to speak about the financial crisis, praising Congress for moving to contain it. But he also delivered a withering assessment of Congress, and tried to reassure voters, who overwhelmingly say that the country has been put on the wrong track under the current Republican president, that he would turn things around if he was elected.Lacrosse, a city that sits along the western edge of Wisconsin, has long been a leading battleground in presidential campaigns.Back-to-back commercials from Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain filled morning television programming here, with each of the messages devoted to the economy.But in a 36-minute speech, Mr. Obama mentioned his Republican rival by name only once. While politics was hardly off the table, the sharp rhetoric that has defined the campaign took a momentary backseat to a bipartisan call to action on the economic rescue plan, which both candidates now share ownership of.""Future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test,” he said. “Will they say that this was a time when America lost its way and its purpose, when we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession?""Or will they say that this was another one of those moments when America overcame,” Mr. Obama said, steadily drawing his audience into applause, “when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other’s success?

"'08-10-02,'0','While the major banks in Europe, including Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Société Générale, appear to be weathering the financial storm fairly well, several others have been taken over through government-engineered consolidations or nationalizations. The stepped up pace of activity comes as yet another bank, the giant pan-European lender, UniCredit of Italy, came under pressure in the stock market.UniCredit declared Wednesday that it was well capitalized but was being damaged by stock speculators after its shares were temporarily suspended from trading in Milan.Talk of a European bailout fund of 300 billion euros ($420 billion) made waves late on Wednesday, after Christine Lagarde, France’s finance minister, acknowledged that some sort of fund would be discussed at the weekend meeting.“We are in agreement within the E.U. that we need to support the financial sector,” Ms. Lagarde, who did not put a price tag on any such fund, told the German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview to be published Thursday. “Then the question arises: Do we need a European rescue fund to save banks?”Mr. Sarkozy’s office and the finance ministry were quick to deny that the fund was a French idea, and the German finance ministry attacked the notion as unwarranted.One European official suggested that the plan had been floated by the Netherlands. Jan Peter Balkenende, the prime minister of the Netherlands, will meet with Mr. Sarkozy in Paris on Thursday. The fund might take the form of a reserve set aside for emergencies by each country, with each setting aside the same percentage of gross domestic product.Another idea, which is being offered by the French, is the creation of a European regulator of banks and insurers, a “European policeman,” as Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the French European affairs minister, called it Wednesday. That would most likely mean a significant tightening of coordination among national regulators.Officials are also looking at ways to standardize deposit insurance levels across Europe to avoid limits being ratcheted up haphazardly from one country to another in response to seeming panics. Ireland decided this week to provide unlimited protection for all deposits at six Irish banks.France would also like to see changes to European accounting rules, which stipulate that banks and insurers have to mark down their assets in line with short-term movements in the market. Changes to the “mark to market” rules are also being considered at the Securities and Exchange Commission.While France waits for those wide-ranging reforms to be discussed, both Paris and Berlin are expected to call for a systematic suspension of rules that limit government assistance to national banks. In the current climate, they seek greater latitude to rescue stricken institutions. Officials in Britain said they were generally behind such a proposal.Germany, meanwhile, is arguing that Brussels should ease up in its enforcement of strict rules against subsidies. Such a step would have immediate relevance for the German bank WestLB, as well as other German state-owned banks.WestLB won initial approval for a 5 billion euro “risk shield” financed by the German government, regional German governments and local savings banks, to avoid a fire sale of its mortgage-linked assets. But it still needs to complete a restructuring that will persuade Neelie Kroes, the European competition commissioner, that the bank — after bailouts stretching back a decade — is on sound footing.Ms. Kroes sought to pre-empt calls to abandon government aid limits by speeding through authorization of the Bradford & Bingley nationalization.At the same time, she made an indirect criticism of the Irish government, which, according to European officials, gave little notice before announcing its deposit guarantee for six Irish banks. Britain said it would increase its guarantee for depositors to £50,000 ($88,700), from £35,000.Ms. Kroes warned governments to consult before taking actions, and invoked the Great Depression. “When Europe was confronted with a banking crisis in the 1930s, governments decided to go national, to retreat from the European markets and close their borders,” she argued. “I would like to plead to national governments today not to act unilaterally.”But Mr. Trichet cautioned against precipitous actions. Because Europe is not a “fully-fledged federation,” he said, a pan-European solution was unlikely.“Each country has to mobilize its own efforts,” he told Bloomberg Television in remarks released Wednesday. “But of course there is a European spirit and that is the spirit of the single market.”Britain is trying to steer the debate toward a “college” of national regulators that would coordinate their decisions. Luigi Guiso, professor of economics and finance at the European University Institute, said that so far national governments had dealt reasonably effectively with the situation but that would be tested if there was a problem with a bank like UniCredit, which operates in 22 countries, including Italy and Germany and in Eastern Europe.In hopes of preventing the situation from worsening, the Italian securities market regulator, Consob, said Wednesday that it had banned short sales, or bets on declines of banking and insurance stocks, following similar measures by British, American, German and French authorities.'"
"'08-10-02,'0','President Bush issued a statement applauding the Senate for its vote in favor of a bill he called “essential to the financial security of every American.” He urged the House to follow suit.In the House, officials of both parties said they were increasingly confident that politically enticing provisions bootstrapped to the original bill — including $150 billion in tax breaks for individuals and businesses — would win over at least the dozen or so votes needed to reverse Monday’s outcome and send the measure to President Bush.The stock market reflected nervous jitters over a vote that was to occur after it closed but that could affect the future of many Wall Street workers. The Dow Jones industrial average was off almost 220 points during the day, but recovered to close down just 19.6 points, or 0.2 percent, at 10,831.07.Besides the tax breaks, senators also made a change that had drawn widespread support in recent days — a temporary increase in the amount of bank deposits covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to $250,000 from $100,000. And the entire package was attached to legislation requiring insurers to treat mental health conditions more like general health problems, a long-sought goal of many lawmakers who demanded such parity.As the shape of the new bill became more clear Wednesday, some House Republicans and Democrats indicated that the changes were enough to get them to take another look at the measure and perhaps change their minds — even though the new items being added would substantially increase the burden on taxpayers.Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who on Monday voted no, said he found the new proposal more acceptable, as did Representative Jim Ramstad, a retiring Republican from Minnesota who voted in opposition as well.“The inclusion of parity, tax extenders and the F.D.I.C. increases has caused me to reconsider my position,” Mr. Ramstad said. “All three additions have greatly improved the bill.”Leaders of both parties in the House, who spent much of Wednesday on the phone taking the temperature of lawmakers not scheduled to return until Thursday, said they were identifying other potential converts as well, and were finding a more receptive audience for the revised measure because of the tax package and other changes.Some conservative House Republicans and liberal Democrats remained adamantly opposed. “The bailout legislation that the Senate is sending back to the House is a fraternal twin to the one I voted against on Monday — meet the new bill, same as the old bill,” said Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas.While popular, the tax breaks, which had been the center of a bitter dispute between House and Senate Democrats, caused problems as well.A coalition of centrist Democrats led by Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, had refused to back the tax benefits unless they were deficit neutral — offset by tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere. The bill now includes the Senate version of the tax plan, which adds most of the cost to the deficit over the next decade.But the Senate leaders decided to present the House with a take-it-or-leave-it choice, and it is possible some Democrats could desert the bill over the tactic. Mr. Reid said the Senate would remain in session this week to see how House members react and whether they might attempt to change the bill, forcing another Senate review.Mr. Hoyer said he was disappointed in the Senate’s decision on the tax breaks and worried it could cost Democratic votes. “Certainly there are people who are upset we are making the deficit worse as we are trying to stabilize the economy,” Mr. Hoyer told reporters. But in a telephone conference call among the Democratic leadership Wednesday morning, he told his colleagues he would back the measure because the economic rescue needed to take priority, according to participants.In the end, Senate leaders decided to overcome some of the ideological and political resistance that doomed the measure in the House with the tried-and-true Congressional approach of stuffing the bill with provisions that would make it hard for many lawmakers to resist.“All I’m trying to do is get this thing passed,” said Mr. Reid, denying he was trying to jam the House by giving members no choice but to accept the tax proposal he favored or again reject the bailout.The multiple tax breaks, called extenders in the Capitol because they renew or extend expiring tax benefits, appeal to many lawmakers and could provide a political argument for backing a bill that has otherwise been very unpopular.Instead of siding with a $700 billion bailout, lawmakers could now say they voted for increased protection for deposits at the neighborhood bank, income tax relief for middle-class taxpayers and aid for schools in rural areas where the federal government owns much of the land.“This bill has been packaged with a lot of very popular things to give it even more momentum,” said Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama, who is an opponent.The approximately $150 billion in new tax breaks, which offer incentives for the use of renewable energy and relieve 24 million households from an estimated $65 billion alternative-minimum tax scheduled to take effect this year, would be offset by only about $40 billion in spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere.Moreover, the increase in federal deposit insurance will not be financed over the short term, as the insurance program now is, by assessing premiums on banks that benefit. Instead, banks will get an open-ended line of credit directly to the Treasury Department. But the Congressional Budget Office noted that federal law requires the banks to eventually make up any shortfall and any loans to be repaid, though not until at least 2010.The changes in the bill were measurable by volume. The initial proposal from the Treasury Department ran just three pages; the latest version exceeds 450.After receiving the proposal from Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. almost two weeks ago, Congress instituted a series of changes, including additional oversight, steps to limit home foreclosures and restrictions on the compensation of executives of institutions that take part in the Treasury program.Under pressure to tighten the plan even more, Congressional and administration negotiators decided to parcel out the $700 billion in installments, starting with a first tranche of $350 billion. And during a weekend of negotiations, they added as a final backstop a requirement that in five years the president must present Congress with a plan to make up any losses of tax funds by looking to the financial community to make up the difference.'"
"'08-10-02,'0','National City, the troubled regional bank, jumped more than 60 percent on speculation that it could be acquired, leading the gains in the financial sector. Other regional banks, including KeyCorp and Fifth Third Bancorp, rose about 15 percent.The Dow Jones industrials, which fell nearly 200 points after the opening bell, gained back most of that in the afternoon and ended down 20 points at 10,831.07. A broader measure of the market, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, lost 0.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.1 percent.After two days of wild swings — including the worst single-day loss in two decades — anxiety still lingered among investors who are worried about credit problems and the fate of the bailout package.Shares of General Electric lost a dollar to close at $24.50, down nearly 4 percent, even after the investor Warren E. Buffett said he would take a $3 billion stake in the company.The Dow fell more than 100 points earlier in the day after a report showed serious problems facing American manufacturers. The manufacturing index of the Institute for Supply Management, a private group, unexpectedly plunged in September to 43.5 from 49.9 in August, on a scale where readings below 50 indicate a contraction of activity. It was the lowest reading since 2001, and economists had expected the index to only fall slightly.Foreign orders for manufacturing goods dropped sharply, as well, a troubling sign for an industry that has been increasingly dependent on exports to make up for slackening domestic demand. “There is no silver lining to this cloud,” Joshua Shapiro, chief domestic economist at the research firm MFR, wrote in a note.Oil prices fell $2.11 to $98.53 a barrel, after falling as low as $96 overnight. A government report showed an increase in gasoline supplies and a larger-than-expected jump in oil stockpiles.Stock markets in Asia rose early Wednesday morning in anticipation of Senate passage of the legislation, only to fall soon after the Senate had finished voting in what market analysts described as a classic case of investors buying on the expectation of good news and then selling on confirmation of the news.Many investors in Asia are uncertain about whether the final details of the legislation will be enough to help American financial institutions with their heavy losses or to prevent the United States economy from slowing significantly, said Thomas Lam, the senior treasury economist at the United Overseas Bank in Singapore. ""The situation in the U.S. is still pretty hairy,"" he said.By mid-morning on Wednesday, the Hang Seng Index was down 2 percent in Hong Kong, the Nikkei 225 had fallen 1.1 percent in Tokyo, the Kospi Index had dropped 0.7 percent in Seoul and the Standard and Poor’s/Australian Stock Exchange 200 Index had dipped 0.5 percent.Following are the results of Wednesday’s auction of 42-day cash management bills:'"

As a price for their affluence, most people there accept restrictions on civil liberties and free speech.

Hundreds of performances and four continents later, the troupe’s efforts travel from stage to screen in a concert film-documentary produced and directed by Andrea Kalin.The title doesn’t lie. These guys know how to tell a joke, often at the expense of their customs, religious holidays, families and themselves. Employing a rare G-rated approach — quite a few bored-looking kids populate the audience — Mohammed Amer, a Kuwait-born Palestinian-American; Azhar Usman, a Chicagoan of Indian parentage; and Preacher Moss, an African-American Muslim convert, each gets his 20-plus minutes in the spotlight (mostly shot last year on a Los Angeles stage).The remainder of the film finds the comics spending time with family and in front of their computer screens as they prepare fresh material on cultural stereotyping, terrorism, flying post-9/11 and other tricky subjects not regularly regarded as funny business. As with all comedy, individual taste will determine one’s own laugh track.Directed by Andrea Kalin; written by Mohammed (Mo) Amer, Bryant (Preacher) Moss and Azhar Usman; directors of photography, John Rhode and Bryan Sarkinen; edited by David Grossbach; production designer, Jennifer Spence; produced by Ms. Kalin, Mr. Moss and Mr. Usman; released by Truly Indie.

Prices declined 1.8 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, after rising 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said. That is the first drop since the three months ended March 31, 2004, when prices retreated 0.4 percent, according to the agency.

"'08-10-03,'0','The next day, Crusader was euthanized, but delivery of specimens to a state lab in New Jersey was delayed, so its illness was not diagnosed as rabies until June 18. That was a week after the other pets, which may have been exposed to the rabid dog, had been sent to their adoptive homes across the country.All pets imported to the United States are supposed to be vaccinated for rabies 30 days before they arrive, according to Dr. Nina Marano, a C.D.C. veterinarian.The dogs and cats in this shipment got rabies shots only a few days before the flight, however, and as a condition of shipment, prospective owners had to sign agreements to keep them at home for a month to prevent the potential spread of undetected disease, Dr. Marano said.Once Crusader’s illness was diagnosed, C.D.C. officials grew concerned about the possible exposure of anyone who came into contact with the other dogs, including people who attended events welcoming the pets.Rabies is almost always fatal, and is transmitted by saliva. A spokeswoman at the C.D.C. said there were one to three cases of human rabies in the United States each year, generally from exposure to bats; about 45,000 people a year get preventive treatment. Dog-to-dog transmission of rabies has been eradicated in the United States, the C.D.C. said, although there are occasional cases of transmission from wildlife to dogs; the number of rabid dogs here declined to 79 in 2006 from about 5,000 in 1950.Rabies is still common in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and parts of Latin America, killing about 55,000 people a year, most infected from dog bites.“Travelers should be aware of the risk of rabies exposure when traveling to countries where rabies is common in dogs and should not import animals to the United States without properly vaccinating them against rabies and adhering to animal importation laws,” the agency said.Federal and state authorities tracked down the 23 Iraqi dogs and the cat that had been dispersed around the country. They were vaccinated and are now being held for six months in quarantine, where they are being monitored for signs of rabies, the report said. So far none have become sick. Thirteen people have also been advised to get preventive treatment for rabies.C.D.C. reports generally keep identities confidential, and the report did not name the soldier or Crusader’s destination.Dr. Marano said that a new shipment of dogs from Baghdad was expected to arrive this week at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, and that the S.P.C.A. had been required to present proof of 30-day-old vaccinations before the dogs board.'"
"'08-10-03,'0','LONDON — In September 2007, consumers stood in line to withdraw their money from the troubled British lender Northern Rock.A year later, they were standing in line again, this time to put money back into the bank.Confidence in Britain’s banks has become so fragile that Northern Rock, which was nationalized after it collapsed, is now perceived to be the safest place for savings because its deposits are guaranteed by the government. But Northern Rock said Thursday that the increased demand for its products had forced it to stop offering most of them to new customers in order to continue to comply with competition rules.“Recent turbulence in financial markets has led to a sizable inflow of retail deposits, particularly in recent days, and Northern Rock is therefore taking further action to moderate its product range and product pricing, to uphold its competitive commitments,” the bank said in a statement.The step, which is to ensure that Northern Rock’s deposits do not exceed 1.5 percent of Britain’s retail savings market, showed how worried consumers are about further bank collapses and the safety of their savings even as the government pledged to increase the deposit guarantee later this year to £50,000 ($89,000), from £35,000, which would cover all but 2 percent of savings accounts.Some analysts argued that government guarantees gave financial institutions an unfair advantage at a time when banks were more dependent on retail deposits. A government-backed bank may also be able to get cheaper financing.'"
"'08-10-03,'0','Mr. White expressed relief that the Intrepid’s return was not foiled by the elements again. In November 2006, several of the most powerful tugboats on the Eastern seaboard struggled mightily to budge the Intrepid, but they could not dislodge its four giant propellers from the muddy river bottom.After another round of dredging by the United States Navy, the Intrepid, which does not have a working engine, was towed away a month later. At a dry dock in Bayonne, N.J., the troublesome propellers, which weighed 20 tons each, were removed and the ship was patched up and repainted.A few months later, it was towed to the Homeport, a city-owned port on Staten Island, where a thorough redesign of its exhibit spaces was begun and its collection of helicopters and fighter planes was touched up and expanded. About two dozen aircraft, some repainted to look as they did when they flew combat missions in World War II, Vietnam and other conflicts, were tied to the steel flight deck as the ship floated across the harbor and up the river.The overhaul of the ship, combined with the reconstruction of Pier 86, will cost more than $100 million, most of it paid for by government grants and the rest from private donations. The museum is scheduled to reopen on Nov. 8, with a grand opening celebration to follow on Veterans Day, Nov. 11, Mr. White said.More than 200 former crew members boarded in Staten Island for one last ride. About 50 of them manned the rail as a lone tugboat pulled the ship past the Statue of Liberty. Alongside the former site of the World Trade Center, they unfurled a giant American flag that had hung on the west side of 1 Liberty Plaza after 9/11. They saluted as a pair of horn players from the New York Police Department band played taps.Throughout the voyage, they traded stories of war and times of peace.Joseph M. Cammarata, 86, recounted his adventures as a radioman on torpedo planes over the South Pacific during World War II. He monitored the radar to calibrate the right moment for the pilot to unload on a Japanese ship that had attacked the Intrepid near the Philippines.“We hit that sucker,” he said, still relishing the moment more than half a century later. But his plane took fire and had to ditch in the sea, leaving him and two crewmates to paddle toward the nearest island. They were picked up by a Filipino fisherman.“If the Japanese got us — pffft — they would have killed us,” said Mr. Cammarata, who lives in Rochester.Joseph D. Murphy, 85, grew up in Rockaway Beach, but traveled from his home in San Ramon, Calif., to relive his exploits operating a 40-millimeter quad gun high above the flight deck. He vividly recalled the day in November 1944 when two Japanese kamikaze pilots crashed near where he was standing on Thursday morning. “Right about here,” he said pointing a few feet to his left, then pausing to think about the men who died in that attack.“I’m delighted to be back,” he said. “It’s a real honor to be here.”Standing beside the ship after it docked, Charles de Gunzburg, co-chairman of the museum’s board of trustees, said that the trustees and staff of the Intrepid shared Mr. Murphy’s sentiments.'"

"'08-10-03,'0','The McCain campaign’s withdrawal will free the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama, to redirect some of his resources from Michigan to several states that President Bush won in 2004 but where recent polls show Mr. Obama gaining ground, including Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia.The McCain campaign still projected optimism in a conference call with reporters, as senior campaign officials argued that they were confident that the electoral map presented them with numerous paths to victory in November.Mike DuHaime, the McCain campaign’s political director, said the campaign would send some of its Michigan workers and resources to other states that voted for Democrats in 2004 but that they hope to win in November.He mentioned Pennsylvania, a state rich in electoral votes where Mr. Obama fared poorly in the Democratic primary; Wisconsin, which the Democrats have won narrowly in the last two presidential elections; and Maine, which divides its electoral votes.And although the McCain campaign’s decision to accept public financing means that it faces spending limits that the Obama campaign does not face, there were indications that the campaign continues to be in strong shape on the money front. The campaign announced that the Republican National Committee, which can augment the $84 million in public money that the campaign had to spend on itself, raised nearly $66 million in September — well above what Republicans had initially said they hoped to raise.Greg Strimple, a senior McCain campaign adviser, held open the possibility that the R.N.C. might continue to run some advertisements in Michigan to keep the state in play. “If we see a swing back in our favor, we will re-engage,” he said in the conference call.The McCain campaign made the announcement as Mr. Obama campaigned in Michigan.The Obama campaign reacted cautiously. “We’ll believe it when we see it,” said David Plouffe, Mr. Obama’s campaign manager, who noted that the McCain campaign could still return to the state, or that independent expenditure groups might step in to try to fill the vacuum. “We’re not going to take their word for it. We’re going to fight for every vote.”But Mr. Plouffe said that if the McCain campaign really does withdraw from the state, it will make it more important for Mr. McCain to win all the states that President Bush carried in 2004, including some where they have seen an erosion of support in some recent polls. “It just makes their path more narrow,” he said.Mr. McCain’s struggles in Michigan were clear at the campaign stop at a factory in Belleville in July, where he found himself peppered with questions about his support for free trade by workers who believe it has cost the state jobs.His campaign officials made it clear that they intend to open an aggressive new campaign highlighting what they described as Mr. Obama’s liberal record.Here in Denver, Mr. McCain was asked at a town-hall-style meeting when he intended to take the gloves off. “How about Tuesday night?” Mr. McCain responded, in a nod to his next scheduled debate with Mr. Obama.'"
"'08-10-03,'0','Dance Theater Workshop is associated with experimental, challenging work. Lar Lubovitch is known for making pretty, romantic dances. One is insular, the other popular: opposite spectrums of the contemporary dance world.Until Wednesday, that is, when the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company opened a four-day run at the workshop. Featured are three dances made between 1976 and 1980, noteworthy for being among the first choreographed to Minimalist composers.The theater is presenting them through a new initiative dedicated to revisiting contemporary works. The Lubovitch company, meanwhile, is a beneficiary of an American Masterpieces reconstruction grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Suddenly, Mr. Lubovitch and the workshop have lots in common.Nowadays it sometimes feels as if every third dance is choreographed to works by Steve Reich or Philip Glass. In 1976, when “Marimba” had its premiere, Mr. Reich’s “Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ” must have seemed an exotic, kinetic landscape. Mr. Lubovitch tends to turn out safe, rather unexciting dances, but “Marimba” has the invigorating air that often accompanies exploration, from the opening moments when the dancers run in slow motion on a diagonal across the stage in a visual representation of aural accumulation.The performers have an inward focus as they execute the simple, physical phrases Mr. Lubovitch sets to the music’s hypnotic waves. There is nothing presentational here, only the concentration of people dedicated to a common goal and pushed to great exertion. (Speaking of which, a little more rehearsal time might not have been amiss for some of these dancers.)In the 1978 dance “North Star,” named for its Glass score, you can see Mr. Lubovitch creating with more of an eye toward pleasing a crowd. Again come the clusters of bodies radiating out, then collapsing. But the movement is more balletic, less utilitarian. There is not quite the same sense of trance, but still a strong focus on communal effort among the dancers, a mix of company members and graduating students from the Juilliard School. Human ropes form, with dancers locked into shared rhythmic pulses.These pulses have their most playful incarnation in “Cavalcade,” a 1980 work to Mr. Reich’s “Octet.” Units of dancers are juxtaposed against one another, allowing Mr. Lubovitch to highlight different aspects of the music. A line of thin streamers billows in the background, and the piece concludes with a Chinese ribbon dance.'"
"'08-10-03,'0','The audience estimates for Fox Business have remained closely guarded for the last year because, with only a few exceptions, they have not met the minimum threshold set by the television ratings service Nielsen. Before 1 p.m. on Monday, the network’s ratings were below Nielsen’s minimums. On Tuesday, the network failed to meet the minimum threshold during any hour, suggesting that the ratings the previous day were not indicative of a growth trend.About 6,300 people on average were watching Fox Business on any given weekday during its first two months, according to early estimates compiled by Nielsen. By contrast, CNBC attracted about 283,000 viewers during that period. The ratings are significant because they are used to set advertising rates.Nielsen has measured the viewership of Fox Business, at its request, since its premiere, but Nielsen was not permitted to release or even confirm those figures because they fell below its minimum standards for reporting, said Gary Holmes, a Nielsen spokesman.This summer, for the first time, Nielsen began including audience estimates for Fox Business in a service called Nielsen MarketBreaks, which is available by subscription to networks and advertisers. There, too, the network was often shown to be drawing only a few thousand viewers an hour, if that. And there again, the figures, which were extrapolated from a sampling of Nielsen households, were so low that Nielsen considered them unreliable — and thus, would not be confirmed to nonsubscribers.As recently as a few weeks ago, there was anecdotal evidence, at least, that the Fox Business audience had not grown appreciably since its debut. A network spokeswoman said by e-mail only that the network was not publicly rated.Fox Business perceived that it had an advantage versus CNBC last weekend when its competitor showed its usual diet of infomercials and documentaries. Kevin Magee, an executive vice president at Fox Business, told The Hollywood Reporter that the weekend coverage “could well be the defining moment” for the network.In print and television advertisements, Fox Business promoted its live weekend coverage and criticized CNBC for taking the weekend off, claiming, “We own this story.”Brian Steel, a CNBC spokesman, said, “We find it amusing that Fox Business says that they ‘own the story.’ Clearly the viewers think differently.”'"
"'08-10-03,'0','The vertiginous speed of the bill’s progress — from 3 pages to 450 in the blink of an eye — makes one suspect that not every aspect of the bill and its potential repercussions has been gone over with a fine-toothed comb: one wonders, in fact, how many of our representatives can even have read it through once in that amount of time.Strangely, the added provisions that have given the bill new life in the Senate seem either unconnected to the matter at hand (the admirable but irrelevant rider on mental health care) or potentially an even greater burden on the nation’s economic health (tax breaks that are not offset in any way).One thing this crisis should have taught us is that markets rise and fall at the drop of a hat — but Congress must not react to those fluctuations with the same kind of volatility.We need our leaders to take a steadier, more measured approach and formulate a responsible plan that takes into account the root causes of the disaster and every aspect of its fallout. Otherwise, in place of the silk purse they were hoping for, they will only be putting lipstick on a pig. Louise T. GuintherDavid Leonhardt’s primer on economic and monetary policy is well taken (“Lesson From a Credit Crisis: When Trust Vanishes, Worry,” Economic Scene, front page, Oct. 1), but seems directed at a populace that does not understand its own best interests. Why not identify what the public got right? There are important lessons there, too.When bad judgment causes a national crisis, policies should change, the costs should be shared, and heads should roll. But Congress’s remedy for the economic crisis is to bail out business as usual.The voters who are calling their representatives in overwhelming numbers against the $700 billion plan see the asymmetry of this response and smell a rat. They are right to hold out for credible and fair rescue legislation.One thing has been widely overlooked in the discussion of the pending rescue package. If it is again defeated, and the economy and the stock market crash, Treasury tax revenues will also tumble. That would likely cost the Treasury more than $700 billion in lost revenues. On the other hand, if the package passes, the Treasury stands a good chance to recoup at least a part of the expenditure.Nicholas D. Kristof (“Save the Fat Cats,” column, Oct. 2) is quite right that based on the dire experience of Japan, the result of inaction will be a sharp long-term decline in employment and incomes. Add to that a steep falloff in Treasury tax revenues.The writer is a former chief economist of the New York Stock Exchange and a professor of economics at Pace University.Nicholas D. Kristof is among the few who have even mentioned what is probably the most important bailout issue: how do we ensure that this doesn’t happen again? If the perpetrators escape now with their fortunes intact, the chance of Congress’s enacting “tough measures” next year is probably nil.No wonder the Bush administration tried to rush this Band-Aid through.When Thomas L. Friedman states, “It’s all about confidence” (“Rescue the Rescue,” column, Oct. 1), he nails the problem on the head. But the confidence problem is bigger than the credit crisis.The public is right to be skeptical of a president who lied us into a trillion-dollar war, to be skeptical of a Congress with an approval rating heading toward a single digit, and to be skeptical of a Treasury secretary who initially demanded total discretionary power to deal with the crisis.The case to the public needs to be made more clearly. The program needs to be better explained. The government needs to build public confidence in its solution. Clearly, it doesn’t have it now.Thomas L. Friedman’s column is right on the money, but it does reflect a sad situation that we have gotten into over the years. We have become so dependent on credit that we can’t function without paying the banks ransom for more credit. All the banks have to do is hold up credit for some time, and the economy comes crashing down!For long-term survival, perhaps a credit crunch is good for us; we may learn that we have to save for things.I’d like to speak out for those of us who have managed our money sensibly.Perhaps you know us? We live within our means. When renting makes sense, we rent. We buy homes we can afford, with real down payments and mortgages we can comprehend and predict. We save our money. We invest what we can, in ways we understand.We pay off credit card balances. We never take out a loan we can’t repay. We don’t assume that our paycheck will grow. We know the difference between a luxury and a necessity. We see our culture’s materialism as a seductive distraction, an invitation to waste and an expensive folly.And now we have lost a lot of money through no fault of our own. And for years to come, we will be paying for problems caused by others. There are many of us. And we are angry.'"
"'08-10-03,'0','While consumers welcome the decline, which will reduce the nation’s $1.3 billion daily oil import bill, oil producers are wary. said it might have to cut its budget next year as petroleum revenue dropped. Countries like and , which have been riding a wave of energy-fueled nationalism, could be forced to scale back their ambitions and energy projects that require enormous financing could be delayed.These difficulties could prompt the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to step in forcefully to stem the slide in prices, analysts said. , the oil cartel’s most powerful member, has signaled it wants to see oil fall below $100 to bolster the world economy, but it is unclear how low the Saudis and other producers will let prices fall.Whatever tries to do, a growing number of experts say that a combination of weaker global growth and slumping demand is likely to keep pushing oil prices down in coming months.“The fall in oil prices is equivalent to a new for consumers,” said Lawrence J. Goldstein, an energy analyst at the Energy Policy Research Foundation. He calculated that each drop of $10 a barrel in the price of oil lowered the nation’s annual bill by about $70 billion. That is $230 for every American.Gasoline now sells at $3.60 a gallon on average nationwide, according to AAA, down from its record of $4.11 a gallon in July, although prices are higher in some states because of lingering problems from . Experts say that if oil prices stayed from $75 to $100 a barrel for a while, that would likely push gasoline under $3.50 a gallon.A result of record energy costs is that Americans have drastically cut back on their driving this year, reducing their gasoline usage at the fastest pace since 1983.As prices peaked, oil consumption fell by 6 percent in July to its lowest level in five years, while the number of miles driven dropped the most since 1979, according the latest statistics from the Federal Highway Administration. For industrialized countries, which account for about 60 percent of global oil demand, consumption could fall by 1.3 million barrels a day this year, the steepest decline since 1982, according to analysts at Bernstein Research. That would more than offset the growth in consumption from developing nations like , the analysts said.“A study of the 1980s reaffirms our pessimism about oil demand in 2008 and 2009,” the Bernstein analysts said in a recent research note. “Recent data suggests we may finally be reaching the point of negative demand.”Many analysts agree. said on Thursday that oil prices could fall as low as $50 a barrel in a global recession. Lawrence Eagles, an oil analyst for , said: “This is the weakest fundamental situation we’ve had since 2002.”Oil prices are still high by historical standards. Many businesses had not managed to raise their prices enough to compensate for this summer’s oil spike to more than $145 a barrel, and they say the high prices are still causing problems.“We get excited when prices break below $100 a barrel, but we are still in a high feedstock and hydrocarbon environment,” said Rich Wells, the vice president for energy at .Automakers have appealed for government aid as consumers shun their gas guzzlers, a problem worsened lately by a credit squeeze for potential car buyers. The said this week that its sales had dropped 34 percent in September. Automakers like and , also reported sharp sales declines.Oil costs are a big reason the global airline industry has lost money in all but one year since 2000. Fuel costs amounted to 14 percent of airlines’ expenses in 2000 but are forecast to reach 40 percent next year, the International Air Transport Association says.“Our industry is like Sisyphus,” Giovanni Bisignani, IATA’s chairman, told an industry conference in this summer. “After a long uphill journey, a giant boulder of bad news is driving us back down.”A sustained drop in oil prices could lead to a new wave of mergers in the energy industry. Given the sharp increase in prices in recent years for everything from drill rigs to steel pipes, costs in the industry have risen sharply. The cost of adding production is now $70 to $90 a barrel, according to JPMorgan and other analysts.Any drop below that range may curb investment in new oil supplies. Already, some producers are feeling the pinch. , for example, signaled recently that the cost of developing oil sands in would not be economical below $100 a barrel.“Prices are still searching for true value and no one is quite sure what that is,” said Tom Bentz, an energy analyst at in New York. “A lot will depend on how the global economic picture will shape up. We still have a world that is a scary place to live in.”'"
"'08-10-03,'0','PARIS — Microsoft said Thursday that it would set up research centers in Britain, France and Germany to improve its Internet search technology, describing the move as a vote of confidence in the European economy and in the company’s ability to close the gap with Google.The chief executive, Steven A.

"'08-10-03,'0','“This package is just a very costly Band-Aid for big banks that will do very little to help patients who need major surgery,” Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, said in his speech on the Senate floor.“Had Congress been able to use the regular committee process to craft a bipartisan and comprehensive legislation, the resulting bill may have gained my support,” Mr. Enzi said. “Unfortunately, Congress has been pressured into passing this bill in two weeks by Treasury and Wall Street. A rescue plan of this scale requires a clear plan of action with a substantial chance of success. This plan has neither.”Some of the harshest criticism was leveled by Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Senate banking committee, who normally would have been his party’s lead negotiator on the bailout bill but removed himself because he opposed the administration’s proposal at its very core.“The choice we faced was between pursuing an informed response or panic,” Mr. Shelby said. “Unfortunately, we chose panic and are now about to spend $700 billion on something we have not examined closely. Yes, in the end, we will have ‘done something.’ At the same time, however, we will have done nothing to determine whether it will accomplish anything at all.”Mr. Shelby, in his speech, laid out a modern history of the American housing, mortgage and securitization markets, explaining how a bubble in home values was fueled by loose lending standards, exotic mortgage products and complex financial instruments, pushed by financial firms that were leveraged heavily to maximize profits.And in many ways, he was already dishing out “I told you sos.”“We did not get to where we are today by accident, it was a path we chose,” he said. “My warnings about the risk of basing credit decisions on well-intended social mandates rather than sound, fact-based underwriting were dismissed. My concerns about the inadequacy of the regulatory structure put in place in the financial modernization legislation went unacknowledged. My efforts to ensure that bank capital standards were designed to ensure safety and soundness, rather than industry concerns, were conducted largely alone.”Mr. Sanders, the Vermont independent, complained that the bill did not put any limits on the types of distressed debt the Treasury could buy, that it did not provide enough oversight, that it did not include adequate provisions to limit home foreclosures, that it did not really limit executive pay at firms that seek help.“Under this bill, the C.E.O.’s and the Wall Street insiders will still, with a little bit of imagination, continue to make out like bandits,” Mr. Sanders said.He said the bill also did not do anything to prevent financial institutions from becoming “too big to fail,” effectively leaving open the potential need for future bailouts.Mr. Sanders also said he could not fathom giving Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. such broad authority over so much money.“Maybe I am the only person in America who thinks so, but I have a hard time understanding why we are giving $700 billion to the secretary of the Treasury, who is the former C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, which, along with other financial institutions, actually got us into this problem,” he said. “Maybe I am the only person in America who thinks that is a little bit weird, but that is what I think.”He added: “This bill does not address the major economic crises we face — growing unemployment, low wages and the need to create decent-paying jobs, rebuilding our infrastructure and moving us to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.”In one of the more remarkable colloquies of the day’s discourse, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, and one of the most conservative members of Congress, took to the floor to express solidarity with Mr. Sanders.“I would like to say to Senator Sanders a couple things,” Mr. Sessions said. “First, I think it is indeed breathtaking that this Senate would authorize basically one person with very little real oversight, a Wall Street maven himself, and allocate $700 billion in America’s wealth, which I would have to say would be the largest single authorization of expenditure in the history of the Republic.”Mr. Sessions added: “So I have to say, fundamentally, I think we have not done a good enough job in creating an oversight mechanism that will work, so I am not going to vote for the bill; I am not.”Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said he opposed the bill because it did not do enough to help average Americans.“This bill sends a message to Wall Street that if they play fast and loose in the name of short-term profits, the government will actually make up for their losses,” Mr. Nelson said. “And the bill does very little to help individual homeowners. Until we stabilize the housing market, which is the underlying ability to restructure the economy from this crisis — until we stabilize the housing market, and until we stem the record number of foreclosures, our market simply is not going to improve.”Mr. Nelson continued: “The bottom line is, ultimately, this bill forces taxpayers to bail out investment banks that caused the crisis in the first place, and it does nothing to address the real problem, which is home foreclosures.”'"
"'08-10-03,'0','The General Electric Company raised $12.2 billion by selling 547.8 million shares for 9.2 percent less than Wednesday’s closing price, giving it more cash to finance operations.The shares were priced at $22.25 each, G.E. said Thursday. G.E.’s stock fell $2.35, or 10 percent, to $22.15 a share Thursday and was the most actively traded stock in United States markets.The discount, coming from an AAA-rated company that has remained profitable through the market crisis, shows how much G.E. wanted to bring in cash and reassure investors, analysts said. The offer price is about where G.E.’s stock traded in February 2003.“As a bond analyst, we approve of G.E.’s move to raise new capital in order to reassure fixed-income investors at a time of unparalleled stress in the credit markets,” wrote Kathleen Shanley, an analyst at Gimme Credit in Chicago. “But it is not entirely reassuring that G.E. felt pressured to offer terms that will dilute existing shareholders.”Combined with $3 billion in preferred shares from Berkshire Hathaway, the company controlled by Warren E. Buffett, in a separate deal announced Wednesday, G.E. raised $15.2 billion. The total may reach $17 billion if an overallotment of shares is exercised by the offering’s lead underwriter, Goldman Sachs, Gary Sheffer, a spokesman for G.E., said.The offering and the preferred sale to Berkshire are “at the high end of expectations, and we are pleased with the results,” Mr. Sheffer said.'"
"'08-10-03,'0','Mr. Trichet’s hints did little to ease pressures in credit markets, where the main gauges of confidence among banks edged up again Thursday. And the euro fell to a 13-month low against the dollar as the prospect of lower interest rates diminished the allure of euro-denominated assets. It bought $1.38 in late European trading, down from $1.40 on Wednesday, and $1.3824 in New York in late trading.The European bank’s decision came two days before Mr. Trichet and top European leaders were scheduled to convene in Paris at the invitation of the French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, to adopt common approaches to the financial crisis.Though French and Dutch officials have suggested responses along the lines of the $700 billion bailout proposed in the United States, Mr. Sarkozy and Britain’s prime minister, Gordon Brown, ruled out that idea Thursday.Referring to the immense infusions of cash that central banks have repeatedly made into the financial system and with the House of Representatives expected to reconsider a bailout package in the United States on Friday, Mr. Trichet called on political leaders to do their part as well.“We do all we can,” he said. “But there are cases where we need decisions by governments.”The E.C.B. said its decision to keep rates unchanged was made in the light of an annual inflation rate that, at 3.6 percent, is running far above the bank’s goal of less than 2 percent. But Mr. Trichet underscored the “extraordinarily high level of uncertainty,” suggesting that repeated bank failures in Europe had eased the way for the shift in the E.C.B.’s attitude.“Suddenly, Europeans were thrust into the center of the furnace and had to take actions to prevent the European financial system from collapsing,” said Julian Callow, chief Europe economist at Barclays Capital in London. “That surely would have affected their thinking.”The bank’s shift is positive for those who think that lower interest rates globally would reduce the effect of the financial crisis and contribute to business confidence.The Fed is scheduled to meet on Oct. 27, a short time before the E.C.B.’s next meeting in early November, and many analysts say they think they both may move to cut rates. The Bank of England will meet next week, when a rate cut is also possible.Mr. Trichet also stressed that the bank could act at any time, suggesting the top central banks could move in unison independent of any meeting.The E.C.B.’s new willingness to consider lower interest rates opens the bank to criticism that it misjudged how weak the economy of the 15-nation euro area had become by midsummer and was acting erratically.The E.C.B. actually raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in July to head off rising expectations of higher inflation.Paul de Grauwe, a professor at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, said the E.C.B.’s reluctance to ease credit even as the euro zone economy contracted in the summer showed a lack of the kind of flexibility that led the Federal Reserve to cut United States rates aggressively. “They are risking being well behind the curve here,” he said.“Holding rates will lead to a situation in Europe where we are always in the defensive pose as opposed to an offensive approach,” he added. “It is very different from the United States.”'"
"'08-10-03,'0','The Dow Jones industrial average dropped at the opening bell and never looked back. A burst of selling in the last hour sent the index to a loss of 348.22 points, or 3.2 percent, ending the day at 10,482.85. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fared worse, dropping more than 4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 4.5 percent.Stocks are nearly back to where they were on Monday, when the Dow plummeted 777 points after the House of Representatives rejected a version of the bailout plan for the financial industry. The Senate passed a revised bill Wednesday. Many investors hoped the House would approve the plan when it votes again Friday, but uncertainty about the outcome had them unnerved. And many have already begun looking beyond the vote and back at the grim fundamentals of the broader economy.“This was a wait-and-see day,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s, referring to the apprehension among investors at the outcome of the vote in the House on Friday.“But while we were waiting, we were thumbing through the economic reports, and they weren’t good.”New applications for unemployment benefits rose last week to a seven-year high, according to the Labor Department. Although the rise was partly attributable to the hurricanes that hit Texas last month, investors worried that an important gauge of unemployment due for release Friday would show the economy bled an additional 100,000 jobs in September.A separate report said that orders for goods made at American factories in August slumped by 4 percent, the largest monthly decline in nearly two years, a problem exacerbated by strains on credit.Treasury yields dropped again as investors sought safety in the government notes. A key three-month borrowing rate for banks, known as Libor, continued to rise. In a sign of severe stress, yields on junk bonds jumped to 17.72 percent, up from 16.69 percent on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. And several companies reported problems finding buyers for their corporate debt, a critical source of financing that helps businesses stay afloat on a day-to-day basis.The Federal Reserve has stepped up its lending to financial firms in the last week in response to the credit crisis. Banks and securities firms had borrowed up to $348.2 billion from the central bank as of Wednesday, up from $217.8 billion a week earlier. But that has not greased the wheels of lending.“Banks as well as individuals just seem to be hoarding their cash at this point,” Mr. Stovall said.A top executive at Marriott, the hotel chain, said the company was forced to borrow $900 million from its credit lines in the face of a weak commercial paper market.Insurance companies had a particularly difficult day, which some analysts attributed to comments from Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, who warned at a press conference that a large insurer could be facing financial problems. A spokesman for the senator later said that Mr. Reid had been referring to the insurance industry as a whole and not a single company.Still, shares of The Hartford fell 32 percent, and shares of Principal Financial and MetLife each declined about 15 percent.Oil prices declined for a second day, falling $4.56 to $93.97 a barrel.European stocks, which had been in positive territory before trading opened in New York, gave up those gains and ended the day lower. The FTSE-100 index in London closed down 1.8 percent, and stocks in Frankfurt and Paris dropped more than 2 percent.The European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.25 percent, and the euro fell again against the dollar.The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill rose 29/32, to 103 2/32, and the yield, which moves opposite the price, was at 3.63 percent, down from 3.73 percent late Wednesday.Following are the results of Thursday’s Treasury auction of 56-day cash management bills:'"
"'08-10-03,'0','HONG KONG — Stock markets in Asia rose early Wednesday morning in anticipation of Senate passage of the $700 billion economic bailout legislation in Washington, only to fall soon after the Senate had endorsed the plan.Money managers and market analysts described the drop as a classic case of investors buying on the expectation of good news and then selling on confirmation of the news.The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, the Nikkei 225 Index in Tokyo and the Kospi Index in Seoul had each fallen about 1 percent by late morning.The Straits Times Index had declined 0.9 percent in Singapore and the Standard and Poor’s/Australian Stock Exchange 200 Index had dipped 0.5 percent in Sydney.Many traders and money managers are more concerned about House passage of the legislation than they were about Senate passage, given that the House voted down a similar bill on Monday, said Henry Lee, the managing director of the Hendale Group, a Hong Kong-based investment advisory firm. The House is expected to vote again on the bill by Friday.He also questioned the effectiveness of the rescue plan in restoring confidence given continued weakness in the American housing market.“It’s a short-term Band-Aid, it doesn’t solve the root of the issue,” Mr. Lee said.Investors in Asia are uncertain about whether the final details of the legislation will be enough to help American financial institutions with their heavy losses, or to prevent the United States economy from slowing significantly, said Thomas Lam, the senior treasury economist at the United Overseas Bank in Singapore.'"

"'08-10-04,'0','“What powers the vice president has today really come from the president,” said Timothy Walch, editor of “At the President’s Side: The Vice Presidency in the Twentieth Century.” “If what she is calling out for is to formally acquire additional power, authority or a leadership role, that is unprecedented and would most likely require some kind of constitutional amendment, or a sense of the Senate resolution at the very least.”Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. also made statements about the vice presidency that have drawn notice in the wake of the debate. He incorrectly stated, for instance, that Article I of the Constitution governs the vice president’s executive branch functions — actually Article I deals with the legislative branch — and he restricted those duties to breaking a tie vote in the Senate, not mentioning the constitutional mandate that the vice president “shall be President of the Senate.”But it was Ms. Palin’s comments that are being most heavily dissected, partly as a result of the outsize role that Vice President Dick Cheney has played over the last eight years, with responsibility for large swaths of policy.A spokeswoman for Ms. Palin said Friday that the governor had meant only that she would work with the president to shape her role.“The Constitution allows the president to determine the role his or her vice president shall play in his or her administration,” said the spokeswoman, Tracey Schmitt. “Every vice president since Walter Mondale has had additional responsibilities determined by the president. As vice president, Governor Palin would look forward to fulfilling such duties.” LARRY ROHTERThe back-and-forth over taxes between Ms. Palin and Mr. Biden was replete with misleading and inaccurate assertions from both sides. Certainly typical voters could be excused for feeling perplexed about how their bottom lines would be affected by the respective tax plans of Senators John McCain and Barack Obama.The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center completed an updated analysis this month with examples of how a variety of taxpayers would fare under each candidate’s plan. In general, Mr. Obama’s plan would cut taxes the most for those at the bottom of the income scale and reduce them as well for those in the middle, but raise them significantly for those at the very top.While Mr. Obama would make permanent certain parts of the Bush tax cuts that are set to expire in 2011, individuals earning $200,000 or more a year and families earning more than $250,000 — about 2 percent of the population — would see their tax bills rise.Mr. McCain’s proposal is simpler. Trying to spur economic growth, it cuts taxes across the board, for corporations as well as individuals, but provides relatively little relief for people at the bottom, more moderate benefits for those in the middle than Mr. Obama’s proposal, and large breaks for those at the top.As for the cost, fiscal monitors have raised questions about the impact of both plans on the budget deficit, with Mr. McCain’s appearing to add the most to the national debt.Calculations of given taxpayers’ bottom lines will vary, of course, depending on their distinct circumstances. And those calculations will change over time as additional provisions of the plans take effect in outlying years.But the Tax Policy Center calculated that in 2009, under Mr. Obama’s plan, a typical two-income married couple who have two children and earn an adjusted gross income of $50,000 a year — meaning they are in the middle-income quintile — would get a tax cut of about $1,000. Under Mr. McCain’s plan, the cut would be $700.The difference is greater if the couple’s income is just $35,000. Under Mr. Obama’s plan they would get a tax cut of $1,400, under Mr. McCain’s less than $500.The contrast is even more striking in the upper reaches of income. A couple with two children and two incomes who earn $1.5 million would see a tax increase of more than $75,000 under Mr. Obama’s plan, but a cut of about $300 under Mr. McCain’s.Political debates are often about making digestible points with simple language, and that makes them a poor fit for examining inherently complicated issues. Global warming is a case in point.When Thursday night’s moderator, Gwen Ifill, turned to climate change, she alluded to conflicting campaign-trail statements each side had made about its own position and challenged the contenders to clarify their stances on “clean coal” and “capping” emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas scientists have linked to rising temperatures.Noting that Mr. McCain “has said he supports caps on carbon emissions,” Ms. Ifill asked Ms. Palin whether she took a similar position.“I do, I do,” Ms. Palin answered, although neither she nor Ms. Ifill specified a mandatory cap or a voluntary one.The difference between mandatory and voluntary is enormous in this context. Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden support mandatory caps on emissions. Mr. McCain’s climate plan, as presented on his Web site, also centers on a mandatory cap, but on the trail lately he has suggested that he would start out with only a voluntary one. Thursday night’s debate did not clarify the Republican ticket’s position in this regard.Ms. Ifill, still focused on climate, then pressed Mr. Biden to clarify whether he was for or against “clean coal,” alluding to a statement he made last month that he was against it.But the question, regardless of the answer, has little meaning in the context of current global warming policy.For decades, under ever tightening regulations, utilities have been scrubbing chemical pollutants like sulfur dioxide that are generated when coal is burned. Mr. Biden’s response — “My record for 25 years has supported clean coal technology” — was clearly a reference to that environmental cleanup. But those pollutants, and cleanup technologies, have nothing to do with global warming. Unlike sulfur, mercury and other trace contaminants in coal, carbon dioxide is a basic byproduct of combustion, generated in vast volumes by power plants. Systems for capturing, compressing and burying the gas have been tested at the scale of only about a million tons a year or so, even as billions of tons are flowing annually from coal-burning power plants now — with higher amounts projected for at least another couple of decades, driven mainly by rapid growth in electricity use in China and India.Energy specialists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and elsewhere have said that construction of a fleet of industrial-scale demonstration projects that might be able to capture and bury the climate-changing gas should be getting under way immediately if there is to be any chance, even by 2020 or so, of meaningfully curbing emissions.So “clean coal,” in the context of climate change, remains a pipe dream for now.

"'08-10-04,'0','Q. If taxpayers finance this recovery plan, will Social Security and Medicare be affected?A. There will be no effect on Social Security and Medicare, which are paid for through deductions from paychecks and contributions from employers. Yes, Social Security and Medicare face some problems that will have to be addressed sooner or later, but to avoid a headache, you should think of those issues apart from the current financial crisis. And tune out oversimplified, alarmist language.Q. But if the government spends hundreds of billions of dollars on a rescue plan, won’t there be a mountain of debt that will take years to pay off?A. There’s already a mountain. As for the current crisis, optimists have suggested that after the Treasury buys up those troubled mortgage-backed securities and resells them, it could actually wind up ahead.Previous “financial interventions,” as the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress calls them, have turned a profit. When the government helped Chrysler with $1.5 billion in loan guarantees in 1980, it made a profit of $311 million from the sale of warrants, or options to buy stock. On the other hand, the 1989 bailout of the savings and loan industry cost the Treasury $150 billion, according to the research service.The value of the mortgage-backed securities in the current crisis will not really be known until they are unraveled. As the research service says, surely without fear of contradiction, determining the cost of government intervention “is not straightforward.”Q. Despite all the talk about Wall Street greed and regulators who don’t regulate, aren’t the American people partly to blame for the current mess, considering that a lot of them took on debt they couldn’t pay back?A. Political oratory notwithstanding, there is no simple answer to this one. Most Americans still make their mortgage payments each month. And one person’s greed is another person’s aspiration. Yes, some people took on debt they ultimately could not handle, and there were some shady lenders and real estate speculators, but no two situations are alike.Being a homeowner is a big part of the American dream, and has long been encouraged by the government. Consider the mortgage-interest deduction, for instance. Q. Suppose the Treasury can’t sell all those mortgage-backed securities for anything close to what it paid for them. Couldn’t that put the government deeper in the hole, and shouldn’t that worry people?A. We’re back to that “mountain of debt.”The rescue plan calls for raising the national debt ceiling by $700 billion, to $11.3 trillion. But, again, it has never been clear that the full $700 billion will be spent. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the final cost could be “substantially less.”And all this talk about billions and trillions demands a little perspective. As of mid-August, the total outstanding debt of the United States government was just a bit more than $9.6 trillion, according to the budget office. But not quite $4.2 trillion of that is debt held by government trust fund accounts, the largest being those for Social Security and also including accounts for retirement benefits destined for military people and civil service employees. Economists, who supposedly understand this stuff, like to focus more on the publicly held debt that the United States owes to domestic and foreign lenders. That number, now just above $5.4 trillion, is about 38 percent of the country’s gross domestic product for 2008. Compare that to the historical high of 1946, when World War II had pushed the overall debt to 109 percent. Moreover, a lot of the debt is owed to Americans whose portfolios include Treasury securities.Q. But shouldn’t the people be worried that a huge bill will come due one day?A. Again, some perspective is called for. Consider this passage from an article in The Times: “When President Bush informed the nation last Sunday night that remaining in Iraq next year will cost another $87 billion, many of those who will actually pay that bill were unable to watch. They had already been put to bed by their parents.”That was written five years and several hundred billion dollars ago and is truer than ever. Also the United States still has a good credit history. Perfect, in fact. It has never defaulted.'"
"'08-10-04,'0','The tax treatment of the payments has drawn considerable interest from tax lawyers, who have written on this subject on various blogs, challenging the campaign’s interpretation of tax law.“What jumps out to me in these tax returns,” said Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed group, “is that the $17,000 in per diems is not there and it should have been.”The McCain campaign has been under pressure to release Ms. Palin’s tax returns after the Obama campaign released 10 years of returns for Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. In addition, Mr. Biden has been required routinely to file financial disclosure statements with the federal government because he is a sitting senator.The documents issued Friday are the first glimpse into Ms. Palin’s personal finances and consisted of the federal public financial disclosure report and two years of tax returns.The Palins reported taxable income in 2007 of $166,080, consisting largely of Ms. Palin’s salary as governor. The couple paid $24,738 in taxes on this income, at a tax rate of around 15 percent. But in 2006, the couple reported taxable income of $127,869, which consisted mainly of Mr. Palin’s income from BP Exploration Alaska and an income of less than $5,000 for Ms. Palin from the State of Alaska before she was elected governor.That year, the couple paid $11,944 in taxes, a tax rate of just under 10 percent.Yet for a couple with modest incomes, the Palins have amassed a sizable portfolio that consists mainly of retirement investments and real estate.The family home in Wasilla, which has been valued for tax purposes at $550,000, was listed on the federal financial disclosure form, which requires that all values be given in ranges, between $500,000 and $1 million.The remaining real estate, valued at between $150,000 and $365,000, consisted of a fishing leasehold on the Nushagak River and partial interest in two other parcels of land.The Palins kept their taxes low by putting all their investable assets into tax-deferred accounts, including 401(k)’s, I.R.A.’s and defined-contribution plans from Wasilla, the State of Alaska and BP Alaska.The disclosure form listed the portfolio’s value as from $300,000 to $850,000. The assets in these retirement accounts included a sophisticated range of investments, including mutual funds invested in Latin America, small-cap stocks, shares in Spanish, Belgian and Australian indexes and a midcap growth fund. Among the firms represented in the portfolio are Morgan Stanley, Putnam, T. Rowe Price and Alliance Bernstein, all well-known financial institutions.Mr. Palin’s commercial fishing business enabled the couple to deduct a small portion of their home’s expenses, and his snowmachine racing business was marginally profitable. In 2006, it had a taxable income of around $2,500. In 2007, when Mr. Palin had $17,000 in prize winnings, he claimed business expenses that resulted in a loss of $9,639.The Palins reported charitable deductions of $2,500 in 2007, and $4,250 in 2006. The only charity identified in the tax returns was the Salvation Army, which received a small amount of goods from the couple.The McCain campaign declined to identify the other charitable recipients, except to say that the money went to “churches in the local community,” according to Mr. Jones, the campaign spokesman. He declined to say whether the Wasilla Assembly of God, where Ms. Palin was a member until 2002 and is still identified on the church’s Web site as a “friend,” received a donation.'"
"'08-10-04,'0','The Treasury is expected to name a senior official to supervise the program. For now, various working groups creating the program are reporting directly to Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary.Mr. Paulson has recruited several former colleagues from Goldman Sachs to advise him, though administration officials took pains to say that they were not dominating the process, pointing to other Treasury employees who were playing major roles.“We will move rapidly to implement the new authorities, but we will also move methodically,” Mr. Paulson said in a statement after the House passed the bill on Friday.The government will hire only a bare-bones internal staff of about two dozen people with expertise in asset management, accounting and legal issues, according to administration officials, and will outsource the bulk of the program to 5 to 10 asset management firms.Administration officials said they had not yet selected the list of firms to run auctions or manage the assets. During the last few weeks, the Treasury has informally consulted major firms — including BlackRock, the Pacific Investment Management Company and Legg Mason — but none have been given a mandate, they said.The selected asset management firms will receive a chunk of the $250 billion that Congress is allowing the Treasury to spend in the first phase of the bailout. Those firms will receive fees that are likely to be lower than the industry standard of 1 percent of assets, or $1 for every $100 under management.Administration officials said they would try to drive down fees with a competitive bidding process. But with $700 billion to disburse, the plan could still generate tens of billions of dollars in fees if the firms negotiate anywhere close to their standard fees.The main mechanism for buying these assets will be reverse auctions, using the same principles that govern auctions of electricity or the wireless spectrum. In this case, the government will issue an offer to buy a class of assets — for example, subprime mortgage-backed securities — with the final price being determined by how many banks are willing to sell.Using outside contractors on such an extensive scale raises a host of thorny questions, outside experts said. Among the most pressing is: How will the Treasury avoid conflicts of interest that fund managers will encounter as they work both for their own clients’ interests — which could pay higher fees — and the interests of taxpayers?“With anyone short of the stature and honesty of a Paul Volcker running it, you need to worry a lot about conflicts of interest,” said Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, referring to its former head. “Unfortunately, there just aren’t many people with the expertise you need but without any possible conflicts.”The Treasury officials said they were still writing a policy on conflicts of interest as well as guidelines on compensation.As if the mechanics were not daunting enough, Treasury officials need to make wrenching decisions that will determine the bailout’s winners and losers. With so much money on the line, lobbyists for interest groups are already besieging the government to decide in their favor.The prospect of pitching in during a national crisis has drawn unsolicited offers from prominent asset managers, like William H. Gross, the managing director of Pimco, who offered his services free.In setting up the program, Mr. Paulson has relied on a cadre of former Goldman Sachs executives: Edward C. Forst, a former co-head of Goldman’s investment management business who is on leave from his job as executive vice president at Harvard; Kendrick R. Wilson III, formerly chairman of Goldman’s financial institutions groups; and Dan Jester, who was deputy chief financial officer at Goldman.But administration officials said several other Treasury officials were playing crucial roles, including six assistant secretaries: Peter B. McCarthy, Phillip L. Swagel, Neel Kashkari, Kenneth E. Carfine, David G. Nason and Kevin I. Fromer, who led the Treasury’s negotiating team on Capitol Hill.Mr. Forst is expected to soon return to Harvard, where he helps manage its endowment fund. And with a change in administrations looming, many of the people involved in organizing the program will not be around to manage it.Still, the Treasury may not have trouble recruiting replacements, given the job losses that have plagued the finance industry.“There are a lot of people, because of the downsizing of Wall Street, who won’t be getting a paycheck at all,” said Joshua S. Siegel, the managing principal of StoneCastle Partners, a fund that manages $2.2 billion. “They would love to be involved.”Of all the challenges that the Treasury faces, the trickiest might be determining a price for the largely unwanted wreckage it will be buying. Many of the junk loans and mortgage-backed securities have no market price at all because they have no potential buyers. The firms hired by the government will have enormous power to push the “market” price up or down as they choose.If the government bargains to buy at the lowest possible price, it will protect taxpayers. But forcing the banks to book big losses could be self-defeating if they cannot resume lending until they raise fresh capital. If the government agrees to buy the assets at the value at which banks are keeping them on their balance sheets, taxpayers will almost certainly be overpaying.The “right” price will depend on whether the government is favoring buyers or sellers. Many banks are hoping that the government will pay close to par — the value listed in their books.But hedge fund managers and other potential buyers are demanding that the government push for the much lower price, based on the current trading value of the assets. These potential buyers are hoping they can piggyback onto the Treasury program, perhaps even acquiring distressed assets alongside the Treasury in auctions.There are similar debates over how the Treasury should organize the plan. Most financial experts agree it would be impossible to build an internal operation of this size in a few weeks.“It’s essential they outsource almost everything possible,” said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. “The one thing they can’t outsource is the final decision, and they can’t outsource the infrastructure — people, hiring policies, contracting rules. But they can hire people to do everything else.”Mr. Ryan is a former director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, where he played a key role in the savings and loan cleanup. Still, some investors are troubled by the government’s heavy reliance on private firms. They said it would be difficult to prevent firms from steering capital in ways that favor their private customers.Inevitably, large asset management firms own, or are tied to banks that own, some of the same securities the government is seeking to sell. Pimco, for example, is owned by Allianz, one of Germany’s largest insurance companies. Merrill Lynch owns a stake in BlackRock.“I can’t even fathom how I would manage that,” Mr. Siegel said. “How would I manage one side, where I’m seeking to maximize profit, and the other side, where I’m looking out for the social good?”The law stipulates that the government must prevent conflicts of interest in the hiring of firms, the decision of which assets to buy, the management of those assets and even the jobs held by employees after they leave the program. But it leaves the details to the Treasury.The Treasury plans to publish guidelines for hiring the asset management firms in the next day or two, officials said. Some experts say that the department simply needs to gird itself for protests.“You’re never going to get past conflicts of interest, so you take your lumps,” said Peter J. Wallison, who was general counsel of the Treasury during the Reagan administration.The bailout legislation itself highlights the contradictory goals that the Treasury will face when it goes on its buying spree. Among the goals it is supposed to consider are “protecting taxpayers,” “preventing disruption to financial markets” and “the need to help families keep their homes.”Democratic lawmakers insisted that the Treasury use its authority to help restructure many subprime mortgages so that at least some troubled homeowners could avoid foreclosure.But the Treasury’s auction plan will make that difficult. More than 90 percent of all subprime mortgages are part of giant pools, or trusts, which sell mortgage-backed securities to investors around the world.Before the government would be able to modify any mortgage that was in a trust, securities experts said, it would have to acquire agreement from 100 percent of the bondholders. But a senior Treasury official said the government would probably want to buy no more than half of the securities tied to a trust, which would hamper winning agreement from all investors.Treasury officials have emphasized that the government will also be buying up whole mortgages, which have not been securitized, and that it may well buy whole mortgages through one-on-one negotiations with individual banks. Officials said they would probably experiment with other approaches as well.'"
"'08-10-04,'0','“It’s always the taxpayers,” said Marianne Rochlitz, 61, who works at the Berlin State Opera, expressing a common complaint in interviews with Germans passing through the Alexanderplatz in Berlin on a rainy October afternoon. “Whatever it is that happens, we have to pay for the mess.”Attitudes here help explain why German officials were quick to reject out of hand a notion that France and a couple of other nations briefly toyed with: a $414 billion bank bailout. They have chosen to stand pat, in the belief that they have rooted out and rescued their own mortgage-lamed institutions, and they do not want to foot the bill for other countries’ problems.Yet the financial crisis has been unpredictable. Germany’s own flagship institution, Deutsche Bank, had enormous but manageable write-downs of over $11 billion from the earlier stages of the crisis. Now, like other large European banks, Deutsche Bank is extremely leveraged, given the erosion in its share price, analysts said.Chancellor Angela Merkel has responded in a discreet fashion, siding with the piggy bankers, while explaining the local bailouts. “I have my own savings and no fear about them,” Mrs. Merkel told constituents Thursday in an interview with the newspaper Bild.Germany is a country where economic prudence was ingrained in the popular consciousness by long centuries of war and the wrenching hyperinflation of the 1920s. “Americans have trust in the future and are willing to borrow against it,” said Matthias von Arnim, a German financial expert and author. “The Germans say, ‘In the future everything is going to be worse, so I have to save.’ ”One very big exception came during the dot-com bubble, when even the equities-shy Germans grew exasperated watching everyone else get rich playing the stock market. They piled in just as the bubble was about to burst, in an unfortunate case of better late than never that turned out to be better never than late. It is a parallel, experts here say, to the last-minute leap several German banks made into American mortgage debt toward the end of the rise in real-estate prices in the United States.Mrs. Merkel defended the decision to rescue Hypo Real Estate, a commercial property lender, with a nearly $50 billion line of credit from the government and several banks as a move to protect the public. “We act not in favor of the banks but for the security of the individual citizens of our country,” Mrs. Merkel told Bild.But the evident concern etched on the faces of government leaders here is not just about answering to the displeased German voters. It is much more the fear that, if the instability in the financial system continues, there could be more bailouts to come.For now, the problems seem to be limited to a few lenders, particularly among the more plodding German banks. They plunged into complex, mortgage-backed securities with particular gusto because they saw American and British institutions making huge profits.The problem for German policy makers is twofold. On one hand, they can never be sure whether another nasty surprise will pop up on another German bank’s balance sheet. On the other hand, even financial boy scouts can be caught off guard as panic and broken trust continue to ripple through global markets and as credit to highly leveraged lending institutions dries up. There is nowhere to hide, and the definition of a healthy balance sheet keeps changing.It has been easier for German leaders to blame the Americans than to admit that some of their own institutions were hooked on bad mortgage debt. The current cover of the German magazine Spiegel shows a picture of the Statue of Liberty’s torch, extinguished, under the headline, “The Price of Arrogance.”Government officials have fretted publicly about the crisis, in particular the need for the United States to get its house in order and pass a rescue package, which Congress did this week and which President Bush signed on Friday. Most memorably, Germany’s finance minister, Peer Steinbrück, declared last week that “the U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the world financial system,” and that “the financial crisis was above all an American problem.”It was just a few days later, however, that the German government, along with a number of banks, was forced to put together the rescue deal to save Munich-based Hypo Real Estate, which was announced Monday by the company.“The Europeans were laughing, more or less, when the U.S. investment banks came down,” said Arnoud Boot, professor of finance and banking at the University of Amsterdam. “They said, ‘We don’t have that. We have superior supervision.’ ”He added: “Now, look at what’s happening to commercial banks in several European countries. That type of rhetoric is misplaced.”Last year, when the financial crisis first erupted, two German banks had to be rescued after speculating in subprime-related securities. The state lender SachsenLB had to be bailed out by the state of Saxony and other regional banks. IKB Deutsche Industriebank lost billions of euros speculating on mortgage-backed securities and had to be bailed out by the state-owned KfW Bankengruppe and then sold for pennies on the dollar to an American private equity firm.KfW, in turn, revealed last month that it had half a billion euros caught up in the Lehman Brothers collapse, including a last-minute transfer as Lehman entered bankruptcy that made KfW a laughingstock nationwide.Klaus Zimmermann, director of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin, said that the greater regulation that German government officials have called for in the United States would not necessarily have prevented the crisis.But Mr. Zimmerman said that he saw the German banking system as more stable, primarily because banks here are better diversified than many United States institutions.In interviews here, German citizens actually seemed less willing to blame the Americans for the troubles at home, pinning the problem on the greed of their own banks.“The Americans always go first,” said Gesine Wiemer, 40, who works in marketing for a scientific research company, “but the rest of them go along with them.”'"
"'08-10-04,'0','Polls have shown that voters trust Mr. Obama more to handle the economy, and the fact that Mr. McCain is running to succeed an unpopular Republican president makes his path more difficult.“We are looking at turning the page on this financial crisis and getting back to discussing Mr. Obama’s liberal — aggressively liberal — record and how he will be too risky for the Americans,” Greg Strimple, a senior adviser to the McCain campaign, said this week in a conference call with reporters.But doing so has its own complications. The performance of Mr. McCain’s running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, in the debate Thursday might have reassured many Republicans, but after her rocky performance in recent interviews, the focus of the debate was much more on Ms. Palin than on Mr. Obama.On Friday, Ms. Palin returned to the campaign trail and tried to redirect the flurry of news media attention away from her and onto Mr. Obama’s record.Ms. Palin said in an interview on the Fox News Channel that one of her regrets about her recent interviews on CBS News, in which she seemed ill-informed to many people, was that she had been unable to effectively press her case against Mr. Obama.“I wanted to talk about Barack Obama increasing taxes, which would lead to killing jobs,” Ms. Palin said on Fox. “I wanted to talk about his proposal to increase government spending by another trillion dollars. Some of his comments that he has made about the war that I think may, in my world, disqualifies someone from consideration as the next commander in chief.”Mr. Obama, who was campaigning in Abington, Pa., questioned Ms. Palin’s effort in the debate to portray his economic proposals as a “job-killing plan.”“I wonder if she turned on the news this morning,” Mr. Obama said, noting the report on job losses. The crowd in the high school football stadium where he was speaking booed.“So when Senator McCain and his running mate talk about job killing,” Mr. Obama said, “that’s something they know a thing or two about, because the policies they’ve supported and are supporting are killing jobs every single day.”Mr. McCain’s effort to regain the upper hand by portraying Mr. Obama as liberal and unprepared is not new.He has run advertisements labeling Mr. Obama as a celebrity and other spots saying that Mr. Obama would raise taxes and that he had supported the teaching of sex education to kindergartners, which is false. And the Republican convention was dominated by speeches, some of them laced with sarcasm, that questioned Mr. Obama’s readiness. An overwhelming majority of the advertisements that Mr. McCain is running this week attack Mr. Obama.But some Republican strategists who once worked for Mr. McCain say that the attacks and false statements have weakened the brand he built over the years as a straight talker who lamented the bitterness of modern politics. More than half of the respondents in a New York Times/CBS News poll said late last month that Mr. McCain spent more time attacking Mr. Obama than explaining what he would do as president.And Mr. McCain finds himself playing defense in a growing number of states he had expected to carry easily.Aides to Mr. McCain said that they had only recently started advertising in some of those states, and that they were confident they could turn things around in states like Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia that are crucial to their hopes for victory but where Mr. Obama has been showing strength in recent weeks.Mr. McCain said in Pueblo that he was looking forward to his debate with Mr. Obama on Tuesday. The face-off affords him a second chance to try to raise doubts about Mr. Obama, after Mr. Obama’s performance in their first debate, on foreign policy, was well-received.“I guarantee you, you’re going to learn a lot about who’s the liberal and who’s the conservative,” Mr. McCain said Friday, “and who wants to raise your taxes and who wants to lower them, and who can secure, who can bring reform, prosperity and peace to America and the world. I can do that, my friends; I have a record. Senator Obama has the rhetoric, not the record.”'"
"'08-10-04,'0','“Secondly, they have made fairly significant progress in the renewable, sustainable energy area,” Mr. Stretch added. “It does look like a hodgepodge, but Congress is saying that the tax system should be a part of a solution, both with respect to carbon and more generally.”Here are some of the items that will affect consumers:TROUBLED HOMEOWNERS The Treasury Department will be buying toxic mortgage assets from financial institutions as part of the bailout. But it is unclear how many mortgages it will ultimately own or control and whether it will be able to exert enough influence to move homeowners into more traditional mortgages they can afford.The law states that the Treasury Department is required to “maximize assistance to homeowners” and encourage mortgage servicers to modify loans through programs including Hope for Homeowners, which went into effect this week. The department is required to report the number of modifications and foreclosures within 60 days after the bill becomes law.It also extends through 2012 the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007. Under the program, homeowners whose mortgage amounts were reduced will not owe tax on the amount forgiven, which is sometimes treated as income. And the law provides that renters who live in foreclosed properties can remain in their homes, under the terms of their leases.DEPOSIT INSURANCE The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will back bank deposits of as much as $250,000 per account holder, up from $100,000, through the end of 2009. That means accounts held by two people would be covered up to $500,000. Retirement account coverage was held steady at $250,000.ALTERNATIVE ENERGY There are several new or extended tax credits to promote reduced energy use or alternative energy.The law extends for eight years a 30 percent tax credit for homeowners who put solar panels on their roofs. Previously, the maximum credit was $2,000; that limit is removed, so that a homeowner installing a typical $20,000 system would be able to claim a credit of $6,000. There is also a new 30 percent tax credit for homeowners installing a small wind turbine on their property. Geothermal heat pumps also qualify for a credit.A tax credit encouraging energy efficiency in existing homes has also been extended for a year. Improvements like installing a biomass stove or an efficient water heater will be eligible. Contractors working on new homes will be eligible for a credit of up to $2,000 if they include highly efficient systems for things like heating and cooling.The law gives manufacturers of energy-efficient dishwashers, clothes washers and refrigerators a tax credit.And owners of plug-in electric vehicles will be eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500 that will start to phase out after 250,000 of the vehicles are sold in the United States. (There are now an estimated 250 plug-in hybrids in the country, most of them converted hybrids like the Prius.)ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX The new law includes a provision to protect middle-class taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax by reducing the amount of income that is subject to the tax.For joint filers, the exemption would increase to $69,950 from $66,250 in 2007, and, for singles, to $46,200 from $44,350. As in prior years, the exemption amount begins to phase out once joint-return filers’ taxable income exceeds $150,000, or $112,500 for singles, said Bob D. Scharin, a senior tax analyst for the tax and accounting business of Thomson Reuters.The alternative minimum tax is a parallel tax system created in 1969 to ensure that wealthy individuals did not take too many tax deductions and paid their fair share of taxes. Since the tax was never indexed for inflation, it has risked ensnaring more middle-class taxpayers each year.MENTAL HEALTH PARITY Another part of the law could affect how health insurance works. If an employer has 51 or more workers and offers mental health or substance abuse coverage, it must now have the same rules and limits on what it will pay for as it would for, say, a visit to a cardiologist.Some companies that offer mental health coverage make people pay higher co-payments for office visits than they would for medical treatment of physical symptoms. Or perhaps the deductible is higher for mental health treatment than other types, or there are lower limits set for the number of days covered for in-patient substance abuse treatment than there are for other types of hospitalization. Now, all of these rules will have to be the same, including those for out-of-network coverage.The new legislation could easily put hundreds of dollars a year back in consumers’ pockets if they make regular visits to a mental health practitioner. There is always the possibility, however, that some employers could scale back their other coverage to make it equal to their mental health offerings. The bill does not require employers to cover mental health treatment or substance abuse in the first place.SUNDRY TAX ITEMS There are a variety of items that extend current tax breaks. A deduction for higher education expenses was extended through 2009, and applies to all taxpayers, including those who do not itemize their taxes. Single filers with adjusted gross incomes up to $65,000 (or $130,000 for joint filers) can deduct up to $4,000 for education expenses. Taxpayers with income less than $80,000 (or $160,000 for joint filers) can claim a deduction of up to $2,000, said Laurie Asch, a senior tax analyst in the tax and accounting business of Thomson Reuters.Meanwhile, another provision extends taxpayers’ option to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of income taxes, if they itemize. This is attractive to people who live in states with no income taxes, like Florida or Texas, and especially to buyers of big-ticket items.The law extends the additional standard deduction for property taxes. And it also extends a provision that allows people older than 70 ½ to use distributions from individual retirement accounts to contribute up to $100,000 to charity, and exclude that amount from their income.MIDWEST DISASTER RELIEF The law contains provisions to help victims of this summer’s storms in the Midwest.It includes a waiver of a 10 percent penalty for disaster-related distributions from I.R.A.’s, increases the amount that people affected by the disaster can borrow from their 401(k)s and gives a tax exemption for anyone housing up to four people dislocated by the floods. The bill also includes tax relief and scholarship provisions for people affected by other disasters.'"
"'08-10-04,'0','Regulators in New Jersey awarded the rights on Friday for construction of a $1 billion offshore wind farm in the southern part of the state to Garden State Offshore Energy. The rights, which include access to as much as $19 million in state grants, is part of New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan, which calls for 20 percent of the state’s energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. The decision comes on the heels of decisions by Delaware and Rhode Island to allow the installation of offshore wind farms.Energy experts say that these approvals could prompt regulators in New York to support projects off the south shore of Long Island and New York City.Garden State Offshore Energy is a joint venture that includes P.S.E.G. Renewable Generation, a subsidiary of P.S.E.G. Global, which is a sister company of the state’s largest utility, Public Service Electric and Gas Company.The proposal by Garden State Offshore Energy includes the installation of 96 turbines to produce as much as 346 megawatts of electricity, enough to power tens of thousands of houses, starting in 2013. The turbines would be arranged in a rectangle about a half-mile long by one-third of a mile wide and would be placed 16 to 20 miles off the coast of New Jersey’s Atlantic and Ocean Counties, much farther out and in much deeper water than other proposed wind farms. Deepwater Wind, which will work with P.S.E.G. to build the wind farm, said it could affordably build turbines in 100 feet of water with the same technology used to build oil and gas rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and other places.Because the wind blows more reliably during the day farther offshore, the company expects to be able to more readily tap into the higher prices available on the power market at peak times. And by putting the turbines so far out, the company hopes to blunt opposition from environmentalists and residents who say that turbines diminish ocean views and damage wildlife.'"
"'08-10-04,'0','MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of Somalis have been left without basic health care after Islamic militants forced one Western aid group to suspend some operations and threatened another on Friday. Meanwhile, Somalia’s civilian death toll continued to climb.The last two weeks have been especially bloody, with the United Nations estimating that more than 80 civilians have been killed in Mogadishu, the capital, alone. Elisabeth Byrs, a spokeswoman for the United Nations humanitarian office in Geneva, said that more than 100 people had been wounded in the same period.Somalia is torn between a growing Islamic insurgency and a weak and corrupt government backed by the United Nations and supported by Ethiopian troops.In recent months the insurgents have staged a series of hit-and-run attacks on several towns, and they hold Somalia’s third largest city, Kismayo. On Friday, a statement by a spokesman for the insurgents, Sheik Muqtar Robow, accused the Western aid agencies, CARE and the International Medical Corps, of having committed “crimes against Islam and the jihad.” The statement warned the agencies to leave areas controlled by the Islamists.He did not elaborate on why the two agencies had been singled out, what infractions they had committed or what would happen if they did not leave.'"
"'08-10-04,'0','In the preliminary September results, released this week, 12.2 percent thought jobs were plentiful and 32.8 percent thought they were hard to get. The 20.6 percentage point difference constitutes the worst job market perspective since late 2003.That figure has been getting worse at a rapid rate, so the three-month average is just a negative 18.5 percent. But that is still very low by standards of the last quarter-century. The figure was, however, much worse in the 1970s and early 1980s, when a series of recessions led to concern about prospects for the American economy.On Friday, the government reported that the unemployment rate remained at 6.1 percent in September but that the number of jobs fell 159,000 in the month. The survey was taken in the week that ended Sept. 12, just before the credit crisis intensified.“It’s the last snapshot of the economy before the credit crunch really hit,” said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. He said the employment rate was likely to rise to 7 percent next year.In the last two economic cycles, the recession was under way by the time more Americans thought jobs were hard to get than thought they were plentiful. This year, the figure turned negative in March, which would be consistent with a recession having started in late 2007.The other chart shows the percentage of respondents saying they expect to buy a car in the next six months. That figure, again on a three-month moving average, has fallen to 5 percent, the lowest figure since the Conference Board started asking the question in 1967.Detroit does not need to be told that polls show that auto buyers are reluctant; the carmakers reported very bad September sales this week.Typically, auto-buying intentions are slow to turn up until there is a better view of the job market, which implies a long period before revival.As the credit squeeze has intensified, many economic indicators have turned down. It now appears likely that the third quarter, which ended this week, will show a decline in gross domestic product, perhaps of 2 percent or even 3 percent at an annual rate. The government’s first estimate of that figure will be released on Oct. 30, just five days before the presidential election, and it is unlikely to improve the outlook for auto sales or employment.'"
"'08-10-04,'0','“Easy Money,” beginning on Sunday on CW, has arrived, as if by divine intervention, at the precise moment to capitalize on a collective rage aimed at the credit industry. By that measure, it ought to win an award for timeliest new fall drama — all votes in, no recount needed.“My business is based on one simple concept,” Morgan Buffkin (Jeff Hephner) explains to a date in a mall. “Never tell yourself no. Why not buy that new flat screen, why not take that trip to the Bahamas, why not add a few carats to the engagement ring? There used to be a time if you didn’t have money to buy something, you just didn’t buy it.”“Easy Money” tries to be a commentary on debt as a national lifestyle and, judging from the pilot, it’s not going to let you forget what its mission is for very long. Morgan is jokingly referred to as Morgan Stanley — in hindsight, the writers are probably thinking that the moral of it all could have been even more forcefully telegraphed if they’d named him Lehman.At any rate, Morgan is second in command in a family loan sharking business, Prestige Pay Day Loans, run by his mother, a woman who has no qualms charging 25 percent interest on short-term borrowing because, as she puts it: “What are the credit cards up to now? Probably more, but nobody calls MasterCard a shylock.”The central tension revolves around Morgan’s increasingly existential skepticism of the whole enterprise and his mother’s refusal to view their practices as predatory. In case you are apt to miss the depths of his ambivalence, the show portrays Morgan going to Borders and buying books about existentialism.“Easy Money” has as its executive producers Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider, alumni of “The Sopranos,” and it aims for a similar mood and tone of chiaroscuro. But it is as if they were using flashlights to produce it. It is as if Tony had gone around and explicitly rationalized his behavior to Anthony Jr. all the time by saying: “You know, kid, what we do here in the mob is no different from some of the things they’re doing down in Washington. I mean extortion, taxes, heck, same thing.”'"
"'08-10-04,'0','The Nittany Lions have had problems holding on to the ball — they have fumbled 13 times, losing 5 — and their offense still has not been tested on the road. Penn State has scored more than 7 points in games at Ohio State only twice since joining the Big Ten in 1993, and it has not scored a touchdown in its past two trips to Wisconsin’s Camp Randall Stadium. The Lions have night games scheduled at both locations this season.“I think we feel good about where we’re at now; we’re also not delusional,” Jay Paterno said. “There’s a lot of things we have to do yet.”But Penn State has been impressive so far in a system that is four years in the making, built around a core of players who bought into a program forgotten as a national power.“It’s exciting, man,” Zack Mills, the Penn State quarterback from 2001-4, said in a telephone interview. “I wish I was in this offense at this stage in the game; I’ve been out of the game for a couple of years. But it’s awesome, because the defense doesn’t know what’s coming next.”The Nittany Lions had long been known for a between-the-tackles offense that seemed to hark back to the elder Paterno’s glory days at the university. That was why Penn State was a surprising selection for a dynamic high school player like Williams. And it was why his father wanted him to attend Florida or Tennessee or Oklahoma — anywhere but Penn State.“I just didn’t see how Derrick would work in their program,” Dwight Williams said in a telephone interview. “When someone talks about Penn State, they think about linebackers, and they think about the running back.”His son had already made up his mind.“At that time, I believed I could go somewhere and have an immediate impact on the program,” Derrick Williams said in a telephone interview. “I said there would be no better program than Penn State to do that at.”The Nittany Lions produced a surprising 11-1 record and an Orange Bowl victory during his freshman year, using a variation of a spread offense led by quarterback Michael Robinson. That success caused a spike in recruiting; Penn State put together a highly regarded class in 2006, with a number of top prospects from near Williams’s hometown, Greenbelt, Md.“I think Derrick has had a huge deal and a lot to do with it,” Mike McQueary, the Penn State wide receivers coach and recruiting coordinator, said. “I think sometimes one of the most overlooked things in recruiting is your players are sometimes the most influential and the best part of what a university can do to recruit a kid.”But Penn State’s offense was stagnant the past two seasons under quarterback Anthony Morelli, and productivity dipped among the skill players. The coaches reopened their playbook this season. Through last weekend, Penn State was the only team in the nation to average more than 250 rushing yards a game and more than 240 passing yards.A number of players who came up with Williams are making an impact.Quarterback Daryll Clark, a junior, ranks 11th nationally in pass efficiency (168.3). The little-recruited Jordan Norwood is the team’s leading receiver as a senior. Deon Butler, who walked on as a defensive back in 2005, now ranks second in Penn State history in receptions (148) and receiving yards (2,233).At a recent news conference, Joe Paterno said, “There’s no question that the end result with Norwood, Butler and Williams and a couple other kids made a great big difference in the program, because we made some plays.”The Spread HD offense aims to combine a pro-style passing game with a spread rushing attack. Penn State has used it in an array of formations, although some wrinkles have not yet been revealed.No performance better illustrated its potential than Williams’s display last Saturday night against Illinois. He became the first player in the Paterno era to rush for a touchdown, catch a touchdown pass and score on a kick return in the same game, amassing 241 all-purpose yards.The Spread HD is considered a more advanced version of Penn State’s 2005 offense, which had a less refined passing dimension.“I’m not saying that the ’05 team was bad, but I think there’s a lot more playmakers on the team this year,” Williams said. “And it’s playmakers with experience.”Indeed, the Nittany Lions’ undefeated start has Penn State fans recalling 2005, when a group of freshmen contributed in a breakout run to a Bowl Championship Series game.

"'08-10-04,'0','The change in course by the House was prompted by fears of a global economic meltdown, and by old-fashioned political inducements added by the Senate: a portfolio of $150 billion in popular tax provisions, including credits for the production of solar, wind and other renewable energy, and an adjustment to spare middle-class families from paying the .In the end, 33 Democrats and 24 Republicans who had voted no on Monday switched sides on Friday to support the plan. Both Mr. Obama and his Republican rival, Senator , voted for the measure when the Senate approved it on Wednesday, and both hailed Friday’s outcome.Mr. McCain said that lawmakers had acted “in the best interests of the nation,” while Mr. Obama warned that “a long and difficult road to recovery” might still lie ahead.In a sign of the urgency surrounding the economic rescue effort, Congressional staff rushed the newly printed legislation into a news conference where Democratic leaders gathered after the vote. Speaker , of , signed it at 2 p.m., and it was sent to the White House for Mr. Bush’s signature.Appearing in the Rose , Mr. Bush praised Congress for acting just two weeks after the Treasury secretary, , requested the emergency bailout legislation with a warning that the American economy was at risk of the worst economic collapse since the .“We have shown the world that the will stabilize our financial markets and maintain a leading role in the global economy,” Mr. Bush said.But it was a hollow victory for the administration, which after long favoring a hands-off approach toward the financial industry has found itself interceding repeatedly this year to avert one calamity after another.Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats, who expect to widen their majority in Congress in the November elections, said they intended to tighten controls.“High-fliers on Wall Street will no longer be able to jeopardize that personal economic security of Americans,” Ms. Pelosi said, “because of the bright light of scrutiny, accountability and the attention given under regulatory reform.”Representative , Democrat of and chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said: “We will be back next year to do some serious surgery on the financial structure.”The Republican leader, Representative of , had urged his colleagues to vote yes. “We know if we do nothing this crisis is likely to worsen and put us in an economic slump the likes of which we have never seen,” he said. “I am going to vote for this bill because I think it’s in the best interests of the American people.”Opponents of the bailout called it a costly Band-Aid that did not address the core problems in the financial system. “Some things have changed in this bill but taxpayers will still be picking up the tab for Wall Street’s party,” said Representative Marilyn Musgrave, Republican of . “I am voting against this today because it’s not the best bill. It’s the quickest bill. Taxpayers for generations will pay for our haste and there is no guarantee that they will ever see the benefits.”Among House Democrats as well as Republicans, many lawmakers facing the toughest challenges for re-election remained in the no column. Those with easier races were more likely to switch.Many said they agonized over the decision amid a torrent of calls from constituents. Several who switched to yes cited a provision added by the Senate increasing the amount of savings insured by the Federal government to $250,000 per account, from $100,000.Fears about the economy also motivated support. “Nobody in East Tennessee hates the fact more than me that I am going to vote yes today after voting no on Monday,” Representative Zach Wamp, a Republican, said.“Monday I cast a blue-collar vote for the American people,” he continued. “Today I am going to cast a red, white and blue-collar vote with my hand over my heart for this country, because things are really bad and we don’t have any choice.”Several Democrats in the said they were persuaded to support the bill by Mr. Obama.Representatives Elijah E. Cummings and Donna F. Edwards, both of , said they had each spoken to Mr. Obama who helped persuade them to support the bill, in part by assuring them that he would work to achieve a goal that Democrats gave up during negotiations: a change in bankruptcy laws to let judges modify first mortgages.Mr. Obama, speaking in Abington, Pa., said he had urged lawmakers from both parties to “not make the same mistake twice.” But he warned that passage of the measure should be just “the beginning of a long-term rescue plan for our middle class.”Mr. McCain, speaking in , Ariz., warned that the bill was not perfect and there was more to be done. “It is an outrage that it’s even necessary,” Mr. McCain said. “But we must stop the damage to our economy done by corrupt and incompetent practices on Wall Street and in Washington.” Mr. McCain said he spoke to House Republicans before Friday’s vote and urged them to approve the bill.Friday’s vote capped an extraordinary two-week final stretch for the 110th Congress. Lawmakers, eager to get home for the fall campaign season, had intended to wrap up by adopting a budget bill to finance government operations through early March.Instead, after dealing with the budget, they found themselves still in Washington, just five weeks before Election Day, facing the most important vote of the year — the most important vote of their lives, many lawmakers said — and under extreme pressure by the White House, the presidential nominees, and Congressional leaders of both parties to make a quick decision.Supporters said the bailout was needed to prevent economic collapse; opponents said it was hasty, ill conceived and risked too much taxpayer money to help Wall Street tycoons, while providing no guarantees of success. The rescue plan allows the Treasury to buy troubled securities from financial firms in an effort to ease a deepening that is off business and consumer loans, the lifeblood of the economy, and contributing to a string of bank failures.Officials say the final cost of the bailout will be far less than $700 billion because the government will resell the assets that it buys.The final agreement disburses the money in parts, with Congress able to block the second $350 billion. It also provides for tighter oversight of the program by two boards, and requires the government to do more to prevent home foreclosures. Lawmakers also included efforts to restrict so-called golden parachute retirement plans for some executives whose firms seek help, and a provision allowing the government to recoup any losses after five years by assessing the financial industry.'"
"'08-10-04,'0','LONDON — Britain’s beleaguered prime minister, Gordon Brown, reshuffled part of his cabinet on Friday, stunning many political analysts by rehabilitating his onetime nemesis, Peter Mandelson, who resigned twice in scandalous circumstances from the previous government of Tony Blair..Mr. Mandelson is currently the European Union’s trade commissioner. He was expected to re-enter the British government as the minister for business, the BBC reported. The European Commission in Brussels declined to comment. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, Mr. Mandelson told reporters that he was “very proud to have been invited to serve” in Mr. Brown’s government.The move by 10 Downing Street was doubly surprising because of Mr. Mandelson’s record in government and the political allegiances that got him there.He was regarded as a particularly close ally of Mr. Blair, whose rivalry with Mr. Brown came increasingly to dominate British politics before Mr. Blair was forced from office in mid-2007. The rift between Mr. Brown and Mr. Mandelson dates back over a decade, when Mr. Mandelson gave crucial backing to Mr. Blair to take over the leadership of the Labor Party before the 1997 election. Mr. Mandelson acknowledged Friday that he and Mr. Brown “have had our ups and downs.”At that time, newspapers labeled Mr. Mandelson the “prince of darkness,” reflecting his reputation for exercising ruthless behind-the-scenes power and shaping public perceptions of the government. Along with Mr. Blair, he was a main architect of the “New Labor” project to move the party away from its socialist, union-dominated roots.'"
"'08-10-04,'0','WASHINGTON — An American envoy returned to the South Korean capital on Friday after three days of inconclusive talks with North Korea, while Bush administration officials said the North’s government was continuing to take steps toward restarting its nuclear weapons program.The envoy, Christopher R. Hill, told reporters that he had held “detailed and very substantive” talks in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, but he would not say whether he was satisfied with the outcome. He said he still had to brief Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was traveling to Kazakhstan on Friday.Mr. Hill has been seeking to salvage a fragile disarmament deal that the Bush administration had hoped would stand as a major part of its legacy. But the accord has been threatened since last week, when North Korea broke the seals placed by United Nations inspectors on its equipment at its nuclear complex in Yongbyon and said it was restarting a facility to manufacture bomb-grade plutonium.In Washington, Robert Wood, a State Department spokesman, said the North Koreans “continue to take some steps to reverse disablement in some of the Yongbyon facilities.”Before Mr. Hill left this week for the North, senior State Department officials portrayed the trip as a last-ditch effort to save the deal. “This is it,” one senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under normal diplomatic rules. The official said he believed that if the United States and North Korea failed to iron out their differences, matters might have to be kicked to the next administration.But on Friday, State Department officials were taking a different tack. They noted that Mr. Hill was leaving his deputy in Seoul, with possible plans to return to Pyongyang for more talks in the next few days, and said they remained hopeful that the deal might yet be salvaged.'"
"'08-10-04,'0','Those developments did not bode well for the corporate earnings that investors watch closely, creating a dour outlook that helped send stocks lower late in the day.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 15.05 points, or 1.35 percent, to close at 1,099.23, ending under 1,100 for the first time in four years — a fitting end to the index’s fourth-worst week in half a century.The Dow Jones industrial average declined 157.47 points, or 1.5 percent, to 10,325.38. The Nasdaq composite index fell 29.33 points, or 1.45 percent, to 1,947.39.“Investors still have to face some significant challenges in the broad economy that can’t be magically removed by a group of our Congressional leaders,” said Marc D. Stern, the chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust. “Investors have to confront a series of unknowns in the weeks ahead that can be disconcerting.”Also weighing on investors were the strains on the flow of credit, which the bailout bill was intended to relieve.Analysts said it might take several days before the effect of the bill’s approval could be seen on the credit markets. On Friday afternoon, the signals were mixed: high-yield bonds and junk bonds eased slightly, but Treasury bills moved against expectations, becoming more expensive as investors remained nervous about emerging from the safety of government notes.It was too soon to tell whether interest rates that banks charge each other for overnight loans — a crucial measure of the flow of credit to businesses and consumers — would fall.Investors and analysts interviewed Friday said they were glad to see the bailout package approved, but they warned that credit would not immediately loosen.“It is not a panacea,” said Douglas M. Peta, a market strategist at J.& W. Seligman. “Credit is the lifeblood of the economy. Until the short-term funding markets start behaving regularly, and until banks are willing to play their role in the system, the direction in stocks is going to be down.”Mr. Peta said Friday’s stock sell-off “was a rational response when the credit markets are almost practically not functioning.”A few other factors may have been at play. On Friday morning, Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based bank, said it had made a $15.1 billion bid for the Wachovia Corporation, scuttling a rival deal with Citigroup that had been struck under government pressure. The move helped raise confidence among investors that companies were still willing to take on major acquisitions amid the current crisis. Still, financial stocks as a group ended lower for the day.The sell-off after the vote on Capitol Hill may have been the result of investors’ tendency to buy on expectations — in this case, that the House would ultimately pass the bill — and sell when the event actually occurs.And Mr. Stern, of Bessemer Trust, noted that Fridays were becoming popular days for investors to sell their stock holdings. “There are two more days that used to be called the weekend, and now are simply two more business days, where important news may develop,” Mr. Stern said, referring to recent developments — the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers; the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America — all of which have occurred on the weekend.“There’s no way to trade on that news until Monday. Therefore you need to position your portfolio on Friday to be ready for what happens over the weekend.”Mr. Stern chuckled. “In 2008, you have to stay close to your BlackBerry on the weekend.”The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill rose 6/32, to 103 8/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.6 percent, from 3.63 percent late Thursday. Oil prices fell 9 cents, to settle at $93.88 a barrel.In Europe, the markets closed ahead of the House vote. The major indexes all rose after stocks on Wall Street advanced. The FTSE 100 index in Britain ended up 2.3 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris rose 3 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt gained 2.4 percent.'"

"'08-10-05,'0','LINCOLN, Neb. — Chase Daniel is the quarterback of the Missouri Tigers, the trigger of one of the nation’s most potent offenses. He also is perhaps the front-runner to win the Heisman Trophy. So it was little wonder that he came here to Memorial Stadium and ignored his university’s history of futility against the Nebraska Cornhuskers.Daniel knew Missouri had not beaten Nebraska here since 1978. He knew what the Cornhuskers’ 63-35-3 record against the Tigers over the years was emblematic of: Nebraska was used to playing for first the Big 12 title and then, possibly, the national championship while the Tigers had last won a conference title in 1969, and were usually thrilled to secure a minor bowl bid.This season, however, things were different. Missouri came here averaging 595 yards of total offense and 53 points a game. The Tigers were 4-0, ranked No. 4 in the Associated Press poll and believed they were better than last year’s Daniel-led 12-2 team. In fact, they fancy themselves contenders for the national championship.Daniel said so, more or less. Earlier in the week, he was respectful of the Cornhuskers but had sent a signal to his Tigers teammates of what he expected from them. “If we play our B game, maybe we’ll win,” he said. “But we don’t want to leave it to maybe.”It took Daniels barely 54 seconds to replace “maybe” into a certain Missouri victory when, on the third play of the game, he delivered a pinpoint pass to Jeremy Maclin, who streaked untouched for a 58-yard touchdown. It was merely the first strike in a rigorous 52-17 thumping the Tigers put on the Cornhuskers.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — A Connecticut-North Carolina matchup usually means national headlines, screaming announcers and expectations of one or both teams making an N.C.A.A. championship run. But that happens only during basketball season, not in October.Oddly enough, there was a football game between these storied basketball colleges that actually meant something Saturday night. Two rising programs with national aspirations met at Kenan Stadium to determine which one was closer to stepping onto that stage.The answer: North Carolina. The Tar Heels scored on offense, defense and special teams to hand the sloppy Huskies a 38-12 defeat that will no doubt knock Connecticut out of the national rankings and possibly lift North Carolina (4-1) into the Associated Press top 25. The Huskies were intercepted three times, had three punts blocked and were assessed 11 penalties for 97 yards.“That was just way too many penalties, way too many turnovers, way too many mistakes for a UConn football team,” Connecticut Coach Randy Edsall said. “This is a top-25 team, in my opinion, that we played today. I ranked them last week in the top 25, and you can’t do those things against a team with this kind of talent and with this kind of athletic ability.”Connecticut arrived here with a 5-0 record and No. 24 national ranking, along with the most productive running back in the country in the junior Donald Brown. He went into the weekend averaging 181.2 yards rushing.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','But Carrie Chiang, the Corcoran broker who listed the Henson mansion, said the Bronfmans had finally found a place large enough to support wide open loftlike spaces without the need for interior load-bearing walls.Ms. Chiang said that buyers at the top of the market are unlikely to be deterred by stock market losses. “They have already made their money,” she said. “Nothing can affect them.”A few years ago, Abigail Disney, a grandniece of Walt Disney, and her husband, Pierre Hauser, sold a town house at 247 Central Park West for $15.5 million, setting a record at the time for town houses on the West Side. (It has since been topped by a sale on Riverside Drive and West 108th Street for $15.75 million.)Soon afterward, Ms. Disney bought a legendary apartment with 14 rooms, 6 bedrooms and 7,200 square feet of space that took up the entire fifth floor at a co-op at 300 West End Avenue. The apartment — actually two that had been combined, with an entertainment space extending across most of the 100-foot-wide building front — was said to be the biggest on West End Avenue, and had been owned for four decades by Harry Belafonte, the singer, actor and civil rights advocate.Mr. Belafonte put the apartments on the market with great fanfare in 2005, for $15.5 million total, but eventually cut the price to $11.5 million. In late 2006, Ms. Disney paid $10.75 million and moved in while she worked with an architect on plans to renovate the space.But in March, she put the apartments back on the market for $13.45 million, after giving up the renovation plans. It turned out that although Mr. Belafonte had lived and worked there for many years, he had never fully integrated the two units, and they required a great deal of work. There are still two separate kitchens, with one apartment functioning as a family space, the other as a work space.Rosalie Liebman, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, who lives in the building and is representing Ms. Disney, said her client had simply changed her mind and was too busy to finish the project. Instead, she has decided to look for a place downtown.“They lived in it for a year to get a feel of it, they began to submit plans, and never finished the process,” Ms. Liebman said.Like Mr. Belafonte before her, Ms. Disney has been gradually lowering the asking price, to $11.95 million in July, and to $10.95 million in September. Each apartment is also available separately, at $5.975 million and $5.475 million.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','In “Those Who Write, Teach,” David Gessner (Sept. 21) structures the choices available to a writer/teacher as either sitting at a lonely desk writing or balancing that writing with all the requirements of teaching. Such a distinction is useful when he writes about Emily Dickinson but much less so when applied to Thoreau or Melville. They went to the woods and the sea, where their experiences and observations provided them with the material for their writing. Teaching does not so much deprive writers of writing time as it substitutes a significant but limited experience for one richer in the invaluable raw material needed for writing.The real issue today is not the divisions within a writer that split his “literary” self from his “academic” self. What is really happening — spurred by developments in global communication — is that our cherished divide between the mighty author and his lowly readers is disintegrating. The key pedagogical issue then becomes how we teach the kind of interactive literacy — one that teaches our students to be both responsible consumers and producers of information — needed to thrive in our new media environment.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','MILWAUKEE (AP) — Given the state of the economy, Commissioner Bud Selig warned team owners Saturday not to “get too cocky” and overprice game tickets.“Because you do pay a price,” he said.Speaking before Game 3 of the National League division series between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Milwaukee Brewers, Selig called 2008 a “phenomenal success” despite a decline in attendance that Selig attributed to bad weather and high gas prices.But Selig acknowledged concern about a prolonged economic downturn. “I think anybody in every business is concerned,” he said.Selig said he was optimistic about baseball economics, citing playoff appearances by the small-market Brewers and Tampa Bay Rays as an example of the positive effects of revenue sharing. “I think the sport has more competitive balance today than there’s ever been,” he said.Selig, a former owner of the Brewers, planned to throw out the ceremonial first pitch Sunday if the series reached a fourth game. He praised the popularity of the wild card, but played down talk of allowing more teams into the playoffs.“I happen to think the system is good this way,” he said.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','European countries lack a common budget and uniform regulations for crossborder banks and brokerages, hampering their ability to enact a large bailout program like the one passed in Washington.The unusual Saturday afternoon meeting was hastily convened by Mr. Sarkozy, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.Afterward, flanked by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, Mr. Sarkozy said, “What is of the essence is that Europe should exist and respond with one voice.”As in the recent conflict between Georgia and Russia, Mr. Sarkozy seemed to revel in the role of being Europe’s chief spokesman in this crisis, occasionally whispering to Mr. Brown and sharing a joke with Mrs. Merkel.Mr. Sarkozy praised the passage of what he called “the Paulson plan” in Washington — a reference to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. of the United States — calling it a stabilizing factor for the global economy.Although Mr. Sarkozy said it was time “literally to rebuild the foundations of the financial systems,” the steps announced were more modest.Leaders said they would try to rewrite European accounting rules by the end of the month to limit the losses banks have to write off, an effort to match changes in “mark-to-market” accounting rules in the United States while keeping Europe’s financial sector competitive.They stopped short of calling for an overarching banking regulator for Europe but proposed creating a panel of European regulators to jointly oversee large financial institutions with operations in different countries.More significant for the long term, the leaders declared that the European Union’s strict rules on competition and fiscal responsibility should be interpreted with greater “flexibility” if more banks require government financial help to survive.They also vowed to lobby the European Investment Bank to make an extra $21.2 billion available immediately to small and midsize businesses squeezed for credit, an initiative spearheaded by Mr. Brown of Britain.With two British banks already nationalized and the British economy teetering on the edge of a recession, Mr. Brown adopted a forceful tone at a news conference after the meeting.“Where action has to be taken, we will continue to do whatever is necessary to preserve the stability of the financial system,” he said. “We agreed that we must do more to coordinate our response in times of crisis and the interest of stability.”But plenty of differences remain. For example, the leaders did not propose a Europe-wide bailout fund akin to the American rescue package, nor did they agree on a common standard for bank deposit insurance across the European Union.A week ago the Irish government said it would fully guarantee bank deposits in Irish banks, reassuring consumers there but angering leaders of neighboring nations that offer much less sweeping protections for savers.The move prompted the British government to raise its deposit insurance to 50,000 pounds, or $88,500, from 35,000 pounds, or about $62,000, because of concerns that British savers might abandon their banks for the comparative safety of Irish banks.At the meeting on Saturday, the leaders seemed to take a veiled swipe at the Irish move, declaring in a joint statement, “We will ensure that potential cross-border effects of national decisions are taken into consideration.”Ireland was not the only country singled out for criticism.Despite praise for the American bailout plan by Mr. Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s prime minister, Mr. Brown said pointedly that the crisis “has come from America.”Mr. Berlusconi claimed that “Europe is not facing and never faced the risks in the American system.” Europeans, he said, “set aside money in savings.”One leader after another blamed what they called “speculative capitalism” for a financial crisis that they said was the worst since World War II.“We want a capitalism of entrepreneurs,” Mr. Sarkozy said. “We don’t want speculators.”The meeting took place after a frenzied week of state intervention to rescue faltering banks in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Britain. Several European economies are sliding into recession, with growth stalled in France, unemployment surpassing 11 percent in Spain and Mr. Brown’s fiscal stewardship criticized in Britain.In addition to the political leaders, the meeting was attended by Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, who oversees monetary policy within the euro zone.Calling the Central Bank “an anchor of stability,” Mr. Trichet said of the 320 million Europeans in the euro zone, “They can count on us.”'"
"'08-10-05,'0','Officially, the nation may or may not be in a recession. (That label is applied by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit group recognized by the government as the final word on such things, and that word awaits.)But measured at the local level, in places as diverse as Saginaw, Mich.; Sacramento, Calif.; Honolulu; and Atlanta, the slowdowns are well under way.According to an analysis by Moody's Economy.com released last week, about two-thirds of the country's 381 metropolitan areas were in recession, and another one in five was at risk.The report evaluates employment and industrial production data for the six months ending in August - so it doesn't reflect deteriorating conditions caused by the financial upheavals in September. But other news did: on Friday, the government said the economy shed 159,000 jobs in September, the worst monthly tally since 2001 and the ninth consecutive month of job losses.The seizing up of credit for businesses large and small, widely reported last week, seems certain to knock some of the ""at risk"" cities down a peg.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','There was, however, at least one doctor-journalist among those 20 reporters in May, the CNN correspondent Sanjay Gupta. At the time, Gupta told on that the medical records were “pretty comprehensive” and wrote on his CNN blog that he was “pretty convinced there was no ‘ gun’ about the senator’s health.” (Physical health, that is; Gupta wrote there was hardly any information on McCain’s .)That was then. Now McCain is looking increasingly shaky, whether he’s repeating his joke twice in the same debate or speaking from notecards even when reciting a line for (literally) the 17th time (“The fundamentals of our economy are strong”) or repeatedly confusing proper nouns that begin with S (Sunni, Shia, , , ). McCain’s “dismaying temperament,” as George Will labeled it, only thickens the concerns. His kamikaze mission into Washington during the bailout crisis seemed crazed. His seething, hostile debate countenance — a replay of ’s sarcastic sighing in 2000 — didn’t make the deferential Obama look weak (as many Democrats feared) but elevated him into looking like the sole presidential grown-up.Though CNN and MSNBC wouldn’t run a political ad with doctors questioning McCain’s medical status, Gupta revisited the issue in an interview published last Tuesday by The . While maintaining a pretty upbeat take on the candidate’s health, the doctor-journalist told the reporter Sam Stein that he couldn’t vouch “by any means” for the completeness of the records the campaign showed him four months ago. “The pages weren’t numbered,” Gupta said, “so I had no way of knowing what was missing.” At least in Watergate we knew that the gap on Rose Mary Woods’s tape ran 18 and a half minutes.It’s against this backdrop that Palin’s public pronouncements, culminating with her debate performance, have been so striking. The standard take has it that she’s either speaking utter ignorant gibberish (as to Couric) or reciting highly polished, campaign-written sound bites that she’s memorized (as at the convention and the debate). But there’s a steady unnerving undertone to Palin’s utterances, a consistent message of hubristic self-confidence and hyper-ambition. She wants to be president, she thinks she can be president, she thinks she will be president. And perhaps soon. She often sounds like someone who sees herself as half-a-heartbeat away from the presidency. Or who is seen that way by her own camp, the hard-right base that never liked McCain anyway and views him as, at best, a White House place holder.This was first apparent when Palin extolled a “small town” vice president as a hero in her convention speech — and cited not one of the many Republican vice presidents who fit that bill but, bizarrely, , a Democrat who succeeded a president who died in office. A few weeks later came Charlie Gibson’s question about whether she thought she was “experienced enough” and “ready” when McCain invited her to join his ticket. Palin replied that she didn’t “hesitate” and didn’t “even blink” — a response that seemed jarring for its lack of any human modesty, even false modesty.In the last of her Couric interview installments on Thursday, Palin was asked which vice president had most impressed her, and after paying tribute to , she chose “George Bush Sr.” Her criterion: she most admires vice presidents “who have gone on to the presidency.” Hours later, at the debate, she offered a discordant contrast to Biden when asked by how they would each govern “if the worst happened” and the president died in office. After Biden spoke of somber continuity, Palin was weirdly flip and chipper, eager to say that as a “maverick” she’d go her own way.But the debate’s most telling passage arrived when Biden welled up in recounting his days as a single father after his first wife and one of his children were killed in a car crash. Palin’s perky response — she immediately started selling McCain as a “consummate maverick” again — was as emotionally disconnected as Michael Dukakis’s notoriously cerebral answer to the hypothetical 1988 debate question about his wife being “raped and murdered.” If, as some feel, Obama is cool, Palin is ice cold. She didn’t even acknowledge Biden’s devastating personal history.After the debate, Republicans who had been bailing on Palin rushed back to the fold. They know her relentless ambition is the only hope for saving a ticket headed by a warrior who is out of juice and out of ideas. So what if she is preposterously unprepared to run the country in the midst of its greatest economic crisis in 70 years? She looks and sounds like a winner.You can understand why they believe that. She has more than anyone else at the top of her party. McCain and his surrogates are forever blaming their travails on others, wailing about supposed sexist and journalistic biases around the clock. McCain even canceled an interview with , for heaven’s sake, in a fit of pique at a CNN anchor, .We are not a nation of whiners, as would have it, but the G.O.P. is now the party of whiners. That rebranding became official when Republican House leaders moaned that a routine partisan speech by had turned their members against the bailout bill. As the stock market fell nearly 778 points, taunted his G.O.P. peers with pitch-perfect mockery: “Somebody hurt my feelings, so I will punish the country!”Talk about the world coming full circle. This is the same Democrat who had been slurred as “Barney Fag” in the mid-1990s by , a House leader of the government-bashing Gingrich revolution that helped lower us into this debacle. Now Frank was ridiculing the House G.O.P. as a bunch of sulking teenage girls. His wisecrack stung — and stuck.Palin is an antidote to the whiny Republican image that Frank nailed. ’s self-styled embodiment of Joe Sixpack is not a sulker, but a pistol-packing fighter. That’s why she draws the crowds and (as she puts it) “energy” that otherwise elude the angry McCain. But she is still the candidate for vice president, not president. Americans do not vote for vice president.So how can a desperate G.O.P. save itself? As McCain continues to fade into incoherence and irrelevance, the last hope is that he’ll come up with some new game-changing stunt to match his initial pick of Palin or his ill-fated campaign “suspension.” Until Thursday night, more than a few Republicans were fantasizing that his final Hail Mary pass would be to ditch Palin so she can “spend more time” with her ever-growing family. But the debate reminded Republicans once again that it’s Palin, not McCain, who is their last hope for victory.You have to wonder how long it will be before they plead with him to think of his health, get out of the way and pull the ultimate stunt of flipping the ticket. Palin, we can be certain, wouldn’t even blink.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','“This is now the issue of the day,” said Nathan L. Gonzales, who follows Congressional races for the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. “And you have candidates and coalitions all over the map.”After two years of Democrats running the House and Senate for the first time since the Republican takeover of the House in 1994, lawmakers on both sides do have other things to talk about.Democrats will point to a hike in the minimum wage, an increase in auto mileage standards, expansive new veterans benefits, education aid and intensified oversight of the Bush administration as evidence of success. Republicans will emphasize a renewed terror surveillance law and their victory in repealing a longstanding drilling ban, while faulting Democrats as mishandling federal spending.Both sides will claim credit for an economic stimulus plan that put a refund check in the hands of Americans this year. And both sides have some responsibility — or culpability depending on one’s view — for the bailout.In some ways, the perception of this Congress has been shaped more by its angry tone than its actual record. Even the accomplishments were produced in a highly charged partisan atmosphere that drove down public approval and that can be traced to deep divisions over the Iraq war and a poor relationship between Democrats and a White House loathe to consider the priorities of the new power on Capitol Hill.“They hadn’t quite realized that we had won the election,” said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.Republicans say Democrats reneged on their 2006 campaign pledge to run a fairer House. Democrats, newly led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, began the session in January 2007 by forcing through a string of pent-up Democratic initiatives without allowing Republicans much say, a start that colored the entire session.Republicans also say the new Democratic majority pushed too hard on divisive issues, like imposing a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq — an effort Democrats failed at repeatedly.Despite the persistent partisan tensions, the leaders of the two parties came together in the final days of the session to put together the bailout measure at the behest of the Bush administration. But they had serious problems trying to get the rank and file to join them on a vote many lawmakers compared in magnitude to a vote for war or the 1998 vote to impeach President Clinton.Lawmakers in both parties, particularly those considered most vulnerable to losing their seats in November, balked at the idea of rapidly agreeing just weeks away from their re-elections to spend up to $700 billion from the Treasury to help out high-finance executives.Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, acknowledged that the proposal was a “challenger’s dream,” allowing anyone running against an incumbent to rail freely against a proposal that left a sour taste with the public.Challengers from both parties went on the attack. It quickly surfaced in high-profile Senate races in North Carolina and Minnesota and emerged in House contests around the country. Lawmakers noticed.On the initial House vote, most of the so-called vulnerable lawmakers in both parties voted no, despite pleas for help from the leadership and the White House. On Friday, many of those in the toughest races as well as House members running for Senate rejected the measure again, though a handful of embattled lawmakers switched their votes.Representative Joe Knollenberg, a Michigan Republican who is a top target of Democrats, said he saw a real shift in public sentiment after Monday’s House defeat and the ensuing market turmoil, prompting him to change his mind despite possible political fallout and back the bill.“This is the right vote,” said Mr. Knollenberg, who said he had been encouraged to change by auto company executives worried about the tightening credit. “It is tough vote, but quite honestly you are damned if you do or damned if you don’t.”Representative Nancy Boyda, a first-term Democrat from Kansas who also faces a serious challenge, said she wrestled with the vote but ultimately rejected the legislation both times. “I wasn’t sure this was going to actually make a difference in the short-term, the medium-term or the long-term,” Ms. Boyda said. “Nothing would make me happier to be wrong.”The vote created some interesting political dynamics. In Minnesota, Al Franken, the Democratic Senate candidate, has criticized Senator Norm Coleman, the Republican incumbent, for supporting the measure. That stance puts Mr. Franken at odds with Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; his party’s Senate leadership; Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from the state; and the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama.The fact that the party hierarchy and both presidential candidates came down so clearly in favor of the bailout could dilute its impact in the Congressional races.Still, independent advocacy organizations and challengers themselves will still make use of it — even if they share a position with their opponent.“If I was in Congress today, I would have voted against the bailout as I would have the first time,” said Sean Sullivan, a Republican challenging Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, who twice voted against the bill. Mr. Knollenberg, the Michigan Republican, said he was not certain what role the bailout would ultimately play in his race. While it might be front and center now, he said, the election is a few weeks off and something else might develop.“People forget in a hurry,” he said.However, $700 billion can leave quite an impression.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','Cutbacks in hours and pay are especially pernicious because for most of the Bush years, wage growth has lagged behind worker productivity and prices. As Americans have worked harder they have fallen further behind. The only good news — if you can call it that — was that credit was easy.As a result, many Americans today have no savings and are deep in debt. That means they are even less prepared to take care of themselves and their families when they lose their jobs.Conditions are only getting worse. Personal spending stagnated in August, the latest month with government data. Auto sales plunged in September. Factory orders are off. New home sales fell to a 17-year low in August, according to the Census Bureau. And home prices continued to fall sharply in July, for a decline of 16.3 percent over 12 months, according to the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index of prices in 20 major cities. There is no sign that prices have hit their bottom.Exports, the one bright spot, are also set to fall, because many other nations took part in America’s financial follies and are now faltering as well.All that weakness means that more Americans will lose their jobs in the months to come. Extending unemployment benefits is the least that Congress can do to help. The House overwhelmingly passed a bill to do that before it left Washington last week. The Senate must take the bill up as soon as it returns for its lame duck session.There is a lot more work to do to fill in the gaps of the bailout bill. It does virtually nothing to prevent foreclosures and keep Americans in their homes. Congress must finally change the code to allow a bankruptcy court to reduce the size of bankrupt borrowers’ mortgages.A new stimulus bill must also be crafted. It must include bolstered food stamps and aid to states and cities, so that they can continue to provide health care and keep paying for construction and other projects that provide desperately needed jobs.The meltdown on Wall Street is only part of a larger meltdown, and the bailout bill is only one attempt at a fix.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','CARACAS, Venezuela — Military officials have prohibited Raúl Isaías Baduel, a retired general and a former confidant of President Hugo Chávez who is now one of his most strident critics, from leaving the country after accusing him of corruption in connection with his tenure as Venezuela’s defense minister.The travel ban was imposed late Friday night after military intelligence agents arrested Mr. Baduel and shoved him into an unmarked vehicle in front of two of his children and his wife, who was screaming at the agents, a scene captured on video and replayed repeatedly throughout this country on private television networks.Rafael Tosta, a lawyer for Mr. Baduel, who was released Friday night, said his client was also required to appear before a military tribunal every 15 days and was prohibited from publicly commenting on the accusations, which revolve around $14.5 million in missing funds.Mr. Baduel, who helped reinstall Mr. Chávez after a brief coup in 2002, has gone from being a hero of the president’s socialist-inspired revolution to one of its outcasts. Mr. Baduel emerged as one of Mr. Chávez most vocal opponents since resigning as defense minister last year.Critics of Mr. Chávez said the arrest was a distraction tactic before regional elections in November, when the president’s party will be faced with the possibility of losing control of important states, including Aragua, a bastion of active and retired military personnel where Mr. Baduel is said to wield influence.“If Baduel had remained quiet, everyone would be happy,” said Ismael García, a congressman who, like Mr. Baduel, broke with Mr. Chávez last year over a proposed constitutional overhaul that would have significantly increased the president’s power. Voters rejected the overhaul last December.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','“It was important for me to start well; they had some good scoring chances,” Lundqvist said. “After I made a couple of good saves, I felt more relaxed.”The Lightning, which finished with the worst record in the league last season, took a mere three shots in the second period. With the game still scoreless midway through the period, the crowd began to express its discontent, whistling loudly and chanting “My chceme hokej,” or “We want some hockey.”Tampa Bay forward Vaclav Prospal, a native of the Czech Republic, bought dozens of tickets for his relatives. He said he had been looking forward to the game and that the atmosphere was “all right.”“Maybe the Rangers got bigger support because they had so many Czech players on the team over the past seasons,” Prospal said. “But we could not expect there to be huge groups of Rangers or Lightning fans.”The crowd finally brightened with 52 seconds left in the second period, when Rangers forward Markus Naslund scored the first goal of the season. Naslund, who hit the post with a backhander moments earlier, beat Lightning goalie Mike Smith with a wrist shot to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead.The Rangers continued pushing in the third, and the Lightning responded with some dangerous counterattacks.Four minutes in, Martin St. Louis evened the score on a pass from Lecavalier. Then 18-year-old Steven Stamkos, the No. 1 overall pick in the draft in June, came close to giving Tampa Bay the lead, but Lundqvist fought off his shot from in front.The Rangers collected their seventh power play of the game with 7:23 to play, when Lightning forward Gary Roberts was called for high-sticking. Dubinsky scored 1:39 later on a snap shot from the right circle that found its way through a thicket of players screening Smith.“Seven penalties, that’s 14 minutes out of 60 that you’re short-handed,” said Barry Melrose, in his first game as Tampa Bay’s coach after spending 12 years at ESPN. “Fourteen minutes that some of your best players aren’t on the ice, and it’s an extra 14 minutes of hard work for a young defense.”“If you give the Rangers seven power plays, you’re going to get a goal,” he added.Though the Czech fans left the game a bit disappointed with what they saw, Naslund said he found promise in the Rangers’ narrow victory.“We’ve got a brand-new team, and it’s not an easy thing for the whole group to come in and find the chemistry,” he said. “I think we did a great job.”PENGUINS 4, SENATORS 3 Tyler Kennedy scored his second goal, with 25 seconds left in overtime, to give Pittsburgh a victory in front of a capacity crowd of 13,699 at Globe Arena in Stockholm.Although many N.H.L. teams have played exhibitions or tournaments in Sweden, this was the first time in league history that two teams began the regular season in Sweden.Ottawa center Jason Spezza turned over the puck at the blue line, allowing Kennedy to skate in alone and beat Senators goalie Martin Gerber with a wrist shot from the left circle. Kennedy also scored 40 seconds into the game. Marc-André Fleury made 32 saves for the Penguins.Defenseman Rob Scuderi tied the score at 3-3 with his goal 3 minutes 56 seconds into the third.Ottawa led, 3-2, after a power-play goal by Dany Heatley and a short-handed goal by Spezza in the second.

"'08-10-05,'0','This particular type of market failure occurs when two conditions are met. First, people confront a gamble that offers a highly probable small gain with only a very small chance of a significant loss. Second, the rewards received by market participants depend strongly on relative performance.These conditions have caused the invisible hand to break down in multiple domains. In unregulated housing markets, for example, there are invariably too many dwellings built on flood plains and in earthquake zones. Similarly, in unregulated labor markets, workers typically face greater health and safety risks.It is no different in unregulated financial markets, where easy credit terms almost always produce an asset bubble. The problem occurs because, just as in sports, an investment fund’s success depends less on its absolute rate of return than on how that rate compares with those of rivals.If one fund posts higher earnings than others, money immediately flows into it. And because managers’ pay depends primarily on how much money a fund oversees, managers want to post relatively high returns at every moment.One way to bolster a fund’s return is to invest in slightly riskier assets. (Such investments generally pay higher returns because risk-averse investors would otherwise be unwilling to hold them.) Before the current crisis, once some fund managers started offering higher-paying mortgage-backed securities, others felt growing pressure to follow suit, lest their customers desert them.Warren E. Buffett warned about a similar phenomenon during the tech bubble. Mr. Buffett said he wouldn’t invest in tech stocks because he didn’t understand the business model. Investors knew him to be savvy, but the relatively poor performance of his Berkshire Hathaway fund during the tech stock run-up persuaded many to move their money elsewhere. Mr. Buffett had the personal and financial resources to weather that storm. But most money managers did not, and the tech bubble kept growing.A similar dynamic precipitated the current problems. The new mortgage-backed securities were catnip for investors, much as steroids are for athletes. Many money managers knew that these securities were risky. As long as housing prices kept rising, however, they also knew that portfolios with high concentrations of the riskier assets would post higher returns, enabling them to attract additional investors. More important, they assumed that if things went wrong, there would be safety in numbers.PHIL GRAMM, the former senator from Texas, and other proponents of financial industry deregulation insisted that market forces would provide ample protection against excessive risk. Lenders obviously don’t want to make loans that won’t be repaid, and borrowers have clear incentives to shop for favorable terms. And because everyone agrees that financial markets are highly competitive, Mr. Gramm’s invocation of the familiar invisible-hand theory persuaded many other lawmakers.The invisible hand breaks down, however, when rewards depend heavily on relative performance. A high proportion of investors are simply unable to stand idly by while others who appear no more talented than them earn conspicuously higher returns. This fact of human nature makes the invisible hand an unreliable shield against excessive financial risk.Where do we go from here?Many people advocate greater transparency in the market for poorly understood derivative securities. More stringent disclosure rules would be good but would not prevent future crises, any more than disclosing the relevant health risks would prevent athletes from taking steroids.The only effective remedy is to change people’s incentives. In sports, that means drug rules backed by strict enforcement. In financial markets, asset bubbles cause real trouble when investors can borrow freely to expand their holdings. To prevent such bubbles, we must limit the amounts that people can invest with borrowed money.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','Successful consultants are very self-motivated and nimble, said Bradford Agry, founding partner of CareerTeam Partners, a career management consulting firm in New York.“Most people are used to working in a job that has a specific description,” he said. “But your consultancy is going to unfold and change, so you need to be flexible.”Q. How far in advance of leaving your job should you begin planning your move, and what should you do during that time?A. Plan on six months to a year to lay the groundwork for your consulting business. Building a network of contacts is crucial during this time, said Linda Stewart, the chief executive of Epoch, which helps find projects for independent consultants in financial services. That network includes friends, colleagues, business associates, vendors and clients.Write a business plan that establishes how revenue will be generated and how you will handle sales, marketing, finance, operations, expenses and fees, Ms. Stewart said.Meet with an accountant and a lawyer, who can advise you about what kind of entity to form — like a limited liability company or a corporation — and about the tax implications of each. Legal advice will also help ensure that the work you do as an independent contractor doesn’t subject you to any personal liability, said Jay A. Zweig, a partner specializing in employment law with the Bryan Cave firm in Phoenix.“One thing that is absolutely critical is to develop a standard engagement letter stating that a particular company is hiring you as an independent contractor and this is how and when you will be compensated,” Mr. Zweig said.Q. What kind of financial cushion should you have before leaving your job to become a consultant?A. Depending on whether you have a partner or spouse helping to pay the bills, you should have 6 to 12 months of living expenses in the bank. Make sure you have a clear understanding of both your personal and business-related financial obligations, Ms. Onderick-Harvey said.“Working out of your home may mean low overhead costs,” she said, “but you need things like office equipment, phone lines, business stationery, I.T. services, health insurance and professional malpractice insurance.”Q. Is it advisable to become a consultant during an economic downturn?A. A downturn isn’t necessarily a bad time to be working on your own, provided that you have a realistic understanding of your market. But your financial cushion is even more important because it could take longer to establish a steady income stream.Q. If you’ve been laid off, is that a good time to become a consultant?A. If your severance package allows you the time to make the transition properly, yes. But you still need to evaluate your skills, personality type, income requirements and risk tolerance, Ms. Stewart said.The decision to become a consultant should never be a knee-jerk reaction, said Ms. Onderick-Harvey, especially if you have a small severance package.Q. When you are starting out, how do you obtain clients?A. Begin with your network. Systematically send e-mail — then follow up with phone calls — to everyone you know who might need your services or be able to refer you to a potential client.Approach larger consulting firms in your industry and let them know you are interested in working as a subcontractor when they need extra help, Ms. Stewart said. You can also work with contract staffing firms that can act as a broker and connect you with projects.Q. It’s troubling that the term “consultant” often has a negative connotation. Why is that?A. Consulting gets a bad rap because there is no barrier to entry, said Alan Weiss, president of the Summit Consulting Group, a management consulting firm in East Greenwich, R.I., and author of “Million Dollar Consulting.”“There is a lot of schlock in the field,” he said, “but the greatest companies in the world use consultants because they know they need them.”'"
"'08-10-05,'0','Google does provide phone support to Gmail customers who subscribe to Google Apps Premier Edition, which costs $50 annually and includes larger storage quotas and other benefits. Customers who use the advertising-supported version of Gmail, however, must rely solely on what Google calls “self-service online support.”Microsoft and Yahoo similarly offer phone support only to their premium e-mail customers. (Yahoo says it offers phone support for its free e-mail service “in some cases,” but it does not publish the phone number; it is revealed to the user in distress only after e-mail communication fails to resolve the problem.)Last month, Google’s official blog dispensed advice for those unfortunate souls who find themselves locked out. The post, “What to do if you can’t access your Webmail,” scolded users about not sharing passwords with anyone, pointed customers to a form to reset the password and, if that doesn’t solve the problem, to another form to start the “account recovery process.”As customers, we bring the same expectations to Google’s personalized information services, like Gmail or Google Docs, its word-processing service, as we do to our bank’s Web site. These are places that hold information very dear to us. My bank recognizes that losing access for days at a time is unacceptable. It provides me with round-the-clock phone support for account problems. So, too, should Google, even if I pay the company not in the form of a monthly account fee, but with my attention, which Google commercializes by selling slices to its advertisers.Last month, with cases like Mr. Lynch’s in mind, I contacted Google to see what the company had to say about my suggestion that it add phone support for its customers with account-related problems. The company returned with a debate team of three to argue the negative position: Matthew Glotzbach, who works with Google’s business customers; Roy Gilbert, who handles consumers; and Greg Badros, who is an engineering director.Mr. Glotzbach began by saying that “one-to-one support isn’t always the best answer” because it would take Google too long to collect lots of data about a problem that is affecting many users simultaneously.For systemic problems, data collection is important. But not for other categories. Account recovery could be slow for a locked-out customer who doesn’t have a backup e-mail account, and who declined to provide a security question and answer because of concerns that someone else could use it to get in (which is what someone did to Gov. Sarah Palin’s Yahoo Mail account).Mr. Badros argued that Google asks so little personal information of a new Gmail customer that it’s hard to determine identity when the genuine user and the impostor both present themselves to claim the account, and neither can produce the verification. He said more information could be asked of users when they sign up, but the inconvenience would dissuade them from trying the service.Mr. Gilbert added that proving identity with only minimal information is a problem, whatever form of communication is used to reach customer support. He said, “Even if they were standing right in front of us, it wouldn’t help.”THIS makes sorting out competing claims seem permanently hopeless, when, of course, this is not the case; it simply means that standard security questions will not suffice. But if Google were to use real people to sort out identity problems over the phone, the only remaining consideration would be the one that Google’s panel of experts didn’t mention in our talk: cost.Google says it has “tens of millions” of Gmail customers. (It declines to be more specific.) If it’s willing to consider phone support for account-access emergencies, it can take heart in the example of Netflix, which last year adopted phone support with enthusiasm, replacing online support completely. For all customers. For all problems. And without resorting to an offshore call center.It turns out that a staff of 375 customer service representatives are enough to handle calls from Netflix’s 8.4 million customers, answering most calls within a minute. Netflix says with justifiable pride that it has received the top ratings in online retail customer satisfaction by both Nielsen Online and ForeSee Results.A Netflix spokesman explained the complete switch to phone support: “Most people don’t need customer service,” he said, “but when they do, they want it now.”'"
"'08-10-05,'0','NAIROBI, Kenya — It was probably my 50th call. The line had always been busy. Or the phone had been shut off.But on Tuesday morning, someone actually picked up.Pirate p.r? Strange. Stranger still to be interviewing, via satellite, a band of seafaring thieves bobbing in the Indian Ocean 700 miles away from my table at a sidewalk cafe in Nairobi. These were the buccaneers who on Sept. 25 hijacked a Ukrainian freighter crammed with tanks and grenade launchers, and by last week had the world’s two most fearsome navies, the Russian and the American, breathing down their necks.Somali pirates may not go for eyeliner like Johnny Depp. But they seem almost as image conscious. In the 21st century, pirates have talking points, too.Like: “You only die once,” according to Sugule Ali, their official spokesman.Or: “We see people who dump waste in our waters. We see people who illegally fish in our waters. We see people doing all sorts of things in our waters.” Also Mr. Sugule.And: “They can’t catch us like goats.” Again Mr. Sugule, who I was told in no uncertain terms was the only pirate allowed to be quoted. Or else.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','For a time, that decision proved profitable. In the end, it nearly destroyed the company and threatened to drag down the housing market and the economy.Dozens of interviews, most from people who requested anonymity to avoid legal repercussions, offer an inside account of the critical juncture when Fannie Mae’s new chief executive, under pressure from Wall Street firms, Congress and company shareholders, took additional risks that pushed his company, and, in turn, a large part of the nation’s financial health, to the brink.Between 2005 and 2008, Fannie purchased or guaranteed at least $270 billion in loans to risky borrowers — more than three times as much as in all its earlier years combined, according to company filings and industry data.“We didn’t really know what we were buying,” said Marc Gott, a former director in Fannie’s loan servicing department. “This system was designed for plain vanilla loans, and we were trying to push chocolate sundaes through the gears.”Last month, the White House was forced to orchestrate a $200 billion rescue of Fannie and its corporate cousin, Freddie Mac. On Sept. 26, the companies disclosed that federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission were investigating potential accounting and governance problems.Mr. Mudd said in an interview that he responded as best he could given the company’s challenges, and worked to balance risks prudently.“Fannie Mae faced the danger that the market would pass us by,” he said. “We were afraid that lenders would be selling products we weren’t buying and Congress would feel like we weren’t fulfilling our mission. The market was changing, and it’s our job to buy loans, so we had to change as well.”When Mr. Mudd arrived at Fannie eight years ago, it was beginning a dramatic expansion that, at its peak, had it buying 40 percent of all domestic mortgages.Just two decades earlier, Fannie had been on the brink of bankruptcy. But chief executives like Franklin D. Raines and the chief financial officer J. Timothy Howard built it into a financial juggernaut by aiming at new markets.Fannie never actually made loans. It was essentially a mortgage insurance company, buying mortgages, keeping some but reselling most to investors and, for a fee, promising to pay off a loan if the borrower defaulted. The only real danger was that the company might guarantee questionable mortgages and lose out when large numbers of borrowers walked away from their obligations.So Fannie constructed a vast network of computer programs and mathematical formulas that analyzed its millions of daily transactions and ranked borrowers according to their risk.Those computer programs seemingly turned Fannie into a divining rod, capable of separating pools of similar-seeming borrowers into safe and risky bets. The riskier the loan, the more Fannie charged to handle it. In theory, those high fees would offset any losses.With that self-assurance, the company announced in 2000 that it would buy $2 trillion in loans from low-income, minority and risky borrowers by 2010.All this helped supercharge Fannie’s stock price and rewarded top executives with tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Raines received about $90 million between 1998 and 2004, while Mr. Howard was paid about $30.8 million, according to regulators. Mr. Mudd collected more than $10 million in his first four years at Fannie.Whenever competitors asked Congress to rein in the company, lawmakers were besieged with letters and phone calls from angry constituents, some orchestrated by Fannie itself. One automated phone call warned voters: “Your congressman is trying to make mortgages more expensive. Ask him why he opposes the American dream of home ownership.”The ripple effect of Fannie’s plunge into riskier lending was profound. Fannie’s stamp of approval made shunned borrowers and complex loans more acceptable to other lenders, particularly small and less sophisticated banks.Between 2001 and 2004, the overall subprime mortgage market — loans to the riskiest borrowers — grew from $160 billion to $540 billion, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. Communities were inundated with billboards and fliers from subprime companies offering to help almost anyone buy a home.Within a few years of Mr. Mudd’s arrival, Fannie was the most powerful mortgage company on earth.Then it began to crumble.Regulators, spurred by the revelation of a wide-ranging accounting fraud at Freddie, began scrutinizing Fannie’s books. In 2004 they accused Fannie of fraudulently concealing expenses to make its profits look bigger.Mr. Howard and Mr. Raines resigned. Mr. Mudd was quickly promoted to the top spot.But the company he inherited was becoming a shadow of its former self.Shortly after he became chief executive, Mr. Mudd traveled to the California offices of Angelo R. Mozilo, the head of Countrywide Financial, then the nation’s largest mortgage lender. Fannie had a longstanding and lucrative relationship with Countrywide, which sold more loans to Fannie than anyone else.But at that meeting, Mr. Mozilo, a butcher’s son who had almost single-handedly built Countrywide into a financial powerhouse, threatened to upend their partnership unless Fannie started buying Countrywide’s riskier loans.Mr. Mozilo, who did not return telephone calls seeking comment, told Mr. Mudd that Countrywide had other options. For example, Wall Street had recently jumped into the market for risky mortgages. Firms like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs had started bundling home loans and selling them to investors — bypassing Fannie and dealing with Countrywide directly.“You’re becoming irrelevant,” Mr. Mozilo told Mr. Mudd, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting who requested anonymity because the talks were confidential. In the previous year, Fannie had already lost 56 percent of its loan-reselling business to Wall Street and other competitors.“You need us more than we need you,” Mr. Mozilo said, “and if you don’t take these loans, you’ll find you can lose much more.”Investors were also pressuring Mr. Mudd to take greater risks.On one occasion, a hedge fund manager telephoned a senior Fannie executive to complain that the company was not taking enough gambles in chasing profits.“Are you stupid or blind?” the investor roared, according to someone who heard the call, but requested anonymity. “Your job is to make me money!”Capitol Hill bore down on Mr. Mudd as well. The same year he took the top position, regulators sharply increased Fannie’s affordable-housing goals. Democratic lawmakers demanded that the company buy more loans that had been made to low-income and minority homebuyers.“When homes are doubling in price in every six years and incomes are increasing by a mere one percent per year, Fannie’s mission is of paramount importance,” Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, lectured Mr. Mudd at a Congressional hearing in 2006. “In fact, Fannie and Freddie can do more, a lot more.”But Fannie’s computer systems could not fully analyze many of the risky loans that customers, investors and lawmakers wanted Mr. Mudd to buy. Many of them — like balloon-rate mortgages or mortgages that did not require paperwork — were so new that dangerous bets could not be identified, according to company executives.Even so, Fannie began buying huge numbers of riskier loans.In one meeting, according to two people present, Mr. Mudd told employees to “get aggressive on risk-taking, or get out of the company.”In the interview, Mr. Mudd said he did not recall that conversation and that he always stressed taking only prudent risks.Employees, however, say they got a different message.“Everybody understood that we were now buying loans that we would have previously rejected, and that the models were telling us that we were charging way too little,” said a former senior Fannie executive. “But our mandate was to stay relevant and to serve low-income borrowers. So that’s what we did.”Between 2005 and 2007, the company’s acquisitions of mortgages with down payments of less than 10 percent almost tripled. As the market for risky loans soared to $1 trillion, Fannie expanded in white-hot real estate areas like California and Florida.For two years, Mr. Mudd operated without a permanent chief risk officer to guard against unhealthy hazards. When Enrico Dallavecchia was hired for that position in 2006, he told Mr. Mudd that the company should be charging more to handle risky loans.In the following months to come, Mr. Dallavecchia warned that some markets were becoming overheated and argued that a housing bubble had formed, according to a person with knowledge of the conversations. But many of the warnings were rebuffed.Mr. Mudd told Mr. Dallavecchia that the market, shareholders and Congress all thought the companies should be taking more risks, not fewer, according to a person who observed the conversation. “Who am I supposed to fight with first?” Mr. Mudd asked.In the interview, Mr. Mudd said he never made those comments. Mr. Dallavecchia was among those whom Mr. Mudd forced out of the company during a reorganization in August.Mr. Mudd added that it was almost impossible during most of his tenure to see trouble on the horizon, because Fannie interacts with lenders rather than borrowers, which creates a delay in recognizing market conditions.He said Fannie sought to balance market demands prudently against internal standards, that executives always sought to avoid unwise risks, and that Fannie bought far fewer troublesome loans than many other financial institutions. Mr. Mudd said he heeded many warnings from his executives and that Fannie refused to buy many risky loans, regardless of outside pressures .“You’re dealing with massive amounts of information that flow in over months,” he said. “You almost never have an ‘Oh, my God’ moment. Even now, most of the loans we bought are doing fine.”But, of course, that moment of truth did arrive. In the middle of last year it became clear that millions of borrowers would stop paying their mortgages. For Fannie, this raised the terrifying prospect of paying billions of dollars to honor its guarantees.Had Fannie been a private entity, its comeuppance might have happened a year ago. But the White House, Wall Street and Capitol Hill were more concerned about the trillions of dollars in other loans that were poisoning financial institutions and banks.Lawmakers, particularly Democrats, leaned on Fannie and Freddie to buy and hold those troubled debts, hoping that removing them from the system would help the economy recover. The companies, eager to regain market share and buy what they thought were undervalued loans, rushed to comply.The White House also pitched in. James B. Lockhart, the chief regulator of Fannie and Freddie, adjusted the companies’ lending standards so they could purchase as much as $40 billion in new subprime loans. Some in Congress praised the move.“I’m not worried about Fannie and Freddie’s health, I’m worried that they won’t do enough to help out the economy,” the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said at the time. “That’s why I’ve supported them all these years — so that they can help at a time like this.”But earlier this year, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. grew concerned about Fannie’s and Freddie’s stability. He sent a deputy, Robert K. Steel, a former colleague from his time at Goldman Sachs, to speak with Mr. Mudd and his counterpart at Freddie.Mr. Steel’s orders, according to several people, were to get commitments from the companies to raise more money as a cushion against all the new loans. But when he met with the firms, Mr. Steel made few demands and seemed unfamiliar with Fannie’s and Freddie’s operations, according to someone who attended the discussions.Rather than getting firm commitments, Mr. Steel struck handshake deals without deadlines.That misstep would become obvious over the coming months. Although Fannie raised $7.4 billion, Freddie never raised any additional money.Mr. Steel, who left the Treasury Department over the summer to head Wachovia bank, disputed that he had failed in his handling of the companies, and said he was proud of his work .As the housing crisis worsened, Fannie and Freddie announced larger losses, and shares continued falling.In July, Mr. Paulson asked Congress for authority to take over Fannie and Freddie, though he said he hoped never to use it. “If you’ve got a bazooka and people know you’ve got it, you may not have to take it out,” he told Congress.Mr. Mudd called Treasury weekly. He offered to resign, to replace his board, to sell stock, and to raise debt. “We’ll sign in blood anything you want,” he told a Treasury official, according to someone with knowledge of the conversations.But, according to that person, Mr. Mudd told Treasury that those options would work only if government officials publicly clarified whether they intended to take over Fannie. Otherwise, potential investors would refuse to buy the stock for fear of being wiped out.“There were other options on the table short of a takeover,” Mr. Mudd said. But as long as Treasury refused to disclose its goals, it was impossible for the company to act, according to people close to Fannie.Then, last month, Mr. Mudd was instructed to report to Mr. Lockhart’s office. Mr. Paulson told Mr. Mudd that he could either agree to a takeover or have one forced upon him.“This is the right thing to do for the economy,” Mr. Paulson said, according to two people with knowledge of the talks. “We can’t take any more risks.”Freddie was given the same message. Less than 48 hours later, Mr. Lockhart and Mr. Paulson ended Fannie and Freddie’s independence, with up to $200 billion in taxpayer money to replenish the companies’ coffers.The move failed to stanch a spreading panic in the financial world. In fact, some analysts say, the takeover accelerated the hysteria by signaling that no company, no matter how large, was strong enough to withstand the losses stemming from troubled loans.Within weeks, Lehman Brothers was forced to declare bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch was pushed into the arms of Bank of America, and the government stepped in to bail out the insurance giant the American International Group.Today, Mr. Paulson is scrambling to carry out a $700 billion plan to bail out the financial sector, while Mr. Lockhart effectively runs Fannie and Freddie.Mr. Raines and Mr. Howard, who kept most of their millions, are living well. Mr. Raines has improved his golf game. Mr. Howard divides his time between large homes outside Washington and Cancun, Mexico, where his staff is learning how to cook American meals.But Mr. Mudd, who lost millions of dollars as the company’s stock declined and had his severance revoked after the company was seized, often travels to New York for job interviews. He recalled that one of his sons recently asked him why he had been fired.“Sometimes things don’t work out, no matter how hard you try,” he replied.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','The first 2008 presidential debate was held at the University of Mississippi. As part of the festivities, the university invited me to perform my pop-history monologue “Assume the Position.” I immediately agreed. Suddenly I was back in 1970.I was a sophomore at the University of Houston. That November, our underrated Cougars football team traveled to Oxford to play Ole Miss, a top-10 team aiming for a national championship behind a strong-armed quarterback named Archie Manning. The Cougars had beaten Ole Miss the previous two years, and Manning (along with the rest of the state) wanted revenge. A rabid fan, I, along with a few dormmates, decided to make the drive from Houston.It wasn’t as easy as it sounded.This was 1970. The heart of the hawk/dove Vietnam era. The year of the Kent State shootings. “Easy Rider” came out the previous year, and the images of driving in the Deep South with my bushy Jew-fro did not lend itself to a sense of serenity. I also had a typical East Coast “I’m right, you’re wrong” college attitude. Perhaps some of my confidence (arrogance?) had been learned from my freshman roommate, a surfer dude and art major named Julian Schnabel.Oh, there was one other thing. Houston was among the first major college programs in the South to allow black players. This was a fact of no small importance.For the most part, the ride to Oxford was uneventful. Once we got to Route 278, the two-lane road leading into the university, traffic came to a standstill. We suddenly found ourselves stuck inside a slowly moving parking lot among cars decked out in rebel colors. We were receiving disapproving glances caused, no doubt, by our Texas plates, along with our “Go Cougars” and “Make Love, Not War” bumper stickers.'"

"'08-10-05,'0','WHEN those attending the opening concert of the Westchester Philharmonic’s 2008-2009 season on Oct. 11 watch Leon Fleisher cross the stage, they will be seeing more than a piano virtuoso about to perform. They will be witnessing the result of decades of physical and emotional perseverance.In 1965, two fingers of Mr. Fleisher’s right hand became mysteriously immobilized; he was 37, and had already garnered international acclaim. After a brief period of despair, Mr. Fleisher recognized that his passion went beyond piano playing to the love of music.He became a conductor, making his New York debut at the 1970 Mostly Music Festival. He began teaching; he is a faculty member of the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore (where Mr. Fleisher now lives), the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. He mastered the left-hand-only piano literature, which he still performs.It wasn’t until 1991 that Mr. Fleisher, now 80, was given a diagnosis of focal dystonia, a neurological condition that he has learned to manage with a combination of Botox injections and Rolfing. Since 1995, he has been performing and recording with two hands. In 2000, he became the first living pianist to be inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame, and he received the 2007 Kennedy Center Honors.At Purchase, Mr. Fleisher will play Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5, popularly known as the “Emperor Concerto.” The orchestra will also perform Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7.The concert marks the debut of the renowned violinist Itzhak Perlman as the Westchester Philharmonic’s conductor. Mr. Fleisher and Mr. Perlman, who will serve three seasons as the orchestra’s artistic director, have performed together previously, but, said Mr. Fleisher, “I’ve never made music with Itzhak conducting.”As part of the Philharmonic’s Tuning Up preconcert series, ticketholders can attend a screening of “Two Hands,” a 17-minute documentary about Mr. Fleisher’s struggle. The film, directed by Nathaniel Kahn, was nominated for an Academy Award in 2007, and for a documentary Emmy Award this year. Upon learning about the screening, Mr. Fleisher said, “Now I have something to live up to.”'"
"'08-10-05,'0','“It’s real emotional to some people,” he said.In past downturns, cars have made up the bulk of what repo men picked up, and during this go-around, by wide margins, that trend has held, repossession officials said; indeed, 80 percent of Past Due’s repossessions are vehicles, Mr. Giordano said.But boats, which historically have been purchased by people who kept up their payments, are now being recovered, too, said Brad Ferguson, co-owner of Northeast Marine Liquidation, in Stonington, Conn.This year, his business, which focuses exclusively on watercraft, from Maryland to Maine, will seize about 250 boats, up from 200 last year, Mr. Ferguson said. It is the largest spike in 16 years for Mr. Ferguson, who has added three employees to handle the increase.Banks can pay up to $2,000 for each boat repossessed, especially if it is more than 30 feet long and requires fuel and a captain to move, and there are outstanding marina fees, Mr. Ferguson said. Cars, meanwhile, command about $400, though more if they are, say, partly buried in a fit of rebellion in someone’s backyard, industry officials said.But banks typically want to avoid repossessions, as the cars are usually worth less than what is owed, said Carol Kaplan, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, a trade group for commercial banks.The costs of repo men and the paperwork to transfer ownership of the vehicle are additional disincentives, she added.“Nobody gains but the repo guy,” Ms. Kaplan said.But auto repossessions show no signs of flagging. In 2007, 2.15 out of every 1,000 cars with outstanding indirect auto loans — which are the kind offered by dealers and which make up 90 percent of all auto loans — were repossessed each month, according to the bankers association. That is up from 1.82 cars per 1,000 outstanding loans in 2006.“And until the jobs picture improves, we will not see consumer delinquencies improve,” said James Chessen, chief economist with the association.Banks, then, are being more flexible about repayment schedules, letting buyers postpone payments for a few months without penalty and lowering interest rates on their loans, he said.But banks’ efforts do not seem to be stemming the repossession tide yet, said Michael Gouldsbury, owner of East End Asset Management, in Center Moriches in Suffolk County.In fact, buyers seem more resigned about losing their cars than ever. Voluntary surrenders, when people willingly hand over the keys, now account for 45 percent of all of Mr. Gouldsbury’s repossessions, compared with 30 percent last year.Plus, the number of cars that are ultimately redeemed — when owners pay their past-due payments plus fees to get their vehicles back — has sharply decreased; three years ago, owners redeemed about 45 percent of their cars, versus 15 percent today, Mr. Gouldsbury said.“People are realizing that there’s no light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.The recent increase in work notwithstanding, many repo men and women complain that it is getting tougher to do their job.High fuel costs are taking a toll, especially when tracking down one vehicle may require a dozen trips, they said.Burnout is high, too, as worries about safety win out, said Robert McCrie, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. Since 1986, about 25 of his students have worked as repo men after graduating, though many lasted only a few years, he said.“They had a feeling that one day their luck might run out in the event they can’t outrun this hostile delinquent debtor,” Mr. McCrie said.Plus, in today’s market, competitors — often inexperienced — are flooding the field, industry veterans say. Thrusting relative amateurs into a potentially dangerous line of work often presents problems in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, where the industry is unregulated, they said.The law says that cars can be repossessed only if there is no breach of peace, like breaking into a garage. To make sure newcomers operate within the law, some police departments are encouraging repo men to share more information.In New York, where repossessions are supposed to be reported in person at the local precinct after the fact, the Village of Westbury and the City of White Plains are asking repo men to tell them before any seizure. The rationale is to cut down on unnecessary emergency calls to people’s homes, in the event the owner reports the car stolen, officials said.“It helps with the appropriate use of resources,” said Capt. Frank Cariello, a spokesman for the Yonkers Police Department, which since 2004 has requested that repo men check in by radio before hauling cars away.“It saves some time and increases safety of everybody involved,” he said.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','The mall entrance is off Commack Road, about three miles south of the Long Island Expressway. That stretch of road is primarily a single lane in each direction. Other access points are located on the Sagtikos State Parkway and the Southern State Parkway.“By the developers’ own admissions, the project will bring almost 3,000 cars per peak hour,” said James W. Ptucha, vice president of the civic association. “Certainly that is a lot of cars to bring to any area, but what makes this problem so acute is the location.”The mall, scheduled to open Oct. 23, will bring in new tax revenue, he said, but not enough to compensate for the traffic problems. The developers are getting a 10-year tax abatement, after which the Town of Babylon projects $10.9 million in property tax revenue in 2019.William Hillman, chief engineer of the Suffolk County Department of Public Works, said that the county, the Town of Babylon and the state all took part in a traffic review but “couldn’t agree on how they thought traffic would go to the location.” The project “definitely will have an impact on traffic,” he said, “but I don’t think the dire predictions from the community will be realized.”Mr. Hillman said that once the mall is completed, within the next two years, the developers would be required to conduct a six-month study to assess the original assumptions about traffic. If changes are needed, the developers will have to make them, he said.The population is large enough that there should be no shortage of cars on the roads. Mr. Blumenfeld said there were 350,000 residents within a mile of the mall. That puts the Arches in a more densely populated area than the operation in Riverhead, a 169-store manufacturers’ outlet center that opened in 1994.Both shopping centers are built on 800,000 square feet and have a comparable amount of parking — about 4,700 spaces — but the similarities end there.Tanger Factory Outlet is strictly a manufacturers’ outlet center with food courts, while the Arches will have not only outlet stores but also a full-price Old Navy, restaurants (Johnny Rockets, Nathan’s, and Chipotle, a Mexican eatery), the theaters showing first-run movies and the health club.Ms. Nebons said that the Arches, a $300 million project, would open with 30 to 40 stores and that the developers hoped to have the mall finished and all 60 establishments open by the end of 2009. Its anchor stores will be the Neiman Marcus Last Call Clearance Center, with designer merchandise previously stocked in its full-price stores and selling for 30 to 65 percent off; and the Christmas Tree Shops, a bargain-price retailer of home décor, giftware, housewares and seasonal products.Mr. Blumenfeld said that because the new mall is closer to the population than most outlet centers, it “needs to act as a regional mall as well as an outlet mall.” He noted that the nearest existing malls — the Walt Whitman Mall in Huntington and the South Shore Mall in Bay Shore — are 12 to 15 miles away.Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island’s largest business group, said discount stores do better than full-price stores during hard economic times.“Wal-Mart stores are doing well, and all discounters are doing well,” Dr. Kamer said. “People who do not normally go to Riverhead will go to Deer Park. Whether they will buy as much as they would have a few years ago is hard to predict, but we see that shoppers are cutting back.” The entertainment features should help, she said.Tanger said in a statement that the mall’s 18-month construction was expected to create 2,000 construction jobs generating $97 million in wages. The Arches are expected to create 1,500 permanent jobs, Ms. Nebons said.Steven C. Bellone, the Babylon Town supervisor, said that the most important aspect of the Arches’ opening was the huge injection of property tax revenue the mall would provide, removing some of the burden of local property taxes, fire and school and town taxes, from residents.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','Chase situated the corrupt center of his “Sopranos” world in Gandolfini — a once-handsome actor with a menacing frame and porcine eyes who confessed many times in interviews that he felt rotten after playing violent scenes. What did that matter to Chase? He designed sicker and sicker scenes of violence for Gandolfini; he shot the actor to look increasingly hideous. Gandolfini got fat. He publicly despaired at the depravity of the character. But Chase never stopped riding him, and something in their twisted relationship produced the performance that defined the show, gave it unity and coherence and made it art.Can the lead actors today duplicate Gandolfini’s accomplishment? On television shows, much more than on movie sets, lead actors determine the working atmosphere. They work grueling medical-resident hours — often 14 hours on, and with 12 off, according to union rules — and are on camera seemingly nonstop. Most dramatic leads, faltering under the pressure, rely on a caricature or revert to being versions of their actual selves. Gandolfini never did, always returning to Tony, a figure he loathed, again and again, as to true north, over eight years.Glenn Close can do this. I spoke to her last summer before “Damages,” in which she plays a ruthless and murderous trial lawyer named Patty Hewes, had its premiere. As a longtime film and stage actress, she was wary of taking on a series, she said, because she would have to play Hewes longer than she had ever played a movie or stage part. As the plots, cast and crew came and went, she would have to find and seize hold of the merciless Hewes character. The first season of “Damages” proved she could do it. Like Gandolfini, she’s never resting. If she’s not entirely in control of a scene — if it’s someone else’s turn, say — she’s still Hewes, brooding, mollifying, strategizing, concealing wretched grief.It’s Jon Hamm I worry about. The star of “Mad Men,” Hamm is a swoon-inducing, physically graceful actor — a through-and-through Hollywood person, without much training in New York’s Method-derived acting styles. As he remembered it in a panel discussion in January, the first scene he shot of “Mad Men,” in which he plays the evasive and cruel Don Draper, required a flurry of stage business. Cigarettes had to be lighted, rooms had to be crossed, shirts had to be changed, ties tied. Hamm says he struggled with this manual ballet, but anyone who saw the first season of “Mad Men” can testify that he made it look natural. And not only natural but also intensely expressive: Hamm in the first “Mad Men” season made midcentury pantomine both nervous and beautiful, elegant actions that sublimated Draper’s anarchic energies.But this season, the Draper character is losing his touch, and the part doesn’t require so much dexterity. Draper loses control of his car and his reputation; he shows less Rat Pack finesse. The camera seems mad at Draper, and it gives him long, stung looks, during which he has almost nothing to do but be. Sometimes these are cutaways from when another character is dressing him down, flattering him or exposing him. Sometimes they are close-ups on moments of self-doubt. But Hamm, the actor, does not seem to like the silence, and he has a hard time staying steady as Don in the quiet interludes.At these times, an incongruous vulnerability presents itself in the reptilian Draper. Accidentally, Hamm seems to flash on an exaggerated look of melancholy or distance — as if the actor were thinking, I don’t want to be this man. Perhaps Hamm, like many Hollywood stars, wants to be liked above all, and Draper is written as less likable in nearly every episode. If the show is to mature and last, Hamm will have to risk being hated.During the first season, Hamm told an interviewer: “You’re kind of getting your hair slicked back and looking sharp and kind of button yourself into those suits. You combine that with how detailed and letter-perfect our set is, and it’s really, kind of, a lot of the work is done for you.”Now this may be modesty from a debonair actor who wants to defuse intimidation and spread the credit. But a megamovie is not a sitcom, or even a multipart Tony Kushner play. Playing the lead in a “Sopranos”-like series is extremely rigorous work. If ever there were an occasion for frank thespianism, this is it. The lead must be consistent, subtle, physically strong and willing to defer to the often-capricious auteurs that run these things. Is Hamm up to it? “Mad Men” is my favorite show on television, and I’m hoping so.MEGATELEVISION: I can only push ‘‘Mad Men’’ so hard, but please know it’s on iTunes as well as DVD. ‘‘Damages’’ is another great, freaky show. It’s back on FX in 2009. In the meantime, polish off the first season, which pits Glenn Close against Ted Danson, on DVD. At Amazon. Others worth giving whole fall weekends to: “In Treatment,” starring Gabriel Byrne; ‘‘The Shield,’’ starring Michael Chiklis; and ‘‘Rescue Me,’’ starring Denis Leary. What do you need with films in theaters — or as I call them, minimovies?WHY DON’T YOU JUST TRY ACTING?: ‘‘SanfordMeisner on Acting,’’ written by Meisner and Dennis Longwell, may not make you James Gandolfini, but it might move you closer. Better than reading Sun Tzu and trying to be Tony Soprano. Gandolfini says acting is ‘‘making a fool of yourself.’’ If he’s willing to do it, you might try it, too.YOUR FAVORITE CURSE WORD: James Lipton plays superciliousness better than any actor on television. The miracle of ‘‘Inside the Actors Studio’’ is that his silly, puffed-up style generates fascinating effects in his scene partners — the actors he sits down with. He’s like Charlie Rose that way. Don’t dismiss him. Instead, check out hefty clips from ‘‘Inside the Actors Studio’’ at bravotv.com.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','At the unregulated Bank of Linguistics, there’s been a run on toxic.Headline in The Sunday Times (in London): “Henry Paulson buries U.S. Toxic Debt,” with the lead describing the Treasury secretary’s task as “to save the American economy by drawing out the toxic waste that is threatening to destroy it.”A reader in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was curious about such toxicity: “As I understand it, the ‘toxic’ debt I backed by property, but not to the value of the debt at the moment.” If the property value rises next year, however, “at which point it will become nontoxic. Or am I missing something?”The Financial Times did not miss the bubble in the frequency of toxic in its pages: over the past three years, the adjective appeared about five times a week about toxic slicks on rivers and toxic food spiked with industrial methanol, but at the end of September, the number ballooned to 69 times in one week — driven by toxic loans. Usage of the previously popular subprime is sinking because the word is not scary enough; toxic has taken over.The French word toxique means “poison,” from the Greek toxicon, “poison for arrows.” In his 1674 Glossographia, Thomas Blount treated it as an English adjective meaning “venomous, poisonous.” But “venomous” is most often used to describe the danger in snakes like rattlers. “Poisonous” — with that skull and crossbones on the iodine label — lost some of its fearsomeness as a financial adjective in “poison pill.” Hence the newly favored toxic, though Secretary Paulson at first preferred the longer but less panicky “illiquid assets clogging the financial system.” He later called the proposed fund “the troubled asset relief program”; Gretchen Morgenson of The Times acronymed that TARP, “the kind of thing they spread over muddy fields so you don’t spoil your Guccis,” but I doubt if Paulson’s name will fly because “relief” was the predecessor word in politics to “welfare.”Time now to put up the dukes of moral hazard: readers of this column were prepared months ago to deal with the pejorative term bailout, a nautical and parachuting term that you will recall was given a financial twist by a Securities and Exchange Commission official in 1940. It means “a method of averting ruin” but has gained a sneering sense of “shoveling taxpayer dollars into a private or municipal enterprise whose failure would supposedly bring about bread lines or at least a troubling downturn.”'"
"'08-10-05,'0','Marriott’s Renaissance brand is the big chain’s attempt to grab the boutique traveler. But can Marriott do hip? As evidence, the company offers this sleek, nautically themed location, which opened in February. On a recent weekend the crowd was mostly a mix of convention-badge business people and families. So the jury’s still out on the cool front. But the helpful, attentive staff has nice nailed. In town for a family wedding and with a crowd in tow, I had booked two rooms and asked for early check-in. The rooms weren’t ready when we arrived before noon, but the front desk clerk offered to call as soon as they were cleaned. At 12:18, as we were standing in line for tickets to the aquarium, my cellphone rang; anytime we were ready, so were the rooms. Twice I saw bellmen chasing after guests who’d forgotten items in the lobby. Answering the phones “delighted to serve”— the Renaissance trademark greeting — might be a bit much, though.In the South Boston Waterfront area, hard by the Fish Pier and the new Institute of Contemporary Art. The Convention Center and the World Trade Center are a stone’s throw away; so are vast parking lots waiting to be redeveloped, which can make the hotel feel marooned. The World Trade Center T station is a short walk, but getting to major tourist destinations can take multiple stops.Our fifth-floor rooms didn’t have much of a view — they both overlooked a deserted patio outside the hotel fitness center. But they were bright and comfortable. The desk, with a plug-in technology panel, was big enough to work at, and it came with a sleek Keilhauer desk chair. In addition to the flat-screen TV, there was an iHome dock for our iPod(s). The bathrooms could offer brighter task lighting. And a real boutique would have fluffy robes, wouldn’t it?Our wedding invitation didn’t include children, so they stayed behind and ordered in dinner. The kitchen warned that the food, ordered at 6:13 p.m., might take as much as 45 minutes to arrive, but it was there in 17. The kids pronounced the crispy fried chicken fingers with fries and chocolate pudding ($8) “excellent.” More adult offerings include a dry aged sirloin steak ($32) and local scallops with mushrooms, potatoes and spiced vinaigrette ($26).The lap pool (open from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.) disappointed the children in our group, who wanted something bigger; serious swimmers might be equally upset to have to do battle with kids. The adjoining fitness center with treadmills and elliptical machines is open 24 hours a day. In addition to 606 Congress, the hotel’s “modern American” restaurant, there’s a Starbucks in the lobby and 24-hour room service. Wired and wireless Internet are available for $12.95 or $16.95 a day, depending on access speed.If you’re in town for a convention or to do business in South Boston, the Renaissance would be a no-brainer — convenient, with high-end tech toys and a friendly, helpful staff. (Plus, an early run on the nearby Harborwalk is a delight. You can say hello to the seals outside the aquarium before turning around to come home.) For families or those looking for a classic Boston scene, the out-of-the way location may override the positives. Doubles run from $199 to $499.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','CALLING your town Truth or Consequences is pretty much a cry for attention, which is what the small resort in southern New Mexico wanted in 1950 when it changed its name from Hot Springs to the title of the popular game show.The town even named a park after Ralph Edwards, who hosted the show on radio and in its early years on TV. And the Geronimo Springs Museum (211 Main Street; 505-894-6600; www.geronimospringsmuseum.com) has a room devoted to Mr. Edwards, who attended the Truth or Consequences Fiesta 50 years in a row.But it’s the excitement over Spaceport America, the world’s first commercial spaceport, which hopes to open in 2010, that’s recharged the mojo. Since the announcement that Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic spaceships would launch from the desert nearby — space rides will start at $200,000 — property values have soared, hotels have received makeovers, a handful of galleries have opened and an Italian restaurant has come to town.Yet there’s still nothing fancy about the sun-baked hodgepodge of bungalows, mobile homes and ranch-style houses sprawled around the tiny downtown. The community is between a stretch of highway and the Rio Grande and is bordered by mountains and desert that’s mostly part of Ted Turner’s 358,643-acre Armendaris Ranch.The stark beauty and quirky local vibe are catnip for stubborn individualists; the most famous resident is the painter Delmas Howe, perhaps best known for his homoerotic cowboy paintings and a series of tableaux combining racy 1970s gay life with the Stations of the Cross.'"

"'08-10-05,'0','On a sweltering day in June, on her side of the makeshift wall, Chana Taub sat at the kitchen table, two fans spinning ineffectively nearby. She was wearing a long-sleeved, high-necked blouse, a blond wig, thick stockings and a long skirt, obligations of an Orthodox woman. She said that a week earlier she extracted a promise from Simon’s attorney that Simon would finally turn on the central air-conditioning, but the switch, which was apparently on his side of the wall, remained off. Twice, Chana said, she faxed emergency pleas to the judge handling their divorce after the temperature in the house climbed to triple digits, but she received no response.‘‘All he has to do is turn on the switch, but he’s cruel and sadistic,’’ Chana said. ‘‘He’s behind the wall, controlling everything.’’Chana is a small, soft-spoken woman of 59 who sees Simon’s reach everywhere. She is convinced that he is wiretapping her telephone and that he has snaked surveillance wires to the bathroom skylight to spy on her. She is sure he is responsible for the dead bird she found on her doorstep, the live mouse she found in her kitchen, the raccoon that dug into her roof.Simon looms large in conversations between Chana and her staunchest supporters: her twin sister, Esther Newhouse, and Susan Titus Glascoff, a self-described freelance public advocate who contends that the court system is driven by money, not justice. On that June day, Newhouse and Glascoff sat beside Chana at her kitchen table, spinning theories on why so few court decisions have gone Chana’s way. They were convinced that Simon had paid off the judges, the police, the building department and even attorneys Chana had since fired. They were sure he had paid off the jurors who concluded unanimously that Chana had no reason to fear for her safety and thus had no grounds for divorce. The sole evidence the women had for these conspiracies seemed to be that no other explanation sufficed. They even hired a private detective to press the jurors after the trial about possible corruption, though none admitted to being bribed. Glascoff lowered her voice: ‘‘I wouldn’t be surprised if that detective was paid off too.’’Chana originally filed for divorce in 2005, citing Simon’s ‘‘cruel and inhuman’’ behavior — a characterization Simon contested with his customary bluster. Those grounds are extraordinarily hard to prove in New York, which is why most divorcing couples choose ‘‘constructive abandonment’’: that one spouse has refused sex for more than a year. Those grounds are the simplest to prove, even if not germane or even true. Chana refiled, eventually choosing that easier path. Simon did not contest these grounds, though he did make his agreement conditional on one thing: that she give back his bed, which she has yet to do.Settling the division of their assets has proved even harder than getting a divorce judgment. The commercial and residential buildings that provide much of their income; the couple’s summer house in Monsey, N.Y.; some of Simon’s jewelry; and, of course, the bed, are all in dispute. On one level, the Borough Park house is just one of the many possessions neither spouse wants to relinquish. But on another, it seems to be something deeper: the site of a last stand.From the kitchen, Chana can see across the hall to the plywood wall — unpainted and roughly sawed — that divides her from Simon on the second floor of their house. One floor below, the division is a patchwork of Sheetrock abutting the spiral staircase, blocking what was once the path to the garage. Now the only way for Chana to get to her car from inside the house is to crouch down and shuffle under the staircase.Despite these inconveniences, Chana refuses to give up the house, in part, she says, because it feels like the only tangible possession she has, now that everything else seems to be slipping away.With the marital assets still in flux and with no job or independent income since marrying Simon, she has borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars from her sister Esther. She has also accepted food from the local Jewish food pantry, which rankles her. She was, after all, accustomed to something far different: a new luxury car every few years, a household staff, the ease of a monied life.‘‘When someone falls from a lower level, they get hurt, but when someone falls from a higher level, they get hurt much worse,’’ Chana says. ‘‘I used to give charity, and now I have to take from charity, and it hurts me. When my children needed shoes, I used to give them the best shoes, the most comfortable and finest shoes, not look for bargains. It’s not that I caused it. He caused it, and he needs to be punished, not me.’’Simon and Chana Taub were introduced by a fellow Orthodox Jew, a used-car salesman who, after selling Chana an aging Oldsmobile sedan, asked if she was by chance looking for a husband. She was. A divorced mother of two, she worked as a secretary at a yeshiva and stretched to make the rent for her small apartment.Simon was divorced, too, with two daughters living a few miles away. The first time Simon called on Chana, he took her for a ride in his Cadillac and then to the finest kosher restaurant in the city, a French place in Midtown Manhattan swathed in red velvet.A few months later, they agreed to marry. As they tell it now, their pairing was far from romantic. Both were in their mid-30s, and the match seemed workable enough. ‘‘I was looking for someone educated, and I wanted someone who made a good living,’’ Chana said. ‘‘I wasn’t looking for someone extra-special.’’ Neither, apparently, was Simon: ‘‘I thought in the beginning that she was a quiet person who wouldn’t make arguments, and when I was dating, quiet meant a lot to me. Whatever I said, she said, ‘O.K.’ ’’They married in December 1984 and rented an apartment in Borough Park with a bedroom so small that their furniture barely fit. Simon told Chana not to worry; he was going to build them a house so big their future children would never disturb the neighbors.Soon after, the Taubs found a large property, a corner lot on 14th Avenue and 49th Street, which they bought for $350,000. They gutted the existing house and office, spending more than $1 million on renovations.When Chana was pregnant with the couple’s third child, they were finally able to move into their new house. They hired (according to Simon) a full-time cook, a nanny and a live-in maid. These were privileges Simon had never known as a boy. He was one of seven children of Holocaust survivors who had moved from Europe to Israel to Brooklyn in search of a better life. That life remained elusive for Simon’s parents, but Simon did well, eventually owning a thriving knitwear factory in Brooklyn with at least 300 employees.By the time the house was built, Simon Taub was a multimillionaire. But he remembered his parents’ financial struggles and vowed to open his house to the poor as a way of fulfilling the Jewish obligation to serve the needy. The Taubs embraced their duty with gusto, spreading word that their new home was open on Shabbos to any man in the religious community who needed a warm meal. And so, each Friday evening and Saturday afternoon, 25 to 30 men would settle in at long tables in the kitchen or on the enclosed porch, filling up with soup, fish, stew, chopped liver and pie. The Taubs and their children would sit among them, and, together, they would eat and sing and pray.For a while, it appeared that Simon Taub’s money would never stop flowing. When the Taubs decided their large home wasn’t large enough, they rented their next-door neighbor’s first-floor apartment and opened a door in the wall, integrating into their house two more bedrooms, a bathroom and a second kitchen to deal with the overflow demands of the Shabbos meal.But in 1997, as competition from Chinese manufacturers intensified, Simon’s company filed for bankruptcy. By 2003, it closed its doors — none of which he told Chana, fearing, he now says, that she would divorce him if the money dried up. So unbeknown to her, they lived mostly on income from their commercial and residential properties — some of which he owned before their marriage and some of which he, like many businessmen, had put in his wife’s name to keep from potential creditors. Only in 2005, after he’d had a heart attack, he said in divorce papers, did he tell Chana of the stress he’d been under.Chana and their children would later testify that Simon had become increasingly testy during those last few years. When Chana was home, they said, he was angry she wasn’t out doing his errands. When she was out, he was angry she wasn’t home. When the Shabbos stew was too watery for his taste, they said, he shoved his bowl to the floor. He threw pots of food off the stove and Chana’s plants out the window. He heaved Chana’s books, vases and mail into the trash and covered them with dirt so she couldn’t salvage them. The children testified that their father, a heavy-set man, treated their mother like a slave, ordering her to put his shoes and socks on every morning. None of the children ever saw him hit her, but they testified that he threw a Rolodex and a dollhouse toward her, though they missed. Simon has more favorable interpretations of these events; for example, he says he threw away only mail that was many years old and only with Chana’s permission. Nonsense, Chana says: ‘‘It wasn’t a marriage. It was a terror.’’In 2005, Chana won an order of protection that included banning Simon from the house. But Simon pressed the court to let him move back, saying that living at his sister’s house taxed his health. At the time, he expressed shock at Chana’s claims, saying that he had always treated her ‘‘like a queen,’’ taking her to high-class restaurants and providing her with a full-time staff of three. ‘‘My wife was therefore never a slave but instead had people tending to her every need.’’It was Simon who proposed dividing the house with a makeshift wall, each side with its own first-floor entrance, a proposal that he hoped would allow him to move back in without breaching the order of protection. Chana and three of their children would get the whole third floor — five bedrooms and two bathrooms. They would get the huge kitchen, bathroom and enclosed porch on the second floor, and the library and indoor garage on the first. Simon and their youngest son, then 14 and preferring to live with his father, would keep the dining room on the second floor and the living room, bathroom and second garage on the ground level. The judge agreed to Simon’s Solomonic plan. Chana hated it, but her appeals failed.And so, in December 2006, Simon waved in workers to erect the patchwork divider, as neighbors gathered outside to watch. Chana installed a $2,000 alarm system on her side of the partition. And in the corner where the wall met her front door, she taped an excerpt from Genesis in which angels blind the wicked Sodomites trying to break into a house to harm the innocent family inside.The wall, however, did not diminish the hostility between the Taubs; in fact, it seemed to inflame it. Lawsuits began sprouting out of Taub v. Taub like weeds in an abandoned lot. One of Chana’s daughters from her previous marriage sued her mother for $12.5 million, accusing her of slander and libel; Chana’s divorce claim, she asserted, accused her and Simon of sleeping together. One month after describing their marriage as idyllic, Simon filed his own divorce case, saying that Chana had yelled at him in front of the children, barred him from the home and taken his cash, his Piaget wristwatch and his diamond cuff links. He soon dropped that case, then sued her for malicious prosecution and inflicting emotional distress. Even Simon’s siblings suddenly found reasons to sue Chana.Simon and his son seemed to spend most of their time in an apartment the Taubs owned two doors away, and they appeared to use his side of the family home like an extended wing, mostly to accommodate company. Chana, though, claimed he used it like a battle trench, turning off her heat in the winter and her air-conditioning in the summer, despite a court order not to interfere with the utilities.At one point, even the exasperated judge questioned the wisdom of their arrangement. ‘‘They’re going to kill each other,’’ Judge Carolyn E. Demarest said. ‘‘Maybe not literally, but figuratively, as they keep battling it out.’’ She suggested that Simon live only in the apartment and leave the whole house to Chana. He refused.‘‘She had for years a luxury life in a mansion with Lexuses and Cadillacs and with a maid, a cook and a nanny, with jewelry and a mink coat and a leather coat,’’ Simon says now. ‘‘She has to accept that after she gets divorced, she’s not Mrs. Taub anymore, and that, she cannot accept. She would like to be Mrs. Taub without Mr. Taub, but with all of his money. It doesn’t work. It doesn’t go like this.’’When the judge agreed to divide the Taubs’ house in two, the media found their feud irresistible. The New York City tabloids dubbed it ‘‘the real-life War of the Roses.’’ Their case reached far-flung audiences, showing up on the BBC, on ‘‘Dr. Phil’’ and on a news feed for members of the Mormon Church.The Taubs, of course, are not the only divorcing couple to use real estate as a proxy for their relationship and a weapon in their fight. Two years ago, a Manhattan physician was so determined to keep his wife from acquiring their four-story town house that he blew up the house and himself. Although divorce disputes are rarely that extreme, the stories resonate because the underlying emotions can be so uncomfortably familiar: stubbornness, righteous anger and the blinding hatred of betrayal.Both Simon and Chana say they want to live in the house on 14th Avenue simply because they love it. And maybe that’s so. But given their powerful desire to deny the house to the other, it’s hard not to suspect that they have other motives. A house is often a couple’s most valuable possession. But a house is not merely a financial asset. It is a place of security, a repository of memories, a witness to all that happens, good and ill. For all those reasons, it is nearly always a potent weapon when a marriage ends.‘‘Divorce is like death,’’ says Adria S. Hillman, a Manhattan lawyer who has been handling breakups since 1971. ‘‘You go through stages of bitterness and sadness, and you need to move on. But it’s hard to give up the relationship, even if it’s a bad one and even if you want to give it up. I had a client who shared a vacation home with his soon-to-be-ex-wife, and on the weekends he had the house, he would plant little plants in the garden, and on the weekends she had the house, she would rip up the plants. It wasn’t about the plants. It was a way to communicate hostility.’’Combined, the Taubs have already spent nearly $2 million on their various lawsuits, and most of their cases are only just starting. ‘‘There will come a point where . . . the equitable distribution will dissolve among itself,’’ Judge Demarest predicted in court. ‘‘There won’t be anything to split up.’’One of the many points of contention is a mortgage Chana took out on their Brooklyn home to pay her divorce attorney, despite a court order not to encumber the property. Chana maintains that she wasn’t served with the order until later. In any case, instead of owing $270,000 at 6.1 percent, they now owe $650,000 at an adjustable rate that can exceed 11 percent. Simon has refused to pay the mortgage on principle.As a result, last summer, foreclosure papers were filed on the Brooklyn house, and the Taubs’ summer house was put up for sale by court order, following foreclosure there. But nearly a year later, on the day the summer house was to be sold, Chana filed for bankruptcy, temporarily staying the sale of either home. And so negotiations over the divorce are once again on hold.Simon — who until recently said he would never let go of the house — now says he’s willing to let it slip away. He is resolute about one thing only: ‘‘This house will be sold or I will live in it,’’ Simon said. ‘‘It doesn’t matter if I spend $10 million. She will not live in that house.’’Shabbos at Chana’s is now an intimate affair. Her younger daughter from her first marriage comes over with her five kids, joining Chana and the three children who live with her for a quiet meal and a few rounds of dominoes or Monopoly.On his side of the wall, Simon continues his Shabbos tradition of feeding the poor. Fewer men show up these days, but the meal is just as lavish. Simon hires a woman to cook all day Thursday in the apartment two doors over and all day Friday to make salads and prepare the table. She returns Saturday after the guests leave to clean up the dirty plates, soiled tablecloths and crumb-covered floor.With the large kitchen and enclosed porch now off limits to him, Simon presides over the meal in the ornate dining room, with its upholstered walls and gilded china cabinets. On a warm Saturday in June, with the air-conditioning on full blast, Simon sat at the head of the table of eight. He was in his element, the master of his domain. He ordered his guests to get up and bring him spoons, give him plates, put down the wine. Simon’s youngest son worked steadily to carry in each course.Simon ladled out generous portions for each guest. As they ate heartily, they talked over one another in a loud, chummy camaraderie, sparring over religious and scholarly questions, this one citing the 11th-century Jewish scholar Rashi, that one interrupting with the wisdom of the 13th-century philosopher Ramban. One man at the end slept, his chin bouncing slowly off his chest as he snored. The voices of the others rose as they disagreed; every time, Simon’s was the loudest. From the other side of the wall floated the sound of children laughing. No one seemed to notice.'"
"'08-10-05,'0','The Guard has a dual federal-state role. While on state missions, Guard units report to the governor, but on a federal mission, they report to the president.The 106th Rescue Wing will embark on its third deployment to Afghanistan next year.Troops from the Army Guard’s 69th Infantry unit, based in Huntington, Bay Shore and Patchogue, are already in eastern and southeastern Afghanistan. Those troops, rifle companies and support elements of the 1st Battalion left in March, said Colonel Goldenberg, and are expected to return to Long Island in January.In all, about 250 Army National Guard troops from Nassau and Suffolk Counties are in Iraq. They left in the spring and fall and are slated to return in March or June of next year.Those troops include a detachment of the 133rd Quartermaster Company based in Riverhead, which oversees the warehousing, inventory and issuance of bulk supplies. Elements of the 3rd Battalion, 142nd Aviation Unit at Ronkonkoma, which fly UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters for Army combat support and service missions to move troops, equipment and supplies, are also in Iraq.Many members of local Guard units are in their second or third tour of duty, said Chief Warrant Officer Richard Siracusano, who is commander of the Army’s aviation support facility at MacArthur Airport and was in Iraq himself from 2004 to 2005. “I know I’m going back,” he said.Colonel Cline said that in 2005, the 106th Rescue Wing took part in rescue efforts for 10 days after Hurricane Katrina and rescued 161 people including a man who painted “please help” on his roof.The unit, celebrating its 100th anniversary this year as the country’s oldest Air National Guard Aviation unit, was recently in Texas and Louisiana to help with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. It flies six Pavehawk helicopters, which can be refueled in the air.Long Island National Guard units have responded in recent years to local community support missions including air-lifting of derelict vehicles from Suffolk wetlands and watershed areas and wildlife and land preserves. The National Guard also responded to the TWA Flight 800 explosion in 1996, the Pine Barren wildfires during the 1990s, ice storms in upstate New York, Catskill wildfires in the early 2000s and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and supports the NASA shuttle flights and other missions. The 106th Rescue unit maintains a landing strip at Gabreski Airport for emergency NASA landings, and has an air crew on hand in Florida and New York during shuttle launches.Federal missions by Long Island Guard units have included not only tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also humanitarian missions in Central and South America and peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo, Mr. Siracusano, the chief warrant officer, said.He said that Guardsmen and Guardswomen on Long Island come from all walks of life.“We have lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, cops, nurses, bankers, teachers,” Mr. Siracusano said. “You name it — they’re a member of the Guard.”Recruiting new members is one of the most difficult challenges now, Colonel Cline said. But “it’s a good mission,” she said, “because we’re saving lives.”'"

"'08-10-06,'1','Following are excerpts from John McCain's remarks as prepared for delivery today in Albuquerque, New Mexico:My opponent has invited serious questioning by announcing a few weeks ago that he would quote -- “take off the gloves.” Since then, whenever I have questioned his policies or his record, he has called me a liar.Rather than answer his critics, Senator Obama will try to distract you from noticing that he never answers the serious and legitimate questions he has been asked. But let me reply in the plainest terms I know. I don’t need lessons about telling the truth to American people. And were I ever to need any improvement in that regard, I probably wouldn’t seek advice from a Chicago politician.My opponent’s touchiness every time he is questioned about his record should make us only more concerned. For a guy who’s already authored two memoirs, he’s not exactly an open book. It’s as if somehow the usual rules don’t apply, and where other candidates have to explain themselves and their records, Senator Obama seems to think he is above all that. Whatever the question, whatever the issue, there’s always a back story with Senator Obama. All people want to know is: What has this man ever actually accomplished in government? What does he plan for America? In short: Who is the real Barack Obama? But ask such questions and all you get in response is another barrage of angry insults.Our current economic crisis is a good case in point. What was his actual record in the years before the great economic crisis of our lifetimes?This crisis started in our housing market in the form of subprime loans that were pushed on people who could not afford them. Bad mortgages were being backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and it was only a matter of time before a contagion of unsustainable debt began to spread. This corruption was encouraged by Democrats in Congress, and abetted by Senator Obama.'"

"'08-10-06,'1','Much larger banks than Countybank are also running ads that are trying to drum up business for products like checking accounts, credit cards and certificates of deposit. Among them are Chase, part of JPMorgan Chase, and Citibank, a unit of Citigroup.The Countybank campaign began in late September with teaser billboards that asked simply, “How do you like yours?” The identity of the sponsor was missing, a common tactic in the first phases of such campaigns.Those signs were followed by signs sending curious South Carolinians to a microsite, or special Web site . Again, no sponsor was identified.Last week brought the next step, known as the reveal. The billboards and the Web site were changed to explain the purpose of the campaign: to introduce the suite of services that Countybank says is customized for each business customer.The Countybank logo was added to the ads, along with the theme of the campaign, “Business banking the way you like it.”The business services being offered by Countybank include cash management, employee benefits, insurance, payment processing, succession planning and wealth management. They are bundled together under the name the BizKit.“I’m not usually a big fan of puns, but we toyed with the idea over the summer and decided, why not?” says Bill Jenkins, the marketing director at Countybank, part of the TCB Corporation. “Everyone thought, ‘It’s a little corny, but let’s give it a try.’ ”“The hand biscuit is a habitual breakfast food here,” he adds. “You pick up a dozen biscuits here in the same way that if you’re in New York, you pick up a dozen bagels.”The light-hearted approach is meant to “do something different, stand out from the crowd,” Mr. Jenkins says.“Bank ads all look similar,” he adds. “They’re all great, if you suffer from insomnia.”The idea behind the campaign is to get “a chance to meet the business owners and find out their needs,” Mr. Jenkins says, in Greenwood as well as a nearby, bigger market, Greenville.“We have a lot more to talk to a business owner about than a savings account or ‘Do you need a loan today?’ ” he adds, because in addition to banking Countybank is also an insurance company, a trust company, a mortgage broker and has a controlling interest in a investment advisory firm.The pitch for the BizKit describes it as “fresh, simple business banking” that is “customized for the way you do business.”“Spend less time managing your money, more time managing your business,” the ads declare.“The thing that big banks and the agencies that work for them miss is that one-on-one relationship,” says Jan Zlotnick, president and creative director at the Zlotnick Group.“All it takes is that one person withdrawing the deposit from the bank, times a million,” he adds, “and we’re in trouble.”The campaign was designed to be straightforward with “no strings attached,” Mr. Zlotnick says, “removing the typical bank fine print.”“It’s good business to be authentic,” he adds. “People are looking for the real thing.”As for the pun, Mr. Zlotnick acknowledges that “it was a little corny.”“But corny can be good,” he adds, because “corny says, ‘Hey, we’re your neighbor; that’s how we talk.’ ”Also, the similarity between “biscuit” and “BizKit” is “a good mnemonic,” Mr. Zlotnick says, and will help potential customers remember the campaign. Also working with Mr. Zlotnick on the campaign are Marija Miljkovic, art director, and Colin Ochel, Web site designer and developer.Those business owners and managers who visit howdoyoulikeyours.com are invited to “enjoy a fresh biscuit breakfast or lunch, for you and your employees, just the way you like it.”“Why?” the text on the home page continues. “We thought it’d be a nicer way to say hi and introduce the BizKit, business banking custom-made to your business.”“That’s it, no purchase requirement, no strings,” the text concludes. “Just mouth-watering biscuits, the way you like.”Those who are intrigued enough to click on a photograph of a biscuit labeled “Pick your fixins” are then asked to select the types of biscuits that a Countybank representative will bring over for the business owner or manager and his or her employees. The choices are plain biscuits; sausage; sausage, egg and cheese; and bacon, egg and cheese.The Web site visitor can also choose when he or she would like the Countybank representative to visit: 8 to 9 a.m., 9 to 10 a.m. or noon to 2 p.m.“It’s the whole Southern hospitality, community concept,” says Michael Massey, president at Media Man, who worked with Mr. Jenkins when Mr. Jenkins was at a credit union in Upstate New York prior to his arrival at Countybank.“As a small-business owner, I deal with a lot of banks,” he adds, “and I’ve yet to find one who gets me.”The purpose of the campaign is to “do something that isn’t pushing product,” Mr. Massey says. “It’s saying: ‘We’re not here to sell you anything. We’re here to tell you what we’re about.’”“The BizKit is a door-opener,” he adds, aimed at businesses “whether they’re generating $50,000 in revenue or $50 million in revenue.”In the weeks that the campaign has been running, Mr. Jenkins says, “we’re seeing good success, but I think we’d see more activity” if it were not for the current financial turmoil.“Some of this news is overshadowing what we’re doing,” he adds.Still, it is surely better to have a bank bring you a hot biscuit than to have a bank land in hot water.If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.'"

"'08-10-06,'1','Q: Are your views converging with Senator Barack Obama? And what do you think the main differences are?A: I think nothing could be more astonishing to me than people who are saying that his and my position have converged. He still wants a set date for withdrawal regardless of conditions. I have always said, when you win wars, when you defeat counterinsurgencies, you withdraw. But the fact is it’s based on conditions on the ground. Gen. Petraeus — change of command — he pointed out as strongly as he could the fragility of all the success that we’ve achieved. So, I am amused and entertained and puzzled by anyone who asserts that somehow our basic positions are right.First of all, Sen. Obama’s first position they’d have been out in March of 2008. The goal post as it has on his whole view of the surge, he said that -- we were “beyond our expectations.” It wasn’t beyond my expectations. He was wrong. So, the fundamental difference remains between myself and Sen. Obama. And it is a gap that is as wide as there could possible be for anyone who understands warfare, that he wants to set a date for withdrawal without any regard to conditions on the ground. As I said, the surge would’ve never had a chance to succeed if we’d had his first position which was: out in March 2008 — completely. So again, I’m entertained and amused at because anybody who thinks that there is any convergence in our positions does not understand the fundamentals of warfare. One of the differences is he wants to come home in defeat; I want to come home with victory and honor.Q: Why do you reject the argument that troop withdrawals would force the Iraqi government to overcome their political differences?A: I reject it because if we announce this “troop withdrawal,” the first thing they’re going to do is make adjustments to the conditions that would prevail when we left. They have to stay there, not only them but other countries in the region. They would make adjustments to accommodate to the Iranians, to al-Qaeda, to the different factions, warring factions within Iraq. And you would have a chaotic situation. The only reason, in my view why we have succeeded in Iraq is because the enemy knows that we’re going to defeat them. Not that we’re going to retreat. Not that we’re going to surrender. Not that we’re going to set a date for withdrawal. And the key to this is, we would not be discussing this issue if we had withdrawn.Q: Well isn’t the Iraqi government itself setting a goal for withdrawal?A: The aspirational aspects of this are very clear. I have always said that we can withdraw with victory depending on conditions on the ground. It is clear that Prime Minister Maliki has got elections in mind and other things in mind but I also have also talked to the Foreign Minister, I have also talked to the President, and others, and they agree with me on the conditions based; and everything I’ve heard about their negotiations said it will be conditions based.Q: Have you talked to them since the SOFA agreement was drafted?A: No I have not. But I have talked to Petraeus and Crocker.Q: And what do they say?A: Well they say that it will be based on conditions on the ground. They adamantly state that’s their position.Q: Did they say that’s the Iraqi position?A: Well obviously there are mixed messages. As I said, the President of Iraq, the Foreign Minister of Iraq and others have all said one thing. Prime Minister Maliki, in all due respect, on occasion has, as sometimes politicians do, has sometimes said one thing in public and another in private, but again the positions that Senator Obama and I have are radically different. His was the popular position at the time. Mine was the unpopular position at the time. That makes me believe because of his vote to cut off the funding for troops while they’re there makes me convinced that Sen. Obama believed this was another political issue.Q: What specific actions would a McCain administration take to get the Iraqis to take the necessary political steps to make the progress there self sustaining?A: Well first of all I guess we look at half empty half full glass here. They passed a De-Baathification law. They passed a budget. They have passed an amnesty law. They have come very close on the provincial elections issue and I would expect that they would move forward with that. They’ve got to have elections. And do they have a ways to go politically? Yes. And with the justice system they do. But people can walk the streets of Baghdad today in relative security. General Petraeus can describe and did describe at his change of command the fragility of this very well which argues against setting a date for withdrawal. So I think the political process is long and hard and difficult particularly in a country that’s basically never known it. Frankly I worry as much about the rule of law as I do almost anything else. But the progress as to where we were at the time of the surge when we were losing a war to where we are now- when Harry Reid the majority leader of the Senate said the war was lost and Senator Obama said the surge could not succeed and still, and still, will not admit that he was wrong. Then I believe that we can see success in Iraq but I urge everyone to read General Petraeus’s statement about the fragility of all this but at the same time the facts on the ground is that Iraq is a dramatically different country than it was a year ago, a year and a half ago, when this surge began.Q: But looking toward the future would you condition support let’s say to the Iraqi security forces on progress made toward reconciliation and would there be consequences if they missed fulfilling their benchmarks or if there were counter-productive actions by Prime Minister Maliki for example not holding fair elections? Would there be sticks and carrots? Do you think there is leverage we have that could encourage the Iraqis to take the right steps and what is it and would you use it?A: Well the first thing I would do is tell the Iraqis they would be paying more for their own reconstruction and their own projects and they have committed to that to some degree. I would certainly work with the Maliki government as we have, and as I say they have made progress. They haven’t made progress because we’ve threatened to leave or threatened this or threatened that but because we’re worked with them in a relationship fashioned by Ambassador Crocker and General Petraus and now General Odierno that I think will bring success in the long run. I do. Now you can draw the what-ifs and hypotheticals, but I am pleased with the progress that they have made in every arena. But I believe that that progress has been fragile so I’m not ready now to say I’m going to threaten you in the future if you don’t do such and such.Q: Senator Obama said “If, on the other hand, our criteria is a messy, sloppy status quo but there’s not, you know, huge outbreaks of violence, there’s still corruption, but the country is struggling along, but it’s not a threat to its neighbors and it’s not an Al Qaida base, that seems to me an achievable goal within a measurable timeframe.” Does that standard seem acceptable to you or are you aiming for something different than that?A: History shows us that countries move forward or they move backward. There’s no such thing basically as a frozen situation politically, economically and militarily. Senator Obama made his second trip in 900 days and his second trip to Iraq. Senator Obama, in all due respect, told apparently it’s been reported, the Iraqi leaders not to make an agreement until he becomes President of the United States. A remarkable statement if that is true. It’s been reported by fairly reliable media.Q: Do you believe it to be true?A: I don’t know. But certainly some of the media that reported it is reliable. I think that the point here is that democracy is hard but we had to have the surge in order to provide security for the people so that the political and economic process could move forward. And although General Petraeus didn’t invent it, he certainly employed the counter-insurgency strategy that worked. So if the strategy continues to work and the Iraqi government becomes stronger then the situation will not evolve as Senator Obama says. But if we withdraw out troops as he says that he is going to do at a date certain then you will see, as General Petraeus has described, this fragile progress destroyed and go back and spiral downward. That’s why the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that, our highest ranking military officer, said that Senator Obama’s policy which he decided on before he left for Iraq in 900 days, not after, would be dangerous for America. I mean we have a fundamental difference here.Q: Shifting gears a little bit to Afghanistan/Pakistan issues, what would be your plan to deprive Al Qaeda and the Taliban their sanctuary in Pakistan? What specific steps would you take in the short run and what long run policies would you enunciate to try to accomplish this?A: We know that Pakistan is a sovereign nation. We also know that the Taliban have re-established bases in Waziristan and all along the frontier region and the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. I’ve been to Waziristan. I know how difficult that terrain is. Nobody has controlled it since Alexander the Great. There are tribes there that operate on their own. So what we need to do overall is employ a strategy such as the one that succeeded in Iraq. And that’s what General Petraeus is going to do. And it is different in a number of ways. It’s not exactly the same. But the principles are the same. I would hope that one of the things we would try as far as those tribal entities are concerned is the same thing we did with the Sunni Awakening. Try to deal with them and try to get them to come over on our side. They have the same problem with the Taliban that they had in the past when they controlled Afghanistan. Brutal regime. But as important we have to establish relationship with the Pakistani government that makes us work in cooperation and part of that, and from a conversation I had with [Pakistan’s President] Zardari, that the Taliban is not going to confine their activities to just Afghanistan. They will also pose a threat over time as other Islamic extremist movements will, to the stability of the Pakistan government. So we have to convince them that it is in their interest as well as ours and Afghan interest, and by the way Karzai and Zardari I think have to establish a relationship. We have to do what we can as far as the poppy crop is concerned. By the way wheat because of the world price is now replacing some areas of poppy cultivation I am informed by General Petraeus and others. We have to understand that we need the cooperation not just of the Pakistani government but the Pakistani public opinion and right now if we announce that we are carrying out military operations or attacking a sovereign country obviously the people do not react favorably. The key to it is a close working relationship with the Pakistani government.Q: The Bush administration has carried out military operations there.A: Well it’s one thing to work in coordination with the Pakistani government. It’s one thing to carry out even some efforts at eliminating some of the opposition, particularly their leadership, and it’s another thing to announce publicly that you’re going to do it.Q: But they’ve done it without eliciting the cooperation of the government.A: I don’t know how much is being done with or without. And I’m sure that’s a discussion that needs to be held with the Pakistanis. I think you will see a greater degree of cooperation if we pledge our cooperation in combating a mutual foe, not just a foe of Afghanistan. So I think you will see General Petraeus support a doubling of the Iraqi Army, excuse me of the Afghan Army, streamlining the command structure, working more closely with our allies both in command and control, as well as operations, trying to deal with the border region in the most effective fashion, perhaps the kind of thing that happened with the Sunni Awakening, at least I believe it’s going to be attempted, closer relations with the Pakistani government, bring whatever efforts you can towards Karzai to reduce the corruption that is in his government which is very serious. So there is a broad strategy that I think is going to be employed in Afghanistan and I think it is going to be hard and tough and by the way it will also entail an increase in American troops. And I would also point out our troop level has gone from 32,000 to 51,000 so it’s not as if we haven’t increased our troop strength and as the Marines withdraw we know that many of them will be going to Afghanistan as well.A: And I’ll make my answers short. I’m sorry, long answers, they’re hard questions.Q: The decision to go to war with Iraq initially was influenced heavily if not based largely on the intelligence about Iraq’s supposed WMD capabilities that later turned out to be terribly wrong. You were among a large number of people who gave credence to this intelligence. What lessons have you learned from this episode and how would it influence your decisions about the use of force and the handling of future crises?A: I served on a weapons of mass destruction commission, we met for 6 months, a year, and I agreed with the conclusions of that commission and basically was that there was a massive intelligence failure but that intelligence failure was not confined to the United States of America. Every intelligence agency in the world believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. And with the price of a barrel of oil well over, now hovering around $100 a barrel, I can imagine what Saddam Hussein would be doing. After he was captured he said he had the infrastructure and organization in place to carry out his dedication to development and use of weapons of mass destruction. So we’ve learned a whole lot of lessons about intelligence capability but every intelligence agency in the world shared that same view and I think the world is far better off with him gone. And my final point is the initial military victory was applauded by one and all. By the way Senator Biden also voted for going to war in Iraq as did Senator Clinton as we all know. The initial military victory and fall of Baghdad was celebrated by one and all. The failure that was phenomenal was the absolute inability to the post initial conflict situation. I sounded the alarm early. I sounded it long. I was called disloyal by Republicans and I stood up for what I believed in when it was most unpopular.Q: But the fact that the intelligence was so off on such an important matter that you took such a strong position on how would that affect your future decision making on crises in the future? We have to rely on intelligence.A: One of the major things the commission concluded was we had to enhance and improve our intelligence capabilities dramatically and those recommendations, many of them were laid out in the commission’s reports, but there’s no doubt about the absolute necessity of improving our intelligence gathering, dissemination, decision making recommendations to the President.Q: One of the points you made in supporting the Iraq invasion was the demonstration effect on other rogue states. For example, Iran. Did it have that effect?A: Well if we had handled it correctly after the initial military success sure because we would have consolidated, we would have moved forward with a democratic government. Instead “Fiasco,” “Cobra II,” other books have been written that chronicles (crosstalk).Q: It did not affect he Iranians.A: Nothing succeeds like success and nothing fails like failure.Q: Basically what I heard you say was that you were satisfied by the progress made by the Maliki government on the political front and did not think it would be productive to use threats or leverage or sticks to get them to move forward. But I would say among the cognoscenti the criticism I’ve heard of your approach is that they say “Well Senator McCain supported the surge which had an effect, but he has yet to articulate a real plan for how to move forward and build on the military success and create political and governing success that’s parallels that.A: All I can say is that is that of course no one is satisfied. I don’t think- I’m not satisfied with the way the government is functioning in this country. Look at the meltdown we’re seeing now. So to be quote “satisfied” is not what I’m trying to say. I am pleased with the progress that’s been made because the surge provided security which meant economic and political process. None of the people that you referred to believed that the Maliki government could function in a way that they sent their troops into places without the United States of America and secured them for the people. That the economy would be improving the way that it is. All of these people, the same ones that predicted failure. I predict that the Iraqi government in a very halting and stumbling fashion, frustrating to us on many occasions, will move forward and progress. And if they make the same progress that they have been the last year, year and a half, than all of us will be satisfied with that progress. I’m not satisfied with a lot of governments in this world today. And I’m not satisfied with many of them that call themselves democracies. But the choice was had was chaos, disintegration, a wider war, Iranian influence and all those things versus the challenges we have today in doing what we can to see that there is further progress and that the political environment improves over time to a point where the people have, can enjoy, a truly free and democratic society. So all sI can say is of course I’m not satisfied and I won’t be satisfied for a long time but I am pleased with the progress that has been made since we started the surge when we were on the verge of losing a war. Lose the first war of the 21st century. And that’s what they predicted was going to happen when the majority leader of the United States Senate stands up and says we’ve lost. Then I believe there were a few of us that stood up and said we can win and the progress that’s been made has been dramatic and they got a long long way to go. But for us to now, before we even, I mean to start threatening the Maliki government that frankly would, I’m not. The success that they’ve achieved so far was not because we were threatening them. The success we’ve achieved so far is because we told them we’re staying. And for a long time people have said threaten them with this, threaten them with that. Instead Petraeus, Crocker and others established a relationship with the Iraqi government so that they did do de-Baathification, they did do an amnesty, they passed a budget. The United States government hasn’t passed a budget. And have they done all the things we wanted them to do? Absolutely not. But I’m not satisfied, I’ll continue to try to find ways to make them move forward but to threaten withdrawal frankly is an option that I would be very reluctant to exercise unless I was sure that we had no other option and I think we have lots of them.'"

"'08-10-06,'1','DNA consists of a string of chemical units, usually represented by the letters A, C, G and T. The order in which those letters appear governs a person’s inherited traits. Sequencing involves determining that order. The human genome — the complete set of DNA — consists of about six billion letters, counting both members of each pair of chromosomes.The first human genome sequence, completed by the federally financed Human Genome Project in 2003, is estimated to have cost a few hundred million dollars. Last year, the genome sequence of James D. Watson, a discoverer of the structure of DNA, was completed at a cost of about $1 million.Today, the cost is about $100,000, said Chad Nusbaum, co-director of the genome sequencing and analysis program at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.Complete Genomics will not begin its service until the second quarter of next year. By then, the cost of competing technologies will no doubt have fallen further. Just last week, Applied Biosystems, a leading manufacturer, said it expected that its newest machine would allow a human genome to be sequenced for $10,000, although that includes only the cost of consumable materials, not labor or the machinery.Knome, a company that offers to provide consumers with their DNA sequence, charges $350,000. But that is a retail price that includes not just the sequencing costs but also the analysis of the data and the customer service.Complete Genomics will not offer a service to consumers. But it will provide sequencing for consumer-oriented companies like Knome.Knome is already exploring farming out its sequencing to Complete Genomics. “We anticipate we’d be able to significantly drop our price,” said Jorge C. Conde, the chief executive of Knome, which is based in Cambridge, Mass.But Complete Genomics expects most of its customers to be pharmaceutical companies or research laboratories that are doing studies aimed at finding genes linked to diseases. Such studies might look at the DNA of 1,000 people with a disease and 1,000 people without the disease.Right now, such studies look at only particular locations in the DNA because it is too expensive to determine the entire DNA sequence. But presumably, an entire sequence would provide more complete information.Pharmaceutical companies are also collecting DNA from participants in many clinical trials, hoping to find genetic patterns that could predict which patients will have the best response to a drug.Complete Genomics, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., was started in 2006. But its sequencing technology has been under development by its chief science officer, Radoje Drmanac, since the 1990s — first at a federal laboratory and then at Hyseq, a genomics company that subsequently shifted to drug development and changed its name to Nuvelo.Complete Genomics has raised $46 million in venture capital so far, including a small investment from Genentech, the biotechnology pioneer.Complete Genomics’s sequencer does not work that much differently from rival machines. But company executives say that miniaturization allows their sequencer to use only tiny amounts of enzymes and other materials. Outsiders have not yet examined the accuracy of the company’s sequences.Rather than selling machines, as most sequencing companies do, Complete Genomics will offer sequencing as a service. That also might help keep prices low because its machines do not have to look as pretty or be as foolproof as they would if they were being sold.“We’re not losing money at $5,000,” said Clifford Reid, the chief executive of Complete Genomics.The company’s first project will be for the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, whose president, Leroy Hood, is an adviser to Complete Genomics.Mr. Reid said Complete Genomics hoped to perform 1,000 human genome sequences next year and 20,000 in 2010, with a goal of completing a million by 2013. That assumes the company can raise the money and find partners to build 10 sequencing centers at a cost of $50 million each. It also assumes there will be enough demand.To put that in perspective, the number of human genomes sequenced to date by all parties combined is, at most, in the double digits. Knome, for instance, says it is on track to have 20 customers by the end of this year.Volume, of course, could further drive down prices. “If we’ve got a million genomes sequenced by 2013,” Mr. Reid said, “it’s going to be very hard for anyone to compete with us.”'"
"'08-10-06,'1','The moves came as federal regulators were trying to help resolve a merger fight in the United States that could make investors more uneasy. Court hearings were under way in New York on Sunday over competing efforts by Citigroup and Wells Fargo to acquire Wachovia, a large bank that nearly failed a week ago.In Europe, meanwhile, the crisis appears to be the most serious one to face the Continent since a common currency, the euro, was created in 1999. Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of the Bruegel research group in Brussels, said Europe confronted “our first real financial crisis, and it’s not just any crisis. It’s a big one.”The European Central Bank has aggressively lent money to banks as the crisis has grown. It had resisted lowering interest rates, but signaled on Thursday that it might cut rates soon. The extra money, aimed at ensuring that banks would have adequate access to cash, has not reassured savers or investors, and European stock markets have performed even worse than the American markets.In Iceland, government officials and banking chiefs were discussing a possible rescue plan for the country's commercial banks. In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Peer Steinbrück, appeared before television cameras to promise that all bank deposits would be protected, although it was not clear whether legislation would be needed to make that promise good.Mindful of the rising public anger at the use of public money to buttress the business of high-earning bankers, Mrs. Merkel promised a day of reckoning for them as well. “We are also saying that those who engaged in irresponsible behavior will be held responsible,” she said. “The government will ensure that. We owe it to taxpayers.”Stock markets fell sharply in early trading on Monday in Asia on growing fears about the health of European banks and the resilience of the global economy.The Nikkei 225 index dropped 3.4 percent in Tokyo on Monday, the Kospi index in Seoul fell 3.7 percent and the Standard and Poor’s/Australian Stock Exchange 200 index in Sydney declined 3.3 percent. The events in Berlin and Brussels underscored the failure of Europe’s case-by-case approach to restoring confidence in the Continent’s increasingly jittery banking sector. A European summit meeting Saturday did little to calm worries.President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and his counterparts from Germany, Britain and Italy vowed to prevent a Lehman-like bankruptcy in Europe but they did not offer an American-style bailout package.The crisis has underlined the difficulty of taking concerted action in Europe because its economies are far more integrated than its governing structures.“We are not a political federation,” Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, said. “We do not have a federal budget.”Last week, Ireland moved to guarantee both deposits and other liabilities at six major banks. There was grumbling in London and Berlin about the move giving those banks an unfair advantage. But Germany proposed its deposit guarantee Sunday after Britain raised its guarantee to £50,000, or almost $90,000, from £35,000.Unlike in the United States, where deposits are fully guaranteed up to a limit of $250,000 — a figure that was raised from $100,000 last week — deposits in most European countries have been only partially guaranteed, sometimes by groups of banks rather than governments. In Germany, the first 90 percent of deposits up to 20,000 euros, or about $27,000, was guaranteed.The Paris meeting produced a promise that European leaders would work together to halt the financial crisis and reassure nervous investors, but even before the meeting began it was becoming clear that two bailouts announced the week before had not succeeded and that a major Italian bank might be in trouble. That bank, Unicredit, announced plans on Sunday to raise as much as 6.6 billion euros, or $9 billion, in capital.Fortis, which only a week ago received 11.2 billion euros from the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, was unable to continue its operations. On Friday, the Dutch government seized its operations in that country, and Sunday night the Belgian government helped to arrange for BNP-Paribas, the French bank, to take over what was left of the company.In Berlin, the government arranged a week ago for major banks to lend 35 billion euros to Hypo, but that fell apart when the banks concluded that more money would be needed. Late Sunday, the government said a 50 billion euro package had been arranged, with the government and other banks participating.The credit crisis began in the United States, a fact that has led European politicians to claim superiority for their country’s financial systems, in contrast to what Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s prime minister, called the “speculative capitalism” of the United States. On Saturday, Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, said the crisis “has come from America,” and Mr. Berlusconi bemoaned the lack of business ethics that had been exposed by the crisis.Many of the European banks’ problems have stemmed from bad loans in Europe, and Fortis got into trouble in part by borrowing money to make a major acquisition. But activities in the United States have played a role. Bankers said Sunday that the additional need for funds at Hypo came from newly discovered guarantees it had issued to back American municipal bonds that it had sold to investors.The credit market worries came on top of heightening concerns about economic growth in Europe and the United States. Many economists think there are recessions in both areas, and one also appears to have started in Japan, where the Nikkei newspaper reported Monday that a poll of corporate executives found that 94 percent thought the country’s economy was deteriorating.“Unless there is a material easing of credit conditions,” said Bob Elliott of Bridgewater Associates, an American money management firm, after the retail sales figures were announced, “it is unlikely that demand will turn around soon.”Almost unnoticed as the United States Congress approved a $700 billion bailout for banks last week, it also agreed to guarantee $25 billion in loans for America’s troubled automakers. European automakers said Sunday they would seek similar aid from the European Commission.Henry M. Paulson Jr., the United States Treasury secretary, hoped that approval of the American bailout, which will involve buying securities from banks at more than their current market value, would free up credit by making cash available for banks to lend and by reassuring participants in the credit markets.But that did not happen last week. Instead, credit grew more expensive and harder to get as investors became more skittish about buying commercial paper, essentially short-term loans to companies. Rates on such loans rose so fast that some feared the market could essentially close, leaving it to already-stressed banks to provide short-term corporate loans.Altria, the parent company of the cigarette maker Philip Morris, said lenders wanted it to delay its planned $10.3 billion acquisition of UST, another tobacco maker, until 2009, but promised it would complete the deal.Europe’s need to scramble is in part the legacy of a decision to establish the euro, which 15 countries now use, but not follow up with a parallel system of cross-border regulation and oversight of private banks.“First we had economic integration, then we had monetary integration,” said Sylvester Eijffinger, a member of the monetary expert panel advising the European parliament. “But we never developed the parallel political and regulatory integration that would allow us to face a crisis like the one we are facing today,” he added.In Brussels, Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, agreed. “Maybe they will be shocked into thinking more strategically instead of running behind events,” he said. “The later you come, the higher the bill.”While the European Central Bank has power over interest rates and broader monetary policy, it was never granted parallel oversight of private banks, leaving that task to dozens of regulators across the Continent.This patchwork system includes national central banks in each of the euro-zone’s 15 members and they still retain broad powers within their own borders, further complicating any regional approach to problem-solving.The European economic landscape today bears little resemblance to the 1990s, when the groundwork for the euro was laid. Back then, Mr. Pisani-Ferry recalled, few banks in Europe had cross-border operations on a significant scale.A wave of mergers over the last decade created giants like HSBC and Deutsche Bank, which straddle continents and have major American exposure.“The European banking landscape was transformed fairly recently,” Mr. Pisani-Ferry said. “When the euro was first introduced, the question of cross-border regulation didn’t really arise.”Optimists say one potential long-term benefit from the current turmoil is that it often takes a crisis to propel European integration forward.“Progress in Europe is usually the result of a crisis,” Mr. Eijffinger said. “This could be one of those rare moments in E.U. history.”'"
"'08-10-06,'1','“Latinos are beginning to see themselves as a group, as a community,” said Cesar A. Perales, the president and general counsel of the organization and one of its three founders. “There is a coming together of identification in a common struggle.”Mr. Perales said that this shared identity had arisen in part because of a belief within the Latino community that it has come under attack in recent years, particularly in the form of government crackdowns on illegal immigration.His organization has taken on many immigration-related cases. Perhaps its most high-profile work involved a challenge to ordinances in Hazleton, Pa., barring illegal immigrants from renting homes or working there.At the same time, Puerto Ricans’ influence in New York City has waned as their numbers have declined and the Latino population has become more diverse.In 1970, there were 811,843 Puerto Ricans in the city, composing about 63.5 percent of the 1,278,630 Latinos, according to the Department of City Planning.The 2006 American Community Survey counted 790,125 Puerto Ricans among a total of 2,276,640 Latinos, or about 34.7 percent.About 31 percent of Puerto Ricans who have left the city have moved elsewhere in the metropolitan area, said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the planning department’s population division. More than 30 percent have moved to the South, most of them to Florida, with the largest concentration in the central part of the state, he said.Latinos in the city now come from everywhere in Latin America. The largest increase has been in the Mexican population, which grew to 263,311 in 2006 from 22,577 in 1980. Mexicans now represent about 11.6 percent of the city’s Latino population, according to the 2006 population survey.This shift is evident wherever Puerto Ricans once held unrivaled influence. For decades, East Harlem was overwhelmingly Puerto Rican, earning the name “El Barrio.” But while Puerto Ricans are still the neighborhood’s dominant Latino group, many Mexicans and other Latinos have moved into East Harlem, and their restaurants, shops and other businesses have proliferated.Among the Latino residents served by the Union Settlement Association, which has been providing education programs and social and community services in East Harlem since 1895, a higher percentage than ever are not Puerto Rican, said Ellen P. Simon, the association’s executive director.“We have a Day of the Dead celebration, which wouldn’t have happened 20 years ago,” she said, referring to a Mexican holiday celebrated on Nov. 1 and 2.Still, the Puerto Rican group’s decision to change its name did not come easily, Mr. Perales said. Discussions about the matter began about 10 years ago. The organization even brought in a consultant to conduct a study on the impact of such a change.Other Puerto Rican organizations have wrestled with the same issue.In 2005, the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, a research and advocacy group founded in 1982 and based in New York, changed its name to the National Institute for Latino Policy.Angelo Falcón, the institute’s president and founder, said he was motivated by the same concerns as P.R.L.D.E.F., since his work involved far more than Puerto Rican issues and the Puerto Rican community.The decision was also influenced by financial concerns. Mr. Falcón said some of the group’s donors and stakeholders thought that the Puerto Rican community and the primacy of its issues had faded in the public consciousness, while awareness of other Latino populations and pan-Latino concerns had grown.“There was a feeling that Puerto Rico had disappeared in the public mind,” he said.In the course of many meetings, the institute’s officials concluded that broadening the name might help with fund-raising. In addition, they hoped, the wider mandate would help tie the Puerto Rican community to the larger Latino population.But the decision was not without risk, Mr. Falcón said. “Within the community, these kinds of changes aren’t always warmly embraced,” he said. In response to the name change, some Puerto Ricans accused the group of forsaking its heritage, he said.Another institution of Puerto Ricans in the city, El Museo del Barrio, which was founded as a neighborhood cultural center in East Harlem in 1969, came under fire in the 1990s when it broadened its mission to promote the cultural heritage of all Latin Americans. It was subjected to more criticism by Puerto Rican loyalists in 2002 when it appointed its first non-Puerto Rican director, Julian Zugazagoitia, who was born and raised in Mexico.Mr. Perales anticipates similar discontent over his group’s new name. Detractors already have accused him of abandoning the Puerto Rican cause.His response has been to explain that the group will continue to defend the interests of Puerto Ricans, along with those of other Latinos. “We’re also going to be the Dominican Legal Defense Fund, the Ecuadorean Legal Defense Fund, the Colombian Legal Defense Fund,” he said. “It would make no sense for every group to have their own legal defense fund.”Mr. Perales said that the diminished Puerto Rican presence in New York was an intensely personal issue for him, and that he understood the community’s concern. But he pointed out that it was as much a result of the community’s success as anything else.As Puerto Rican families in New York have made their way up the social ladder, he said, they have moved out of the city and to middle-class suburbs or elsewhere in the United States.So the decline in the city’s Puerto Rican population can be seen as a reflection of the community’s growth and development, Mr. Perales said, much as he hoped the community will consider the name change.'"
"'08-10-06,'1','Frank B. McArdle, a health policy expert at Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm, said the law would force sweeping changes in the workplace.“A large majority of health plans currently have limits on hospital inpatient days and outpatient visits for mental health treatments, but not for other treatments,” Mr. McArdle said. “They will have to change their plan design.”Federal officials said the law would improve coverage for 113 million people, including 82 million in employer-sponsored plans that are not subject to state regulation. The effective date, for most health plans, will be Jan. 1, 2010.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the new requirement will increase premiums by an average of about two-tenths of 1 percent. Businesses with 50 or fewer employees are exempt.The goal of mental health parity once seemed politically unrealistic but gained widespread support for several reasons:¶Researchers have found biological causes and effective treatments for numerous mental illnesses.¶A number of companies now specialize in managing mental health benefits, making the costs to insurers and employers more affordable. The law allows these companies to continue managing benefits.¶Employers have found that productivity tends to increase after workers are treated for mental illnesses and drug or alcohol dependence. Such treatments can reduce the number of lost work days.¶The stigma of mental illness may have faded as people see members of the armed forces returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with serious mental problems.¶Parity has proved workable when tried at the state level and in the health insurance program for federal employees, including members of Congress.Dr. Steven E. Hyman, a former director of the National Institute of Mental Health, said it was impossible to justify insurance discrimination when an overwhelming body of scientific evidence showed that “mental illnesses represent real diseases of the brain.”“Genetic mutations and unlucky combinations of normal genes contribute to the risk of autism and schizophrenia,” Dr. Hyman said. “There is also strong evidence that people with schizophrenia have thinning of the gray matter in parts of the brain that permit us to control our thoughts and behavior.”The drive for mental health parity was led by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, who has a daughter with schizophrenia, and Senator Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat who was killed in a plane crash in 2002. Mr. Wellstone had a brother with severe mental illness.Prominent members of both parties, including Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter and Tipper Gore, pleaded with Congress to pass the legislation.Representatives Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Jim Ramstad, Republican of Minnesota, led the fight in the House. Mr. Kennedy has been treated for depression and, by his own account, became “the public face of alcoholism and addiction” after a car crash on Capitol Hill in 2006. Mr. Ramstad traces his zeal to the day in 1981 when he woke up in a jail cell in South Dakota after an alcoholic blackout.The Senate passed a mental health parity bill in September 2007. The House passed a different version in March of this year.A breakthrough occurred when sponsors of the House bill agreed to drop a provision that required insurers to cover treatment for any condition listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association.Employers objected to such a requirement, saying it would have severely limited their discretion over what benefits to provide. Among the conditions in the manual, critics noted, are caffeine intoxication and sleep disorders resulting from jet lag.Doctors often complain that insurers, especially managed care companies, interfere in their treatment decisions. But doctors and mental health advocates cited the work of such companies in arguing that mental health parity would be affordable, because the benefits could be managed.Pamela B. Greenberg, president of the Association for Behavioral Health and Wellness, a trade group, said providers of mental health care typically drafted a treatment plan for each person. In complex cases, she said, a case manager or care coordinator monitors the patient’s progress.A managed care company can refuse to pay for care, on the grounds that it is not medically necessary or “clinically appropriate.” But under the new law, insurers must disclose their criteria for determining medical necessity, as well as the reason for denying any particular claim for mental health services.Andrew Sperling, a lobbyist at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an advocacy group, said, “Under the new law, we will probably see more aggressive management of mental health benefits because insurers can no longer impose arbitrary limits.”The law will also encourage insurers to integrate coverage for mental health care with medical and surgical benefits. Under the law, insurers cannot have separate cost-sharing requirements or treatment limits that apply only to mental illness and addiction disorders.The law comes just three months after Congress eliminated discriminatory co-payments in Medicare, the program for people who are 65 and older or disabled.Medicare beneficiaries pay 20 percent of the government-approved amount for most doctors’ services but 50 percent for outpatient mental health services. The co-payment for mental health care will be gradually reduced to 20 percent over six years.The mental health parity law was forged in a highly unusual consensus-building process. For years, mental health advocates had been lobbying on the issue.Insurers and employers, which had resisted earlier versions of the legislation, came to the table in 2004 at the request of Mr. Domenici and Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming.Each side had, in effect, a veto over the language of any bill. Insurers and employers, seeing broad bipartisan support for the goal in both houses of Congress, decided to work with mental health advocates. Each side gained the other’s trust.“It was an incredible process,” said E. Neil Trautwein, a vice president of the National Retail Federation, a trade group. “We built the bill piece by piece from the ground up. It’s a good harbinger for future efforts on health care reform.”'"
"'08-10-06,'1','While the White House and Congress have been embroiled in negotiations over the $700 billion bailout of the nation’s bedraggled banks, another bailout of sorts passed Congress just under the radar: $25 billion in subsidized loans for Detroit’s bedraggled automakers.The burst of government generosity last week inspires two thoughts. There is a long list of troubled industries that could easily put government billions to good use. But public finances are looking more stretched with each passing bailout. So it is probably a good idea for Congress, and the administration, to refrain from giving another big chunk of the corporate sector more money, at least for the time being.Moreover, while the money is ostensibly meant to further the cause of fuel efficiency, we fear Detroit’s automakers will be tempted to put it to other uses. The Department of Energy, which is in charge of writing detailed criteria for car companies to get the loans, should include a provision for strict oversight of the program to ensure that the money is not diverted to other purposes.The loans are limited to plants that have been around for at least 20 years, which pretty much limits the help to the gas-guzzling trio from Michigan and three Honda plants. It is supposed to be used to retool old car and parts plants to make vehicles that achieve at least 25 percent better gas mileage than similar models in their class — hardly a difficult target, according to experts from the Union of Concerned Scientists.But the Big Three automakers are reeling from the impact of expensive oil on sales of gas-guzzlers and spending oodles of money to cover retiree health and pension costs. Like other businesses, they are being strangled by the credit crunch. They have pushed for more money and tried to ease the restrictions on its use.There are other, perhaps more pressing demands on the public purse than merely helping out General Motors, Ford and Chrysler: guaranteeing all Americans access to affordable health care, improving the nation’s schools, mending the country’s threadbare social safety net to help unemployed workers. The list could go on.'"
"'08-10-06,'1','Like the market itself, Mr. Sharpell said, the business has suddenly become extremely volatile. Selling stress release, one might expect to see bookings at a record high, if massage operated in a perfect world of supply and demand. Or he could be experiencing a major drop-off in Wall Streeters, who, one-sided body injuries or not, might count massage as one of the first luxury line items to go, along with extravagant time shares and weekly floral arrangements, when one’s portfolio has sunk by 30 percent.In fact, Mr. Sharpell and the massage therapists who work for him are seeing both. “I would say I’ve lost 50 percent of my Wall Street clientele,” said Christine Hagin, who started working at Relax in 2002. She wasn’t feeling the hit, however — for every financier who has dropped out, she said, another one has signed up.So far, the financial turmoil has been a zero-sum game for Mr. Sharpell’s bottom line. But the inefficiency of a suddenly unpredictable schedule is taking a toll. “Usually, if I had a blank schedule two months ahead, I could do a fair job predicting how it was going to fill up: with whom, which days, which therapists,” he said. “Now I really don’t know. It’s all up in the air.”The schedule is still filling up, but at the last minute. “I get a lot of people calling and saying, ‘Can you fit me in in an hour?’ ” he said. Normally, if the answer were no, clients would say they’d call ahead next time. Now people are pleading for special dispensations, to be squeezed in whatever the cost. “When they call, there’s an urgency,” he said. “But they don’t want to plan ahead — it’s like they’re waiting for some piece of information that’s going to tell them something.”“I seem to be getting a lot of calls at 4, 4:30,” he added. “Like something must happen on Wall Street around then?” (At Relax, they are blissfully unaware of the closing bell a few miles south.)On Sunday, Dale McCormick, a 49-year-old stockbroker who lives in the West Village, left a 90-minute massage at Relax looking as if he had just woken from a nap. He has not increased his regular massage quota of one a month, but he is thinking about the standing appointment differently. “Before it was a luxury,” he said. “Now you can look as it as ‘I have to have it.’ ”It’s as if the value of a $95-an-hour massage ($115 for Mr. Sharpell’s more experienced hands) changes depending on where we are on the arc of stress. When money is flowing, Relax is a triumphant indulgence; when money is tight, so are the upper-shoulder muscles, and Relax becomes a necessity. Finally, when things are dire, no matter how nagging that back pain, Relax reverts to luxury.Before Bear Stearns collapsed this spring, a 50-something single woman who worked at the troubled firm entered Relax worried about her future. Like everyone else, Ms. Bear Stearns told him, she lived hand to mouth — what would she do without a paycheck? Before she left, she scheduled an appointment for two weeks on. By then, her firm was history, and, sure enough, when Mr. Sharpell checked the book, the appointment was, as he put it, “whited out.”One thing Mr. Sharpell never says to clients: Relax (unless it’s followed by a direct object, like your shoulders or your neck). But he does try to take them outside their anxiety, if only for a brief respite.“The first thing I tell them,” he said, “is that for the next hour they don’t have to worry about anything — they’re not responsible for anything. All they need to do is just chill out.”Whether it’s true or not, they seem to like hearing it.'"
"'08-10-06,'1','Obama advisers say they plan to push back forcefully and warn that Mr. McCain, who has praised Mr. Bush’s picks for the court, would continue selecting conservative judges.Both campaigns are also watching to see if the future of the Roe v. Wade decision, as well as issues like gay marriage and school prayer, become galvanizing forces for swing voters in battlegrounds like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Advisers on both sides say they doubt social issues will match the economy’s problems in this election, and Obama advisers say they are being especially vigilant about not allowing anything to overshadow that issue.Indeed, Mr. Obama already has some experience with blowback from the right and the left over Supreme Court issues. Critics accused him of slipperiness in June for praising the court’s decision in a Second Amendment case overturning the District of Columbia’s ban on personal gun ownership, and for his attack on another ruling that outlawed the death penalty for people convicted of child rape.For Mr. McCain’s part, conservatives remember with antipathy that he was part of the so-called Gang of 14, Republican and Democratic senators who forged a compromise that allowed for confirmation votes on some of Mr. Bush’s judicial appointments.Still, many conservatives are confident that Mr. McCain would appoint people who, as he has pledged, fit the mold of the two most recent additions to the court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. (Mr. Obama voted against both men; he has praised Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter as “sensible.”) The next president is expected to have at least one nomination for the Supreme Court and as many as three in his four-year term.“McCain is a social conservative, and he’s given every indication that his appointees would be conservative, especially since that’s the traditional way to repay the Republican base for helping elect you,” said Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School and a former clerk for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. “Obama’s whole message, meanwhile, is about uniting people and listening to the other side. And he is close to a number of core centrist Democratic thinkers about the court, so it’s likely that he would pick people who are fairly centrist.”Many conservatives disagree. They point to remarks that Mr. Obama made on CNN where, after saying he did not believe “in a bunch of judicial law-making,” he went on to describe in relatively explicit terms for a presidential candidate what sort of perspective he would want his nominees to have.“What I do want is a judge who is sympathetic enough to those who are on the outside, those who are vulnerable, those who are powerless, those who can’t have access to political power and as a consequence can’t protect themselves from being — from being dealt with sometimes unfairly, that the courts become a refuge for justice,” said Mr. Obama, who taught constitutional law for years at the University of Chicago.Several conservative observers of the court said they interpreted those remarks as code for Mr. Obama’s intention to select “liberal activist judges.”“That comment was pretty remarkable to a lot of us,” said Neomi Rao, a teacher at George Mason University Law School who is a former associate counsel in the Bush White House and a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. “When I hear about a judge who rules on the basis of empathy, I think of an activist judge.”Obama advisers say that he believes most cases are decided based on precedents but that a handful of decisions can reflect judges’ own life experiences, like a recent equal-pay case where a conservative bloc of justices ruled against a female factory supervisor saying she should have filed her suit years earlier.Some campaign analysts point out that presidential candidates have long struggled to make an issue out of their opponent’s record on judicial appointments. Senator John Kerry, for instance, often said in 2004 that if voters needed a reason to oppose Mr. Bush, “I have three words for you: the Supreme Court.” Few analysts say it made much difference in the outcome of the election, and Mr. Roberts and Mr. Alito have joined the court since.Still, now is the moment in a presidential race when court issues can come to the fore. The new advertisement focusing on Mr. Obama’s ties to Mr. Wright and others comes as Mr. Obama is struggling to win over white working-class voters in parts of Michigan, Ohio and western Pennsylvania (where the advertisement will also be seen) who voted for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries.“It’s important to point out that voters don’t get to pick justices; we pick a president who hopefully has the right discernment of character to evaluate people for life tenure on the court,” said Wendy Long, chief counsel for the Judicial Confirmation Network, a conservative-leaning group that is running the new commercial. “Based on the evidence of people like Reverend Wright, Obama has deficiency in that area.”'"
"'08-10-06,'1','The long road to this Sunday started there. The Denver Broncos cut Hixon nine days after the collision. He said he worried that the play would define him, worried that he would never careen down the field with the same abandonment he once had. The play still haunts him, Hixon said.The Giants claimed Hixon last October, and he exceeded their expectations with a 74-yard kickoff return for a touchdown against the New England Patriots in the regular-season finale and a recovered fumble against the Green Bay Packers in the National Football Conference championship game.This preseason, when Burress was out injured, Hixon shined. He caught two touchdown passes against the Cleveland Browns and gained 51 receiving yards against the Jets.His coach, Tom Coughlin, does not readily hand out compliments. But when asked recently about Hixon, Coughlin said, “The arrow is going up on that guy.”It pointed straight toward the sky Sunday, when Hixon went wild in the first half. He said the Giants missed Burress, missed his jokes in the locker room and his presence on the field.But Hixon wasted little time becoming involved. On their first drive, the Giants called a double move, which pushed Hixon beyond the safety and up the left sideline. He caught a 32-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Eli Manning and danced in celebration.“Eli threw the perfect ball,” Hixon said. “He put it where only I could catch it.”Every time the Giants needed a big play, they made one, Hixon said. Often, those plays came from an unheralded group of wide receivers that was missing its best player.Sinorice Moss caught two touchdown passes. And Manning connected with eight teammates and threw for 267 yards.The Giants were the anti-Seahawks on Sunday. While the Seahawks’ receivers have gone through a rash of injuries this season, their Giants counterparts have been showcasing their depth at that position.“We’ve got five or six receivers on this team who could be starters,” defensive end Justin Tuck said. “Everybody knew Plaxico would be out this game. They might not have known the kind of receivers we have behind him.”Hixon left the game late in the second quarter, after a 16-yard completion when his head bounced off the turf. Coughlin said the Giants would know more about Hixon’s injury on Monday, but Hixon said he felt “fine” and “good” and noted that he had wanted to return to the game.He knew, better than most, about seizing each opportunity, no matter what the size. He knew this presented his biggest opportunity to date. And despite the injury, despite missing the second half, Hixon wore a smile in the locker room, on an afternoon where he played his favorite role — starting receiver, leading man.“Domenik played like he did right through the preseason,” Coughlin said. “When he has had an opportunity, he has played very well.”'"
"'08-10-06,'1','All this is making returns harder to come by for hedge fund managers, and stoking further investor uncertainty. There are exceptions: Paulson & Company, which made billions betting against housing last year, returned around 20 percent in several of its funds so far this year. But most funds are down significantly. For many funds that were already weakened, the difficult conditions could spell the end.That suggests an acceleration of hedge fund closures and consolidation, leading to a less-populous industry. Most of the bigger, more mature fund firms should live to fight another day. But factor in poor performance and redemptions, and even they may have less money to play with for a while.They’re used to long nights and crisis situations. Some of them are old enough to have been involved in the Black Monday crash of 1987, or the wild currency movements of the early 1990s. But few of them, the central bankers and the Treasury officials who are trying to deal with the current crisis, have ever worked through such a prolonged ordeal. They’ve lost count of the nights of two hours of sleep and the weekends of round-the-clock meetings.This has truly become a world where the sun never sets. The Federal Reserve sends news releases at 2 a.m. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, woke up the governor of the Bank of France at 3 a.m. to take part in the rescue of the bank Dexia. Banks near bankruptcy on Friday night have to be rescued by Sunday. Time zones have to be ignored.It’s hard to tell whether Hank Paulson has slept at all since he first came up with the idea for his troubled asset purchase plan. Some might even say his first “trust me with $700 billion” proposal already showed signs of sleep deprivation.Worn-out officials are staying up all night to negotiate clever plans for failing banks while trying to cooperate with colleagues across distant oceans. Mistakes could be priced in billions, for years to come. But investors, politicians, the news media and voters are demanding quick solutions.The strain is beginning to show. First the puffy eyes, on to the silly jokes — was that Mr. Paulson kneeling at Nancy Pelosi’s feet? Then come the nervous laughs and next could be the disastrous decision made in the dead of the night on too little rest.So, after insolvent banks and frozen markets, the world’s financial system faces yet another threat: the exhaustion of its handlers. The crisis shows no sign of receding anytime soon. The best advice for the stressed and powerful: get a good night’s sleep. RICHARD BEALES and PIERRE BRIANÇON'"
"'08-10-06,'1','Sidney Poitier, Cicely Tyson, Ruby Dee and Oprah Winfrey were among the thousands of guests at the grand opening of Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta on Saturday night, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. “I never dreamed I would witness this in my lifetime,” Ms. Tyson said, referring to Mr. Perry’s achievement in creating the first major television and film studio owned by an African-American producer.

"'08-10-07,'0','Ruedi Rymann, a Swiss farmer and cheesemaker renowned in his home country as a yodeler and the man who recorded what came to be known as “Switzerland’s greatest hit,” died on Sept. 10 at his home in Giswil, south of Zurich. He was 75.His family told the Swiss newspaper Blick he had been suffering from liver cancer and decided in June to end chemotherapy treatments. He is survived by his wife and six children.To the Swiss, Mr. Rymann was something of a cultural representative, the embodiment of a kind of Swissness that was steeped in tradition. A forester, a hunter and generally an outdoorsman, he was an athlete as well, running a local club devoted to the uniquely Swiss style of wrestling known as swingen, in which the combatants strive to toss each other beyond the bounds of a circular bed of sawdust. And though yodeling — a type of singing in which a falsetto, or head voice, alternates with a deeper, natural chest voice — is native to a number of countries and migrated to a number of others, including the United States, it is most closely associated with Switzerland, where one theory has it that it developed as a method of alpine communication, to be heard from mountaintop to mountaintop. The Swiss Yodeling Association, founded in 1910, attracts over 200,000 visitors to its National Yodeling Festival every three years.Mr. Rymann was a master yodeler in the Swiss style which, according to the book “Yodel-Ay-Ee-Oooo,” a remarkably comprehensive tour of the yodeling universe by Bart Plantenga (Routledge, 2004), does not make use of the “eee” sound.“And, to the surprise of most neophytes, it has a decided melancholy feeling — slow, mournful, forlorn,” Mr. Plantenga wrote.Mr. Rymann, whose natural voice was a bell-like tenor, made numerous recordings, singing alone or with other yodelers — sometimes even yodel choruses — and often accompanied by a jaunty accordion or two. His recording of a traditional folk song, “Dr Schacher Seppli,” became a fixture on Swiss request radio.The song is a melodic lament by a poor wanderer, the title character, whose name roughly translates as Joe Schacher, about the unfairness of life and the rewards awaiting him in heaven. The lyrics go, in part:People hurt each other just because of that damned money.How beautiful it could be down here.'"
"'08-10-07,'0','Citadel is developing several new, low-price funds that will eschew the industry’s “2 and 20” structure, whereby funds collect annual management fees of 2 percent and, on top of that, take a 20 percent cut of any profits. Some of the funds will bet only on investments and will not use short sales to hedge, effectively taking the “hedge” out of hedge fund. The funds will provide investors with a menu of à la carte investing options, another departure for Mr. Griffin, as he expands beyond hedge funds into broader asset management.Gerald A. Beeson, the chief operating officer of Citadel, said no one had seen anything like the turmoil now gripping the financial markets. “Any one of the market events we saw in September could on its own result in a meaningful dislocation,” Mr. Beeson said. “Together they were simply unprecedented.”Until now, Mr. Griffin has rarely stumbled. Between 1998 and 2007, he handed his investors an average annual return of 20 percent, more than three times that of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. That performance made Mr. Griffin a rich man and fanned his already formidable ambition. Not long ago, he was considering taking Citadel public, a step that might now be difficult, if not impossible, given the state of the markets. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Griffin, who turns 40 on Oct. 15, declined to comment for this article.What went wrong? Citadel’s losses this year were largely caused by equity trades and two arbitrage strategies, the first of which involves betting on the outcome of mergers, and the second on convertible bonds.Now, the clock is ticking for Mr. Griffin. If his funds close down for the year, Citadel will not earn its 20 percent profit fee and will have to finance its growth through past savings. Dismal year-end returns could also put another dent in Mr. Griffin’s aspirations for taking his company public.Hedge funds are down, on average, 10 percent so far this year, the worst run yet for the private, largely unregulated industry that manages money for some of the largest pension and endowment funds in the world. The losses are threatening the survival of thousands of hedge funds, and pitting traders against each other. As the markets rumbled last month, troubled hedge funds sold investments at rock-bottom prices, and other, stronger funds tried to bet against any stocks or bonds that their weaker peers held.“The real issue for hedge funds is that the whole environment has changed, and like everyone else, they’re trying to figure out whether they still have some kind of investment edge in this new environment,” said William Goetzmann, a professor of finance at the Yale School of Management. “I think some of them will find that they don’t.”Already, investors are starting to ask for their money back at large hedge funds like DKR Capital and RAB Capital. Managers like Dinakar Singh, a former Goldman star who runs the hedge fund TPG-Axon, are writing apologetic letters to their investors, asking them to stay put. And analysts are warning that some 10 percent of the 10,000 hedge funds in business may be gone by early next year.It is a setback for an industry that has created staggering wealth for individuals like Mr. Griffin and raised eyebrows in Washington. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said last week that it would hold a hearing on hedge fund regulation next week, and Mr. Griffin is among the five billionaire hedge fund managers invited to testify.Citadel is already mapping changes to put it ahead when the chaos ends. The company has been hiring Wall Street workers for its new, low-price funds, a move that angered JPMorgan Chase so much that the bank stopped trading with Citadel for a day. And Citadel has been working on creating a new exchange and clearinghouse for credit-default swaps with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, an alternative to a plan being promoted by Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs.A fiercely competitive trader, Mr. Griffin has weathered the ups and downs of the markets since he opened Citadel in 1990 with $4.6 million. This time around, he has stockpiled $6 billion in cash and has lowered his funds’ leverage, which has helped fuel returns in the past. He has also broadened Citadel’s reach in recent years into fee-based businesses typically offered by financial service firms, not hedge funds. The businesses include carrying out trades — Citadel now executes 30 percent of all American option trades and 8 percent of American stock trades. And it performs administrative tasks for other hedge funds.Despite the diversification, Mr. Griffin will still be judged to a degree for how his largest fund, the Kensington fund, fares during the turmoil.Traders in the convertible bond market said that Citadel suffered from carnage at other funds. Much of the drop was caused by selling by Lehman’s proprietary trading desk as well as the hedge funds Lydian Asset Management, Whitebox Advisors and Platinum Grove Asset Management, according to traders who asked to remain anonymous because they agreed not to discuss the portfolios they reviewed. Many of those funds owned preferred stock in financial companies like Lehman and Merrill Lynch, but they were forced to sell bonds from a range of industries as they searched for cash.Lydian and Whitebox did not return calls for comment, and an executive at Platinum Grove declined to comment. A spokesman for Lehman confirmed the selling in the week after the bank filed for bankruptcy.Many of Citadel’s strategies were also thrown off by the short-selling rules that the government imposed in the middle of last month. Traders say that stocks were moving out of sync from earnings announcements and in patterns that seemed divorced from their research into those companies. The rules are scheduled to last through the middle of October, though they could be extended.Analysts said that investors might forgive many hedge funds for their September spirals, because of the historic events during the month. But investors may not forgive many more months of pain, they said.Still, some say Mr. Griffin is in a good position to profit from the pain on Wall Street. Even mighty firms like Goldman Sachs have torn up their playbooks, potentially creating an opening for Mr. Griffin — provided Citadel can bounce back fast.“Ken Griffin has the attention of the world,” said David DeRosa, chairman of DeRosa Research and Trading, a company in New Canaan, Conn., that advises financial companies, including hedge funds. “Given that we’ve lost the major investment banks, there’s an opening now.”'"
"'08-10-07,'0','“It’s a fear of contagion,” Mr. Bibby said, while adding that Asian banks were better positioned than most to withstand the current problems because the region’s high savings rates tends to mean that Asian banks are net lenders in international money markets.Similarly, many economists expect that the regulatory reforms Latin America took to shore up its banking sector in the wake of previous crises will make them more resistant to failure than their American or European banks. But that relative health is inspiring little faith in the markets.Brazil’s stock market, the Ibovespa, closed down 5.4 percent, after trading was suspended twice, at one point when the market plunged 15 percent. Argentina’s Bolsa de Buenos Aires fell 6 percent. Even Chile, the region’s most stable economy, had one of its largest one-day drops in years. The country’s IPSA exchange dropped 6.02 percent; its IGPA exchange fell 4.89 percent.For Latin America, nightmarish memories of previous financial crises are still fresh. Mexico struggled at the end of 1994 and was saved from default only by a $50 billion bailout by the United States in concert with international organizations. After the Southeast Asian crisis, Brazil watched its currency, the real, tumble 43 percent in early 1999 after the government abandoned its policy of defending it.This time, the region was thought to be more resilient. This decade, Brazil, Mexico and Chile, in particular, have saved wisely during a broad-based commodity boom. They have reformed their financial institutions with stronger regulations and, in the case of Brazil especially, diversified their trade to be less reliant on the United States economy and more on Asia’s.“Latin America is in a much better macroeconomic position now,” Mr. Coutiño said. “But in the past few weeks the movie has changed, and now Europe is involved. Two of the three main global locomotives for growth are now suffering. If we face a global recession nobody can escape.”To varying degrees, Latin American countries have said they will tap reserves and stabilization funds to try to ensure that the higher cost of borrowing does not affect exporters. The governments of Brazil and Chile have said in recent days that they will free funds for key industries this year.Other countries — such as Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina — which saved less, will not have as much flexibility. In Argentina, the global credit tightening could make it more difficult for the country to renegotiate billions of dollars in outstanding debt and stave off a fiscal crisis next year, Mr. Coutiño said. But because it has been shunned by international investors, capital flight is less of a concern.“Capital is not leaving Argentina because it never entered Argentina,” said Dante Sica, an economist at Abeceb, an economic consulting firm in Buenos Aires.Russia led the global sell-off Monday, its stock market falling 19.1 percent, its worst day since the end of the Soviet Union and the return of capitalism. Russia’s RTS index dropped about a tenth of a percent farther than during the previous worst day — Oct. 28, 1997, during the emerging-market financial crisis of the late 1990s.Three halts in trading through the day failed to slow the drop. The other main stock exchange, the Micex, was down 18.6 percent. And some big companies fared even worse.Gazprom, Russia’s largest company, fell 24.4 percent, and Norilsk Nickel, a blue-chip mining enterprise, lost 37.7 percent. Brokers once giddy about the rapid rise of the oil-fueled market said they expect worse to come.“Nobody has to own the market,” Kingsmill Bond, the chief strategist at Troika Dialog brokerage, said of Russia stocks. And nobody, apparently, wants to, as investors closed positions to move to treasury securities.The problem is, even against a backdrop of global uncertainty, the Russian stock market looks especially vulnerable.Falling commodity prices is one reason: as the threat of global recession looms, oil and other resources that fueled Russia’s boom are retreating. The Russian market was also weakened by investors divesting in the wake of the war in Georgia, which raised the specter of a return to cold war hostilities with the West. As stocks fell, other investors were forced to sell on margin calls, in a spiral that revealed the Russian stock market was more leveraged than most analysts had believed. A Kremlin bailout plan, meanwhile, has not had much effect.On Monday alone, the stock market drop represented a paper loss of $102 billion for Russian companies.Gazprom executives once boasted, Khrushchev-like, that their company would bury its biggest competitor, Exxon Mobil, on the strength of their seemingly limitless reserves of natural gas in the Siberian wilderness. But Gazprom has fallen 66 percent since its peak in May; the company’s market capitalization was $123 billion Monday.Exxon Mobil, which is also vulnerable to oil price declines, has fallen less, 21.1 percent since its May peak.In another example of Russia’s woes, the price of Norilsk Nickel collapsed Monday after a big shareholder, the metals tycoon Oleg V. Deripaska, the nation’s richest man, was forced to hand over his shares in the Canadian auto parts maker Magna in a margin call by creditors.That raised the question of whether his recently purchased Norilsk shares could also soon be seized by the consortium of Western banks that financed the deal. A spokesman for Mr. Deripaska’s conglomerate, Basic Element, said the company faced no liquidity crisis. Norilsk shares are down 78.2 percent from their peak this year.Such losses in Russia’s mighty mining, oil and gas companies have now raised the specter of defaults by the wealthy but secretive coterie of Russian businessmen known as the oligarchs. Peering into their finances has always been a guessing game.The Russian stock market is now about where it was on Aug. 17, when authorities halted trading for two days and announced a more than $150 billion stimulus package of loans to banks and tax cuts, which the market has largely shrugged off. On Monday, Vladimir V. Putin, the prime minister, said he would set up a committee to study new responses to the crisis. A deputy minister of economy said Russia plans additional, unspecified stimulus measures.Iceland’s banks were celebrated not long ago for transforming an island of fishing villages into an economic dynamo by lending money to the world. But now the global credit squeeze is threatening to swamp those overleveraged banks, and the country with it.The position of Iceland’s banks had deteriorated greatly over the last 24 hours, Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde said in a television address from Reykjavik on Monday. So much so that the country passed legislation Monday allowing the government to take wide-ranging powers over its banks.Mr. Haarde said all bank deposits would be guaranteed by the country — following Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and others.The prime minister had already asked the country’s pension funds and its two biggest banks, Kaupthing Bank and Landsbanki Islands, to sell some foreign assets and repatriate the proceeds so the country would get an infusion of capital. With the new legislation, the government is now able to decide whether to merge pension funds and banks or declare some bankrupt.The steps were also desperately needed to stop the tailspin of the country’s currency, which only destabilized the economy further. The Icelandic krona fell 43 percent against the euro this year mainly because investors feared the government will be forced to step in and support the banks — something it could not afford to do on its own.Assets held by the country’s main banks are nine times the size of the entire economy.Iceland’s problems are deeply rooted in the history of its financial services industry, which grew out of proportion to the country’s 319,355 population ever since the sector was privatized and deregulated about eight years ago. The banks tapped capital markets to finance their rapid expansion into Britain and as far as China and set off an investment boom that created a whole league of new billionaires.But it also left the country with a large current-account deficit and its economy and financial market vulnerable to a credit markets squeeze. Iceland had its first warning in April when the krona fell 26 percent in four months as traders started to doubt the ability of the government to sustain the stability of its inflated banking sector.The fear was that Iceland’s banks could default on their foreign loans. A month later, the central banks of Sweden, Denmark and Norway came to its rescue and offered an emergency loan. Back then, it helped to reinstate some trust in the country’s financial system and economy but other Europeans have their own problems this time.Two weeks ago, President Felipe Calderón of Mexico, during a visit to the New York Times offices in Manhattan, noted that in previous decades when the United States would catch a cold Latin America would catch pneumonia. Nowadays, he said that day, when America catches pneumonia, Latin America catches only a cold.That might have been wishful thinking. With some 85 percent of Mexican exports going to the United States, and half of its foreign investment flowing from there, Mexico is likely to be the Latin American country most affected by the financial woes on Wall Street when all is said and done. Remittances, the second-biggest source of foreign exchange for Mexico, are flat and falling, said Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, a Mexico expert and political fellow at the Brookings Institute. And Mexico’s peso fell 6.4 percent in September, its worst month since August of 1998.Mexico’s banking sector could present a bigger challenge. Some 82 percent of Mexican banking assets are foreign-owned, of which about one-third are in American hands, about one-third owned by Spanish banks and the rest owned by other European banks, Mr. Martinez-Diaz said.“The crisis could be transmitted to Mexico through those banking connections,” he said. “If there is a crisis in the Spanish market they may retrench and stop lending to Mexico for some time.”As companies postpone big investments until at least next year, regular Mexicans will most likely tighten their belts, stay home more and perhaps put off large expenditures. “The whole economy will go into a wait-and-see mode, to see which way the U.S. economy goes,” he said.With Monday’s drop, Brazil’s stock markets has plunged 45 percent this year. But the country continues to grow at more than 5 percent a year.It has done more than any country in Latin America to set aside money during the commodity boom. The last two governments have accumulated more than $200 billion in foreign reserves and billions more in stabilization funds. Brazil has diversified its economy and lowered its exposure to the United States, which accounts for only 15 percent of Brazil’s exports now, down from about 50 percent at the beginning of the decade.But while household spending has driven much of the recent growth in the economy, Brazil remains highly sensitive to commodity prices. On Monday, government officials sought to play down the effect of the market’s fall and broad concerns about emerging markets.One silver lining in the sell-off may be the effect the crisis is having on the Brazilian real, which lost 17 percent of its value in September, its worst performance since September of 2002. While that will sap buying power for consumers, it provides welcome relief for industrialists in the country that were warning that Brazil’s exports were becoming too expensive.'"
"'08-10-07,'0','Mr. Allen, the main prosecution witness, has been on the stand since last week. Prosecutors contend that Mr. Stevens knew full well that the gifts and services from Mr. Allen and his company, the Veco Corporation, were provided to him free.Mr. Allen, a hulking former welder who ended up running a company that was worth $380 million, and Mr. Stevens, a Harvard Law School graduate who has represented Alaska in the Senate for 40 years, were once close friends, going to resorts together and sharing ownership of a racehorse.Mr. Allen testified that he had not sent bills for the work done on the Stevens home by Veco workers for several reasons. He said he had liked and admired Mr. Stevens and wanted to help him. But he also testified that although Mr. Stevens sent him two notes asking for bills, the senator sent an emissary who told him explicitly not to furnish them. The emissary told him that the notes asking for bills were simply to create a record to protect Mr. Stevens.In his testimony and taped calls, Mr. Allen comes across as clearly pained by his role in testifying against Mr. Stevens. Even though the F.B.I. is listening in, he repeatedly apologizes to Mr. Stevens for their problems. At one point, Mr. Allen, a gruff and rugged man, says to Mr. Stevens, “I love you, you know.”Although Mr. Allen often seemed a reluctant prosecution witness, he acknowledged that he had agreed to become one as part of a deal with the Justice Department. He has already been convicted of three felony counts relating to his bribing of state legislators.He agreed to cooperate on the first day he was approached by the F.B.I. in exchange for a promise that his grown children would not be prosecuted, he said. He has not yet been sentenced because prosecutors will make a recommendation based on his cooperation in the Stevens trial.In the taped conversations, Mr. Stevens, for his part, repeatedly tries to calm Mr. Allen, telling him he is “one of my best friends” and urging him to take care of his health.“Get out in the community,” he urges Mr. Allen in a pep talk. “You’re not going to let this thing whip you.”Mr. Stevens’s chief lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, began his cross-examination of Mr. Allen gently on Monday, having him agree that he was a generous man who liked to do favors for people like Mr. Stevens.Mr. Sullivan noted that Mr. Stevens had done “guy things together” and that Mr. Allen had stayed overnight several times in the Stevens home. The relationship was “one of pure friendship, wasn’t it,” Mr. Sullivan asked. Mr. Allen responded to all such questions with a simple “yes” or “yep.”Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of Federal District Court put off until Tuesday a hearing on the defense lawyers’ latest call for a mistrial over what they said was evidence that the Justice Department had improperly withheld information from them. The department has called the claim “theatrics and hyperbole” and said prosecutors had not withheld any information they have been required to turn over.Judge Sullivan earlier admonished prosecutors on two occasions for failings, though he declined to declare a mistrial.'"
"'08-10-07,'0','Over the weekend, Mr. Obama more accurately characterized the McCain plan as a swap but one that would work to the detriment of millions. Middle-class families, he said, would “watch the system they rely on begin to unravel before their eyes.”The business leaders said that was also their fear. Despite steady declines this decade, employers still provide coverage to 62 percent of Americans younger than 65. Surveys show that they want to continue doing so to attract and maintain a productive workforce.The business leaders forecast that Mr. McCain’s free-market approach would impose particular burdens on small businesses and old-line manufacturers that are already struggling.“To some in the business community, this is very discomforting,” said R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president for government affairs at the Chamber of Commerce. “The private marketplace, in my opinion, is ill prepared today with an infrastructure for an individual-based health insurance system.”Health economists are ideologically divided over Mr. McCain’s plan. Analysts who support it project that it might provide coverage to 25 million people, while critics predict that the number of newly insured would peak at five million and then decline.Though Mr. McCain says his plan would not add to federal spending, the Tax Policy Center has estimated that it will cost at least $1.3 trillion over 10 years. And while right-leaning economists emphasize that the plan would provide a tax cut for the average American, opponents respond that certain high-earners will face an increase and that some in the middle class may break even only by reducing their coverage.The centerpiece of Mr. McCain’s plan is the elimination of the provision that has, since 1954, excluded the value of employer-sponsored health benefits from a worker’s taxable income. The exclusion can be worth thousands of dollars for some workers.In its place, Mr. McCain would offer all Americans income tax credits of $2,500 per person or $5,000 per family for heath coverage, regardless of how they bought it.Mr. McCain would not change the ability of companies to deduct health benefits as a business expense on their corporate income taxes. And advisers have said he would continue to exclude the value of health benefits from the payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare.The income-tax exclusion benefits 162.5 million Americans but costs the federal government $145.3 billion in foregone revenue, second only to the tax break for retirement account contributions, according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.Still, the exclusion has encouraged the pooling of workers into large purchasing groups that tend to lower costs. And with group coverage, no one can be denied coverage, everyone pays the same rates and the healthy and wealthy essentially subsidize the sick and the poor. Consequently, it is often more expensive to buy equivalent coverage as an individual, partly because insurers pass along the administrative costs of weeding out unacceptable risks.The exclusion has long been criticized as unfair because the 18 million people who buy health insurance on their own are not entitled to it. Critics also say that it is most valuable to those in high tax brackets with the costliest health plans, that it contributes to job-lock, and that the subsidization of group insurance encourages people to buy more coverage and consume more health care than they need, driving up health spending.Mr. McCain and his health advisers argue that replacing the tax exclusion with tax credits for all would encourage consumers to shop more deliberately, stoking competition in the marketplace and lowering premiums. He would allow them to shop for policies across state lines.“It will help to change the whole dynamic of the current health care system by putting individuals and families back in charge and forcing insurance companies to respond with better service at lower cost,” Mr. McCain wrote recently in The New England Journal of Medicine.For some workers, depending on their tax bracket and insurance costs, the new tax credits would exceed the value of the tax exclusion, making the swap profitable. But with the average employer-sponsored family policy costing $12,680 this year, other workers would find the exchange a losing proposition. They would either have to spend more, reduce their coverage or persuade employers to make up the difference.Officials with eight business trade groups contacted by The New York Times predicted the McCain plan would raise costs and force some employers to stop providing health benefits.A recent survey of 187 corporate executives by the American Benefits Council and Miller & Chevalier, a consulting firm, found that three-fourths felt the repeal of the tax exclusion would have a “strong negative impact” on their workers. Only 4 percent said they would provide additional pay to fill any gaps.John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, an association of leading chief executive officers, said his group instead supported extending the tax exclusion to those who bought coverage on their own.“One of the things we don’t want to do,” Mr. Castellani said, “is jeopardize 170 million Americans who do get insurance through their employers.”A number of business officials are worried that Mr. McCain’s tax credits would lure young and healthy workers into the individual market to take advantage of cheaper, less-generous policies. That, they say, would leave employers to cover an older and sicker pool of workers, forcing up premiums.Workers who found that they had less buying power with the tax credits than with the tax exclusion could be expected to pressure employers to raise salaries or benefit subsidies, the business officials said.“There are huge questions about the $5,000 per family being an insufficient amount in terms of being able to purchase the same coverage,” said Mr. Josten with the Chamber of Commerce.Helen B. Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, a coalition of 300 companies, agreed that many workers would face a net loss. “The last thing you want to do to the average working person, especially when you’re bailing out big financial companies, is take something they hold near and dear partially away,” Ms. Darling said.Economists forecast that the problem would worsen over time because Mr. McCain, according to advisers, would index his tax credits to overall inflation. Health insurance premiums have grown four times faster than inflation since 1999.James A. Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, said concern that the tax credits would not keep up with inflation was a primary reason his 280 member companies “take a very dim view” of repealing the tax exclusion.Mr. McCain theorizes that if the government’s subsidization of health care is capped, consumers will cut back on their use of the system, slowing the growth in spending. But critics worry that he overestimates his ability to control health costs, and that a growing number of people will find they cannot obtain traditional coverage.'"
"'08-10-07,'0','“We are getting close,” said Don Ness, the mayor of Duluth, population 88,000, with 800 full-time city workers. “But it seems there is new bad news every week that puts us further behind. We have no cushion available to us. And we now lack the finance tools that could have assisted us getting through our current financial crisis.”While some of the nation’s largest cities have had perennial budget trouble and others have a history of suffering since the demise of major manufacturing, some of the cities that are facing economic hardship this time around were used to balancing their budgets without too much trouble.And the largest are struggling even more than usual: Los Angeles and Chicago are each facing shortfalls in the $400 million range. In New York, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg last month ordered $1.5 billion in cuts over two fiscal years, and the financial situation is worsening by the day as Wall Street continues to struggle.“If they do their cuts and lay back on services and are still in the red and have to issue a bond or a note, the climate is not the best,” said Steve McLaughlin, a director of Municipal Market Advisers, an independent advisory firm. “If they need money quickly through a bond issuance, it’s going to be hard to get. There are a whole host of new challenges.”Cities as varied as Duluth, Phoenix and Atchison, Kan., have had to cut back and, in some cases, make drastic reductions that affect the quality of life for their residents.All over the country, parks are being sold, fees for routine services are going up and city workers are being laid off.Even prosperous Tempe, Ariz., is facing a loss of 75 to 100 city positions — 5 percent to 8 percent of its municipal work force — to help close a budget gap.“We are very well-positioned, but that is a relative statement,” said Mayor Hugh Hallman of Tempe. “We are obviously in the same boat that the whole U.S. and, frankly, global economy is in. A city like Tempe is hard-pressed to control everything about its own destiny.”In a survey of more than 300 municipalities released last month, the National League of Cities reported that four out of five finance officers said their cities would be less able to meet needs in 2009 than this year. The group called the findings troubling, with no sign of getting better.“This is the first time for at least two decades that all three major general tax sources — property, income and sales — have all declined at the same time,” said Michael A. Pagano, a co-author of the report and dean of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, Chicago. “That’s the real frightening thing for cities.”“It’s not like the 2000 or 1991 recessions; those hit the coasts first and flowed to the middle,” Dr. Pagano continued. “This one doesn’t differentiate between high-tech and low-tech cities, manufacturing towns or new exurbs.”“We’re watching housing prices decline still,” Dr. Pagano added. “The property tax receipts on that property today won’t be collected for at least 18 months. That puts us in fiscal 2010. So, for at least the next two fiscal years, we’re going to be feeling the lingering effects of the real estate decline.”Cities typically begin to look for cost savings in areas like the arts and recreation, then move, when pressed, to services like police and fire protection, or trash pickups. Many cities have already arrived at the latter stage.“We try to cut programs and services that impact the public the least,” said Toni Maccarone, a spokeswoman for the City of Phoenix. “Unfortunately, this time around, there’s going to be direct service cuts. That’s what makes it so hard. It’s police and fire, and parks and senior services, libraries.”Some cities, like Duluth, are constantly juggling ideas to stay afloat, even if they do not come to fruition. The city decided this week, for instance, that it will not part with its Minnehaha window despite the financial crisis. But the plan to sell the beachfront property is going forward, and, Mayor Ness said, it could bring in as much as $2 million — a big step toward a balanced budget.Atchison, a city in northeast Kansas with a population of just over 10,000, had begun what it considered a risky pattern of spending down its reserves to make ends meet. This year, however, to stem the bleeding it is consolidating several departments, enacting a 23 percent property tax increase, and asking employees to pick up a larger part of their health care costs.It will also be losing one of its 22 police officers and its only construction management position. Atchison relies on sales taxes for more than a quarter of its almost $6 million general fund budget.“When you already have a really trim work force, then any cuts hurt even more,” said Justin Der, the city manager.Phoenix, with its population of 1.5 million, has a much larger budget than Atchison but it, too, is largely reliant on sales taxes. In the last fiscal year, the city adopted a budget that included $89 million in cuts.“Unfortunately, the economy hasn’t improved; it’s gotten worse so all departments are currently working on another 30 percent cut,” Ms. Maccarone said. “When people aren’t shopping — buying new cars and refrigerators and other big-ticket items — we’re not getting the revenue.”“We are trying to be as creative as we can,” she said. “It’s been challenging. We’re just started our new fiscal year, and our forecast is just terrible.”'"
"'08-10-07,'0','“Sometimes we would be playing, and he would come back from somewhere in his car,” said Fico Ramos Enrique, 77. “And before even going back into the house, he would play with us.”Hemingway first came here in 1939. At the time, he rented the house from a Frenchman, though he was believed to have initially despised the place. But as he wandered around the rural neighborhood, he saw local children tossing around worn-out baseballs in the dusty street.“We didn’t know where else to play,” Blas said.Hemingway had grown up with the sport, according to J. Gerald Kennedy, a Hemingway scholar at Louisiana State University. As a child, he kept a huge collection of baseball cards and posters, but lost track of them when he moved to Europe.By 1940, Finca Vigia had grown on him. His new bride, Martha Gellhorn — wife No. 3 — adored it. So while Hemingway was out on one of his marathon fishing excursions, Gellhorn bought the house. Hemingway, Blas said, had promised the boys that when he returned, they would be allowed in to play.“Originally, I think they came over to steal the mangoes,” said Valerie Hemingway, who worked as Hemingway’s assistant from 1959 until his death in 1961 and later married Gregory. “Instead of shooing them away, Ernest found things for them to do. Feed the cats, pick up the mail and give them a few pennies. And when he knew Greg and Pat were coming, he started a baseball team.”Ramos was one of those boys, hired to hold doors in the house. Because he worked for Hemingway, he never called him Papa, using the term Caballero instead.“We were very poor,” Ramos said. “We lived in houses with dirt floors and straw roofs.”That first summer, after the children were introduced to Patrick and Gregory, known in those days as Gigi, Hemingway produced a complete set of new balls, bats and gloves. The local boys had never seen anything like them.The field was small, with a home plate and only two bases about 70 feet apart, Blas explained recently as he jogged around where the basepaths used to be. The grounds were neater then, he said. A tree has cropped up between where home and first used to be.“And that tree,” Blas said, pointing to a majestic 25-footer, “used to come up to my chest.”The land was flatter, the grass closely trimmed. Blas says he still remembers how the short blades felt between his toes, because the children never wore shoes. They owned only one pair, and their mothers would have been furious had they worn them out playing baseball. So Patrick and Gregory played shoeless, too.Hemingway tried to teach them other sports, like boxing and tennis. “Greg was a tremendous athlete, and Ernest was very proud of that,” Valerie Hemingway said. But the Cuban boys had little time for tennis, because none of them were any good at it. They knew how to handle a bat, not a racket.Eventually, Hemingway wondered if the children might enjoy the chalky white lines and groomed dirt of a real diamond. But if his backyard ballplayers were going to play on a real field, they would need to look the part. Soon, they were all being measured for jerseys and caps.There was only the small matter of what would be stitched onto the uniforms. After some deliberation, Blas said, they settled on the Estrellas de Gigi — the Gigi Stars. In royal blue letters, the word Stars was emblazoned across the chest with a star on the hats. Blas wore No. 5 for his hero, Joe DiMaggio.Dressed and ready to play on Wednesdays and Sundays, the white-flannel-clad Gigi Stars would pile over one another into Hemingway’s Chrysler and go out to the Club de Cazadores (the Hunters’ Club), where he used to take his sons skeet shooting. It was open exclusively to whites. For the six dark-skinned Cubans on the team, that would have been a concern. But with Papa, nothing was ever a problem. The Gigi Stars cruised in behind their coach.“Papa would bat, too,” Blas said. “When he got a hit, he would make one of the little kids run for him.”Exactly who was running and where hardly mattered in the game, because they never kept score. The cast of characters seldom changed, and one of the few times it did, it was only because of tragedy.Rodolfo Villarreal worked about the house with Ramos until age 10, when he slipped in the road. The driver of the car that ran over his abdomen never saw him. His death sent shockwaves through the team, and Hemingway went to Villarreal’s house to pay his respects. That was where he met Rodolfo’s older brother, Rene. Rene eventually took over Rodolfo’s job in the house and his place on the team.Hemingway did the same when Ramos’s sister died . He laid a wreath for her as he delivered his condolences.“For him to come to a house like ours ... ” said Ramos, fighting back tears. “Honestly, I was just an employee, but he always treated us like family.”After 1943, the Hemingway boys stopped coming to Cuba. They were older and had new interests. In later life, Valerie Hemingway said, they hardly spoke about the game. Gregory died in 2001, and Patrick now lives in Montana and never publicly discusses his father.After the boys left Cuba for the last time, the Gigi Stars used to stop by the farm to ask the butler if he knew when Patrick and Gigi had their vacations. “Soon?” Blas said. “What about this summer?”Without them, the game ended. The Stars went back to playing in the street. As they grew, the children returned to the house only once a year, to wish Papa “Feliz Navidad.” He would tell them stories about his travels, how they celebrated Christmas in the United States and whom this Santa Claus character was, Blas said. Then he would give them each a dollar.On their way out, they would pass the field where they had become the Gigi Stars. They never played there again. But nearly seven decades later, any mention of Papa’s ball field still opens a torrent of memories and a toothy white smile.“They were the most beautiful years of our lives,” Blas said. “It was like it was ours.”'"
"'08-10-07,'0','Indeed, the ripple effects from Europe and the United States were amplified as they spread to stock markets in Russia, Brazil, Indonesia and the Middle East.These countries had little to do with the subprime crisis but were vulnerable to a sudden halt in the flow of money. They lack even the veneer of national or regional cooperation that protects Europe and the United States. Stock markets in emerging economies recorded their worst one-day decline in 21 years on Monday, with trading in Russia and Brazil halted to stem an investor panic.“It looks pretty ugly down the road,” said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund who specializes in financial crises. “Everybody is going to get caught up in this.”The global nature of the crisis and its growing collateral damage ought to galvanize countries to work together to fashion a concerted response, Mr. Johnson said. There is a chance to do that this week, with dozens of finance ministers and central bankers converging on Washington for the annual meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank.The trouble is, these institutions no longer have the resources or authority to lead such an effort. The I.M.F., which played a central role in the Asian crisis, has been relegated to the sidelines this time — its credibility tarnished by that episode and its skills ill-suited to a crisis in advanced economies. These days, it mainly issues lonely warnings about the impact on developing countries.The Group of 7, which once functioned as a sort of command center for the global economy, is similarly depleted, according to critics. It no longer represents the world’s economic drivers, they said, and badly needs to be expanded to include rising powers like China and India.“The globalization of the crisis means we need a globalization of responses,” said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “But most of the responses will be national. For all the institutions we have, we don’t have the right institutions to do this.”That is particularly true in Europe, which has an effective central bank but lacks a unified legislature or treasury to coordinate or finance a rescue of the banking system. So far, economists say, Europe’s response to the crisis in its banks has been mostly marked by denial and dissension.From London to Berlin, governments are clinging to a piecemeal approach. The British and the Germans have resisted a broader solution, because they fear they will end up rescuing their neighbors.A weekend meeting of European leaders in Paris, called by President Nicolas Sarkozy, ended with a pledge that Europe would not countenance a bank failure like that of Lehman Brothers, but little else.Part of the problem, experts said, is the nature of this crisis: bailouts of banks are costly and unpopular with taxpayers — even more so, as in Europe, where burden sharing is a perennial sore point.“Taxpayers won’t agree to bail out the banking system of other countries,” said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. “Not even in Europe, where you have a neutral framework, could you get people to cooperate on a joint effort.”As the problems in Europe have worsened, the crisis has taken on an “every country for itself” quality. When Ireland placed a guarantee on all bank deposits and debt last week, it angered neighbors, who feared capital would flee their banks to the safer haven of Dublin. Now, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Austria have all pledged to guarantee deposits.“If you do this one by one, it destabilizes people’s deposits in other countries,” Mr. Johnson said. “It’s mind-boggling that the Europeans have coordinated so little up until this point.”With Europe and the United States deep in crisis, economists said, the rest of the world could not help but suffer. Robert B. Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, warned that the crisis could be a “tipping point” for the developing world.“A drop in exports, as well as capital inflow, will trigger a falloff in investments,” Mr. Zoellick said in a speech on Monday. “Deceleration of growth and deteriorating financial conditions, combined with monetary tightening, will trigger business failures and possibly banking emergencies.”The immediate danger, economists say, are countries in Eastern and Central Europe, like Bulgaria and Estonia, which run steep trade deficits and are vulnerable to a sudden flight of foreign capital.Iceland, with an overheated economy and suffocating foreign debt, may prove to be the first national casualty of the crisis. On Monday, threatened by a wholesale financial collapse, the government in Reykjavik assumed sweeping powers to intervene in its banking industry.“We were faced with the real possibility that the national economy would be sucked into the global banking swell and end in national bankruptcy,” Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde said on Monday.But with global growth slowing sharply, the problems could spread to larger emerging markets, even China, which has a hefty current account surplus and immense foreign reserves.“Where is China going to sell its exports?” Mr. Johnson of M.I.T. said. “Everyone is going into recession at the same time.”This week, the focus will be on the Group of 7, whose finance ministers and central bankers are scheduled to meet on Friday at the Treasury Department. The group issued a perfunctory statement of support for the United States, after the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., briefed members about the rescue plan in a conference call two weeks ago.But European finance ministers, notably Peer Steinbrück of Germany, noted that the crisis began in the United States, and played down the need for a systemic European response.Mr. Zoellick, in his speech, said flatly that the Group of 7 “is not working.” He advocates expanding the group — which includes the United States, Canada, Britain, Italy, France, Germany and Japan — to include emerging economies like Brazil, China, India and Saudi Arabia.The urgency of the moment, experts said, demands a bolder response from the Group of 7. Mr. Bergsten said the group should commit to a coordinated stimulus plan to stave off a recession.“Just as the U.S. rescue plan may not be enough,” he said, “a U.S. stimulus plan by itself will not be enough.”'"
"'08-10-07,'0','The case, Altria Group Inc. v. Good, No. 07-562, is the court’s latest exploration of the limits of pre-emption, the legal doctrine that can prohibit lawsuits concerning products that have met federal standards.The case was brought by three plaintiffs from Maine as a proposed class action. They sued Altria and its Philip Morris USA unit for fraud under Maine’s Unfair Trade Practices Act, saying they had been injured by their reliance on what they called the companies’ false statements.The defendants countered by invoking a federal law, the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, which says “no requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion” of cigarettes that follow federal labeling requirements.The parties agreed that the provision prohibited lawsuits challenging advertising claims “based on smoking and health.” But they disagreed about whether the current fraud suit, which seeks money for economic rather than medical harm, was inextricably intertwined with claims about smoking and health.Theodore B. Olson, representing the tobacco companies, said the plaintiffs’ fundamental claim — that they had been misled into buying cigarettes they believed were safer than regular ones — was inescapably about smoking and health.David C. Frederick, representing the plaintiffs, said the federal law did not pre-empt fraud suits brought under general state consumer protection laws. Mr. Frederick drew on a fractured 1992 Supreme Court decision, Cipollone v. Liggett Group, in which a four-justice plurality said Congress had not meant to pre-empt all fraud suits concerning cigarettes.Mr. Frederick said there was a difference between state laws “specially targeted at the cigarette industry” and “a generally applicable rule against deception,” one that would not entangle a jury into “any special inquiry about smoking and health.” Only the first sort of law is pre-empted, he said.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. did not seem to be persuaded.“How do you tell whether it’s deceptive or not if you don’t look at the relationship between smoking and health?” Chief Justice Roberts asked. “They have an advertisement that says light cigarettes are better for you than regular cigarettes. You have to know what the relationship is between smoking and health to determine whether that’s deceptive.”Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter asked Mr. Frederick what sort of harm remained if the suit was entirely divorced from claims about health.“So what are your damages?” Justice Kennedy asked.Neither justice seemed satisfied with Mr. Frederick’s response that “economists have projected” that cigarette buyers would have acted differently had they known the truth.Justice Stephen G. Breyer tried to suggest a line between permissible and forbidden lawsuits.“I can totally understand why Congress would not want 50 states telling cigarette companies what to say about health and smoking,” Justice Breyer said. “What I can’t understand is why Congress would want to get rid of, in this area, the traditional rule that advertising has to tell the truth.”The federal government has played a minor role in the case.To the frustration of several justices, the government took no position on the central issue of whether the federal law pre-empted the state claims, in so many words. Rather, the solicitor general’s office submitted a vigorous brief supporting the plaintiffs limited to a separate argument — that the trade commission’s actions had not pre-empted the suit by implication.Mr. Olson, the companies’ lawyer, had already all but thrown his argument on that point overboard by the time the government’s lawyer rose to speak.“I’d like to spend no time on the implied pre-emption argument,” he said.Asked repeatedly where the government stood on the effect of the federal law itself, Douglas Hallward-Driemeier, an assistant to the solicitor general, would not bite. “The United States has not taken a position on the bottom line” of the main issue in the case, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier said.On the first day of its term, the court also issued an 82-page list of orders concerning cases that had accumulated over its summer break. It accepted no new cases and turned down several that had gained public attention.The court will not hear cases about “Choose Life” license plates, Bible consultation during jury deliberations, whether criminal juries must act unanimously and the constitutionality of the way some patent judges have been appointed. The court took no action in the case of Troy A. Davis, a death row inmate in Georgia who says he is innocent. The court, which has granted a stay in the case, will consider whether to hear Mr. Davis’s appeal at its next private conference, on Friday.The list of orders also suggested that Justice Breyer and his wife had sold some of the dozens of stocks they held, allowing the justice to participate in more cases. The development was first reported by Bloomberg News.Kathleen Arberg, the court’s public information officer, confirmed the sales. “Justice Breyer and his wife intend to continue to sell shares” under a law that permits judges to defer paying capital gains taxes, Ms. Arberg said, “in order to minimize the number of instances in which financial conflicts require recusal.”'"
"'08-10-07,'0','In the afternoon, Mr. Bloomberg led an economic round-table discussion with his counterpart, Mayor Boris Johnson, and about two dozen other titans of finance and government. And he offered, just as he has done repeatedly in City Hall, a glass-is-half-full view of the crisis, telling reporters that he had a “perspective of optimism” because there had been “up markets and down markets.”He added, “The danger is that we overreact.”Mr. Bloomberg, looking quite comfortable in a city where he owns a home, in the fashionable Cadogan Square neighborhood, then received the Freedom of the City of London — the equivalent of getting the key to the city in New York. The award is a framed certificate approximately the size of a tie box. Mr. Bloomberg said his mother would be proud of him.But a few hours later (with his meeting with Prince Harry sandwiched in between), the mood had changed perceptibly at Haberdashers’ Hall, given the tumbling prices of stocks around the world.“I’m sure we’ve been watching everything on a Bloomberg screen,” said Stuart Fraser, the policy chairman of the City of London, the capital’s financial district. He was referring, of course, to the Bloomberg terminals, filled with up-to-the-minute financial information, that helped to make the mayor a billionaire an estimated 20 times over.During his speech, Mr. Bloomberg said, in one of many ad-libbed moments: “It’s really scary what’s going on out there.”At another point, he expressed, for the first time, his disagreement with the federal government’s decision not to intervene and save Lehman Brothers.“It would have been a lot cheaper for society to do the same thing at Lehman Brothers,” he said, referring to the government’s $700 billion bailout. “Wipe out the stockholders, fire the management, but keep the organizations going. That would have been a more intelligent thing to do.”He continued: “I do think that we live in a world where the consequences of big companies’ going out of business should give us all pause to think before we say: ‘Hey, it’s economic Darwinism. If they weren’t smart enough, the heck with them.’ You can’t do that in the real world, and you shouldn’t do that in the real world.”'"
"'08-10-07,'0','Forecast International, another prominent industry analyst, issued its own outlook in late September that predicted another record year in 2009, followed by a three-year decline that would reflect worsening economic conditions.In discussions with corporate flight departments in the United States, Honeywell analysts are already picking up signs of a decline in business jet use.“Flying hours are slowing in general, mostly concentrated in smaller jets,” said TK Kallenbach, marketing vice president at Honeywell Aerospace.Departures of private jets, as measured by the Federal Aviation Administration, are also declining, Mr. Kallenbach said. The sharpest declines have been in the use of the least expensive jets.“To date in 2008, 78 percent of the reduction in flight hours has been concentrated in light jets and very light jets,” he said. “When fuel prices started to go up, they affected the light-jet guys the most, guys who are flying on a more discretionary basis,” he said.Another developing trend is a large inventory of used jets for sale. Again, it is primarily in the low end of the market — light-cabin jets that sell new for $2.5 million to about $6 million.“You see a lot of light jets and very light jets hitting that used-aircraft market,” Mr. Kallenbach said, “whereas it’s extremely difficult to buy a used Global right now; it’s hard to find a used G550.” He was referring to Bombardier’s line of big Global 5000 and Global Express jets, which sell for about $45 million, and Gulfstream Aerospace’s G550s, which cost about $59 million.There is, of course, a private jet market that’s even richer. That is the market in wide-bodied airliners converted to corporate or private use by extremely wealthy people. That market seems to be doing just fine.At Lufthansa Technik, which installs custom cabins on big airliners for private use, demand for conversions of wide-body airliners at the “uppermost levels of the business-jet market” has “risen dramatically,” the company, a subsidiary of the German airline, said in Orlando.Lufthansa Technik has contracts to provide V.I.P. interiors for two Airbus A380 superjumbo planes (list price, around $330 million without interior fixtures), and two A340s (list price, $225 million) by 2011. In Orlando, the company announced that it had new letters of intent to outfit interiors of three Boeing 747-800s (which cost about $260 million) and three Boeing 787s (not yet in service, but expected to cost around $170 million).The company also said it was negotiating with six other customers for 787 private cabins and five others who want to have 747-800s outfitted at its factory in Hamburg, Germany, where Lufthansa has already done interiors for 15 Boeing 747s that are currently flying the world in private hands.'"
"'08-10-07,'0','Sleeping in a room with a fan lowers a baby’s risk of sudden infant death syndrome by 72 percent, a new study has found.The finding, published Monday in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, is the latest evidence to suggest that a baby’s sleep environment is a critical factor in the risk of SIDS, which is diagnosed when an infant’s sudden death cannot be explained by other factors.The study was not designed to identify why fans make a difference, but researchers said they thought that by circulating air, fans lowered the risk of “rebreathing” exhaled carbon dioxide. That risk has been suggested as a reason the rate of SIDS is higher when children sleep on their stomach, in a soft bed or without a pacifier.Since 1992 the rate of SIDS deaths has dropped by more than half, to about one death per 2,000 live births from 2.4 per 1,000. The decline is linked to a national “Back to Sleep” campaign that promotes putting babies on their back instead of their stomach, which has been shown to lower the risk of sudden death.The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends that parents avoid soft bedding, allow babies to use a pacifier and avoid overheating a baby’s room.'"
"'08-10-07,'0','Gasoline prices are bound to go lower, experts say, as oil prices fall. West Texas intermediate crude for November delivery fell 6 percent to close at $87.81 in New York trading on Monday.What makes the sudden drop in oil and gasoline prices all the more surprising is that it comes at a time when oil company executives are realizing that damage to oil platforms and underwater pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico from Hurricane Ike is more serious than originally thought.The federal Minerals Management Service reported on Monday that 46.2 percent of oil production and 40.6 percent of natural gas production were still shut down. Most platforms were shut down for safety reasons before Hurricane Gustav entered the gulf in late August and then remained shut as the more powerful Ike struck last month.Fifty-two of 3,800 production platforms were destroyed, and 73 additional platforms had moderate to considerable damage.Eight pipeline systems that transport oil and gas output onshore and five onshore natural gas processing plants suffered damage, and several more oil pipeline systems are still undergoing damage assessments. Nearly all of the 15 gulf refineries that were shut down by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike are operating normally again, although a few are still struggling to repair damage from flooding.The gulf accounts for about 25 percent of the nation’s domestic oil production and 15 percent of natural gas output. Government and industry officials say as much as a quarter of the gulf’s oil production could still be out in a month.“If this had happened during a brisk economy, it might have been haunting, but we are far from a brisk economy,” said Tom Kloza, senior oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. “As long as demand remains flat,” he added, normal gulf output at this time of year “is not needed.”The disruption caused shortages at gasoline stations around the Southeast for several weeks, and gasoline prices in Atlanta remain about a half-dollar higher than the national average. But shortages have eased, as gasoline flowing through the Colonial pipeline connecting the gulf to the Southeast is returning to normal levels.The reason that prices are going down despite falling gulf production is the steady drop in gasoline demand. A recent report by the Energy Department showed that consumption in July was the lowest in 11 years for the month, traditionally one of the heaviest for driving. Demand is also declining rapidly in Europe and other industrial regions because of high fuel prices and the global economic slowdown.“The financial contagion that is spreading to Europe is raising concerns about a slowdown in oil demand on the Continent that could perhaps eclipse what has already happened in the U.S.,” wrote Addison Armstrong, an energy analyst at Tradition Energy, on Monday. “Oil traders are on watch of any signs that Chinese demand could follow suit.”'"
"'08-10-07,'0','In his show, Alber Elbaz caught the flavor for the exotic, with lush colors and leopard prints. Africa has been a potent theme of the collections, with Azzedine Alaïa making the most exuberant display in raffia and python.So one of the strangest Paris seasons ended, made confusing by deepening economic worries, bouts of real creativity and the feeling that, as hard as some designers worked, retailers will have to work even harder next spring to get customers to come into the stores just for a look.A number of collections should be celebrated. Mr. Elbaz’s best dresses had a nonchalant style of draping; hardly D.I.Y., but if you’re wearing a one-shoulder dress in fireball-orange silk with a puff of fabric grazing your face and arm, the effect should be slightly unserious. Many of the outfits were in taffeta, cloqué and duchess silk, and Mr. Elbaz gave them volume in simple ways — and sometimes with an interior band of grosgrain to hold things in place — and some dresses were in fact a top and a skirt. He cut the tops long so they could also be worn in a different proportion with pants, and he twisted the fabric slightly so the shape wouldn’t look flat and boring.What looked new were slim pants with tacked-down pleats that gave shape to the waist; there was no actual waistband. Full sleeves, set into the shoulders of jewel-neck cloqué blouses, created a very narrow line — like a twig, which of course you may not be.But you can play. The collection was, finally, in that spirit — the stilettos joyfully blitzed with tacky beads, a bone silk dress embroidered with stones in an abstract leopard pattern.Alexander McQueen used computer images of crushed crystals, wood grains, animals, human skeletons and the iron grid of the Eiffel Tower as the basis for dazzling digitalized prints on silk jersey. The palette includes smoky grays, delphinium blues and vibrant parrot colors that look fractured by a prism. All the dress and jacket shapes were within the realm of the imagination, especially the fluttery dresses, and then you had the particular flavor of the engineered prints.Mr. McQueen said his show was inspired by Darwinism and the Industrial Revolution, among other world-shaping forces. That gave him the historical ground for his romantic tailoring, leather corset belts, and molded showpiece dresses (covered with pounds of crystals and duly translated into more wearable dresses in the showroom). It’s just a good thing that he managed to pull out the prints from all that antiquity.Backstage, in his fully furnished dressing room, John Galliano said that his vividly colored collection was inspired by James Gillray, an 18th-century caricaturist.I’m sure my eyes glazed over. “I’ll Google him,” I said.Here is a passage from the Tate Museum site: “Gillray’s targets range from lecherous men to amateur actors and musicians, and include the passion for art collecting as well as sex and gambling; all are exposed with great wit and graphic invention but also unrelenting cruelty.”You could have blown me over with a Chanel feather: it sounded just like the fashion world, especially the bit about a “passion for art collecting.” Mr. Galliano indeed captured Gillray’s distinctly satirical palette of sunny yellows, baby and rosy pinks, and aristocratic blues — ideal for making light of pompous things. Under Bo Peep bonnets and sleeping caps made extreme by the milliner Stephen Jones, Mr. Galliano presented clothes that were light and pretty in the best sense.No need to analyze a draped dress in pink silk jersey with drawstrings at the waist and hem. It fell on the body in a flattering way and looked fresh and new. The same was true of puffy blouses in crisp cotton or silk that spilled off one shoulder, and looked gentle and inviting compared with some of the ugly and overwrought clothes we’ve seen in the last two weeks.There was probably not a better evening dress anywhere in Paris (well, maybe with the exception of Chanel and Alaïa) than a square-neck gown in cream silk jersey with a lightly draped bodice, soft sleeves and a long sleek skirt. A number of Mr. Galliano’s dresses were quite transparent, requiring a slip and a decent body, but the real measure of this wonderful show was how unfussy and free it was.Chloé’s new designer, Hannah MacGibbon, made a fair start, offering sundresses with ruffled crisscrossed backs, a sharp-shouldered jumpsuit in khaki cotton, and a cool, one-shoulder dress in nutmeg cotton with side lacing. Sandals were flat (black straps, say, with a Kelly green sole). Scalloping (around hems and dinosaur-style down the sleeves of a bitter-lemon coat) looked cute in small doses. No doubt Ms. MacGibbon, who worked at the house once before under Phoebe Philo, will hear from plenty of critics about her very large trousers, and look back upon them critically herself and feed her eye from smaller plates.'"
"'08-10-07,'0','Here his story segues smoothly into a lucid discussion of cancer immunobiology, in which the bad cells can be tamed by manipulations of their environment. And then we are in the kitchen, reviewing its contents from the specific perspective of cancer prevention.This familiar terrain encompasses the antioxidants, the good fats, the whole grains and the green teas. There are the combinations essential to maintain (you must take your turmeric with pepper) and the ones to avoid (no milk with your dark chocolate). Cancer “feeds on sugar” but supposedly not on agave nectar; on omega-6 trans fats but not the omega-3s. The blanket of body fat in the obese creates a giant repository of fat-soluble carcinogens.We hear the story of Lenny, who adopted a diet heavy on cabbage, berries and dark chocolate, and survived pancreatic cancer for an impressive four and a half years. We meet vegetable-fed mice, who seem more active and curious and have slower-growing tumors than their chow-fed brothers. And Dr. Servan-Schreiber himself, of course, is still doing well at age 47 — 14 years after his initial diagnosis.For each of the foods on his anticancer shopping list there is a shred of scientific evidence — usually from experiments done on cells in culture, sometimes from studies of mice with cancer, and occasionally from small studies on actual human beings. For none is there the kind of data that would support, say, the licensing of a new drug.Extracts of garlic, onions and leeks, for instance, will demolish all kinds of cancer cells in a culture. Whether these vegetables are still active in the busy metropolis of the body, with thousands of cellular processes going on at once, is another question: once the leek is chewed, swallowed, demolished by intestinal enzymes and absorbed into the blood, how likely are its molecules to brush up against a cancer cell, let alone engage it in armed combat? No one knows.Among the militant foodists, Dr. Servan-Schreiber is something of a moderate. He warns against rejecting standard medical treatments for food-based therapy, and admits that much is unknown about exactly how powerful his vegetables are.He is less reserved in a discussion of “the anticancer mind,” an enthusiastic re-creation of the archaic theory that a “cancer personality” — passive, saintly and repressed — enables tumors to flourish, while self-actualization makes them recede. Susan Sontag, who spent much of her intellectual muscle arguing exactly the reverse, would have had a field day with this section.Still, this book is destined to sell widely and will probably become a bible in some homes. This fact alone makes it worth considering, not so much for what it says as for the clarity with which it illuminates the need it so deftly fills.It is that old primal need to gain some control over a random and malevolent universe, the one (as any toddler’s relatives can attest) often won on the battleground of food. The popularity of books like this one makes it clear that for many adults there are two such universes to contend with: the malevolence of illness and that of orthodox medicine, somehow now perceived as conjoined enemies of health.So these folks find control by heading determinedly to the supermarket and the refrigerator and the stove, the support groups, the treadmills and the massage tables. When it comes to cancer, these comforts are unlikely to hurt much, but the evidence is still out for whether they help.'"
"'08-10-07,'0','The newly remastered 25th-anniversary edition from Warner Home Video restores the film’s subtle textures (almost tactile in the Blu-ray version) and offers both the upbeat studio ending and Mr. Brickman’s original, more tentative and melancholic conclusion. (Warner Home Video, Blu-ray, $28.99; standard-definition, $19.96, R)A masterpiece of the German silent cinema, F. W. Murnau’s 1924 film has never looked as dazzling on American home video as it does in this new edition from Kino International. It was transferred from a 2003 restoration by Luciano Berriatúa based on several sources, including original camera negatives.At the time of its release, the film was much admired for Emil Jannings’s performance as an aging hotel porter who is demoted, losing his imposing, military-style coat and, with it, his social status and self-respect. Today Jannings’s work seems somewhat lugubrious, compared with Murnau’s innovative camera movements: sustained tracking and crane shots with a marvelous fluidity that helped establish an aesthetic alternative to the American montage style developed most famously by D. W. Griffith.A revelation of this new version, which attempts to reconstruct the film as it was seen by German audiences, is that it contains more camera movement than the one made for American release. (A 40-minute documentary included here offers side-by-side comparisons of the German, the American and a third “international” version of the film, which frequently use different takes and editing patterns.) Murnau’s innovations turn out to be even more extensive and original than we had thought: where the American version breaks down a scene, like Jannings’s dismissal by his uncaring boss, into a cluster of close-ups, the German version creates the illusion of a single continuous shot (though it is actually two shots, bridged by a dissolve) that allows the viewer’s eye to wander freely. We seem to chance upon the details (like Jannings’s groping for his glasses, to read the fine print of his dismissal notice) that the American edition emphatically underlines.By giving the hotel name an English spelling (Atlantic), a modern design and a prime location on a block of skyscrapers, Murnau creates a visual and metaphorical sense that this chillingly impersonal institution is located in Manhattan, while the tenement square where Jannings lives with his wife and niece has the cramped, tumbledown atmosphere of old Berlin.Past readings of “The Last Laugh” (or “Der Letzte Mann,” “The Last Man,” in its German title) have centered on the anti-militaristic implications of Jannings’s dismissal: stripped of his coat, he is no longer fearsome, but a shuddering, pathetic figure. But a nationalistic reading also seems possible: Jannings is a Germany stripped and humiliated by American and European demands for war reparations, a world leader turned into the political equivalent of a washroom attendant, the job that Jannings is given after his dismissal as doorman.Kino’s edition of “The Last Laugh” features a surround-stereo recording of Guiseppe Becce’s original 1924 score, as well as a second disc with the complete (though unrestored) international version of the film (with a different score by Timothy Brock).

"'08-10-07,'0','The use of acetaminophen in the first year of life is associated with an increased risk for asthma, eczema and allergic runny nose later in childhood, a New Zealand study reports. Acetaminophen is sold in the United States under the brand name Tylenol and as an ingredient in many other pain relievers.The study, published in the Sept. 20 issue of The Lancet, included data from more than 190,000 6- and 7-year-old children in 28 countries whose parents had responded to questionnaires about various health and diet practices.After controlling for numerous factors, including breast-feeding, antibiotic use and parental smoking, they found that children given acetaminophen before age 1 had an almost 50 percent increased risk for asthma, eczema and allergy compared with those given none.“We can’t be certain that acetaminophen is a cause,” said a co-author, Tadd Clayton of the University of Auckland. “We can only say that it is associated. People should continue to follow the recommendation of the W.H.O., which is that acetaminophen should be reserved for children with a high fever, 101.3 degrees or more.”The study is large, but the medical information was obtained from parents after the fact, and children with asthma and related illnesses may be more likely to be treated with acetaminophen in the first place.'"
"'08-10-07,'0','WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve said Monday that it would begin paying interest on commercial banks’ reserves and would expand its loan program to squeezed banks by billions of dollars, fresh steps to help ease a painful credit crisis.In the $700 billion bailout bill President Bush signed on Friday, Congress gave the Fed the power to pay interest on those reserves for the first time. The law accelerated the effective date to October of this year versus in 2011.The move was seen as another way to expand the Fed’s resources to battle the worst credit crisis in decades. It will encourage banks to keep more resources at the central bank.The Fed also said that 28-day and 84-day cash loans being made available to banks would be increased to $150 billion apiece, effective Monday. Those increases will eventually bring the amounts outstanding under the program to $600 billion.Loans that will be made available in November to banks also will be increased to $150 billion each. That makes a total of $900 billion in credit potentially outstanding over year’s end, the Fed said.'"
"'08-10-07,'0','HONG KONG — Stock markets fell sharply in early trading on Monday in Asia on growing fears about the health of banks around the world and the prospects for a downturn in Asian exports to the weakening economies of the United States and Europe.The Nikkei 225 Index dropped 4.3 percent in Tokyo by early afternoon on Monday, as waves of selling pushed the index steadily lower. The Kospi Index in Seoul was off 4.4 percent. The Standard and Poor’s/Australian Stock Exchange 200 Index in Sydney was down 3.3 percent, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong fell 3.4 percent and the Taiex Index in Taiwan declined 4.1 percent.Trading patterns in futures markets suggested that the selloff in Asian markets was a foretaste of another weak opening of trading in the United States on Monday. Futures contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Averages were pointing to an opening that would be down 165 points, to 10,199, with a fall in the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index of 19.2 points, to 1,089.10.Nicholas Bibby, an economist in the Singapore office of Barclays Capital, said that falling share prices across the region showed that many investors were still worried that banking difficulties might spread even after the House of Representatives passed a $700 billion economic bailout plan last Friday in Washington.“It’s a fear of contagion,” he said, while adding that Asian banks were better positioned than most to withstand the current problems because the region’s high savings rate tends to mean that Asian banks are net lenders in international money markets.'"

"'08-10-08,'0','In April, for example, a group of academic doctors questioned the validity of drug industry research after finding that Merck had hired ghostwriters to produce scientific articles about Vioxx, then recruited prestigious doctors to serve as their official authors. Vioxx, a painkiller, was withdrawn from the market in 2004 after research indicated it could cause strokes and heart attacks.Last winter, Merck and Schering-Plough were criticized for delaying the release of a study on their best-selling cholesterol medication Vytorin that showed the drug did not slow the growth of plaque in arteries. In the case of Pfizer’s Neurontin, the negative studies would have increased doubts about the drug’s value for several unapproved uses — treating bipolar disorder, controlling certain types of pain and preventing migraine headaches, according to the expert opinions.So-called off-label use of Neurontin for those conditions helped propel its sales to nearly $3 billion a year before it lost patent protection in 2004.In one example, the experts concluded that Pfizer had deliberately delayed release of a study that showed the drug had little effect against pain that is a complication of long-term diabetes, even as the outside researcher who was a lead investigator for the study, Dr. John Reckless of Bath, England, pushed to publish the unflattering findings on his own. Dr. Reckless’s office said Tuesday that he could not be reached for comment.According to one September 2000 e-mail message by a Neurontin team leader at Pfizer, “The main investigator in the U.K. (Dr. Reckless) is keen to publish but this will have several ramifications.” The team leader later wrote, “I think we can limit the potential downside of the 224 study by delaying publication for as long as possible.”Pfizer said Tuesday that it had submitted the Reckless study to two journals which declined to publish it. The results were not published until 2003 and, according to plaintiffs’ experts, when they did appear they were combined with two other studies and together the findings concluded Neurontin was effective for treating neuropathic pain.Another series of e-mail messages had the subject line “Spinning Serpell,” a reference to an investigator on the study, Dr. Michael Serpell of Glasgow, Scotland. In the e-mail exchange a senior marketing manager for Pfizer and a professional medical writer discussed how to cast the results in a more favorable light for a poster presentation at a medical conference, the experts concluded.“If Pfizer wants to use, present and publish this comparative data analysis in which two of the five studies compared make the overall picture look bad, how do we make it sound better than it looks on the graphs?” the medical writer asked.Pfizer discontinued its marketing program for Neurontin in 2004 after the drug became available as a generic. That same year, the company paid $430 million to settle federal criminal and civil claims that Warner-Lambert, which Pfizer acquired in 2000, promoted Neurontin for unapproved uses during the 1990s.At the time, Pfizer said the illegal marketing had occurred before Pfizer acquired the company or drug. On Tuesday, Pfizer repeated that it had instituted procedures when it acquired Warner-Lambert to make sure there was no off-label promotion of Neurontin.Despite that settlement, separate legal action involving the drug is still pending in Boston, where consumers and third-party payers including insurance companies and trade unions want Pfizer to repay them billions of dollars for Neurontin prescriptions. The plaintiffs accuse Pfizer of fraudulently misrepresenting the drug’s benefits.Thomas Greene, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the documents in the case revealed that even after the Neurontin settlement.“Pfizer continued with the medical marketing firms and planted marketing messages in journal articles that Neurontin was effective while they knew that their own clinical trials had failed to demonstrate it was effective,” Mr. Greene said.Dr. Dickersin, the Johns Hopkins expert, said that of 21 studies she reviewed, five were positive and 16 negative, meaning they did not prove the drug was effective. Of the five positive studies, four were published in full journal articles, yet only six of the negative studies were published and, of those, two were published in abbreviated form.'"
"'08-10-08,'0','WASHINGTON — Scrambling to repair his image on economic issues, Senator John McCain proposed during Tuesday night’s debate a $300 billion plan authorizing the treasury secretary to buy the mortgages of homeowners in financial trouble and replace them with more affordable loans.The campaign of Senator Barack Obama quickly countered by saying that the financial rescue plan that President Bush signed into law last week already gave the treasury secretary such power. And, his advisers noted, Mr. Obama recommended such a step in a news conference nearly two weeks ago.The Obama camp is correct that the new $700 billion bailout of the financial system gives the Treasury the authority to buy troubled mortgages. But the law leaves unclear how the authority is to be used, according to a person who was privy to the recent legislative negotiations between the White House and Congress and who is not affiliated with either campaign.The mortgage renewal idea actually originated with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. And Mrs. Clinton, who proposed the idea in a recent newspaper column, borrowed it from a Depression-era New Deal agency, the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation.As Mr. McCain’s campaign described his program, it would be available to mortgagors for whom the property is their primary residence, who can prove they were creditworthy when the original loan was made and who made a down payment. “Lenders in these cases must recognize the loss that they’ve already suffered,” a McCain campaign summary said.'"

"'08-10-08,'0','Yum Brands, the owner of the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC chains, said on Tuesday that third-quarter profit rose 4.4 percent, led by sales growth in China.The company has focused on international expansion as sales in the United States, which account for about half of Yum’s revenue, continue to slow. Consumers have reduced spending on dining out because of higher gasoline prices and food expenses.Net income increased to $282 million, or 58 cents a share, from $270 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales climbed 11 percent, to $2.84 billion from $2.56 billion.Sales at stores open at least one year increased 5 percent in China and 4 percent in Yum’s international division. Sales in the United States rose 3 percent on growth at Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. KFC sales fell 4 percent.Yum increased the number of restaurants in mainland China by 21 percent in the quarter, to 2,840. The company expects to open at least 1,400 new international locations by the end of the year, including 506 in China.“Clearly, for the long haul, they are positioned better than any other fast-food brand in China,” Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones & Company in St. Louis, said in a telephone interview.'"
"'08-10-08,'0','“This is unprecedented,” said Simon Tilford, chief economist of the Center for European Reform, a research organization in London. “It has exposed the limits of European integration and coordination when presented with a crisis of this magnitude.”Defenders of the European Union were quick to point out that its system, which lacks a central finance ministry comparable to the Treasury Department in the United States, was not designed for this kind of crisis.And quietly, they point out that the Treasury Department did not prevent the United States from creating the mortgage mess; nor did Congress, speaking a single language on behalf of a single nation, have such an easy time finding consensus on a response.“Political will is always in short supply when there’s no risk,” said Jan Techau, director of the Europe program at the German Council on Foreign Relations, who said he was often skeptical of the European Union, but understanding of its present struggles. “You can either say, see how long it took them, look at how impotent they are, or you can say, when push comes to shove, they can really act. You can look at it positively or negatively.”The meeting of member countries’ finance ministers on Tuesday illustrated the virtues and the flaws of the union. The ministers managed to more than double the minimum level of guarantees for bank deposits in member countries, to around $67,500, but that was less than half what some member states had asked for.“They haven’t drawn the line in the sand yet,” said Irwin Collier, professor of economics at the Free University in Berlin. He added: “They established a minimum, and you can hear the sound of one hand clapping for that measure. It’s very modest.”The disarray has raised painful memories of Ireland’s single-handed rejection of the European Union’s Lisbon Treaty in June, dealing a serious blow to the bloc’s efforts to streamline decision making and increase its political clout. It also comes five years after the start of the United States-led war in Iraq in 2003, which exposed deep fissures among European countries. Two months ago, Russia’s invasion of Georgia showed that many of those same differences, particularly between countries like Germany and the more recent member states of Eastern Europe, still remained.European countries struggled to agree to a joint response to the Georgia crisis, although agree they ultimately did. “The E.U. was utterly divided over Russia,” said Mark Leonard, executive director of the European Council on Foreign Relations and author of “Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century.” “But given that, it did better than anyone expected.”Beating low expectations is not the same as living up to its purpose. “The divisions mean that the E.U. is definitely punching below its weight,” Mr. Leonard said, pointing to its much larger population, higher combined military spending and an economy that dwarfs Russia’s.In the caldron of the global financial crisis, Ireland was the first to break ranks, acting unilaterally on Sept. 30 to guarantee the deposits and debts of its six largest financial institutions, a go-it-alone approach that was denounced by its neighbors and regulators in Brussels. They feared that savers across the Continent might flee their domestic banks in a destabilizing rush for the government-backed safety of Irish banks.Even before a weekend emergency meeting in Paris of the union’s four biggest economies — Germany, France, Italy and Britain — German officials had rejected a proposal floated by the French for a common European bailout fund along the lines of the United States plan devised by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.In Berlin, where the financial crisis has emboldened criticism of the no-holds-barred, Anglo-Saxon capitalist model, officials argued that Germany, traditionally the European Union’s largest financial contributor, should not pay for a problem that began elsewhere.Then on Sunday, Germany unilaterally promised to guarantee all retail deposits in its own banking system to calm the country’s skittish savers. “Trust, the most important currency for financial markets, has been lost,” Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday.In Brussels, the atmosphere is fraught over the national disarray on the financial crisis, but also with a sense that the criticism is unfair. Without a unionwide banking regulatory system or fiscal policy, any reaction to the crisis was inevitably going to be national in character.And that, proponents say, only underlines the need for greater integration and regulation and the creation of some kind of pan-European fiscal architecture.“I believe events have shown that no country is immune from this crisis,” said José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, on Tuesday. “I hope that persuades the most skeptical people of the benefits of joint E.U. action.""'"
"'08-10-08,'0','A body found by federal agents this week on Long Island was that of William Cutolo Sr., a Colombo family underboss, according to a letter filed by prosecutors on Tuesday in United States District Court in Central Islip.On Monday afternoon, F.B.I agents digging in Farmingdale found the body of a man wrapped in a tarp. A law enforcement official said that Mr. Cutolo was identified by his dental records, and by a distinctive physical feature: He was missing the tip of his right middle finger. Mr. Cutolo, whose body was partly decomposed, was wearing Italian loafers, the official said.The death was ruled a homicide by the Suffolk County medical examiner, according to a letter filed in court in the case of two men convicted of the 1999 killing Mr. Cutolo.Last year, Alphonse Persico and John DeRoss were convicted of murder in aid of racketeering and witness tampering in connection with Mr. Cutolo’s death. Prosecutors had said that Mr. Persico and Mr. DeRoss killed Mr. Cutolo in the belief that he was trying to take control of the crime family from Mr. Persico.Prosecutors previously believed that Mr. Cutolo’s body had been dumped in the Atlantic Ocean. But last Wednesday, F.B.I agents began digging in Farmingdale, searching for Mr. Cutolo’s body and those of two others: Richard Greaves, who was killed in 1995, and Carmine Gargano, a Pace University student who disappeared in 1994.'"
"'08-10-08,'0','So if you want to conjure up some doomsday stories about the federal budget, I’m happy to play along (and will do so momentarily). But those stories aren’t mainly about the credit crisis. They’re about the dangers of ignoring economic realities — which, when you think about it, is how we ended up in this credit crisis in the first place.The most newsworthy part of Mr. Bernanke’s lunchtime speech on Tuesday was his sober overview of the economy. He called the financial crisis “a problem of historic dimensions” and indicated that the Fed would soon cut its benchmark interest rate once again.But the bulk of the speech was a catalog of the extraordinary steps that the Fed and Treasury had taken since August and the delicate line they had tried to walk along the way. They have lent enormous amounts of money to banks and trumpeted those efforts to try to restore some confidence to the credit markets. Fed officials have pointed out that they are nowhere close to being out of bullets either. They work for the central bank, after all. They can always print money.But Mr. Bernanke and the Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, have also emphasized that they’re not being too generous. They are mainly making loans and investments, and they expect to recoup much of the money they’re spreading around.Outside the government, economists differ about whether Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson have been too aggressive or not aggressive enough and whether they have been aggressive in the right ways. But there is not much concern that they are taking on additional debt — or even about the amount of it.“The policy actions are not likely to have a large effect on the budget over the next five or 10 years,” Douglas Elmendorf, who has become a go-to Democratic economist during the crisis, told me. John Makin, of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, added: “The last thing I’m worried about right now is additional government indebtedness. There really isn’t an alternative.”Mr. Makin pointed out that during Japan’s long malaise, the government passed a stimulus package almost every year that was equal to more than 2 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (equivalent to about $400 billion in this country today). But interest rates in Japan remained low, a sign that economic weakness, not deficits, was still the problem.That being said, today’s ever-expanding bailouts do create some dangers. You’ve probably heard the term moral hazard, which is shorthand for the idea that government rescues may lead investors to take new, unwise risks — and ultimately require yet more rescues.The Fed is also setting itself up for tough decisions about when to end its various emergency programs. If it waits too long, it could leave so much money sloshing around the economy that inflation will take off. Fed officials have suggested they understand that they made precisely this mistake after the 2001 recession, when they kept interest rates low and added to the mania in the housing market.Finally, there is the net cost of the bailouts, which may well be bigger than Mr. Bernanke has acknowledged. Under the new program announced Tuesday, the Fed will own the commercial paper that serves as short-term loans for companies. If some of those companies go bankrupt, the Fed could suffer some losses.The Treasury’s $700 billion bailout fund, meanwhile, is based on the premise that investors are collectively undervaluing assets and that the government can pay above current market prices without losing much money. “One has to be at least a bit skeptical,” the economist Greg Mankiw says, “about the idea that government policy makers gambling with other people’s money are better at judging the value of complex financial instruments than are private investors gambling with their own.”After talking with budget analysts, I think it’s reasonable to assume that the bailouts will end up costing several hundred billion dollars, spread over several years. Perhaps $100 billion of that cost may come next year. Add in another $100 billion or so for the weakening economy — specifically the fall in tax revenue, increases in spending on social programs and the possibility of another stimulus package.Even before the crisis, the Bush administration was set to bequeath a $550 billion deficit to its successor. Now, a better estimate appears to be $750 billion — or 5 percent of gross domestic product. The only years since the 1960s that the deficit has been nearly so large were the early 1990s (almost 4.5 percent of G.D.P.) and the mid-1980s (with a peak of 6 percent in 1983).Obviously, next year’s deficit is a problem. And if you assume the credit crisis isn’t about to lift — which seems smart at this point — the ultimate cost of the bailouts could conceivably go higher. Whatever the final figure, it should still be put in some context.Despite everything, the biggest fiscal problem remains, far and away, health care. Based on the rate that medical spending has been rising, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts that Medicare and Medicaid will take up 10 percent of G.D.P. within two decades, up from about 4 percent now. In today’s terms, that would be the equivalent of adding at least $900 billion to the deficit every single year, in perpetuity. It makes the cost of the bailouts look like a rounding error.When it comes to health care, we have a situation that is blatantly unsustainable. With the right choices, we can prevent that. But so far, we instead seem to be hoping that the situation will magically resolve itself, which is a recipe for big problems and perhaps even a crisis.Let’s see. That doesn’t sound familiar, does it?'"
"'08-10-08,'0','At present, four European directives cover consumer rights, some dating from two decades ago, before the era of Internet shopping.Though minimum standards apply across the Continent, many countries have stricter rules, creating a patchwork of guarantees. For example, current cooling-off periods vary from 7 to 14 days, the European Commission says.The proposals, to be put forward Wednesday by the European consumer affairs commissioner, Meglena Kuneva, will try to rationalize the legal framework to offer more reassurance to online customers.Cécile Grégoire, senior adviser for payment systems at Eurocommerce, a trade association for retail, wholesale and international trade interests in Europe, said she welcomed the move, in principle.“Anything that would enhance the possibility for e-commerce across borders is important,” she said. “It is important for large firms, and even more for small firms, to be able to open new markets and some type of harmonization is generally needed.”The commission noted the widely varying prices for merchandise across the Continent. In March, for example, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8 digital camera was offered for sale in Britain for about 198 euros, while in Ireland it was 254 euros, in Belgium it was 276 euros and in Finland it was 306 euros.Under the commission proposal, which is subject to approval by the individual countries and the European Parliament, a common cooling-off period of 14 days would be established.In addition, prices and terms and conditions of sale would have to be explained on the sellers’ Web sites, and retailers would be prohibited from putting prechecked boxes for added-cost options on their sites. Consumers would have the right to be reimbursed for money paid for preselected options.Merchandise would have to be delivered within 30 days and the sellers would be responsible for any damage to the product in transit.The legislation includes a list of prohibited contractual terms, including terms that allow businesses to substitute one product for another without specifying a reason.European officials say that the regulatory regime for e-commerce is vital because the sector is forecast to generate 128 billion euros, or $174 billion, across the European Union in 2008. The figure could grow by 230 percent in five years, officials say.'"
"'08-10-08,'0','Joris den Blanken, the European climate and energy director for Greenpeace, warned that the subsidies could prolong the use of dirty technologies. “Carbon capture is an expensive gamble that gives coal a lifeline,” he said.But Chris Davies, a British member of the European Parliament, said that carbon capture and storage, known as C.C.S., was one way to slow harmful emissions if many regions of Europe continued to rely on fossil fuels to generate power.“E.U. governments must now either back this proposal to kick-start C.C.S. development or produce a realistic alternative,” Mr. Davies said. “At present the ideas from the Parliament are the only show in town.”The full European Parliament is expected to vote in December on the proposals, which will also require approval by the individual governments.The committee supported adding the aluminum and chemical sectors to the system by 2013. It now includes the steel, cement, glass, and pulp and paper industries.Businesses have warned that the plan will cost billions of euros. In a concession, legislators said that industries would need to buy only 15 percent of their permits starting in 2013 — a move intended to shield them from competition from manufacturers outside Europe where there is less regulation. The commission had proposed requiring industries to buy 20 percent of the permits starting in 2013.The proportion of permits that companies would be required to buy would increase each year, to 100 percent by 2020.Companies could also import significant amounts of credits from United Nations carbon-cutting projects in countries like China and India. The value of those credits rose Tuesday, as traders anticipated more demand over the next decade.Allowing imported credits angered some environmental advocates, who complained that polluters would let be off the hook.“Countries and industries can buy their way out of their required emissions reductions by offsetting about a third of their effort,” said Delia Villagrasa, a senior adviser at the environmental group WWF.Legislators also backed proposals for national goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from sources that are not covered by the trading system, like road and sea transportation, buildings, services, agriculture and smaller industrial installations.The goals would allow some poorer countries, like Bulgaria, to increase emissions by up to 20 percent, while obliging wealthier countries, like Denmark and Luxembourg, to make significant reductions.'"
"'08-10-08,'0','WASHINGTON — A federal panel of policy makers and scientific experts urged a government-wide evaluation Tuesday of programs that sift through databases looking for clues on terrorism, to determine whether the programs are effective and legal.The federal government has made aggressive use of so-called data-mining tools since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as counterterrorism officials in many intelligence agencies have sought to analyze records on travel habits, calling patterns, e-mail use, financial transactions and other data to pinpoint possible terrorist activity.The National Security Agency’s program for wiretapping terror suspects without warrants, the screening of suspicious airline passengers and the Pentagon’s ill-fated Total Information Awareness program, shut down by Congress in 2003 because of privacy concerns, have all relied on aspects of data mining.But in a 352-page government study released on Tuesday, a committee of the National Research Council warned that successfully using these tools to deter terrorism “will be extremely difficult to achieve” because of legal, technological and logistical problems. It said a haphazard approach to using such tools threatened both Americans’ privacy rights and the country’s legitimate national security needs.Mining through data patterns has been shown to work in commercial settings to predict what kind of toothpaste people may buy and what kind of movie they are likely to rent, or to detect casino card-counters or those engaged in credit card fraud.'"
"'08-10-08,'0','Whether Mr. Trebicka’s death was a result of an accident or something more sinister, the public reaction has revealed how little faith the people of this small, poor European country have in their authorities after enduring decades of Stalinist repression followed by years of everyday corruption.The deadly blast and ensuing corruption investigation, and then the sudden death of a major witness, raise questions for allies like the United States, which have strongly backed Albania’s bid for NATO membership. The European Union, too, has been working to build up institutions and civil society in Albania for possible membership down the road.Marjana Papa, executive director of Transparency International Albania, a nonprofit anticorruption organization, said the problem of corruption should not be underestimated. “It is not just petty corruption of people giving bribes,” she said. “It is a systemic problem.”Though the government has stepped up pressure to prosecute some corruption cases, the problem has persisted, and much of the drive for reform has come from outside the country, especially from the European Union.But compared with the anarchy of the late 1990s, after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes that robbed thousands of Albanians of their life savings, the country is far more stable. The European Union has worked extensively with the Albanian government on laws to reform the police force, public procurement and the judiciary.“The overall assessment of the European Commission is clearly that there has been progress, but that much, much more progress is needed in the future,” said Helmuth Lohan, leader of the European Commission’s delegation to Albania.But Mr. Trebicka’s death has damaged trust in an already shaky legal system. “People are nervous because of this, and it’s hurting other cases because people won’t testify,” said a member of the legal community in Albania who did not have permission to speak publicly about the problem. “Whatever happened, I don’t know, but there are signs that people are becoming hesitant to testify, and because Albanian investigations and trials are weak to begin with, this is a real problem.”A spokeswoman for the general prosecutor’s office in Tirana, the Albanian capital, said that Mr. Trebicka had “never presented to the office of the general prosecution any concerns about the safety of his life related to the case,” according to a written answer to questions submitted to the office.Three people remain under arrest in the investigation into the munitions trading and the explosion at the disassembly plant, according to the spokeswoman. The former defense minister, Fatmir Mediu, has been stripped of his immunity, but has not yet been charged with a crime, according to the statement.“How could you leave such an important witness without protecting him, without following him?” asked Eduard Shalsi, deputy mayor of Tirana, and a member of the opposition Socialists. Mr. Shalsi knew Mr. Trebicka and saw him two days before his death. “We have an obligation to the guy who had the courage to come forward,” he said.Mr. Trebicka had told friends and reporters repeatedly that he feared for his safety after blowing the whistle on the operation.Mr. Trebicka provided The New York Times and American investigators with evidence that AEY Inc., an American company, had bought aging Chinese cartridges and repackaged them in unmarked boxes to obscure their origin so they could be sold for Afghanistan’s army and police forces. Federal prosecutors in Miami have charged AEY executives with illegally selling Chinese ammunition to the United States Army for distribution in Afghanistan.The company hired Mr. Trebicka, a local Albanian businessman, to do the repackaging. He said he had suspected that money from the sale of the ammunition was being diverted to Albanian officials, including Mr. Mediu and the director of the Albanian arms export agency, Ylli Pinari.Mr. Trebicka said that after he raised his concerns with the Defense Ministry, he lost the contract. He recorded a phone call with AEY’s president, Efraim E. Diveroli, in which Mr. Diveroli said the corruption went all the way up to the Albanian prime minister, Sali Berisha, and his son. Local news media reported that a former bodyguard of Mr. Berisha’s, now at the Interior Ministry, played a major role in the investigation.Calls and e-mail messages to a spokesman for the prime minister were not answered. An official at the Ministry of the Interior referred all inquiries to the local prosecutors, who refused to comment except to say that a report could be out as soon as the end of the week.After Mr. Trebicka’s death, Albanian authorities asked for technical assistance through the United States Embassy. According to Sgt. Les Tyler, Mr. Teter’s supervisor at the Virginia State Police, Mr. Teter would not comment on the case, but the sergeant confirmed Mr. Teter’s participation. “He assisted with the investigation and also reviewed what they had investigated so far,” Sergeant Tyler said. “My understanding is our services have been completed in this case.”A daily newspaper, Gazeta Shqiptare, printed an Albanian translation of what the paper said was Mr. Teter’s report, obtained from the police in Korce. The article said that Mr. Trebicka’s car had flipped over, throwing him out of the vehicle.“People did not believe the government during the time of Hoxha,” said Elsa Ballauri, who leads the nonprofit Albanian Human Rights Group in Tirana, referring to the country’s Stalinist dictator, Enver Hoxha, who died in 1985. “It is normal not to believe.”'"
"'08-10-08,'0','“Over all, the combination of the incoming data and recent financial developments suggests that the outlook for economic growth has worsened and that the downside risks to growth have increased,” Mr. Bernanke told members of the National Association for Business Economics.“In light of these developments, the Federal Reserve will need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate,” he added — his strongest indication to date that the Fed will cut rates.Fed policy makers are scheduled to meet on Oct. 28 and 29, and investors had already been betting that the central bank would reduce the overnight federal funds rate by as much as one-half of a percent, to 1.5 percent. But many analysts predict the Fed may act before the next meeting, given the sprawling nature of the credit crisis.In its latest tactic, the Fed announced on Tuesday morning a new program to buy up parts of the short-term financing market to unlock the flow of credit to businesses. The program, which is expected to begin soon, was the latest and potentially biggest in a series of unprecedented efforts by the Fed to combat the worst turmoil that financial markets in the United States have endured since the Great Depression.“These are momentous steps,” Mr. Bernanke said, “but they are being taken to address a problem of historic dimensions.”Only a few weeks ago, the Fed’s official posture was that the risk of rising inflation was almost as big a concern as the risk of slowing growth and rising unemployment.But on Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke said the outlook for inflation had “improved somewhat” and made it clear that worries about a recession had now trumped worries about rising prices.While he noted that energy and commodity prices, a significant burden on American consumers, had declined from their recent peaks, he painted a bleak picture of an economy stalling on multiple fronts. The housing collapse has yet to abate, and the slowdown has now spread to other parts of the economy. Unemployment has been rising, household purchasing power has been eroded by inflation and consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, has been falling since May.Mr. Bernanke made it clear that the latest round of market turmoil would depress growth for the rest of the year. He said he hoped for a gradual recovery in 2009.President Bush, trying to sound a note of reassurance, said on Tuesday that the $700 billion financial rescue passed by Congress last week was “bold and necessary” and would eventually work to ease the credit crunch. But he warned that the plan would “take time.”“We’ll work through this,” Mr. Bush said. “We’re taking aggressive steps. And it’s not an easy problem, no question about it. But I am — I am confident in the long term for this country. I’m confident that the steps we’ve taken are bold and necessary.”Earlier in the day, Mr. Bush spoke by phone with European leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who has proposed an emergency meeting of the so-called Group of 8 leaders of industrialized nations. The White House said Mr. Bush was open to Mr. Sarkozy’s idea.But the question for Wall Street is why none of these extraordinary, precedent-shattering efforts have stanched the selling that has infected the market for five straight days.“You are getting all the things that you would think the equity markets would respond very favorably to,” said Steve Sachs, director of trading at Rydex Investments. “But at this point it just doesn’t seem to be doing it. It’s the attitude of ‘sell’ — regardless of what the news is.”Although investors fled stocks, there were signs on Tuesday that the Fed’s latest plan did have a positive impact on the troubles in the credit market. The cost to borrow commercial paper overnight fell significantly, and yields on Treasury bills rose, a sign that investors were more willing to leave the safe haven of government notes.But the Dow, which had lumbered downward from early in the session, accelerated its losses in the final hour and ended down 508.39 points, breaking below the 9,500 mark to close at 9,447.11. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell by 5.7 percent, ending below 1,000 for the first time in five years.The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill fell 14/32, to 104 3/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.50 percent, up from 3.45 percent late Monday.Shares of banks and financial firms shouldered the biggest losses by far, with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley all losing about 25 percent.Fears about the health of the banking industry were stoked by a disappointing earnings report from Bank of America, which had been perceived as one of the few winners in the current crisis. The bank cut its dividend on Monday and said profits fell sharply.Late in the afternoon, rumors flew across trading desks that a financing deal between Morgan Stanley and a Japanese bank had fallen through. Shares of Morgan fell more than 30 percent before officials at the bank reassured investors that the deal was, in fact, still on track.In a sign of how the credit crisis is affecting ordinary Americans, the amount of credit provided to consumers in August dropped for the first time since 1998. Consumer credit declined by $7.9 billion, the biggest monthly drop in more than half a century, according to the Fed.“Nobody trusts anybody right now,” said Ryan Detrick, an analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.Others said the market could start to recover when credit starts to flow again. But as long as businesses are forced to scramble for cash — and even states like California and Massachusetts have approached the federal government for billions in loans — the economy will only worsen. That brings the prospect of a deep recession.“There’s a realization that this problem is much bigger than anyone had thought,” said T. J. Marta, a strategist at Royal Bank of Canada. “There’s a fear that the Fed can’t get its arms around it.”Asian stock markets were moving sharply lower in early trading on Wednesday in response to Wall Street’s losses. The Nikkei 225 index fell in Tokyo soon after the opening of trading, after the Bank of Japan added nearly $15 billion to the financial system.The Standard and Poor’s/Australian Stock Exchange 200 Index dropped 4.3 percent in early trading on Wednesday morning, more than erasing a gain of 1.7 percent on Tuesday, when Australia’s central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates by a full percentage point.James Chirnside, who manages $65 million at Asia Pacific Asset Management in Sydney, said that investors feared corporate profits would fall and many companies would fail if banks did not resume lending soon. He recommended a coordinated round of interest rate cuts by central banks to unfreeze interbank lending markets.“Without that sort of global coordination, we’ll still be hostage to these violent moves in the market,” Mr. Chirnside said.Following are the results of Tuesday’s Treasury auction of 79-day cash management bills and 4-week bills:'"

The slide destroyed five cabins and partly damaged at least three others, according to a park statement. Three visitors were treated for minor injuries. The volume of rocks cascading from the granite face was estimated at about 1,800 cubic yards, or about 180 truckloads, said Vickie Mates, a park spokeswoman. There was a smaller slide in the same area on Tuesday. In 1996, a rock slide in the same area sent as much as 162,000 tons of rock plummeting more than 2,000 feet, killing one visitor and felling 500 trees.

"'08-10-09,'0','Beyond the costs, the proposal could encounter a backlash from voters, especially those who have had to work hard and sacrifice to keep current on their mortgage payments and who might resent bailing out fellow homeowners who got themselves into financial trouble.Mr. Holtz-Eakin suggested that “the taxpayers’ contribution” would be the price of getting the quickest possible relief to homeowners and arresting falling home values. Declining home values have led to rising defaults and foreclosures, which in turn have devalued trillions of dollars in housing-related assets for financial institutions and companies in the United States and abroad, threatening the businesses’ survival and fueling a credit freeze that endangers the global economy.Though Mr. Holtz-Eakin spoke of the urgency for action, he said Mr. McCain did not propose the idea as part of the recent bailout negotiations between Congress and the White House. So it would not begin until after Mr. McCain, if elected, takes office in January and issues an executive order.The White House and the Treasury Department declined to comment on the McCain proposal, saying they did not have enough information. But they said existing programs were helping homeowners to avert foreclosures.Mr. Holtz-Eakin noted that about 10 million Americans had mortgages that exceeded their homes’ value. “Literally millions of people” could benefit, he said, adding, “The question is how many people pick up the phone.”He said the process of applying for a replacement mortgage would be “very simple,” though clearly administering such a program would not be. Under the plan, homeowners could call a mortgage broker or lender to refinance their residences. If they passed a credit check, they would qualify for a Federal Housing Administration loan based on the reduced value of the homes, with lower principal and a lower interest rate.The government would pay off the original loan, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. That would take the bad debt off the books of the institutions that made the original loans, or in the case of loans that were sold and repackaged as mortgage-backed securities, it would prevent further deterioration of their value.Assuming the homeowners ultimately paid off the new mortgages, the taxpayers’ liability would be the difference between those mortgages and the original, more costly mortgages, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.Mr. Holtz-Eakin corrected one detail from the brief outline that the campaign issued Tuesday night after the debate. That outline said the plan would cost roughly $300 billion, which, it said, could be drawn from the $700 billion provided in the financial rescue package that became law last week.But Mr. Holtz-Eakin said the financing could come from “several pots of money”: the bailout money, the F.H.A.’s separate authority to refinance up to $300 billion in mortgages, or the mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government now owns.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','As the crowd booed angrily at each mention of Mr. Obama’s name, Mr. McCain threw himself more vigorously into his speech.“Is he the candidate who promises change, or is he the politician who has bought into everything that is wrong with Washington?” Mr. McCain said, then concluded, nearly shouting, “We can’t change the system with someone who’s never fought the system.”Earlier in the day, Mr. McCain flatly told “Hannity & Colmes” on Fox News that Mr. Obama was not prepared to be president while Ms. Palin, in the same interview, said that Mr. Obama’s association with the 1960s radical William Ayers and the convicted felon Antoin Rezko makes her “question his judgment” and “who he would associate himself with in the future.”On Wednesday, Cindy McCain, Mr. McCain’s wife, joined in the attacks, too, and in a departure from her normally mild public remarks told the crowd at Lehigh that Mr. Obama did not understand what it meant to have a son serving in Iraq, as she has had.“The day that Senator Obama decided to cast a vote to not fund my son while he was serving sent a cold chill through my body, let me tell you,” Mrs. McCain said. “I would suggest that Senator Obama change shoes with me for just one day.” Mrs. McCain was referring to a vote against troop financing that Mr. Obama cast in 2007 because the legislation did not include a timetable for withdrawal; Mr. Obama has voted for all other war-spending bills since he entered the Senate in 2005.At the same event, the Lehigh County Republican chairman, Bill Platt, twice referred to Mr. Obama from stage as “Barack Hussein Obama.” Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin had not yet arrived at the arena when Mr. Platt made his remarks, and the McCain-Palin campaign later disavowed them as “inappropriate rhetoric.”Much of Mr. McCain’s addresses on the economy are delivered to voters through the prism of his attacks on Mr. Obama. On Wednesday, Mr. McCain got into a relatively lengthy discourse on how the housing crisis started, but soon enough had placed Mr. Obama in a prominent role in the narrative of bad mortgages that had been backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.“This corruption was encouraged by Democrats in Congress, and abetted by Senator Obama,” Mr. McCain said, adding that “as recently as September of last year he said that subprime loans had been, quote, a good idea. Well, Senator Obama, that good idea has now plunged this country into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.”Mr. McCain also vowed to “confront the $10-trillion-dollar debt that the federal government has run up and balance the federal budget by the end of my term in office,” but in a slip of the tongue in Pennsylvania he then added, “this is the agenda I have set before my fellow prisoners.”The prepared text of his remarks had called for him to say “fellow citizens.”'"

Output gained a seasonally adjusted 3.4 percent from July, when it slipped 1.6 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said Wednesday. That is the biggest gain since August 1993. Economists expected a drop of 0.3 percent, the median of 27 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey showed. From a year earlier, production adjusted for working days rose 1.7 percent. The German economy has shown few signs of recovery after shrinking in the second quarter, as worsening financial market turmoil pushes up credit costs and weighs on global growth. Still, factory orders rose for the first time in nine months in August and investors were more optimistic last month. “It wasn’t much of a surprise after factory orders,” said Sylvain Broyer, an economist at Natixis in Frankfurt. “We’re only at the beginning of a slowdown. The German economy will fail to grow over the coming one or two quarters.” Factory orders rose for the first time in nine months in August, data showed Wednesday, ending their longest-ever losing streak. The August gain in industrial production is distorted because of the summer holidays, the Economy Ministry said.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','“What was the inspiration?” I asked a young man with a mohawk named Xuan (pronounced “Sean”). There was so much white tulle and gold brocade, my guess was “Swan Lake” as directed by Crazy Ludwig II of Bavaria.The collection, I was told, was inspired by a 600-year-old tree in back of Mr. McQueen’s country house. “It’s a story about a girl emerging from the tree, coming out of darkness,” Xuan explained.A tale of metamorphosis: Girl sheds her duckling down and becomes a crowned head of the Orient.There was a particularly fetching group of czarist items: a Persian lamb-collared greatcoat ($4,190); silk blouses with jeweled buttons and bunchy princess necks ($1,450); and finally, an enormous crimson satin teardrop of an evening coat with a high ruffled collar (shorter sapphire blue version: $6,880) that perfectly matched a lacquered oval handbag resembling a Fabergé egg. I nicknamed the more Gothic of these offerings: “Anastasia Romanov is back ... and boy is she PO’d.” The perfect style motto to outfit the End Times, or at least a good class war.I tried on a pair of wonderfully cut, black stretch gabardine pants ($795).“These are a sound investment,” said the devil in Miss Wilson. “These are inarguably classic. You will wear them for at least 150 years.”“Shut up,” I told myself, prying them off. I attempted to restrain my impulses by inspecting other aisles.When Mr. McQueen goes wrong, he goes wrong big. Some of the rubberized waterproof-looking black damask pieces were so lousy with ornate buckles and silver skulls as to require Cher to do a cameo on “Deadwood” (embroidered hourglass leather jacket with asymmetrical motorcycle zipper: $7,795).And that’s when I saw it: A double-V-neck, Sofia-Loren-Goes-to-Wellesley miniature houndstooth wiggle-dress ($1,230).Confession: Never in my life had I crossed the $1,000 barrier for a dress I didn’t get married in. I consider it fiscal suicide. Some outrageously tempting garments have clung to me like weepy James Deans, but I have turned and left them coldly on their racks. The Narciso Rodriguez That Got Away stands out as one of the more bitter regrets of my sartorial life, but such is the price of survival.But this wasn’t a dress: It was the fulfillment of my deepest desires, in wool. For a literary performance, it was the perfect fusion of tweedy respectability and autobahn curves. Elves had tailored it on me while I slept.My credit cards were banging steel cups against the bars of my wallet. Black smoke began pouring out of my handbag.After much weeping and rending of sensibility, I bought the dress. There is no investment more worthwhile, I reasoned, than an investment in your own transformation into a better future-self.Naturally, this flight of rationalization would not go unpunished.I FOUND myself in a car service on the way to the airport, frantically calling the Alexander McQueen store, the night before my performance.“Xuan,” I said, “you left the security tag on the dress.”I had seen it while packing. My brain had exploded, envisioning myself walking onstage and San Francisco saying: “Great dress. Too bad she stole it.”Xuan sounded miserable. “You can take it to the Gucci store,” he whimpered. “They can remove the tag.”Was there any other option? Powerful magnets and a crowbar?“If your hotel has a dry cleaner, they can remove the seams and take it off that way.”I could hardly bring myself to pay to dismantle a dress of such astronomical expense before I had even spilled anything on it.Suffice to say, Gucci San Francisco (Alexander McQueen is part of the Gucci Group) came to my rescue. A very nice young man named Dominic removed the offending tag and gave me a new garment bag besides. It was a mild inconvenience.But if the audience at my event that night doesn’t remember a word I said, I bet they’ll never forget that dress. And I am never taking it off.MCCLEAN The designer’s meatpacking district boutique continues to thrill with laser-sharp designs for all modern Ladies Macbeth (or gals who just want to look like them).MCMEAN The Samsonite roller bags, molded to resemble a human rib cage, appear to have the power to roll you right out of the airport and into Matthew Barney’s Cremaster Cycle. Ideal when matched with Union Jack evening clutches with jeweled skull clasps.MCSLIGHTLY OBSCENE If Jimi Hendrix were alive and raising reindeer in Siberia, a certain nomadic bolero jacket ($16,385) might inspire a free-love revolution in his yurt.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','The I.M.F. managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said in Washington that he had activated an emergency financing system, last used during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, to help countries in crisis. Though not mentioning Iceland by name, he said: “We are ready to answer any demand by countries facing problems.”Iceland has approached Russia about a 4 billion euro, or $5.5 billion, loan to help see it through the crisis, but Mr. Haarde said no agreement had been reached.An I.M.F. intervention in Iceland, which would necessarily involve accepting a series of harsh measures to restore fiscal and monetary stability, would underline the extraordinary reversal in the country’s fortunes after a decade-long, debt-fueled binge by the country’s banks, businesses and some private citizens. The banks, while avoiding the toxic mortgage securities that have humbled Wall Street, expanded aggressively at home and abroad. When credit tightened and the krona fell this year, they were unable to finance their debts.In these circumstances, going to the I.M.F. “is probably the only thing Iceland can do,” said Richard Portes, an economist at the London Business School.Events have moved so fast that the full import of national bankruptcy has yet to sink in here. It has happened before, of course, but in places like Argentina and Thailand, not a country that likes to think of itself as close to Europe.And on an island raked by icy North Atlantic winds and dotted with volcanoes and geysers, where people live with the threat of earthquakes and maritime disasters, few residents seem to be losing their cool over the financial crisis — yet. But some have suffered deep losses, and others are simply bewildered at how things could have gone so wrong so quickly.“There is a lot of fear in society and there are people who are losing everything,” Bubbi Morthens, an Icelandic rock favorite, said Wednesday after singing at an impromptu midday concert in central Reykjavik intended to lift people’s spirits.Like many of his compatriots, Mr. Morthens did well when Iceland was riding high, accumulating considerable wealth. But when the government seized control of Iceland’s third-largest bank, Glitnir, last month, Mr. Morthens said he lost his life savings, which he had invested in the bank’s stock.On Thursday, the government seized Kaupthing Bank, the country’s largest lender, effectively completing the nationalization of the banking system after the previous takeover of Glitnir and the No. 2 lender, Landsbanki.Meanwhile trading in the currency froze up Thursday, according to Bloomberg News, citing dealers at Nordea, a big Scandinavian bank. The last trade was made at 340 krona to the euro, Nordea said — less than half what the Icelandic currency was worth at the start of the week.Mr. Haarde said the Central Bank of Iceland had set up a special system to handle currency transactions, so that Icelandic companies could conduct international business.“We are gradually moving through this crisis,” he said, sounding surprisingly unworried for the leader of a country facing economic and financial disaster. “There are still a few issues to resolve but that is the nature of these kinds of things.”Problems with the krona have been at the core of the government’s inability to control the crisis. Without a viable currency, there is no way to support the banks, which have done the bulk of their business in foreign markets. There is also no way to bring down inflation or interest rates, both already in double digits before the crisis intensified in recent days.Mr. Valfells and Mr. Portes said that once the situation is stabilized, the best way forward would be for Iceland is to give up on the krona and adopt the euro instead.How could Iceland, which is not even a member of the European Union, adopt the currency?One option would be to simply “peg” its currency to the euro. In that case, Iceland would also hand over control of monetary policy, including the setting of interest rates, to the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.But fixing the currency to the euro could be difficult for Iceland, given that its central bank probably lacks the necessary reserve to defend such a level if the currency were to come under renewed attack, Mr. Portes said.That leaves another option: applying to join the European Union and adding Iceland to the euro zone. Because Iceland is already part of the European Economic Area, a looser trading bloc, it already abides by many European Union rules.Still, such a move would be politically challenging. The conservative Independence Party, headed by the prime minister, has been dead set against it. Another member of that party, which is governing in a coalition with the Social Democrats, is the central bank chairman, David Oddsson, a former prime minister.They are supported by the powerful fishing industry, which mostly wants to stay out of the euro and to keep Europe at a comfortable distance. Fishing has been the focus of many clashes between Iceland and its European neighbors — most heatedly with Britain, in what became known as the Cod Wars of the 1950s to the 70s. The two countries clashed repeatedly over Iceland’s move to extend exclusive fishing rights into waters that had long been trawled by British vessels, too.Tension with Britain has flared anew during the current crisis. It centers on hundreds of thousands of accounts that Britons hold in online branches of the Icelandic banks; now they fear they will lose their money, and the British government wants Iceland to pay up. The government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain has used powers granted under anti-terrorism laws to freeze British assets of Landsbanki until the standoff is resolved.“We do not consider this to be a particularly friendly act,” Mr. Haarde said, adding that he had tried to defuse the situation in a telephone call with Mr. Brown on Thursday.For all the worries, this capital city of 120,000 people still displays the fruits of the decade-long economic boom that followed the deregulation of Iceland’s financial sector in the 1990s — hip cafés, lobster restaurants and stylish shops selling outdoor gear.But the days when the economy seemed capable of gravity-defying feats are gone. So are the days when investors went on an international buying spree, adding some of the biggest names of the British and American retailing industries to their portfolios. Gone too, are the days when ordinary citizens effortlessly joined in the fun, taking out second mortgages to finance their own trips abroad or at least to the Laugavegur, the main shopping strip in Reykjavik.“It’s difficult; the landscape is very difficult,” said Franch Michelsen, a watch dealer in central Reykjavik, as he took a break Wednesday from cleaning his shop window.Some ordinary Icelanders face a similar problem to the one that brought down the banks. In recent months, many mortgages were taken out in foreign currencies — marketed by the banks as a way to benefit from lower interest rates abroad, as rates in Iceland rose into the double digits.Now, with the Icelandic krona plunging, homeowners suddenly have to pay back far more expensive euro or dollar values of their mortgages. At the same time, house prices are falling.The Reverend Karl Sigurbjornsson, the bishop of Iceland, who leads the state-sponsored Lutheran church, says he worries about how the prospect of financial suffering will affect a society that “was led to believe that it was unlimited growth forever.”“What will happen when the dust settles?” he asked. “A lot of people will be very angry. It will be a challenge for our society.”'"
"'08-10-09,'0','George Kissell, who became one of baseball’s most renowned teachers in a long career with the St. Louis Cardinals’ organization as a manager, player, coach and instructor, died Tuesday in Tampa, Fla., of injuries in an auto accident on Monday. Kissell, who lived in Pinellas Park, near St. Petersburg, was 88.Kissell’s death was announced by the Cardinals. The Pinellas Park police said Kissell had been a passenger in a car driven by his daughter, Karolyn Kidwell, that collided with another auto.Kissell never played in the major leagues, but he tutored virtually every player who made it to the Cardinals through their minor league system going back to the 1940s, and he imparted his baseball wisdom to players arriving in St. Louis from other major league teams. What became known as the Cardinals way — their approach to fielding, hitting and strategy — was essentially the Kissell way.In 1971, when Kissell was a Cardinals coach, he oversaw Joe Torre’s switch from catcher to third baseman, working with him daily in spring training and providing insights that served Torre well long after he left St. Louis.“He’d stand behind me and throw a ball off a concrete wall, and I’d have to react to its bounce and catch it,” Torre recalled in his memoir “Chasing the Dream.”'"
"'08-10-09,'0','Adding to the pressure, critics are already raising questions about potential conflicts of interest in the government’s plan to hire large financial firms to handle the transactions.More than 100 asset managers submitted bids to Mr. Kashkari on Wednesday, seeking to manage parts of the portfolio that the Treasury Department will eventually acquire, according to two industry representatives who have been in contact with Treasury officials. Goldman Sachs was among the bidders but it offered to provide its services free of charge. Mr. Kashkari declined to talk about the bids.Mr. Kashkari and Mr. Paulson have worked closely together since leaving Goldman Sachs and arriving at the Treasury Department on the same day in July 2006 — even though they hardly knew each other before then.Mr. Paulson was based in New York as the investment bank’s chief executive. Mr. Kashkari worked in San Francisco, where he was one of the firm’s many hundreds of vice presidents — a title given nearly automatically to associates who have been there several years.In early 2006, Mr. Kashkari said, his supervisor at the time helped him set up a meeting with Mr. Paulson to talk about his experience as an official in the Nixon administration and Mr. Kashkari’s interest in government service.Mr. Kashkari, a Republican, said Mr. Paulson was encouraging. A few months later, when President Bush asked Mr. Paulson to serve as Treasury secretary, Mr. Kashkari said he called him, reminded him of their conversation, and asked for a job.Mr. Paulson hired him as his special assistant, a kind of handyman position for which he took on a series of projects that caught the secretary’s interest. He shared a cramped office with another junior official.Mr. Paulson soon put him in charge of an effort to have mortgage holders voluntarily change financing terms in order to prevent foreclosures. The program met with only mixed success, but a Treasury spokeswoman said that it was never intended to be a “silver bullet,” given the complexity of the overall problem.This summer, Mr. Kashkari was promoted, winning Senate confirmation to be assistant secretary for international economics. Among other things, he has focused on working with American banks toward adoption of a less-risky system of mortgage-based bonds that is popular in Europe. And he moved to a larger office, with room for sofas and photos of his favorite ski slopes around Lake Tahoe.As the crisis unfolded in recent months, Mr. Kashkari worked long hours alongside Mr. Paulson, helping to deal with the bailouts of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the American International Group in turn, while working in secret on what became the $700 billion rescue package — a project code-named Break the Glass because it was to be used only as a last-resort emergency measure.Late last week, as Congress prepared to vote on the bailout package, Mr. Paulson gathered his top aides in his office to discuss how to get the program up and running for the next administration to take over.Mr. Kashkari said that when Mr. Paulson told the aides, “I want Neel to run this,” he was honored but not surprised, given their close working relationship.His reply was simple, he recalled: “I said ‘O.K.’ ”Mr. Kashkari, who grew up near Akron, Ohio, is a first-generation Indian-American. His parents had grown up in poverty in the Kashmir region of India before becoming an engineer and a doctor and coming to the United States.Mr. Kashkari’s older sister, Meera Kashkari Kelley, said in an interview that the experiences of their parents shaped their childhoods.“They ingrained in us the perspective that our origins were relatively poor,” she said. “I think that gave us a great appreciation for the opportunities that people have in this country.”Mr. Kashkari stood out in his family. While everyone else leaned liberal, his sister said, he gravitated toward free-market Republican views.As a high school student at the Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio, Mr. Kashkari excelled in math and was chosen by his classmates to be the graduation speaker.After high school, Mr. Kashkari initially opted for an engineering career, earning an undergraduate and master’s degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He also met his wife, Minal, a mechanical engineer who works on NASA projects, on campus.Mr. Kashkari worked for several years as a satellite engineer for TRW before earning an M.B.A. from the Wharton School.“Neel was one of the strongest students in my class,” said Anjani Jain, the vice dean and director of the graduate division. “I remember him fondly as a gentle but persuasive student. He got a lot done.”After graduating in 2002, Mr. Kashkari joined Goldman Sachs, where he specialized in helping start-up computer security companies get financing or sell themselves to larger companies.One was FrontBridge Technologies, an e-mail security company that Mr. Kashkari worked with for several years. He helped the company with its acquisition by Microsoft in August 2005 for several hundred million dollars, according to Steve Jillings, its former chief executive. (The terms of the deal were not publicly disclosed.)Bradford Koenig, now retired, who ran Mr. Kashkari’s technology banking group at Goldman Sachs, said their interaction was “a very positive experience.” But, he added, they had relatively little contact because Mr. Kashkari was a junior banker.Now, Mr. Kashkari’s skills in working with powerful people will be tested. David Smith, chief economist for the House Financial Services Committee, said that despite concerns over his age, Mr. Kashkari is “a serious guy.” Still, he said, Congress will watch his decisions very closely.“It’s not simply that he’s never done it before — no one has ever done it before,” he said. “So scrutiny will be and should be intense.”'"
"'08-10-09,'0','If you missed that opportunity, you’re hardly alone.But if you sell now, you’ll be locking in your losses. And once you’re in cash, there isn’t much upside. In fact, with interest rates low, you’re likely to lose money in cash, because inflation will probably eat up the after-tax returns you earn from a savings or money-market account.A guarantee of a small loss may sound good right now. But if you’re not bailing out of stocks once and for all, how will you know when it’s time to get back in? The fact is, any peace of mind you gain by being on the sidelines now will turn into a migraine once you see how much you can harm your portfolio over time by missing just a bit of any rebound.H. Nejat Seyhun, a professor of finance at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, put together a study in 2005 for Towneley Capital Management, where he tested the long-term damage that investors could do to their portfolios if they missed out on the small percentage of days when the stock market experienced big gains.From 1963 to 2004, the index of American stocks he tested gained 10.84 percent annually in a geometric average, which avoided overstating the true performance. For people who missed the 90 biggest-gaining days in that period, however, the annual return fell to just 3.2 percent. Less than 1 percent of the trading days accounted for 96 percent of the market gains.This fall, Javier Estrada, a professor of finance at IESE Business School in Barcelona, published a similar study in The Journal of Investing that looked at equity markets in 15 nations, including the United States. A portfolio belonging to an investor who missed the 10 best days over several decades across all of those markets would end up, on average, with about half the balance of someone who sat tight throughout.So moving to cash right now is just fine as long as you know precisely when to get back into stocks (even though you didn’t know when to get out of them).At some point, stocks will indeed fall enough that investors will remove the money from their mattresses and put it to work, causing prices to rise significantly. But, as Bonnie A. Hughes, a certified financial planner with the Enrichment Group in Miami, put it to me, there won’t be an e-mail message or news release that goes out when this is about to happen. It will be evident only afterward, on the few days when the market surges.And it gets worse for those who think they won’t have any trouble investing in stocks again later. Medium- or long-term investors who are considering a big move into cash right now are probably making an emotional decision, at least in part. For those who follow through, the same instincts will probably hurt when trying to figure out when to reinvest in stocks.“The emotional forces that drove them out of the market aren’t likely to let them back in ‘until things are better,’ ” Dan Danford of the Family Investment Center in St. Joseph, Mo., said in an e-mail message. “And for most people, things won’t feel better again until the market has already moved back up.” In fact, he added, plenty of people may not allow themselves to get back in until the market has already risen significantly.That situation is worth considering if you think your mood, or returns, can’t get any worse. “People feel worse missing out on the bounce-back that will inevitably come than they do hanging in there through the down period,” said Elaine D. Scoggins, a certified financial planner with Merriman Berkman Next in Seattle.The truly downbeat do not see the bounce as inevitable. This outlook is essentially a bet that our current predicament is so different that the equity markets won’t bounce back at all, even though they survived 1929, the Great Depression, 1987 and a major terrorist attack. I do not believe that the markets are in some kind of permanent decline, and I haven’t found an expert who does.That said, some retirees, or those close to leaving the work force, may be well-off enough to leave stocks behind for now. If the tumult in the economy and the decline in the markets have altered your risk tolerance, then it may make sense to move to a portfolio of Treasury bills, certificates of deposit and money market funds.Michael G. Coli, 56, of Crystal Lake, Ill., decided to take his 401(k) money out of the market in February. As an investor in his sons’ pizza restaurants, he noticed that an increasing number of customers were relying on credit cards. And as the owner of a winter home in Naples, Fla., he witnessed the housing market dive. Taken together, he decided to pull his retirement money, which he would need in five years, from the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund and move it all into certificates of deposit.“I had the feeling the economy was not on real firm ground,” Mr. Coli said. “I decided to get out and put it all in C.D.’s, and that is where I’ve been ever since.”If you can’t afford to live off the proceeds of cash investments (or dividends from your investment in your kids’ pizza joints), you may have no choice but to hold on to whatever stocks you have left. Then, you can hope for a rebound that will allow you to live out your later years more comfortably. Selling now and moving to cash could mean guaranteeing a lower standard of living for the rest of your life, because you’d be locking in your losses.But if you’re a bit younger, try to think of your investment portfolio in the same way you consider the value of your home, if you own one. After all, if you’re not moving anytime soon, your home is a long-term investment, too.“Today’s price is not your price. Your price is 10 or 20 years from now,” said Thomas A. Orecchio, of Greenbaum & Orecchio, a wealth management firm in Old Tappan, N.J. “Unfortunately, stock market investors don’t always see things that way.”'"
"'08-10-09,'0','LOS ANGELES — The Writers Guild of America has instructed its members not to work on a new television variety show featuring Ozzy Osbourne and his family that is being prepared by the producers of “American Idol” for the Fox television network.The presidents of the east and west branches of the Writers Guild told its members in a letter that Fremantle Media North America, which is producing the Osbourne show, had asked the Guild to accept a contract that would treat the program as “half-scripted.” Such a contract would pay reduced fees to Guild-represented writers of skits, interview material and scene outlines, said the letter, written by Patric M. Verrone, president of the Writers Guild of American West and Michael Winship, president of the Writers Guild East.David Shall, a Fremantle executive, said in a statement that the company had contacted the Guild “hoping to employ Guild writers for a nontraditional show that combines elements of both variety and reality programming.Unfortunately, after only a few phone conversations with our representatives, the Guild chose to end discussions,” Mr. Shall said. “We are disappointed that our effort to meet the Guild halfway has been summarily rejected and as such, we don’t believe the Guild’s membership has been served.”The dispute renews the Guild’s dispute with Fremantle, which also produces the enormously successful Fox series, “American Idol,” as well as other unscripted, or reality, programming. The Guild has been seeking to organize employees on numerous reality television shows, which often employ non-Guild writers to produce scripts for show introductions and host remarks.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','A federal appeals court panel on Wednesday issued a temporary stay of a federal judge’s order that had directed the Bush administration to free 17 Guantánamo detainees by releasing them in the United States on Friday.The order, from a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, made clear that it was intended to give the appeals court time to review the government’s request for a longer stay of the order from a federal district court judge in Washington, Ricardo M. Urbina. On Tuesday, Judge Urbina had directed that 17 men, members of the Uighur Muslim minority in western China, be brought from the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to his courtroom where they were to be freed.The brief order from the appeals panel said it was issuing what it called an administrative stay so that it could consider a Justice Department request for a stay of Judge Urbina’s ruling while the department appealed. The Wednesday night order said it “should not be construed in any way as a ruling” on the Justice Department’s request for a stay of Judge Urbina’s ruling.Judge Urbina had said he would release the men, who have been held in Guantánamo since 2002. He said that the men had never fought the United States and that the government had presented no evidence that they presented a security threat to the United States.The Wednesday order followed two days of legal confrontation between the Justice Department and lawyers for the Uighur detainees.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','Those who are trying to figure out where to stash their money may be interested in the Safe-T-Bed, which has a small safe hidden in the mattress. The bed, made by Hollandia International, an Israeli luxury mattress company, was introduced last spring. It starts at $7,400 and goes up to $50,400, for a model with a retractable TV, a DVD and CD player and a massage system. (The Executive model, above, is about $20,400.) For $800, though, any Hollandia mattress can be made into a Safe-T-Bed. In a phone conversation, Avi Barssessat, the 43-year-old owner of Hollandia, who lives on a farm outside Tel Aviv, assured a reporter that the Safe-T-Bed is an excellent investment.How is the economic crisis affecting your bed?It came at a perfect time. It came to me in a vision: If people don’t trust the bank anymore, it’s becoming like the old days, like my father putting the money under the mattress. But this time we need something more sophisticated, more upscale.But $20,000 for a mattress that’s supposed to help you save money doesn’t make sense. Why not just put your money under the mattress you have?You’re actually getting two benefits in one: First, you have a safe place to put your money, and you also get a good quality sleep. If you just put the money under the mattress without the safe, no insurance will cover you.What kind of safe is it?A heavy-duty steel safe, about 5 by 12 inches, and 7 inches deep.Do you have one?'"
"'08-10-09,'0','BEIRUT, Lebanon — Two American journalists who were traveling in Lebanon have not been heard from since Oct. 1 and appear to be missing, according to United States Embassy officials here who appealed for help in locating them.The journalists, Holli Chmela, 27, and Taylor Luck, 23, arrived in Lebanon from Jordan on Sept. 29, the embassy said in a statement. They had been working at The Jordan Times in Amman, Jordan, where they were expected back on Saturday.The journalists apparently left Beirut on Oct. 1 and told friends they were heading to Byblos and the northern city of Tripoli en route to Syria. The embassy is working with Lebanese authorities on an investigation, the statement said, and is coordinating with other American embassies.Lebanon has been relatively stable since May, when a power-sharing agreement ended an 18-month political crisis. However, Tripoli has become increasingly violent. Two bombs have exploded near buses carrying Lebanese troops there in the past two months, killing 13 soldiers and several civilians.Tripoli is viewed as a center of hard-line Islamism. Members of Lebanon’s government have accused Syria of trying to sow unrest there to create an excuse to return to Lebanon. Syria dominated Lebanon militarily for three decades before 2005.Ms. Chmela, who grew up in Massachusetts, was studying Arabic and working as an intern at The Jordan Times, said her mother, Amy Chmela. She had previously worked as a news assistant in the Washington bureau of The New York Times. Mr. Luck, who is from the Chicago area, is a reporter at The Jordan Times.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','I applaud your editorial highlighting the potential damage the mounting foreclosure crisis may inflict on the nation’s voting system (“Foreclosures and the Right to Vote,” Oct. 5). Indeed, the cooldown in the housing market puts millions at risk of being frozen out at the polls.As the editorial notes, voter registration is “based on people’s residences.” But more than 7,000 Americans each day are losing their homes — many in pivotal battleground states. These voters become subject to partisan political challenges and contravention at the polls.This raises a disturbing specter: could the election turn on the number of eligible voters who are turned away?So, when a Republican Party county chairman in Michigan pledged to use foreclosure lists to challenge voters, we in Congress went to work. My colleagues and I crafted legislation to prohibit such challenges and uphold voters’ rights.Despite our attempts, the measure was not included in the multibillion-dollar emergency financial rescue package.It would be a national scandal if more than a million people who have lost their homes also wound up losing their votes. When Congress resumes work, members from both parties must come together and do more to prevent foreclosures and to protect the franchise.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','If mortgage-backed securities are the toxic asset in the United States, loans backed by shares are the problem in Russia. A bailout package of more than $200 billion by the Kremlin of loans and tax cuts has failed to stanch the sell-off.“Russia does have its own problem now,” Mr. MacFarquhar said.Indonesia, Ukraine and Romania also closed their exchanges on Wednesday, and a rate cut by six big central banks failed to reverse a global rout in stocks.The Standard & Poor’s index for Russian stocks has fallen 53.2 percent this year as of Oct. 3 — the most of the 30 markets monitored by the S.& P.’s emerging-markets index. The second-biggest drop was in Indian stocks, which fell 51.8 percent.Russia’s market has fallen further than any other, in spite of trade and budget surpluses, partly because of the unusual ownership structure that took hold after the breakup of the Soviet Union.A few wealthy individuals, known as oligarchs, obtained huge stakes in companies as Russia privatized. In “loans-for-shares” auctions in the mid-1990s, they became owners of the big mining and petroleum companies in exchange for small loans to the government.In this sense, Russia is in contrast, for example, to the United States, where large companies have a diffuse stockholder base. Typically, oligarchs hold more than 50 percent in the companies they control, with the remaining shares split between domestic and foreign investors.As the market here swooned and commodity prices fell, risk-averse foreign investors pulled out. Russia’s war with Georgia and government attacks on private companies also scared away foreign investors. Meanwhile, the oligarchs had, to an unknown degree, pledged portions of their far larger stakes as collateral for loans.As the smaller investors left and the market dropped, banks made margin calls. The fear is that now the shares that had been locked in the core holdings of the oligarchs will flood the market, at a time when there are no buyers. Just on Tuesday, regulators introduced more sweeping power to suspend trading on the stock exchanges to halt margin-call selling.Unless trading is closed permanently, however, this measure will not solve the underlying problem.“At some point, you must let market forces take their course,” Michael Kavanagh, a metals sector analyst at UralSib bank, said.Also on Tuesday, President Dmitri A. Medvedev said he would submit a bill to the Duma that he said would simplify the rules for the seizure of collateral by creditors, which might encourage new lending.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','“I think he is in a special category all by himself,” said Joseph B. Cumming Jr., a former Atlanta bureau chief for Newsweek who hired Mr. Frady as a reporter in the 1960s.Barbara Gandolfo-Frady, Mr. Frady’s fourth wife and widow, said that Mr. Frady, like many writers, had led a financially unstable life. “Most writers don’t get paid well, and when they do work on a story and they finally get a check, a $20,000 check has to last them a whole year,” Ms. Gandolfo-Frady said on Wednesday at the I.R.S. office on West 44th Street before the auction. “Marshall always said his books were never best sellers.”According to public records, some of Mr. Frady’s unpaid taxes date to 1998. Ms. Gandolfo-Frady said the couple had been paying some of the taxes, but could no longer afford to after his cancer was diagnosed.At the time of his death Mr. Frady had recently been appointed to the faculty of Furman University, his alma mater in Greenville, S.C., as a writer in residence and lecturer in political science and nonfiction literature.Mr. Frady owned no property that could be seized by the I.R.S., said Ms. Gandolfo-Frady, who now lives in Queens. But he had saved many of his drafts, notes and papers, and she suspected they might be valuable.Ms. Gandolfo-Frady, 56, said that Furman had hoped she would donate the papers, but that because of the outstanding tax bill she wanted to keep them. A representative of Furman’s special collections and archives department could not be reached.Bob Digregorio, property appraisal and liquidation specialist for the New York and Western Pennsylvania region of the I.R.S., said he had never seen another situation in which personal papers were auctioned to pay tax bills.On Wednesday gray document boxes were stacked on rolling carts in a 12-by-18-foot room with cream-colored walls at the I.R.S. offices. The only bidder present was Steve Enniss, director of the Manuscript, Archives and Rare Book Library at Emory University in Atlanta.He riffled through a file folder containing correspondence between Mr. Frady and literary figures like Willie Morris, the Southern writer and former editor in chief of Harper’s, and Norman Mailer. In one letter Mailer wrote, “I obviously enjoyed your page of tasty prose and would try to return auctorial tender but my mouth tastes like tablets.”Mr. Enniss said researchers would be particularly interested in the correspondence because of Mr. Frady’s connections with “a wide circle of historically significant figures.” He said Mr. Frady’s papers would be an important addition to Emory’s collection of Southern journalism.“There is a lot that this archive still has to tell,” he said. Because there was so much unpublished material, including extensive notes, he added, “there may be original observations that did not make their way into the published work that are in a sense eyewitness accounts of history.”Mr. Enniss noted that he had been to archival auctions before, but never one quite like this. “Normally it would be a Sotheby’s or Christie’s auction,” he said. “This is a very different setting. Nobody is coming around with Champagne.”At 12:07 p.m. Mr. Digregorio announced some legal preliminaries for the auction, and noted that there was one mail-in bid. With an I.R.S. collections assistant serving as a stand-in for the absent bidder, Mr. Digregorio opened the bidding at $6,000.The bid quickly went to $10,000, the absentee’s final number. Mr. Enniss secured the collection with $10,100.Ms. Gandolfo-Frady gasped. Mr. Digregorio disclosed that the mail-in bidder was in fact Furman University. Ms. Gandolfo-Frady fought back tears. “It was nice to know they were still interested,” she said.“I feel relieved that I know that his collection is in a great place and that writers, journalists and students will be able to look over his work,” she added.Kevin McKeon, an I.R.S. spokesman, declined to say what would happen to the remaining tax debt.Mr. Enniss paid up and invited Ms. Gandolfo-Frady to lunch.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','NBC has taken the unusual step of editing the online version of a “Saturday Night Live” skit. In a sketch about the government’s financial bailout package that was broadcast Saturday night, two characters identified as Herbert and Marion Sandler were labeled with on-screen words that read, “People who should be shot.” Those two characters represented real-life business managers who had sold their savings-and-loan company (and its mortgage-backed securities) to Wachovia.NBC removed the skit from its Web site, nbc.com, on Tuesday; the video reappeared on Wednesday with the label removed. Explaining the change, NBC said in a statement, “Upon review, we caught certain elements in the sketch that didn’t meet our standards.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','Another rock act has objected to the use of its music by Senator John McCain’s presidential campaign. This time it’s the band Foo Fighters, protesting the campaign’s use of its song “My Hero” at rallies. “ ‘My Hero’ was written as a celebration of the common man and his extraordinary potential,” the band said in a statement released on Wednesday. “To have it appropriated without our knowledge and used in a manner that perverts the original sentiment of the lyric just tarnishes the song.” Last month the band Heart demanded that the McCain campaign stop playing its song “Barracuda” at public appearances by Gov. Sarah Palin. And in August Jackson Browne filed suit against the Ohio Republican Party for using his song “Running on Empty” in a television commercial without his permission.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','It was the rare John Lennon-related showdown not motivated by sublimated anger toward Paul McCartney. But Lennon’s widow, Yoko Ono, and EMI Records have dropped their suit against a group of filmmakers who used Lennon’s song “Imagine” in a movie without Ms. Ono’s or EMI’s permission, Reuters reported. Ms. Ono and EMI, Lennon’s label, had sued the makers of “Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed” for using a 15-second clip of “Imagine” in the film, a documentary about teachers and scientists who support the theory of intelligent design. The filmmakers had countered that their inclusion of the song was covered by fair use. The DVD release of “Expelled” will not include the song.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','The other groups that produced the guidelines are the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.Epidemiologists contend that the challenge in reducing hospital infections, which are said to attack one of every 22 patients, has not been a dearth of guidelines but a lack of adherence.A survey of hospitals last year by The Leapfrog Group, which advocates for health-care quality, found that 87 percent did not consistently follow infection-control guidelines. Studies have found that half of hospital workers do not follow hand-washing protocols. And epidemiologists in hospitals around the country have found that an intense focus on cleanliness and prevention can lead to significant reductions in infection rates.“Too often where we fail is not in the knowledge but in the execution,” said Dr. Patrick J. Brennan, chairman of the federal Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, which supports the effort.Dr. Wise said his accrediting agency found large variations in hospitals’ practices to control infections.“The same hospital which does great at inserting a central line and maintaining that central line might do poorly in the way it handles urinary catheters,” he said, adding, “All hospitals are partially effective. Few hospitals are completely effective.”The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also endorses the new guidelines, estimates that there are 1.7 million infection cases a year in hospitals, and that 99,000 patients die after contracting them (although the infection alone may not be the cause). It projects the cost of treating hospital infections at $20 billion a year.With new research making a compelling case that infections are often preventable, many hospitals have become more aggressive. They have also been prodded by new policies by Medicare and other insurers to not pay for the added cost of treating patients who develop certain infections.But a persistent problem, hospital officials say, has been the difficulty of translating guidelines into practice.“One of the reasons hospitals are having difficulty now is that when they look at guidelines they are drinking from a fire hose,” Dr. Wise said. “There are thousands of these things, and they don’t quite know what to do with them.”The six conditions covered in the guidelines, which run 6 to 16 pages, are central-line-associated bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, and Clostridium difficile, an intestinal bacteria.Dr. David C. Classen, an epidemiologist at the University of Utah and a lead author, said his team surveyed existing recommendations and research before deciding which practices were based in solid science. Some of the existing guidelines had not been updated in years, Dr. Classen said.Among the additions were recommendations that patients with ventilators be kept in raised hospital beds and that they receive regular antiseptic oral care.The group did not change standard practices for controlling MRSA, a virulent drug-resistant bacteria that may contribute to 19,000 deaths a year. It recommends universal testing of patients for MRSA on admission — so that infected patients might be isolated and treated with special precautions — only if less burdensome efforts fail to reduce infection rates.Some hospitals have had great success with prevention programs that include universal screening. But other researchers argue that vigilant hand-washing and other precautions can be just as effective and less expensive while better caring for infected patients. The guidelines’ authors said the science remained inconclusive.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','“Most of all, I feel exuberant,” he said. “I wake up in the morning saying, ‘Yes! I wonder what’s going to happen today?’ ”It helps that the entrepreneurial urge is in his genes. He formed a theater group in college and made money creating publicity posters and Web sites. Though he weighed a career in acting or the Navy, “I always knew I wanted to start my own company and create something from nothing,” he said.In jobs after college as a fund-raiser and later as a marketer for a couple of architectural firms, he said, “I got bitten by the bug to make software to make it easier to do things.” Once, he said, for example, he redesigned an operational system that allowed his employer to create photo portfolios for clients in five minutes instead of eight hours.He said he also inherited his father’s fierce work ethic. He started Integrate in June 2005 while simultaneously studying for a master’s degree in communications at Rutgers University and holding down a part-time job as a data analyst at Johnson & Johnson.Finally, he exhibited that tell-tale trait of the entrepreneur, boundless self-confidence. After graduating in December 2005, with hardly any savings, he threw himself full-time into Integrate, with Johnson & Johnson as his first big customer.“Not that I had any huge background in computer science,” he says. “I just knew what I could do.”He had already learned from a couple of mistakes in his start-up’s early stages. The first was creating a bar code system to manage inventory for a machine shop. The problem was that the owners did not show much interest in it. The lesson, from that, he said, was, “If people aren’t going to use it, don’t make it.”The second was signing a lopsided contract with a client. The lesson there, he said, was to find a good lawyer and make sure you know exactly what you are getting into when you enter into an agreement.In 2006, with all his energies centered on Integrate, he prospered. He signed a big contract with Merrill Lynch and a few smaller deals. He hired an assistant, who, like him, worked out of her home. The money rolled in — in the low six figures in 2006 and again in 2007, with phone bills his biggest expense.But while all this was happening, Mr. Hazlett was also committing a classic blunder of the fledgling entrepreneur: putting his eggs in too few baskets. He said his gut instinct warned him of the danger, but after landing a big job with yet another big corporation last November, he stopped worrying.Then, it all fell apart. “In early January, we had 12 months of work in the pipeline,” Mr. Hazlett said. “But in just two weeks, all our active clients backed out of their contracts. We went from euphoria to fear.”After a futile search for new customers, he decided to develop a new product, event-planning software for small and medium-size organizations. Using the open-source Web framework Ruby on Rails, he spent six months writing and fine-tuning Event Clipboard.“I have a lot of faith in it, in my gut, based on my research,” he said. “We fill a niche that didn’t exist,” which he defines as groups within large corporations, nonprofits, including houses of worship, as well as small and medium-size businesses. Smaller organizations can subscribe to a personal account, which costs $20 a month, while the most advanced version sells for $160.So far, Mr. Hazlett said, he has recruited nearly 50 beta testers, “and their reaction is very positive.”The day of reckoning approaches. But he said that the road he had traveled so far had hardened him for whatever lies ahead. These are among the other lessons for running a business that he has absorbed over the past year, he said:¶Be frugal. Mr. Hazlett never sought outside financing, and has no debt. In Integrate’s heyday, he thought about renting an office, but concluded there was no compelling reason to do so. He cut his salary last year, and even so, puts much of it into his personal savings account.¶Switch to a new product or service if the one you are marketing is not selling. “I saw that we could only do one of two things: change or close our doors for good,” he said.¶Be patient. “It takes time to get it right,” he says.¶Look for opportunity in tough economic times. It was corporate cost-cutting that hurt him last year, he says, and so he is marketing Event Clipboard as a tool for the budget-conscious to save money.“I’m hoping that by the end of 2009 we’ll have 250 accounts,” he said. “I think it’s going to go.”'"
"'08-10-09,'0','Dr. Tsien (pronounced chen) added that his work was “only one little piece” amid the work of many. “It wasn’t necessarily the case they had to give it to me,” he said. “Obviously, it’s pretty nice to hear.”Dr. Chalfie never received the phone call from Sweden. “I slept through it,” he acknowledged at a news conference at Columbia. He said he had inadvertently turned down the ringer on his telephone a couple of days ago. He woke up at 6:10 in the morning and thought the soft ring was coming from a neighboring apartment.“I was a little bit annoyed that they weren’t answering their phone,” he said. “I then realized because it was after 6, that they must have announced the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. I decided to find out who the schnook was that won it this year. So I opened up my laptop and found out I was the schnook.”Biologists have long observed that some sea creatures glow in the dark. In 1962, Dr. Shimomura, then a researcher at Princeton, and Frank Johnson, a Princeton biology professor, isolated a specific glowing protein in the Aequorea victoria, a jellyfish that drifts in the ocean currents off the west coast of North America.The protein looked greenish under sunlight, yellowish under a light bulb and fluorescent green under ultraviolet light. Dr. Shimomura and Dr. Johnson called it the green protein, but now it is known as green fluorescent protein, or G.F.P. for short.The green fluorescent protein consists of a chain of 238 amino acids bent into a beer can-like cylindrical shape, and for two and a half decades it remained a little-known biological curiosity.Dr. Chalfie first heard about the protein at a seminar in 1988, and thought he might be able to use it in his studies of Caenorhabditis elegans, a transparent roundworm.“It didn’t take much to realize that if I put that fluorescent protein inside this transparent animal, I would be able to see the cells that were making it,” he said. “And that’s what we set out to do.”He thought that the fluorescent protein could be made to serve as a biological marker by splicing the gene that makes the protein into an organism’s DNA next to a gene switch or another gene.“That serves as a lantern,” Dr. Chalfie said, and biologists would be able to see when specific genes turn on or off and where different proteins are produced.He was not able to pursue the idea until Douglas C. Prasher, a scientist then at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, found the G.F.P. gene and shared it with Dr. Chalfie in 1992. Dr. Chalfie said that within a month his group was able to insert the gene into E. coli bacteria.In 1994, Dr. Chalfie and his collaborators reported that they had inserted the protein into six cells of the C. elegans worm. When placed under ultraviolet light, those cells shined green, revealing their location.For many biologists, it was a surprise that inserting the G.F.P. gene was all that needed; many had thought that other jellyfish proteins would be needed to help G.F.P. fold into its light-emitting shape.Dr. Tsien was thinking along similar lines as Dr. Chalfie, also contacting Dr. Prasher. But for the biology experiment he wanted to conduct, he needed two colors of fluorescent proteins. Dr. Tsien started mutating the G.F.P gene and looking at the resulting proteins. Some, he found, glowed blue instead of green.“That was the first evidence you could change the color,” Dr. Tsien said.Other scientists have since expanded the palette, enlisting similar proteins from corals to produce fluorescent reds. The multiple colors allow biologists to track different processes simultaneously. In one experiment, the brain of a mouse was transformed into a kaleidoscope of color by tagging different nerve cells with different fluorescent proteins.The protein has even entered the world of art. In 2000, Eduardo Kac, an artist, displayed a green glowing rabbit named Alba, which he had commissioned a French laboratory to modify genetically with the G.F.P gene.Scientists have also made green-glowing pigs and zebra fish, which they hope will aid research on stem cells and cancer.'"
"'08-10-09,'0','As the deadline for enrollment neared on Wednesday, four of the nation’s best-known mutual fund companies said they had joined the new federal program aimed at restoring confidence in the nation’s money market funds.Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, T.

"'08-10-09,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired short-range missiles off the country’s western coast this week, , South Korean media reported Wednesday, a move that comes amid tensions raised by its efforts to reassemble part of its nuclear facilities.Several news organizations reported the launches, but offered differing details.South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, quoting an unnamed government source, reported that the .North had launched two missiles on Tuesday toward international waters between the North and China.Chosun Ilbo, a mass-circulation daily in Seoul, also quoting an unnamed government source, reported that North Korea launched an unknown number of missiles from a naval base in Chodo, an island about 60 miles southwest of the North Korea capital, Pyongyang. It said the missiles were either KN-01 land-to-sea missiles or Styx ship-to-ship missiles.North Korea has deployed more missiles around Chodo and declared it a no-go zone, meaning that it may launch more missiles to mark the Oct. 10 anniversary of the ruling Workers Party of Korea, the newspaper quoted the government source as saying.But another mass-circulation newspaper, JoongAng Ilbo, said two missiles were fired Tuesday and said they were air-to-ship missiles launched from an IL-28 North Korean bomber.'"

"'08-10-10,'0','David Samson was New Jersey’s attorney general when he and his wife, Joanna, heard about Aiken six years ago. They had a weekend house in Washington, Conn., and Ms. Samson rode with a local fox-hunting club — when the weather allowed.Ms. Samson and her horses were cooped up with cabin fever when “someone told us about this awesome little horsy town, where the footing is always amazing,” she said of Aiken. “I went down and fell in love. The red-clay dirt roads. The crosswalks that have two push buttons: one for pedestrians, one higher up for horseback riders. The adorable downtown.”They kept their Connecticut house and a condo in New Jersey, but the Samsons now winter in Aiken, living in a 2,500-square-foot 1887 cottage they bought in 2002 for $380,000.There’s no such thing as holding your horses in Aiken.There are steeplechases, fox hunts, polo matches and other competitive events. The streets downtown have names like Citation Drive, Ruffian Road and Saratoga Street, and the sidewalks feature a herd of life-size fiberglass horses. In the center of the city is the Hitchcock Woods, one of the largest urban forests in America, a nearly 2,000-acre preserve meant for horsy fun, complete with hilly trails and jumps.There’s plenty of golf, too. Some courses are public; others are within private clubs or gated communities. Perhaps disappointingly, golfers ride carts, not horses, between holes.The downtown is home to mom-and-pop shops like New Image, which sells men’s suits for $45 and ball gowns for as low as $29; Equine Divine, which specializes in horse-related gifts; and Jones Supply, a hardware store that looks straight out of a Frank Capra movie.There’s a mix of restaurants, like Up Your Alley and the West Side Bowery, where the appetizers are listed as “Dinner Starting Gate,” and the salads as “Grazing Greens.”Aiken’s night life can be wild on weekends. There are students from two local colleges, the seasonal horse set and scientists from the nearby Savannah River Site, a federal nuclear production facility. All of them spill onto the sidewalks, drinks in hand, from the Aiken Brewing Company, Pat’s Martini Bar or CuiZine. At the Hotel Aiken, with its Polo Tavern and Tiki Tavern, people dance to Carolina shag, drink Jack Daniel’s and smoke with abandon.“Yes, we have smoking in Aiken,” said Jane Page Thompson, an agent with the Carolina Real Estate Company in town, “and if that’s not O.K., you probably shouldn’t come.”And, in Aiken, churches seem to sprout like mushrooms in a rainy season. “When we came to Aiken, we found God — everywhere,” said Steven Naifeh, a writer who bought a 25,000-square-foot, 29-bedroom “cottage” on Easy Street in 1989 with his companion, Gregory White Smith, also a writer, for less than $500,000. “There’s a church on every corner, with marquees, like, ‘Life Is a Lottery, Win With Christ.’ ”You’ll also find couples like Cathy and Herman Wallace, who were pushing their rarefied pooches in a pink pram outside the elegant Willcox hotel. The Wallaces, who also live part-time in Kentucky and Tennessee, spend a few weeks each year at the Willcox “because they roll out the red carpet for us and our babies,” Ms. Wallace said, referring to Patience, a bichon frisé-poodle with blue bow and collar, and Lola, a Maltese, with green bow and collar. But image and income play little part in the social scene, Ms. Samson said. “The women here care more about keeping their horses fit than getting their nails done.”Aiken’s climate is dry and sunny, there are plenty of riding opportunities, there is a lively downtown, real estate values are below the national average, and taxes are low.Smoking is allowed in restaurants and bars, but many in Aiken like that — South Carolina, after all, is tobacco country.Aiken’s equestrians may tend toward wealth, but, even so, buyers have been getting a deal. The median price of a home last year was $155,000, according to statistics from the National Association of Realtors, while the national median was $219,000. Condos go for $75,000 to $130,000; three-bedroom ranches start at $120,000; and properties with barns and paddocks range from $250,000 to more than $1 million. The Balcony, a six-acre estate, sold for $2.8 million last year. There are 757 homes on the market in Aiken, about 7 percent of the town’s stock, said David Stinson, an agent with Meybohm Realtors. Brick or clapboard ranches are most common, but there are also renovated historic frame houses, sprawling estates and country club villas that start at $300,000 and surge into the millions. There are also several high-end communities being built, including the Ridge at Chukker Creek and the New Bridge Polo & Country Club.Part-timers make up 17 percent of homeowners, said Sandra Korbelik, Aiken’s senior planner, and the town is one of the fastest-growing second-home communities in the country.Edward Bernard, an oil executive from Point Clear, Ala., bought an antebellum house on five acres in Aiken three years ago for $350,000. He owns 500 more acres, on which he has put in three polo fields and several hunter/jumper arenas. He sells 10-acre lots for $150,000 apiece. Mr. Bernard said: “A gal from up North just came down and said, ‘You’re kidding, right?

"'08-10-10,'0','Some things that teenagers were doing during the Shwayze concert Wednesday night at the Blender Theater at Gramercy: making out, fighting, dancing closely in pairs, texting, crying, getting escorted out by security.Something a few parents, seated at the back of the theater, were doing: pretending they didn’t mind.“There are a lot of under-age girls,” Shwayze said. “I see the under-ageness.”Another school night, another opportunity for corruption by the rapper Shwayze, who hails from Malibu, and Cisco Adler, formerly of the band Whitestarr, who produces his music. Together they made “Buzzin’,” one of the summer’s biggest rap hits, even if it was all but ignored by hip-hop audiences. Instead its popularity was buoyed by pop radio; an MTV reality show of the same name, which chronicled the duo’s misadventures in a style that suggested a stoner infomercial; and in ads for Pontiac, which showed that misadventure can still make for great marketing, at least in the minds of marketers.Sun-bleached and sauntering, “Buzzin’ ” is unmistakably Southern Californian in origin. And like most songs on Shwayze’s self-titled debut album (on Suretone/Geffen), it sounds more genial than it really is. (In a sleight of nomenclature, Shwayze is both the rapper’s name and the name of his partnership with Mr. Adler.) His music has unlikely antecedents — the crossover hits of Crazy Town, the offhandedness of the Pharcyde, Everlast’s blues-rap, the emoting of Atmosphere. Slipped in between Mr. Adler’s gently sung, surprisingly sticky hooks, his raps detail nights of endless parties, nameless women and copious substance intake (sample song titles: “Corona and Lime,” “Mary Jane”), yet somehow connote warmth.So when Shwayze and Mr. Adler inquired of their impressionable audience, largely not yet able to vote, about grown-folks subject matter, they did it with smiles on their faces. They kept grinning as they asked for a spotlight to be aimed at a young couple who were kissing, egging them on until they stopped. The songs — raunchy but never off-putting — felt almost incidental, especially when Mr. Adler gazed upon the crowd as if he were getting away with something.Still, the mood had spread. Outside, after the show, some new bonds were forming. “Go home,” a young blond girl told a beefy boy with a buzz cut. “Facebook me.” She blew him a kiss. “I love you, baby.”'"
"'08-10-10,'0','But going down the city’s political chain, there are dozens of candidates like Ms. Simon who feel that the campaigns they have worked to build are now in limbo.For months, even years, they have gone through the painstaking duties of registering and following the guidelines of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, which calls for meticulous record-keeping. They have reordered the routine of their lives for fund-raising events and campaign forums.They now face an uncertain political landscape.Ms. Simon had planned to run for an open seat, since the incumbent, Councilman David Yassky, is barred from running for re-election under the current law and had been planning to run for city comptroller. But Mr. Yassky said he would run for comptroller only if the incumbent, William C. Thompson Jr. (who is also a candidate for mayor), did not run for comptroller again.“There is a lot that’s not clear right now,” Ms. Simon said.A few candidates, however, said that they supported four more years of a Bloomberg administration and that they would be happy to wait until 2013.“My feeling is that, when we’re in a time of economic crisis, that it’s in the city’s best interest to extend term limits,” said David G. Greenfield, a candidate for the City Council seat now represented by Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat in Borough Park.Mr. Greenfield, who is the executive director of the Sephardic Community Federation, is also the top fund-raiser among City Council candidates, having amassed $177,000 in campaign contributions. But he said he would not mind supporting Mr. Felder for re-election.“The reality is that both the mayor and City Council have spent the last seven years in a position where they have a better understanding of the city’s economy than anyone else,” he said. “And I think Simcha Felder has done a good job and I would be happy to support him again. I’m more than happy to do my part and wait it out for another few years.”Mr. Greenfield’s view about delaying his candidacy is rare. Most Council candidates say they are frustrated by the prospect of an extension of term limits. And many contend that running against incumbents — who have name recognition, free mailings and fund-raising advantages — would be too hard.“I’m not sure that it’s a viable campaign for me if there is no vacant seat,” said Mark H. Pollard, a lawyer who is a candidate for the City Council seat held by Albert Vann in Brooklyn.“It’s almost impossible to beat an incumbent,” Mr. Pollard said. “And it’s not something I’m sure I would want to do. I used to be Al Vann’s counsel.”Still, some candidates say they will run even if the City Council decides to alter the term limits law, which was approved in two public referendums.“There is nothing on the face of this earth that would cause me to drop out,” said Saquan Jones, an auditor at Columbia University who is also running for the Council seat represented by Mr. Vann in the district anchored in Bedford-Stuyvesant.“Sure, it’s more challenging to run against an incumbent,” Mr. Jones said. “But it’s also more stimulating. I think that only the people whose hearts are committed to running will keep going forward.”Similarly, Ydanis Rodriguez, a teacher and grass-roots organizer, said he would continue with his plans to run for the City Council seat in the district in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, even if the incumbent, Miguel Martinez, ran for re-election.“I’m not going to change my plans,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “But I find this entire situation to be very frustrating. It’s frustrating for me as a candidate, but it’s even more frustrating for me as a social studies teacher.”Mr. Rodriguez, who teaches in a high school in Washington Heights, said: “It’s painful for me to tell my students about democracy and that the will of the people is the foundation of this country. And then, I have to watch a city where billionaires like Bloomberg get to decide what happens.”'"

"'08-10-10,'0','“There are going to be some recommendations to him about what should be done,” though Dr. Griffin may not immediately decide the mission’s fate, said Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman.Even before the latest financial snag, the mission had gone over cost by at least $200 million, raising the total to $1.7 billion, and NASA had been forced to juggle its finances for this year to cover overruns in the program.“The cupboard is kind of bare now,” said Sean C. Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, chairman of the planetary science subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council. “And to come up with $100 million-plus gets really, really challenging.”Last week NASA officials gave an update on the Mars Science Laboratory to the subcommittee, which provides feedback from scientists to NASA in the planning of planetary missions. The officials, Dr. Solomon said, did not give details of why the mission’s costs had swelled again.The Mars Science Laboratory aims high, both in its technological requirements and in its science goals. It would weigh about 1,800 pounds, or more than four times as much as either the Opportunity or Spirit rover, both currently on Mars. Pellets of decaying plutonium rather than solar panels would provide sufficient power for larger and more sophisticated instruments in its 140-pound scientific payload.But the laboratory is too big and heavy to employ the bouncing cocoon of airbags that cushioned the landings of Spirit and Opportunity. Instead, engineers devised a completely new landing scheme. After parachutes slow the spacecraft’s descent through the atmosphere, rocket thrusters are to fire, enabling the craft to slow to a stop and hover in midair. The rover would then be lowered via a winch to the surface. (The hovering part of the spacecraft would fly away and crash.)In his presentation to the planetary science subcommittee, James L. Green, director of NASA’s planetary science division, said that to make up for the new overrun, the agency could delay or cancel missions like Grail and Ladee, which are to visit the Moon, or Juno, a return to Jupiter and its moons. But such a step could start a domino effect that would disrupt the entire solar system program.Another option is to delay the Mars Science Laboratory’s launching by a year and then park the spacecraft in orbit around the Sun for a year, until Mars and Earth are again in close alignment. That option, in which the craft would arrive at Mars two years later than planned, would add $300 million.Yet another option — adding tens of millions of dollars beyond that one, Dr. Green said in his presentation — would be a two-year delay in launching.Dr. Solomon said there was no support on his subcommittee for the most drastic choice: cancellation. “We didn’t think it was a good use of NASA’s funds invested already,” he said.Another member of the subcommittee, Kip V. Hodges, a professor of earth and space exploration at Arizona State University, said: “One of the things they wanted our opinion on is, is this a critically important mission? And the answer to that is absolutely yes.”But Dr. Hodges also wondered what opportunities might be lost to the Mars Science Laboratory’s growing costs.“At some time,” he said, “when you’re on fixed income, you have to think how far you can go even if it’s an excellent mission.”'"
"'08-10-10,'0','He also argues that it is “critical that the U.S. be able to build the components for these plants and reactors within our own country so that we are not dependent on foreign suppliers with long wait times.”Because nuclear energy is virtually carbon neutral, some environmentalists who opposed its use now are more open to it.Elgie Holstein, an adviser to Mr. Obama on energy issues, accused the McCain campaign of misrepresenting Mr. Obama’s position on nuclear power.“Some specific proposals that Senator McCain has made are troubling,” Mr. Holstein said, because of the problems of storage and reprocessing, and the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear fuel.“Senator Obama definitely understands that nuclear power plays a major role in our electricity mix and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future,” Mr. Holstein, a former Energy Department official said. “He doesn’t favor shutting down power plants and hasn’t come out against extending their licenses, so it is simply incorrect to say he is anti-nuclear-power.”It is probably safe to say that Democrats as a group are less enthusiastic than Republicans about nuclear energy. The 57-page platform adopted at the Democrats’ convention in Denver in August does not mention nuclear power.Mr. Obama is from Illinois, which has more nuclear reactors than any other state, and during the Democratic primary season drew fire from rivals for donations he had received from the company that operates those reactors. In his acceptance speech in Denver, Mr. Obama vowed that as president he would “find ways to safely harness nuclear power.”Mr. McCain restated his support for nuclear power in the first two presidential debates, and criticized Mr. Obama. Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, did not respond to phone calls and e-mail messages over a one-month period requesting an interview with one of Mr. McCain’s energy advisers to elaborate on Mr. McCain’s stance.On the campaign trail, Mr. McCain has repeatedly cited France as a model for the development of nuclear power in the United States. In France, 59 nuclear power plants generate nearly 80 percent of the country’s electricity, helping to reduce carbon emissions and producing a surplus that has made France one of the largest net electricity exporters in the world.In France, the government controls both the construction of nuclear power plants and the generation and distribution of electricity.“Putting aside the question of whether it is advisable to have an electricity system dominated by one mode of generation, it is a little odd for him to point to the heavily subsidized French case and say we should be emulating it,” Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said of Mr. McCain. “It would take a massive shift in government policy to proceed in the French direction, and it would be antithetical to the United States and how it operates, since it would be a quasi-socialist system.”In campaign speeches, Mr. McCain also estimates that his program to build nuclear reactors would “provide 700,000 jobs for American workers.”Some nuclear power experts offer more modest figures, noting that much of the heavy foundry work and other tasks would have to be done overseas, at least in the initial phase.But Mr. McCain has said he wants such work to be done within the United States, even though he noted in July in Missouri that “our manufacturing base to even construct these plants is almost gone,” and added, “We will need to recover all the knowledge and skills that have been lost over three stagnant decades in a highly technical field.”Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace and the co-chairman of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, a pro-nuclear group, estimated that each reactor would cost up to $8 billion and would generate 3,000 to 4,000 jobs during the construction phase and up to 800 permanent jobs once in operation.Asked to provide a ballpark figure on employment if all 45 reactors were to be built, Mr. Moore, responded, “225,000 good union jobs that you can support a family on.”Trade groups like the Nuclear Energy Institute favor plans similar to Mr. McCain’s proposal to build 45 nuclear reactors, but some energy experts say that would require billions of dollars in new subsidies and be an inefficient use of taxpayers’ money, no matter how many jobs were generated.Those experts seem to prefer Mr. Obama’s promise to invest $150 billion in clean-energy projects over 10 years, the bulk of which would probably be directed toward non-nuclear energy sources.“The two big hurdles to the construction of nuclear plants in the United States are that they are not economically competitive and cannot be privately financed, so the real issue McCain should be addressing is how he proposes to pay for them,” said Tom Cochran, a physicist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. “You’re simply penalizing the programs and technology that include improvements in energy efficiency and can provide climate mitigation more quickly, cheaply and safely.”Mr. McCain has sought to defuse concerns about the safety of reactors by noting his own service aboard the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the Enterprise. During the more than 50 years that the United States Navy has deployed nuclear vessels, “there has never been an accident,” he said recently in a campaign swing through Florida.Strictly speaking, that statement is not correct. While it is true there has never been a known fatal accident involving nuclear material aboard a naval vessel, vessels have suffered blowback from radioactive waste or leaked radioactive coolant water in domestic waters and foreign ports, which generated complaints from governments in Japan and Singapore.In large part because of safety concerns, the two candidates disagree on whether the federal government should build a nuclear storage facility at Yucca Mountain, Nev., about 90 miles north of Las Vegas.Mr. McCain favors the proposal. Mr. Obama opposes it, arguing that a better short-term solution is to continue to store nuclear waste at the reactors that produce it “until we find a safe, long-term disposal solution that is based on sound science.”'"

"'08-10-10,'0','There is no evidence that questionable contributions amount to anything more than a small portion of Mr. Obama’s fund-raising haul. The Times’s analysis, conducted over a few days and looking for obvious anomalies, like names or addresses with all consonants, identified about $40,000 in suspect contributions that had not been refunded by the campaign as of its last filing with the Federal Election Commission, in September.It appears that campaign finance records for Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, contain far fewer obviously false names, although he has taken in about $200 million in contributions, less than half Mr. Obama’s total. Mr. McCain did collect about $173,000 from donors who appear in campaign finance records with only a name and have no other identifying information. Mr. Obama collected about $314,000 from such donors.Although campaigns have long wrestled with questionable donations, Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, said the record-setting number of new donors Mr. Obama has drawn, many of them online, presents new challenges to a compliance system that remains stuck in the past.Ms. Krumholz pointed out, however, that it would take an extraordinary amount of coordination to pull off widespread fraud.Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, highlighted the more than 2.5 million donors it had to wade through. “We have been aggressive about taking every available step,” he said, “to make sure our contributions are appropriate, updating our systems when necessary.”But even a contributor who used the name “Jgtj Jfggjjfgj,” and listed an address of “thjtrj” in “gjtjtjtjtjtjr, AP,” was able to contribute $370 in a series of $10 donations in August.A pair of donors named “Derty West” and “Derty Poiiuy,” who listed “rewq, ME” as their addresses and “Qwertyyy” or “Qwerttyyu” as either their employer or occupation, contributed a combined $1,110 in July.In some cases, campaign finance records showed refunds from the Obama campaign, presumably to donors’ credit cards, even as other contributions were accepted. Obama officials said most of their vetting occurred after a donation came in.Officials with campaign finance watchdog groups said that there was no proof of a widespread problem, but that the issue certainly warranted additional scrutiny.“I think the candidates need to be clearer about the vetting systems they’re using and demonstrating they’re sufficient to weed out potential fraud,” said Stephen Weissman, associate director for policy at the Campaign Finance Institute.The questionable donations to the Obama campaign, most of which appear to have been given in small increments online, are bolstering the contentions of some campaign finance groups that additional disclosure requirements are needed for contributions of $200 or less.Federal candidates are not required to itemize such contributions to the F.E.C. unless the donor’s cumulative total adds up to more than $200. Roughly 70 percent of these contributions to Mr. Obama are not reported, compared with more than 75 percent of Mr. McCain’s.On Monday the Republican National Committee filed a complaint against the Obama campaign with the F.E.C., questioning the legitimacy of the more than $220 million in small donations to Mr. Obama’s campaign.The complaint followed an article on the conservative Web site Newsmax.com that highlighted thousands of dollars in contributions, made in increments of $25 dating back to March, from “Good Will” in Austin, Tex., who listed his employer as “Loving” and his occupation as “You,” as well as thousands in small contributions that started last November from a “Doodad Pro” in Nunda, N.Y., with the same employer and occupation.Doodad Pro and Good Will, who made more than 1,000 contributions each and whose totals far exceeded the $4,600 that individuals can legally give to the primary and general elections, were flagged by the F.E.C. in standard letters regarding excess contributions sent to the Obama campaign. The commission alerted the campaign about Good Will as early as June, giving it 30 days to respond.The Obama campaign refunded several thousand dollars in contributions to the two donors, even before receiving the letters from the F.E.C. But its campaign finance filing in September showed it had failed to refund more than $10,000 in donations from each of them, although Obama officials say all of the money has now been returned.Even though Good Will made more than $7,000 in contributions to the Obama campaign in March, and even more after that, Suzanha Burmeister, marketing director at Goodwill Industries of Central Texas, a nonprofit group whose address matches the one listed by the donor, said the organization was not contacted by the campaign until September.The group was not asked about fraud but instead received several letters informing the donor that he had exceeded his contribution limit for the primary and asking if he wanted to redirect the excess to the general election.Someone from the group immediately called the Obama campaign, Ms. Burmeister said, and was told it was having “integrity issues” with its online donations. “They must be really backlogged,” she said.The contributions from Doodad Pro shot up to $11,275 in February alone, of which F.E.C. records show the Obama campaign refunded only $2,550 initially.The address listed by Doodad Pro leads to Lloyd & Lynn’s Liquor & Wine in Nunda, a town of about 3,000 people.Lynn Kirwan, one of the store’s owners, said they used to share an address with a consignment shop called Doodad’s. Several months earlier, she said, the local police contacted the store to ask about some athletic equipment that had been ordered by a Doodad Pro, but she said they had heard nothing from the Obama campaign.Another donor apparently connected to Good Will and Doodad Pro, “Fornari Usa,” listed the same “Loving” and “You” under employer and occupation, and made a series of $25 donations to Mr. Obama in May, totaling $1,050.The address leads to a women’s clothing store, Fornari U.S.A., in Milpitas, Calif. Levi Lazo, a sales associate, said she and her manager were mystified by the donations.“None of us,” Ms. Lazo said, “have made any contributions.”'"
"'08-10-10,'0','A short time later, James T. Harris, a conservative talk radio host in Wisconsin who was one of the few African-Americans in the crowd, stood up and told Mr. McCain that in the next presidential debate, on Wednesday, “it’s absolutely vital that you take it to Obama, that you hit him” where it hurts, because “we have all of these shady characters that have surrounded him,” as well as, he said, Mr. Obama’s former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.Although Mr. McCain did not mention Mr. Ayers, a founder of the radical group the Weather Underground, by name, his intent was clear in his response to a question about Mr. Obama. A man told Mr. McCain that “we’re all wondering why Obama is where he’s at” in the polls and then asked, “Is there not a way to get around this media and line up the people he has hung with?”Mr. McCain responded, “Well, sir, with your help and the people in this room, we will find out.” He added: “Look, we don’t care about an old washed-up terrorist and his wife, who still, at least on Sept. 11, 2001, said he still wanted to bomb more. You know, but that’s not the point here. The point is, Senator Obama said he was just a guy in the neighborhood. We need to know that’s not true.”Although Mr. McCain raised questions about Mr. Obama’s ties to Mr. Ayers in a televised interview last spring, he has refrained from attacking Mr. Obama on the trail for his association with Mr. Ayers in the general election campaign. He had left those attacks to his campaign operatives and Ms. Palin.Mr. McCain’s reference to Mr. Ayers’s desire to carry out more bombings was from an article in The New York Times, published by chance on Sept. 11, 2001, about Mr. Ayers and his memoir, “Fugitive Days.” The article opened with a quotation: “I don’t regret setting bombs. I feel we didn’t do enough.” Three days later, Mr. Ayers wrote on his Web site that the meaning of his remarks had been distorted.Most of the bombings attributed to the Weathermen were meant to damage only property, but a 1970 pipe bombing in San Francisco attributed to the group killed a police officer and severely hurt another.Mr. Ayers is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and lives in Mr. Obama’s neighborhood. He was named citizen of the year in Chicago in 1997, has worked with Mr. Obama on a schools project and a charitable board, and gave a house party when Mr. Obama was running for the State Senate.In Ohio, Mr. Obama took aim at Mr. McCain’s mortgage plan, which would allow millions of struggling Americans to refinance their mortgages with government help, leaving taxpayers to cover the losses rather than the banks or other institutions that hold the mortgages. Mr. Obama also released an advertisement assailing the plan.Mr. Obama zeroed in on the potential cost to taxpayers, which would result from the government’s having to pay full face value on the mortgage papers even if the homes were worth less than the outstanding mortgage balance.“It’s a plan that would guarantee that American taxpayers lose by handing over $300 billion to underwrite the kind of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street that got us into this mess,” Mr. Obama said from a platform above the pitcher’s mound at the Dayton Dragons stadium.“It’s not just that Senator McCain’s bailout rewards irresponsible lenders,” Mr. Obama added, “it’s that his bailout would make it more likely that those lenders keep up their bad behavior.”Mr. Obama also tweaked Mr. McCain for owning — with his wife or through her family — about seven homes, condominiums and other dwellings. Mr. Obama promised to enact a change that would allow bankruptcy judges to write down mortgages only for people who have just one home.'"

"'08-10-10,'0','“Revenue from ticket sales will always be important,” Ms. Levin said, “but remaining affordable to serve loyal patrons is likely to be a priority for most organizations during times of economic uncertainty.”Here are some suggestions for how to get the most for your cultural dollar.Perhaps nothing symbolizes the entertainment draw of New York better than Broadway, and the theater world has the most extensive discount system.The classic Broadway buck-saver is the TKTS booth, operated by the nonprofit ( ). With tickets at 25 to 50 percent off, and sometimes more, it has locations in Times Square, South Street Seaport and, since July, downtown . On Thursday its gleaming new Times Square facility will open with a bonus: credit cards will finally be accepted.Broadway and Off Broadway producers also advertise through Season of Savings, a booklet of coupons for up to 55 percent off, distributed in newspapers and available on the Web ( ). It was created in response to the drop in theater attendance after 9/11, said Nancy Coyne of the Broadway advertising agency Serino Coyne, which runs the program.“We were nervous that New Yorkers needed more than just Giuliani telling them to go to the theater,” Ms. Coyne said, referring to reassurances at the time by Mayor .In addition, most Broadway shows have rush or standing-room tickets sold before the performance; a handful, including “Avenue Q, and have daily lotteries for front-row seats under $30. Onstage seating is available at ($40) and “Equus” ($76.50 for most shows; details at ).Among Off Broadway’s many deals, the ( ) is selling Sunday evening tickets for $20, and the Keen Company ( ) is offering 15 seats to Jan de Hartog’s “Fourposter” on Tuesdays for $15. A cluster of Web sites, including and , have sizable deals for Broadway, Off Broadway and beyond.One major new bargain in town is Free Night of Theater, a nationwide event organized by the Theater Communications Group. Begun three years ago in , and , Tex., it has now expanded to 120 cities, including New York for the first time.In New York 115 theaters are giving away about 6,000 tickets for performances from Thursday to the end of October. “Fuerzabruta” at the Daryl Roth Theater, and “The Language of Trees” at the , and at the are all on the list. Free Night’s Web site ( ) began accepting reservations last week; most spots have been claimed, but theaters may add more, said Phillip Matthews, the director of audience programs for Theater Communications Group.There is a kind of benevolent class system to the discount game, favoring students and retirees — at least those with time to spare.The ( ) sells $12 tickets to students and has deals for people 65 and older. At ( ), students are eligible for subscriptions at $15 per concert and both students and those 65 and older can get into some concerts for $10; student entry to the ( ) is $10 at the box office the day of the show, or half-price in advance.The catch is that it is almost a job in itself to keep track of all the rules and schedules. Those student tickets at the Philharmonic go on sale 10 days before the performance, and tickets for age 65 and over the day of the concert, if the show is not sold out; Carnegie’s discounts go on sale weekly.Students and those 65 and older, get to the Brooklyn Academy of Music ( ) 90 minutes before show time for $10 entry. But you’ll need to act fast to get the special $20 orchestra seats at the Metropolitan Opera ( ), offered for most performances Mondays through Thursdays. They go on sale two hours before showtime, and the line forms early for the most popular shows.( ) gives 40 percent off to students and those 65 and older, as well as performing artists, who should be prepared to show some proof of creative employment (a review, for example).The rules are even more byzantine on Broadway.For “Spring Awakening,” for example, student rush tickets go on sale each day when the box office opens, but for be there two hours before the curtain; has rush tickets, but only on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Rush tickets for are available for each performance except Saturday night, and you need not be a student, but for “Speed-the-Plow” they go on sale two hours before showtime — and have that student ID ready.Got all that?Discounts are nice, but you can’t beat free. Besides Free Night of Theater, there’s a wealth of world-class arts events in New York offered gratis.On Friday the World Financial Center ( ) presents a piano marathon honoring , with Geri Allen, Randy Weston and Chucho Valdés. Later this season are the composer Bobby Previte (Oct. 28), the Limón Dance Company (Nov. 4) and 20th-century choral with Musica Sacra (Nov. 18) — all free.The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s new “Poems & Pints” series ( ) presents major American poets at Fraunces Tavern, one of the oldest buildings in .

Many other museums offer discounted hours: On Friday nights, for example, ( ) is free, the Guggenheim ( ) is half-price, and you can pay what you wish at the Whitney ( ).The of the DealIt may be too soon for many arts institutions to gauge how the recent economic tumult will affect attendance and sales, and to decide how to react. Some are starting with community outreach: in response to the bad news on Wall Street, the has added career counseling to the programming of its new downtown branch, 92YTribeca, which opens next weekend.But for the city’s most dedicated cultural bargain hunters, a good deal is a good deal no matter what is happening in the economy.Outside the Metropolitan Opera one afternoon this week, 100 or so patrons were lined up for $20 orchestra seats to see Strauss’s — seats that normally cost up to $175. (Starting Monday the Met will offer prime tickets to ’s “Doctor Atomic” for $20 and $30 thanks to a $500,000 donation by Agnes Varis and her husband, Karl Leichtman, who financed the original $20 program, which is now three years old.)They had brought books and magazines to read while waiting for the tickets to go on sale at 6. Linda Larys, 70, said she went to the opera about five times a season and got the discount whenever possible.“These are cheap tickets,” she said. “That’s why we’re here.”'"
"'08-10-10,'0','Indeed, Japan, where government guidance of banking and big industry was commonplace, fell into a prolonged state of denial, deferring painful write-offs by its banks. Instead, Japan tried to reflate its way out of the mess with heavy public works spending, racking up a huge national debt. When those stimulus efforts failed, the country was finally forced to at least partly break up the collusive ties between business and government that had slowed a real cleanup and to create the more independent Financial Services Agency to restore faith in its market oversight.These bitter memories, still raw here, have made Japan sympathetic to Washington’s efforts and reluctant to lecture America, even though Japanese banks have escaped the current crisis relatively unscathed so far because they held little American mortgage debt. That is in contrast to the 1980s, when Tokyo was fond of rebuking Washington for its economic failings, or the 1990s when Americans did the same to the ailing Japan.Rather, Japan has taken a more self-flagellant view, eagerly pointing to its past failures as a cautionary tale of the challenges and pitfalls that could still lie ahead for Americans. But just how similar America’s and Japan’s roads are remains a matter of debate.For one, the easy cash that fueled the two countries’ real estate bubbles came from different sources. Japan’s bubble was domestically financed and lubricated by excessively low interest rates. The United States borrowed heavily from overseas, especially from China and Japan. America’s more transparent financial system exposed underlying problems relatively quickly, while Japan spent years understating the losses at its banks with fuzzy accounting methods.Still, one striking similarity was the intense public resistance in Japan to a taxpayer-financed bailout, even after it became apparent that financial companies were in trouble. When Japan finally made its first injection of public funds, putting some $6.5 billion in 1995 into nonbanking real estate lenders, the effort stirred public outrage, including sit-ins in Parliament by opposition lawmakers. It was not until 1998 that Japan finally committed taxpayer funds to a sweeping financial cleanup, only after the collapse of large banks and brokerages, including Yamaichi Securities.That is about the point in the crisis the United States has reached with last week’s bailout package, many Japanese economists and business leaders say. In Japan’s case, some of the most costly and wrenching steps were yet to come.In Japan, the first $17 billion bailout package, disbursed in 1998, proved woefully inadequate. As the true size of the lending losses became apparent, the government was forced to make a second bailout of $82 billion in 1999 to shore up the capital at weakened lenders by buying their stock. The government also committed billions more to buying problem loans, reimbursing depositors in failed institutions and taking over several banks. When the crisis finally passed around 2004, Japan, an economy about 40 percent the size of the United States’, had spent some $450 billion on its bailouts.Most of the government officials, business leaders and economists interviewed praised America’s plan to spend $700 billion buying troubled mortgage-related assets from banks. But they also said they expected that Washington would soon have to put together another huge bailout package, this time to recapitalize American banks, especially with the International Monetary Fund now estimating total bank losses from the subprime mortgage crisis to reach $1.4 trillion.On the other hand, another lesson from Japan is that the American bailout may end up costing taxpayers far less than $700 billion or whatever the final figure may be. Japanese regulators were eventually able to recover all but $100 billion of the $450 billion spent by selling off the troubled loans and bank stocks later, after the economy had rebounded.A final lesson may be that the crisis will spill over into the real economy, confronting America with the prospect of a long, grim recession. But that might not be all bad, said Yukio Noguchi, a finance professor at Waseda University, if the recession forces Americans to consume less and kick the habit of overseas borrowing.“The final chapter of the crisis,” Dr. Noguchi said, “may be when Americans finally learn to live within their means.”'"
"'08-10-10,'0','“Iceland is bankrupt,” said Arsaell Valfells, a professor at the University of Iceland. “The Icelandic krona is history. The only sensible option is for the I.M.F. to come and rescue us.”Prime Minister Geir Haarde, who had warned this week of the threat of “national bankruptcy,” declined to say Thursday whether Iceland was seeking a rescue package from the International Monetary Fund.“We will certainly keep this option open, but we have not yet made a decision,” he said at a news conference here.A fact-finding team from the International Monetary Fund has been in Reykjavik all week, and Mr. Haarde said Thursday that the finance minister, Arni Mathiesen, was on his way to Washington for the annual meeting of the monetary fund and the World Bank this weekend.The fund’s managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said in Washington that he had activated an emergency financing system, last used during the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, intended to expedite loans to countries in crisis.“We are ready to answer any demand by countries facing problems,” he said. He did not mention Iceland by name.Iceland has already approached Russia about the possibility of a 4 billion euro loan to help see it through the crisis, but Mr. Haarde said no agreement had been reached.The I.M.F.’s intervention in Iceland would underline the extraordinary reversal in the country’s fortunes after a decade-long, debt-fueled binge by the country’s banks, businesses and some citizens. The banks, while avoiding the troubled mortgage securities that have humbled Wall Street, expanded aggressively at home and abroad. When credit tightened and the krona fell this year, they were unable to finance their debts, many of which are denominated in foreign currencies.In these circumstances, going to the monetary fund “is probably the only thing Iceland can do,” said Richard Portes, an economist at London Business School who has studied the country’s financial problems.On Thursday, the government seized Kaupthing Bank, the country’s largest lender, effectively completing the nationalization of the banking system after the earlier takeover of two other banks, Glitnir and Landsbanki.The stock exchange will remain closed until Monday, the government said.Mr. Haarde acknowledged that international trading in the currency had essentially ended. Bloomberg News cited traders at Nordea Bank as saying the last quoted value of the krona had been 340 to the euro — less than half what the Icelandic currency was worth at the start of the week.Mr. Haarde said Thursday the central bank of Iceland had set up a special system to handle currency transactions, so that Icelandic companies could conduct international business.“There are hiccups in the foreign exchange market,” he said. “If not today, then tomorrow, there will be more trading in the currency.”Sounding surprisingly unworried for the leader of a country facing economic and financial disaster, he said, “We are gradually moving through this crisis.” He added, “There are still a few issues to resolve, but that is the nature of these kinds of things.”Analysts say the problems with the krona have been at the core of the government’s inability to control the crisis. Without a viable currency, it is not possible to support the banks, which have done the bulk of their business in foreign markets. There is also no way to bring down inflation or interest rates, both of which were already in double digits before the crisis intensified in recent days.Mr. Valfells and Mr. Portes said that once the situation was stabilized, presumably with help from the I.M.F., the best course would be for Iceland to give up on the krona entirely and to adopt the euro.How could Iceland, which is not even a member of the European Union, adopt the single currency?One option would be to simply peg the Icelandic currency to the euro. In that case, Iceland would also hand over control of monetary policy, including the setting of interest rates, to the European Central Bank.But fixing the currency to the euro could be difficult for Iceland, given that its central bank probably lacks the reserves to defend such a level if the currency were to come under renewed attack.That leaves another option: applying to join the European Union and adopting the euro. Because Iceland is already part of the European Economic Area, a looser trading group, it abides by many European Union rules.Still, such a move would be politically challenging. The conservative Independence Party, headed by the prime minister, has been firmly against it.'"
"'08-10-10,'0','Last month, when he defended his before Congress, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was reluctant to have the government take an ownership stake in the banks that taxpayers are going to rescue. It came as a relief on Wednesday when he executed an about-face and said that the Treasury was now considering doing just that.In the weeks since the bailout was announced, the financial markets and broader economy have continued to deteriorate, with credit still in a deep freeze and the stock market plunging anew in the last two hours of trading on Thursday.Injecting cash directly into banks in exchange for an ownership share would provide a quicker and more powerful boost to the financial system than the measures proposed in the original bailout plan. It would also be a better deal for taxpayers, because it would give them a direct claim on any postbailout profits earned by the bank.Mr. Paulson’s original plan, which was modified by Congress to include the possibility of the government taking equity positions, envisioned a complex process in which taxpayer money would be used to buy banks’ bad assets. That would enable the banks to start lending again and would drain a lot of the poison that is ruining their health. Once taxpayers graciously put the banks on the road to recovery, the original plan assumed that private equity firms and other investors would invest loads of fresh capital in them and reap, for themselves, the subsequent gains.Workable, perhaps, but infuriating. Investing money in exchange for equity is more efficient and — not incidentally — more fair.'"
"'08-10-10,'0','This 30-second advertisement for Senator Barack Obama will be shown across the nation on national cable television, according to the campaign. It is titled “Tested.”THE SCRIPT A narrator says: “In a time of crisis, our leaders’ judgment is tested. On Tuesday, an announcement.” Senator John McCain: “I would order the secretary of the Treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America.” The narrator: “On Wednesday, the details. McCain would shift the burden from lenders to taxpayers guaranteeing a loss of taxpayer money. Who wins? The same lenders that caused the crisis in the first place. Putting bad actors ahead of taxpayers? We can’t afford more of the same.”ON THE SCREEN The advertisement opens with still images: a foreclosed home with a “For Sale” sign, a worried stock trader, the Capitol. Then a clip of Mr. McCain’s announcing of his home mortgage plan at the debate Tuesday. The narrator says the plan would “shift the burden from lenders to taxpayers” as a graphic of a CNN Money.com article that reaches a similar conclusion appears on the screen. The advertisement ends with images of a street sign on Wall Street, followed by a photograph of Mr. McCain with President Bush.ACCURACY Even Mr. McCain’s economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, conceded that the plan would place a burden on taxpayers. Under the proposal, the government could buy the home loans of Americans who are at risk of defaulting (or are already delinquent) and allow them to obtain new mortgages at more favorable rates. Taxpayers would be responsible for the difference in value between the old and new mortgages. It is very likely the McCain plan would result in “a loss of taxpayer money,” as the message says.While the advertisement portrays lenders as the winners in this arrangement, it fails to acknowledge the potential benefits to homeowners, namely more affordable mortgages. Mr. Holtz-Eakin has also noted that stabilizing home values would speed economic recovery. The commercial does not mention the fact that legislation, including the $700 billion bailout bill that Congress and the president approved last week, paved the way for the plan that Mr. McCain proposed. Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama supported the bill.SCORECARD With millions of Americans at risk of foreclosure, Mr. Obama has seized on Mr. McCain’s mortgage proposal as a way to question his judgment on economic issues. While the advertisement glosses over the critical point of the McCain plan — that it is meant to be a lifeline for homeowners before they slide into foreclosure — it makes some valid points about the new liabilities taxpayers would face.

"'08-10-10,'0','Apollo Management, the private equity giant, offered to pay $540 million on Thursday to help close the $6.5 billion merger between its subsidiary, Hexion Specialty Chemicals, and a rival chemical maker, the Huntsman Corporation.The offer was an effort to prod banks that have committed to financing the deal to live up to their lending agreements, a difficult task given the unsettled credit markets.Shares in Huntsman surged 28 percent to $11.64 on Thursday, as investors hoped that an end was in sight for one of the most bruising battles over a private equity deal in recent years.Negotiations for the deal, which was struck in July 2007, have been bogged down by a fight in Delaware courts, where a judge prevented Hexion from backing out and ordered it to make its “reasonable best efforts” to complete the merger.Devised at the height of the credit boom, the Huntsman-Hexion merger was to be financed mostly with debt, including a loan package of more than $15 billion, to be provided by Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.'"

"'08-10-11,'0','Carl Crawford managed the first hit by lining Matsuzaka’s 1-0 fastball to right field for a single to lead off the seventh. The Red Sox had two relievers getting ready. As Cliff Floyd’s single to left put runners on first and third, Matsuzaka had morphed from having no problems to having a lot of issues.But Matsuzaka, who had looked like a lost soul in the first, steadied himself and plowed ahead against the bottom three hitters in the lineup. He retired Dioner Navarro on a popout, struck out Gabe Gross and induced Jason Bartlett to ground out. Matsuzaka bounded off the mound confidently, knowing he had inched closer to a win.“Some days I can pitch like that, some days I can’t,” said Matsuzaka, who sounded like a mystery even to himself.Masa Hoshino, Matsuzaka’s interpreter, said the 9:39 a.m. start time on Saturday morning in Japan was perfect. According to Hoshino, the Japanese fans would be enamored with watching Matsuzaka as they ate breakfast. After a rocky first inning that included one strikeout, Matsuzaka struck out two batters each in the second, third and fourth, one in the fifth and another in the seventh.Three players who were not on the Red Sox’ 25-man roster in early July helped them score the game’s first run in the fifth. Jason Bay walked against James Shields, and Mark Kotsay followed with a check swing double down the left field line. Jed Lowrie’s sacrifice fly drove in Bay. Kevin Youkilis had a run-scoring double off J. P. Howell in the eighth to make it 2-0.Grant Balfour replaced Howell and, with first base open, plunked J. D. Drew in the right shoulder. With these two squabbling teams, any hit batter is worth monitoring. Naturally, Balfour said he did not target Drew.Carlos Peña had a reckless at-bat in the eighth. After Matsuzaka allowed consecutive singles, Hideki Okajima replaced him. Okajima fell behind 3-0 in the count and was one pitch from loading the bases. Manager Joe Maddon permitted Peña to swing at the 3-0 pitch, and he lined out to right. Evan Longoria followed with an unsure swing against Justin Masterson in which he tapped into a double play.“Both of us got good pitches to hit,” Longoria said. “We just didn’t get good swings on them.”Maybe the Rays, who were so good for so long, felt different in Game 1 of the A.L.C.S.“I’m not saying somebody was scared or anything,” Ortiz said. “When it’s your first time in the playoffs, you kind of put a little pressure on yourself.”The first inning proceeded slowly, very slowly, because Shields and Matsuzaka pecked at the strike zone. It took 29 minutes and 52 pitches to finish an inning in which there was one hit and no runs.With one out, Shields walked Pedroia. Youkilis sliced a ball that barely landed fair, bounced off the right-field warning track and went into the seats for a ground-rule double. If the ball had remained in play, Pedroia would have easily scored. Shields escaped by striking out Drew.Matsuzaka, who can be frustrating for fielders to play behind when he is fighting the strike zone, walked two of the first three Rays. After a strikeout, Matsuzaka walked Crawford to fill the bases. Like Shields, Matsuzaka tiptoed around danger by getting Floyd to groundout.After that, Matsuzaka was a different pitcher. He challenged the Rays, he retired 15 of the next 16 batters and he helped nudge Boston closer to another memorable October. With three more victories, the Red Sox will visit the World Series again.'"
"'08-10-11,'0','And that was before Dubinsky scored a goal in this game and set up two others with the kind of gritty play Rangers fans love.“It’s special,” Dubinsky said. “I want to be that player that fans like because I’m willing to put it on the line every night for my teammates.”Dubinsky credits the cautious way the Rangers have brought him into the fold, after four seasons in juniors and one in Hartford.It is similar to the way they developed forwards Ryan Callahan and Nigel Dawes, as well as defenseman Marc Staal.“I certainly think it was good for me,” Dubinsky said. “I learned a lot of things in the American League. I think playing in juniors, I was a little bit one-track minded. I focused on scoring and offense a lot and kind of didn’t have a defensive aspect to my game. I kind of relied on my talent level to get me through.”By the time Dubinsky joined the Rangers for good last season, he was confident enough to become Jagr’s center. Now, he seems completely at home.“He seems like he’s getting better by the second,” Drury said. “Every game he has more and more confidence, stronger on the puck, everything.”Chicago, of course, had a different situation from the Rangers. Mired in a long playoff drought, with completely disillusioned fans, the Blackhawks earned their high draft picks the hard way. But they also made good use of them.So in came Kane last year as an 18-year-old and Toews after two seasons at North Dakota.“It was really good for me,” Kane said. “Plenty of guys here spent two, three, four years in the American League. They come up and their rookie season is when they are 22, 23 years old. You always want to go to the best league possible, prepare as quick as possible.”Kane made an immediate impression, scoring 21 goals with 51 assists. Toews had nearly as good a season, with 24 goals and 30 assists despite missing six weeks with a knee injury.“It’s tough,” Chicago Coach Denis Savard said. “This is the best league in the world. They had to face the best forwards and best defensemen every night. They did pretty well.”But so have the Rangers’ rookies, coming from an entirely different approach.The Rangers’ new free agents paid dividends in their victory. Defenseman Wade Redden, who scored his first goal for his new team during its opening weekend in Prague, made himself at home at Madison Square Garden, scoring the Rangers’ first goal 6 minutes 47 seconds into the game. After Patrick Kane tied it for the Blackhawks later in the first period, Rangers center Brandon Dubinsky set up a goal by Aaron Voros and scored one on a breakaway in the second.'"

True, he’s been campaigning for 19 months and has been interviewed by everybody from “Meet the Press” to “Men’s Health.” Which would be O.K. if we were talking about somebody from a small town rather than, as a McCain campaign co-chairman noted delicately, a “guy of the street.”Back in August, women politicians were afraid of going negative because it might have made them look too strident.

"'08-10-11,'0','Despite another overrun that could push its cost to more than $2 billion, NASA’s next-generation Mars rover mission remains on track for launching next fall, NASA officials said Friday.“Things are going quite well technically,” Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA headquarters, said in a telephone news conference.Because of delays in some components like motors to move the rover’s joints, additional staffing and resources were needed to keep the project on schedule, Dr. McCuistion said.Officials in NASA’s planetary sciences division met with the NASA administrator, Michael D.

Dr. McCuistion said the meeting was regularly scheduled and typical for any of NASA’s flagship missions.The rover, the Mars Science Laboratory, will be about the size of a small sport utility vehicle and weigh more than 2,000 pounds, much larger and heavier than the two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, currently exploring Mars.

"'08-10-11,'0','Mitsubishi executives are in Washington this weekend for meetings of the International Monetary Fund. Morgan Stanley has been in close contact with the bank all week. In particular, Morgan Stanley executives warned the Japanese bank that its shares would probably come under attack on Thursday after the end of a temporary ban on short-selling, a tactic used to bet against a company’s stock price.Analysts said it was difficult to fathom why the stock price of Morgan Stanley was spiraling down.“I think you have truly one of the very top investment banking franchises in Morgan Stanley,” said Jeffrey Harte, an analyst with Sandler O’Neill. “As an analyst, we can do fundamental analysis of companies, but as an analyst, it’s hard to do fundamental analysis of market sentiment.”Morgan Stanley converted itself into a bank holding company one week after Lehman Brothers collapsed last month. That business model makes it easier for Morgan Stanley to borrow from the Federal Reserve.Morgan Stanley held preliminary discussions with Citigroup about a possible combination in the days before it reached an agreement with Mitsubishi.Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on Friday about whether they might consider a merger with Morgan Stanley.Mitsubishi has large ambitions for expansion into the United States. It recently purchased the remaining shares of UnionBanCal, a bank in California, for a premium over its share price. Mitsubishi had owned the majority of UnionBanCal since 1996.Nearly three weeks ago, Mitsubishi struck its deal with Morgan Stanley at $25.25 a share, and that premium, growing by the day, has caused some people to question whether Mitsubishi would seek to renegotiate. Of Mitsubishi’s $9 billion investment, only $3 billion is in common stock and only that portion is directly affected by the sinking share price of Morgan Stanley.Mitsubishi and Morgan Stanley plan to create a strategic committee to chart out future cooperation after the close of the deal. In particular there may be logical combinations in their Japanese operations, a Morgan Stanley executive said.It is not part of the current deal for Morgan Stanley to have access to Mitsubishi’s more than $1 trillion balance sheet, but that is a topic the banks plan to address, the executive said.A spokesman for Mitsubishi did not return a request for comment on Friday.A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley said that nothing had changed in the deal and the banks were not renegotiating.'"
"'08-10-11,'0','Many investors had hoped the meeting of the finance ministers from the world’s leading economies would result in more concrete steps to restore the paralyzed credit markets, and lay out a blueprint for recapitalizing banks.“This fell short,” said Adam Posen, the deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “It all seems to be moving toward direct injection of capital, but why aren’t they just saying it?”Mr. Paulson said the seven countries — the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan — had committed themselves to five principles, ranging from preventing the failure of important banks to protecting the bank deposits of savers.“People came together,” Mr. Paulson said at a news conference, noting that the diplomatic language of such communiqués had been replaced by a plan “that’s different, that’s to the point, that’s powerful.”Treasury officials said the United States may embark on direct injections of capital into banks within the next two weeks, even earlier than the government plans to begin buying distressed assets from banks under the bailout plan that President Bush signed just over a week ago.Mr. Paulson said hopes for a grand global solution were naïve, given the differences among countries. Indeed, other finance ministers had tried to reduce expectations for the meeting.“Don’t imagine that we’ll have a harmonized response that will be the same for everybody because you can’t apply the same method to different market situations,” the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said earlier in the day.The Group of 7 session was one of a flurry of meetings in conference rooms from the Federal Reserve to the International Monetary Fund at which officials discussed potential remedies for the financial system. The timing was fortuitous: the world’s financial elite had gathered in Washington for the annual meetings of the monetary fund and the World Bank.But the pageantry and parties that normally characterize this gathering have been replaced by an atmosphere of high drama and deep gravity — a 21st century echo of Bretton Woods, the 1944 conference in New Hampshire at which the Allies fashioned the financial institutions of the postwar era.The discussions on Friday focused on the growing likelihood that the United States and several major European countries would have to partially nationalize their banking systems.Germany remains deeply reluctant about such a course, according to people with knowledge of the German position, because of fears that it would end up bailing out the banks of its neighbors.Such a step would have been unlikely here a week ago, too, but the swiftness of events is forcing officials to throw out decades of conventional wisdom about how free markets should operate.Events also seem to have upended the Treasury’s plan to stabilize the financial system by buying billions of dollars of troubled assets from the banks — a plan that Mr. Paulson and his Treasury Department colleagues expended enormous energy designing and selling to a skeptical Congress.“The original Paulson plan didn’t hit the nail on the head,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economist at Harvard and an adviser to the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain. “It’s one thing to go back to Congress six months later and say ‘I didn’t ask for enough.’ It’s another to go back after six days and say ‘I didn’t ask for enough.’ ”The Treasury has been soliciting feedback about capital injections from Wall Street chief executives, top hedge fund managers, and other big investors, according to a senior banker briefed on the proposal.One message the industry has given officials is that their plan should help strong banks, rather than save deeply troubled ones. They have suggested tying the eligibility for a government investment to a bank’s so-called Camel rating — a measure used by regulators to grade an institution’s financial strength. Only banks in the highest-rated categories would qualify for support.Another suggestion is for regulators to effectively halt dividend payments for all banks in which the government injects capital, this banker said. This would help remove the stigma of lowering the dividend, and keep about $55 billion a year from leaking out of the banking system.The United States and Germany appear to be the pivotal players in determining whether recapitalizing banks becomes a global standard, given that Britain has already adopted such a plan, and France, Italy and Japan generally support it. Japan recapitalized its banks after a financial crisis in the 1990s.Before the meeting, Italy’s finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, criticized a draft of the communiqué, saying it was too weak, and threatened not to sign it. The final text was very different, he said.Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy raised eyebrows earlier in the day, with a call for countries to shut their financial markets while the authorities drafted new rules for the financial system — a suggestion that was rebuffed by the White House and later disavowed by Mr. Berlusconi himself.While the leaders managed to paper over any rifts by the time they emerged from their meeting, their lack of agreement on a British-style guarantee of loans made between banks worried economists.If other countries do not follow the same course as Britain, they said, it could destabilize the financial system, because money may flow to Britain from countries without those same guarantees.“You now have the full faith and credit of the British government standing behind the banking system,” said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. “The British could suck deposits from continental Europe and even the United States.”'"
"'08-10-11,'0','When a man told him he was “scared” of an Obama presidency, Mr. McCain replied, “I want to be president of the United States and obviously I do not want Senator Obama to be, but I have to tell you — I have to tell you — he is a decent person and a person that you do not have to be scared"" of ""as president of the United States.” The crowd booed loudly at Mr. McCain’s response.Later, a woman stood up at the meeting, held at Lakeville South High School in a far suburb of Minneapolis, and told Mr. McCain that she could not trust Mr. Obama because he was an “Arab.”Mr. McCain replied: “No, ma’am, he’s a decent family man, citizen who I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues. And that’s what this campaign is all about.” At that, the crowd applauded.Mr. McCain and his campaign have been harshly criticized this week by Mr. Obama, Democrats, some Republicans and a number of columnists, commentators and editorial writers for stoking angry crowds at rallies, particularly those in which Mr. McCain appears with his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska.Crowds in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have repeatedly booed Mr. Obama and yelled “off with his head,” and at a rally in Florida where Ms. Palin appeared without Mr. McCain, The Washington Post reported that a man yelled out “kill him.” At the same rally, a racial insult was hurled at an African-American television cameraman.Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said Friday in an interview that he was surprised that neither Mr. McCain nor Ms. Palin had reacted, either by chastising audience members or discussing the events later. “It concerns me greatly when people come to the point where they take a political race, a race for president, and holler out words like ‘kill him,’ ” he said. “I just think our country is so much better than that.”At the same time, Mr. McCain’s advisers sought to minimize the impact of those images of angry voters that have repeatedly been broadcast on television in the last two days.“I don’t think it’s that big a deal,” Rick Davis, Mr. McCain’s campaign manager, told reporters in a conference call on Friday. “I think political rallies have always attracted people who have an emotional connection to the outcome of an election.”Nicolle Wallace, one of Mr. McCain’s senior aides, tried to turn the tables on Mr. Obama on Friday and accuse him of denigrating the people who go to Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin’s rallies. “Broadsides against our supporters are insulting,” she said. “He attacks the same people he once called bitter.”Within the campaign, there is a difference of opinion on the attacks, and some of Mr. McCain’s closest advisers have felt he should also criticize Mr. Obama for his ties to his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. But they say Mr. McCain believes that if he does so, he will be accused of racism.“I personally believe that Jeremiah Wright is a legitimate issue to bring up,” one of Mr. McCain’s top advisers said. “But the candidate is refusing to do that out of an abundance of caution.”Mr. McCain appeared far more cheerful and relaxed at the town-hall-style meeting in Lakeville than he has at any other recent campaign event. He smiled broadly, laughed easily and told a number of well-worn jokes from similar forums of a year ago. He kept the event going for more than an hour, even after his aides said it was time to bring it to a close.But although the crowd was not as large and angry as previous crowds — Ms. Palin appears to attract greater numbers of frustrated voters — Mr. McCain at numerous points had to try to tone down the intensity.At one point, after a voter told him he wanted to see a “real fight” at the debate and the crowd responded with a roar, Mr. McCain replied, “We want to fight, and I will fight, but we will be respectful.”Then he added, “I admire Senator Obama and his accomplishments, I will respect him.” The crowd interrupted Mr. McCain to boo, but he kept talking. “I want everyone to be respectful and let’s make sure we are, because that’s the way politics should be conducted in America.""At that point, the crowd applauded.'"
"'08-10-11,'0','In the United States, the Dow Jones average dropped 370 points on Monday. On Tuesday, it dropped 508 points. Wednesday: 189 points. Thursday: 679 points, including a sickening plunge of more than 450 points in the last hour of trading. And it didn’t relent on Friday; although the Dow wound up “only” down 128 points, it came after an early 700-point swoon, followed by a brutal whipsaw of a day. It was the worst week in history for the Dow.Someday, when the history books are written, the inevitability of this crash — following as it did speculative excess, Frankenstein-like financial engineering and a huge asset bubble — will seem every bit as obvious to future generations as the South Sea crash seems to us.So why didn’t we know any better? Why do we, as a species, continually have these bouts of financial insanity? This week, with the markets collapsing, that was what I most wanted to understand.“What does humanity ever learn about romance?” said James Grant, editor of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer and the author of the forthcoming book “Mr. Market Miscalculates.” Science, said Mr. Grant, is a discipline that builds cumulatively. Previous knowledge isn’t forgotten or cast aside — it is built upon. But finance isn’t like that.“People keep on stepping on the same rakes because money, like romance, is only partly an intellectual experience,” Mr. Grant continued. “Money, like sex, brings out some thought — but also much heavy breathing and little stored knowledge. In finance, the process is cyclical. Some people learn from their ancestors, but mostly they repeat the same mistakes. Thus it has always been and thus it will always be.”Mr. Grant’s point, echoed by almost everyone I spoke to, is that it is not just the analytical part of our brain that deals with money, it is also the instinctive, emotional part — what we like to think of as our gut. A lot of the time, our gut gets it wrong. And that is as true of high-powered investment bankers as it is of mom-and-pop investors.Paul Slovic of the University of Oregon, an expert in the psychology of risk, pointed out that when times are good — when markets are rising, for instance, and bankers are making millions trading their mortgage-backed securities — “the sense of risk is depressed. You don’t look as hard for warning signs.” Robert Shiller, the Yale economist, said, “One thing we know about human behavior is that our memory is influenced by recent events.”Thus, when we are living through a housing bubble, it is hard not to be caught up, emotionally, in the idea that prices can only go up — even though our analytical brain knows that acting on such impulses defies logic. But in the moment, a kind of unshakable euphoria takes over, and we just can’t imagine its ever ending. Similarly, when times are bad, fear and loathing capture our imagination, and we find it equally impossible to see a glimmer of hope. We take actions to protect ourselves — like banks refusing to lend to other banks — even though these individual actions result in a kind of cumulative madness. That is where we are now.William Goetzmann, an economist at Yale who has studied financial panics, told me that after the South Sea bubble burst, people went back to writings and illustrations that were done nearly a century earlier in the wake of tulip mania, trying to understand how they could have made the same mistake.We’re now wondering the same thing. But while history may help us understand why financial panics take place, it doesn’t do anything to prevent them. The impulses that make us want to forgo the slow and steady for instant riches, that cause us to go along with the crowd instead of bucking it, that allow us to think that this time it’s different, instead of understanding that it never is — these are such basic aspects of human nature that they cannot be changed through study alone.They can be changed only by cold, painful experience. That is what our parents went through during the Depression; they were so scarred by that experience that most of their generation were debt-averse forever after. That is where we are now, too.Mr. Shiller, a leader in the field of behavioral economics, believes that bubbles and crashes are a kind of social epidemic. “Ideas become contagion,” he said. When housing prices were rising quickly in the early part of this century, he said, “people misinterpreted the meaning of the price increase. The theory that housing prices could only go up began to sound plausible. It became a thought virus. And people believed it was true rather than realizing it was a thought epidemic.”Crashes tend to feed on a similar dynamic, except in reverse. Mr. Shiller did a study of the days leading up to Black Monday in 1987 — days that also had sharp market drops — asking people what they were reading and talking about. Invariably, they were reading and talking about the big price drops, which led them to pull money from the market, which led to yet more price drops. “Exactly the same thing is happening now,” he said.“At times of crisis, people have an instinctive need to get into a huddle and talk about it with other people,” he added. “On the one hand, this creates a sense of community. On the other hand, it amplifies the speed with which news is related.”As I was speaking to Mr. Shiller, I suddenly realized I had spent the week in a huddle of my own making. I’m not someone who usually has CNBC on all day — but I did this week. I needed to hear every rumor and track the market’s every move. I called hedge fund managers to hear how they were doing. I saw Jim Chanos, the well-known short-seller, and empathized as he complained about the foolishness of the ban on short-selling. I had dinner in a restaurant and fell into a long discussion about the credit crisis with two complete strangers. So many of my conversations this week began with a kind of resigned acknowledgment of the predicament we’re all in.Late on Thursday, right after that awful 679-point drop in the Dow, I got an e-mail message from someone I didn’t know, a trader and blogger named Karl Denninger. “We have an extremely serious credit market dislocation about to occur — like maybe tomorrow,” he wrote. He asked me to call him.So I did. “There is a flight of money from the U.S.,” he said breathlessly. “We need $2 billion a day in foreign capital to operate our government, and that has mostly come from China and the oil-producing countries. Now that money is leaving. We are going to have a complete lockup of the credit markets within 48 to 72 hours. Everybody is trying to push this off to the election. But we’re not going to make it to the election.”On Friday, Mr. Shiller told me of a conversation he had with an economist friend of his. The man had spent his entire career advocating the efficient market hypothesis, which posits that all known information about a stock is already priced into it. But with the market in collapse, the economist sold all his stocks. “I feel like a Christian Scientist who has come down with appendicitis,” he told Mr. Shiller.All around me, I hear the sounds of panic. Some things, it turns out, never change.'"
"'08-10-11,'0','Senator John McCain proposed on Friday that investors should be given a temporary reprieve from a rule forcing them to withdraw from their 401(k)’s and I.R.A.’s after the age of 70, so that they might be shielded from the devastating plunge of the stock market in recent weeks.The staggering decline in stocks has devastated the retirement holdings of many Americans, posing a particular threat to those nearing retirement age. Because investors over age 70 1/2 are required to begin withdrawing from their retirement accounts, they are being forced to sell their stocks at substantial losses.“We have to protect those who currently rely on their investments for retirement,” Mr. McCain said at a rally in La Crosse, Wis. “Current rules mandate that investors must begin to sell off their I.R.A.’s and 401(k)’s when they reach age 70 1/2. To spare investors from being forced to sell their stocks at just the time the market is hurting the most, those rules should be suspended.”Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain’s top economic adviser, said that under the plan, the government would waive for one year rules requiring people to begin withdrawing parts of their 401(k)’s and other retirement plans. The mandatory withdrawals are based on an investor’s life expectancy, and the rate of withdrawal increases each year. So at age 70 1/2, the annual distribution is about 4 percent of the value of the retirement plan; at age 80, the rate is about 5 percent.But what can make the requirement burdensome in the current financial crisis is that withdrawals being made now are based on an account’s value on Dec. 31, 2007, when accounts were most likely worth much more, said Roberton Williams, a principal research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.“It’s not exactly onerous to say, ‘You’ve got to get 4 percent out,’ ” Mr. Williams said. “On the other hand, if your portfolio has dropped by half, you have to take out twice as much.”Campaigning in Ohio, Senator Barack Obama also put forth a proposal to deal with the economic crisis, urging a rescue plan in which the Small Business Administration would lend directly to small businesses that are cut off from other sources of loans. The plan would provide fixed-rate loans to help businesses meet operating expenses, make short-term investments and refinance existing debt.'"
"'08-10-11,'0','The buildings of Liberty Village will be replaced by a picnic area, and the project will for the first time open up the island’s entire 2.2-mile perimeter to bicyclists and pedestrians.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that the city expected more than 125,000 people to have visited the island by the time the island’s season, which begins in May, ends on Sunday, some of them drawn by one of the waterfall installations by the artist Olafur Eliasson, on the island’s north end. In contrast, he said, only half that number of people visited the island in 2007.Barbara Blackwood, a 65-year-old Astoria resident, said she visits the island once a week. The retired chambermaid used a walker to slowly make her way down the island from the ferry terminal to see her first demolition. She said she is eager to see the entire island converted for recreational use. “It’s open to the public, and you can see all these houses — things that were built in 1812. My God,” she said, stopping to take a breath.Mr. Bloomberg said that by the time the island reopens next spring, new amenities will include a seasonal entertainment and dining venue on the north end of the island. The site will also have artists studios and space for art exhibitions, he said. Other plans for the island include a new home for the 425-student New York Harbor School, a public high school in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that focuses on marine science and technology.Despite her sorrow, Mrs. Petersen said she was glad that the apartments where she once lived would be turned into a picnic area.Mrs. Petersen watched as a huge excavator, fitted with a powerful grapple on the end of its black boom, shredded the blue roof gable and white porch where she often visited friends and other families almost 20 years ago. Her former building is scheduled to be demolished soon.The Petersens said those few years living on Governors Island were, for them, the “ideal way to experience New York City.” They had a commissary, a bowling alley, a golf course, a Burger King, a movie theater and a school that went up to sixth grade. Meanwhile, the world-famous novelty of Manhattan’s urban frenzy was a mere minutes away by ferry.The building they were watching come down, in grinding twists of metal and loud cracks of posts and plywood, was where a friend of their daughter had lived. They said they had not been back since 1991, when Mr. Petersen was transferred to Michigan.“It’s just very sad to see it happen,” Mrs. Petersen said.'"
"'08-10-11,'0','A. That’s unclear. Some big institutions are signing up for the government’s plan, but a lot of people are scratching their heads wondering if they should. It’s not really classic insurance. It’s literally disaster insurance. A fund would have to go through the process of liquidation in order to restore the dollar.Q. As part of the bailout package, Congress increased the federal insurance for bank deposits to $250,000, from $100,000. Will this put money market funds at a competitive disadvantage?A. I don’t think so. The last several weeks we saw banks being taken over by the F.D.I.C., and that woke some investors up to the idea that maybe they had left too much money in the corner bank. So they walked around the corner to spread their money between banks. But a savings account can’t really compare to a money market fund return, and the structure of the money market fund is much more liquid than a bank C.D.Q. What will the government’s plan to buy up distressed assets mean for the mutual fund industry?A. Fixed-income funds will benefit if this frees up the credit markets that have become stagnant. I don’t think many of them own the type of assets that the Treasury will be creating auctions for, but if they do, we may now have a better valuation for those assets. On the equities side, it would help if the package restores investor confidence, so those people who decided to crawl under a rock would put their money back in the market. But first we need to reduce the volatility. Having these 300-point days up and down is discouraging to the average investor. Stabilization is what’s important now.Q. As part of the bailout bill, Congress asked the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board — FASB — to re-evaluate the mark-to-market accounting rule, which requires companies to value certain assets at their current market prices. How might this affect mutual funds?A. Mutual funds have to comply with FASB rules as well. The distinction is that the fund industry has an obligation to value its portfolios every day. If a fund only owns stocks in the S.& P. 500, that’s not an issue. But a lot of funds own instruments in the fixed-income space, or in foreign markets, that might not trade every day. The mark-to-market rule has been the accepted practice, and I think it would be a mistake to change it.Q. In recent years, a growing number of mutual funds have started using derivatives, like swaps, which are agreements between broker-dealers. Given all of the financial company failures, should investors in funds like these be worried about the counterparty risk?A. Very much so. Four weeks ago, if you had told me that Lehman and Merrill Lynch and Wachovia would cease to be separate entities, I would have looked at you as if you had horns on your head. The repercussions of this are just staggering. I would hope that each manager who uses these types of instruments has a strong risk-management process in place that monitors their counterparty exposure. That is something that investors, or their advisers, should be aware of.Q. What will the consolidation on Wall Street mean for mutual funds?A. The trading landscape will change because we will have fewer players. And Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will have less leverage, as bank holding companies, to buy part of a large transaction to facilitate the trade. When we reduce the amount of capital in the marketplace, the fund industry may have problems with the depth and quality of execution. We may already be seeing this. The 777-point decline in one day may be a reflection of the lack of the brokerage community to provide a level of execution.Q. Compared with the banking industry, the mutual fund industry is highly fragmented. You’ve been predicting a wave of fund consolidation for years. Are we more likely to see that now?A. There’s no question we are going to see consolidation. The top 30 mutual fund companies have 77 percent of the assets. There are roughly 600 mutual fund companies. So the remaining ones each control a very small percentage. Some funds might liquidate, but I think most of them will merge, and we will see more of that the longer the bear market goes on.'"

"'08-10-11,'0','MOSCOW — Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Friday that his government would start spending billions next week to buy shares on the Russian stock exchange to support one of the world’s hardest-hit markets from the credit crisis, as the country suffered fresh blows from plunging commodity prices.After a week in which authorities suspended trading on the main RTS stock exchange repeatedly, Mr. Putin said $6.7 billion would be set aside to buy battered shares. The state development bank will place the orders, continuing a strategy that has essentially relied on making the government’s oil windfall profits available to banks to encourage them to lend to companies or buy equity to maintain growth.Both of Russia’s major stock markets remained closed Friday after Asian and European markets plummeted as confidence in the global financial system continued to ebb. The Micex, a key exchange, is down 64 percent from its peak on May 19.Many Russian companies are suffering sharp declines because they used shares as collateral to borrow large sums of money. The market’s overall spiral is also forcing a wave of margin-call selling, driving shares down further and hardening the climate of fear that has made banks reluctant to lend to one another or to businesses and consumers.In another bid to jump-start lending, the Parliament passed a law on Friday unlocking central bank money for private banks, sealing in a $36 billion bailout that had been announced Tuesday. President Dmitri A. Medvedev had said the central bank would lend about $18 billion to commercial banks and that the government would also lend about $18 billion. After the law passed on Friday, Mr. Medvedev called the new lending “sufficient and serious” enough to supply banks with enough money to ensure liquidity.'"
"'08-10-11,'0','“If all the speculations are true, if senior leadership is going to lift all the restrictions out the door, I’d say this is a great positive,” said Keliang Zhu, a lawyer with the China research division of the Rural Development Institute, a Seattle-based organization that has pushed for land rights for the rural poor. “It’ll free up the dead capital and allow all this wealth to materialize.”Mr. Zhu added that the change would give China “huge momentum in terms of agricultural development.”Chinese leaders are alarmed by the prospect of a deep recession in leading export markets at a time when their own economy, after a long streak of double-digit growth, is slowing. Officials are eager to stoke new consumer activity at home, and one potentially enormous but barely tapped source of demand is the peasant population, which has been largely excluded from the raging growth in cities.Average income in rural areas lags far behind the average in cities, giving China one of the starkest income gaps in the world, according to government estimates.Many farmers work on tiny, state-allocated plots of land for a small fraction of the year, investing little in agriculture. While they are entitled to 30-year land-use contracts, the state retains ownership of rural land, and local officials often seize or reallocate it to suit their development priorities.Rural land disputes are perhaps the biggest source of social unrest in China. Protests and riots in rural areas number in the thousands each year, according to national police estimates. They are often incited by allegations of corruption and illegal land seizures.Many farmers leave the land to seek work in cities, but they are still classified as farmers under the country’s population control policies and tend to work in low-wage factory or construction jobs on a seasonal basis.Advocates for land reform say the proposed changes would create more asset wealth for farmers and strengthen land security, which would in turn encourage peasants to invest in farming and increase productivity.A law enacted in 2002 allows limited land-use trades between individual farmers, but does not permit unrestricted trade between farmers and companies, straight sales of land-use rights or the option to use the land as collateral to obtain a loan, Mr. Zhu said.The major state news organizations reported Friday that rural land reform was at the top of the agenda for the plenary session. China Daily, the country’s official English-language newspaper, said, “The meeting is expected to make it easier for farmers to lease or transfer the management rights of their land, measures that have become necessary as many farmers move to cities as migrant workers.”Private ownership of land is not allowed under the Constitution, and rural land is still effectively controlled by township- and village-level leaders. Officials characterize the proposed policy changes as allowing the farmers to lease or trade their 30-year land-use contracts to individuals or companies.The issue remains a delicate one. Many party traditionalists strongly favor collective land ownership. They have argued that China’s economy is still not robust enough to absorb hundreds of millions of rural laborers full time. They also defend the system of allocating small plots of land to all rural families as guaranteeing farmers at least a subsistence income.But repeated efforts to enliven the rural economy without freeing up land have failed, and proponents of moving toward partial privatization appear to have the upper hand.One point under discussion is whether land contracts should be extended to 70 years from 30 years, scholars say, a move that would give farmers more security and presumably increase the value of their land-use rights.Chinese leaders have been carefully preparing the public for a major announcement.On Sept. 30, President Hu Jintao, who is also the secretary general of the Communist Party, made a well-publicized visit to Xiaogang village in Anhui Province, the site in 1978 of a bold experiment in rejecting Maoist-era land collectivization. Since then, the village has been held up as a symbol of rural land reform.Mr. Hu said at the time that farmers would soon be allowed to transfer their land contracts.“Not only will the current land contract relationship be kept stable and unchanged over time, greater and protected land contract and management rights will be given to the peasants,” Mr. Hu said, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. “Furthermore, if the peasants wish to, they will be allowed to transfer the land contract and management rights in various ways and to develop management on an appropriate scale.”Some farmers are already informally leasing out their land-use contracts. After Mr. Hu’s visit to Xiaogang, China Daily reported glowingly that one farmer who took part in the risky experiment in 1978, Yan Jinchang, had recently joined about 10 other households in renting 44 acres of land to a Shanghai company. In 2006, the company built a pig farm on the land.“We raise special pigs that produce lean pork,” Mr. Yan said, according to the China Daily. “Our meat sells well in Shanghai, and we are profitable.”From dynastic times onward, control of farmland has always been a central part of the relationship between Chinese rulers and the common people. Rulers are keenly aware of the fact that peasant rebellions related to land use and taxes have overthrown kingdoms throughout Chinese history.Mao forced farmers into collectives, a move that turned out to be disastrous. In 1978, before the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping officially announced the start of his bold Reform and Open policy, 18 families in Xiaogang, including Mr. Yan’s, quietly decided to divide up communal farmland for personal use. It was the precursor to the land-use contract system that the government later enacted.But since then, rural land reform has not kept pace with urban land reform, which partly explains while farmers have failed to capitalize on the economic gains of the past few decades. China allows urban residents to trade or sell their land-use contracts freely. That right has allowed people to profit from city property in ways that farmers have not legally been able to do.There is speculation that Mr. Hu has chosen the party’s planning session this year to announce the rural reforms in order to link himself in the public eye with Mr. Deng, whose initial economic reforms were unveiled 30 years ago this month.'"
"'08-10-11,'0','G.E. is paring back its short-term financing, bringing the commercial paper portfolio down to $80 billion by the end of the year. Added to its long-term financing, bank lines and cash on hand, the moves last week represent an insurance policy against the uncertainties of the commercial paper market, said Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive.“We thought it was smart to have suspenders on suspenders on suspenders in this environment,” Mr. Immelt said Friday in a conference call.The company acted, he said, to “take big issues off the table for investors.”Still, G.E. clearly faces further deterioration in its finance business. Delinquencies are rising for the company’s private-label credit card business in North America, where G.E. handles credit cards for companies like Wal-Mart Stores, Ikea and Brooks Brothers. That unit will swing from a $500 million profit this year to a loss of $200 million to $300 million in 2009, Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach, estimated.Mr. Heymann pointed to the wide range G.E. was placing on its projected earnings for the full year — $1.92 to $2.07 a share — as an implicit recognition by the company’s management of the uncertainty surrounding the fourth quarter. In normal times, he said, the range might be 4 or 5 cents, instead of 15 cents.G.E. plans to set aside provisions for pretax losses on its consumer and commercial finance business of $6.6 billion this year, a sharp increase from 2007. In 2009, G.E. expects losses to rise further, to $7.5 billion to $9 billion. But Keith S. Sherin, G.E.’s chief financial officer, said the company’s provisions for losses should be ample.He emphasized that G.E. was a conservative finance company with no exotic securities and low leverage ratio — debt to assets — of about 7 to 1, which it plans to bring down further, to 6 to 1 or less by the end of 2009.Even in a turbulent quarter, when GE Capital suffered with others, the finance arm was solidly profitable, earning $2 billion. “That’s a pretty good performance in this environment,” Mr. Sherin said.Troubles in the financial markets have obscured the other G.E. businesses, from jet engines to electricity-generating windmills. The picture is mixed, but generally solid in the quarter, when G.E.’s total revenue rose 11 percent, to $47.2 billion.The health care business was soft, as hospitals short on cash in the United States slowed purchases of medical equipment. Sales in G.E.’s energy unit rose 32 percent, to $9.7 billion, including selling $2 billion worth of alternative-energy windmills, a 50 percent jump.G.E. owns NBC Universal, and the broadcast, cable network and studio business turned in a solid performance, with profits rising 10 percent to $645 million on revenue of nearly $5.1 billion. Among the strong performers was the CNBC business news network, which set audience records.G.E.’s shares rose 7 percent on Friday, to close at $20.31 a share.'"

(AP) — A corrosive liquid overflowed a tank at a chemical plant Saturday in western Pennsylvania, evaporating into a toxic cloud that snaked along the ground and forced about 2,500 to flee. At least three residents were reported injured.Oleum, similar to sulfuric acid, leaked from a tank at the Indspec Chemical Corporation plant here, about 40 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, said the plant manager, Dave Dorko.Officials were concerned about the potential for respiratory damage and skin burns, said a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Freda Tarbell.The authorities went door to door to warn the 2,500 people living within two miles of the chemical plant to evacuate. Residents were taken to shelters in nearby towns, and officials said they did not know when they would be allowed to return. Red Cross officials said they expected to shelter up to 100 people overnight.No injuries were reported at the plant, where the spill was contained and crew members were trying to clean it up. An official at Butler Memorial Hospital, where the authorities said three residents had been taken, declined to comment.The dense cloud was reported to be moving slowly west on Saturday night. No more evacuations were planned, but residents in the cloud’s path were told to remain inside; to close doors, windows and vents; to shut down any system that draws air from the outside; and to put out any fires in fireplaces.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Chase Daniel’s Heisman Trophy stock plummeted, and Missouri’s national championship hopes took a tumble, too.No. 17 Oklahoma State stopped an offense that had been scoring at will, intercepting Daniel’s passes three times in the second half and upsetting the third-ranked Tigers, 28-23, on Saturday night.“Put it all on me,” Daniel said. “I should have made all three of those throws. It seemed like we were a little bit off all night. For the reason, I have no idea.”Zac Robinson and Damian Davis hooked up on two long scores in the second half, and Patrick Lavine’s interception at the Oklahoma State 31 with 1 minute 41 seconds to go on a pass intended for Jeremy Maclin was the clincher.“It was a great opportunity on a national stage,” said Oklahoma State linebacker Andre Sexton, whose interception and 39-yard return set up a score that put the Cowboys ahead by 28-17 in the fourth quarter. “We got a chance, and we just wanted to go out there and show everybody.”'"

"'08-10-12,'0','Still, investors may wonder why the other two-thirds of the emerging-market universe failed to benefit enough to at least compensate for the fall in commodity stocks. For that matter, when commodities were rising earlier in the year, why didn’t the producers’ shares rally enough to mitigate the declines in other sectors?Many portfolio managers say the ultimate cause of the swoon is extreme overvaluation after a five-year bull run in which conditions in emerging economies brightened markedly but couldn’t keep up with investors’ expectations.“Emerging markets have become less risky places to invest,” said Simon Hallett, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Portfolio. “Corporate and government balance sheets have improved, and the integration of developing economies into the global economic system has been a wondrous thing.”As impressive as these developments were, investors demanded more: invulnerability. They rationalized high valuations away by invoking the decoupling argument, which said emerging-market growth would be largely unaffected by worsening conditions elsewhere.It was not, as it turned out. When global growth faltered, emerging economies felt the strain. The expectation that they would not, combined with a sudden aversion among investors to any sort of risk, ensured that developing markets declined more than others.Mr. Hallett said he saw it coming. Valuations at the peak made sense only if emerging economies could be connected to the rest of the world and independent from it at the same time.“You could either believe in the joys of globalization or decoupling, but you couldn’t believe both,” he said. “We were skeptical eight or nine months ago when everyone said they were low-risk places to invest. We live in an increasingly synchronized world.”Now that they have been pummeled and investors are avoiding them, is it time to venture back into emerging markets? “I think we’re getting close,” Mr. Hallett said. Bad as things have gotten, he said, “I don’t think we’re going to see any meltdown in financial systems and, given what’s happened to share prices, we’re starting to see normal valuations again.”His portfolio is heavily invested in companies involved in providing consumer services, broadly defined. Those include HDFC, an Indian bank, and Anhanguera Educacional, a Brazilian company that offers university-level degree programs.Charles de Vaulx, a portfolio manager at International Value Advisers, prefers to focus on people’s consumption of something less edifying than knowledge. He likes the San Miguel Corporation, a brewer and food producer in the Philippines, and Thai Beverage, which sells beer and spirits. Each stock trades well below the intrinsic worth of its assets, by his calculation.He also likes Samsung Electronics, the South Korean maker of computer chips, and Millennium & Copthorne Hotels, a British company with extensive Asian properties.He is otherwise reluctant to invest in developing economies. “I find it harder as a stock picker to find great businesses in emerging markets,” he said.Many companies raised their returns on equity, but that was mostly attributable to booming economies, in his view, not through improved management expertise and efficiency. “It’s hard to find genuine little gems,” he lamented.AT the Forward fund, Mr. Bell has an eclectic list of stock picks. Despite his observation that emerging markets are driven by commodity cycles, he is drawn to phone companies as a way to benefit from growth in domestic economies. His picks include América Móvil, with a big share of the Latin American mobile phone service market; the MTN Group in South Africa; Telkom Indonesia; and Bharti Airtel in India.Two other sectors he highlighted are technology and alternative energy. In technology, he favors Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and AU Optronics of Taiwan. In alternative energy, his picks include Suzlon Energy, a wind turbine manufacturer, and Suntech Power, a Chinese maker of solar panels.Jeffrey Urbina at William Blair & Company has a lot of cash in his Emerging Market Growth fund, evidence of his wariness. He finds good growth prospects in India and Brazil, where managements “are better than in the vast majority of emerging markets,” he said.His favorite stocks include HDFC and Infosys Technologies of India, and two giant Brazilian commodity producers whose prices have come down substantially: Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, known as CVRD. and Petróleo Brasileiro, known as Petrobras.For Arjun Jayaraman, co-manager of the Causeway Emerging Markets fund, some of the best bets are smaller banks, like Woori Financial in South Korea and Bank of India. They are cheaply valued and have been able to keep growing and steer clear of the global credit mess, he said.He is also partial to health care stocks like Teva Pharmaceutical in Israel and food producers including Chaoda Modern Agriculture in China and Sadia in Brazil. He considers both sectors safe and defensive, which is just how he likes it amid today’s punishing conditions. “It seems like every sector is having problems,” he said. “We’re trying to find places to hide.”'"
"'08-10-12,'0','WASHINGTON — Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat and civil rights leader, said Saturday that Senator John McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, were “sowing the seeds of hatred and division” in a way that reminded him of former Gov. George Wallace and “another destructive period” in the nation’s history.In a blistering statement reacting to the angry crowds at McCain-Palin rallies in the past week that have shouted “off with his head” and other insults about Senator Barack Obama, Mr. Lewis said: “During another period, in the not-too-distant past, there was a governor of the state of Alabama named George Wallace who also became a presidential candidate. George Wallace never threw a bomb. He never fired a gun, but he created the climate and conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans who were simply trying to exercise their constitutional rights.“Because of this atmosphere of hate, four little girls were killed on Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama.”Mr. Lewis, who was referring to the 1963 church bombing by the Ku Klux Klan, added: “As public figures with the power to influence and persuade, Senator McCain and Governor Palin are playing with fire, and if they are not careful, that fire will consume us all. They are playing a very dangerous game that disregards the value of the political process and cheapens our entire democracy.”Mr. McCain has cited Mr. Lewis as one of three people on whom he depends for sage advice. Stunned by Mr. Lewis’s comments, Mr. McCain responded with his own statement, calling the remarks “a character attack against Governor Palin and me that is shocking and beyond the pale.”“The notion,” Mr. McCain’s statement added, “that legitimate criticism of Senator Obama’s record and positions could be compared to Gov. George Wallace, his segregationist policies and the violence he provoked is unacceptable and has no place in this campaign.”Mr. McCain said he was “saddened” by the criticism from “a man I’ve always admired” and called on Mr. Obama to repudiate Mr. Lewis’s comments.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','Hundreds of savings and loan associations will have to be closed down, costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. Many other financial institutions have been significantly weakened by poor-quality loans and investments. The credit quality of American corporations is at its lowest point since the Great Depression, despite seven years of economic expansion.The abuse of the credit system began more than a decade ago, through a series of events and developments that loosened the structure of the financial system. That fostered a highly aggressive financial entrepreneurship that severely impaired the remaining code of prudent financial conduct.The credit system suffered further from the Government's willingness to allow deregulation to proceed in the absence of adequate new safeguards, improved official financial supervision and stricter rules of financial conduct. Instead, from Main Street to Wall Street, excesses multiplied through the employment of novel financial techniques and liberalized credit standards that were unthinkable even two decades ago.Hardly anyone in authority stopped to question the implications for the financial system. The facile rhetoric was that the ''marketplace'' would discipline the wrongdoers in our financial system.But relying on the market to discipline financial institutions is generally unacceptable. It is too blunt a weapon for financial institutions, which are thinly capitalized and closely linked through myriads of transactions with other institutions.Financial institutions are the holders and, therefore, the guardians of our savings and temporary funds, a unique public responsibility. Truly letting the marketplace discipline the financial system would mean acquiescing in an avalanche of potential failures - including many salvageable financial institutions and many of their customers.The excesses of financial entrepreneurship have been abetted by a kind of ''hollowing out'' of the financial regulatory system. Because of piecemeal legislation, official supervision and regulation is highly fragmented. That has meant heavy and inefficient overlapping authority in some areas and enormous regulatory gaps in other areas.Specifically, the two agencies with responsibility for the securities industry, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board, hold opposite - and probably irreconcilable - theories of financial regulation and supervision.In a nutshell, the Fed believes that the holding-company parent and all affiliates of a bank or securities firm ought to be supervised on a consolidated basis. The S.E.C.'s legal authority is narrowly focused on the broker/ dealer operation of a securities firm.Thus, under the terms of its mandate from the S.E.C., the New York Stock Exchange must concentrate its surveillance on the broker/dealer. It has little authority to go into other affiliates of the broker/dealer's parent, even if they are involved in financial activities.This regulatory fragmentation, and the loopholes it provides, has not been lost on Wall Street. The leading securities houses have all sought to increase their financial leverage by forming elaborate holding companies. To this end, they use creative, though permissible, accounting techniques to hide from public view their gross asset and liability structures.Thus, the end of Drexel Burnham does not mean the end of the unwinding of the financial recklessness of the past decade. Continued slow economic growth or a business recession will bring forth failures that are still hidden in the financial fabric.For many firms in the securities industry, the franchise that they once had will not be recaptured. Wall Street's special role as adviser and investment banker to business and to other financial institutions is waning rapidly. The foundations of this role were based on trust. That trust has been shattered by conflicts of interest that were created when many securities firms rushed to participate in hostile takeovers and direct acquisitions of nonfinancial businesses.In the wake of the Drexel failure, the task of rebuilding a strong financial base for our corporations and financial institutions will require tax inducements, the strengthening and centralization of official financial supervision and the establishment of standards to hold corporate directors accountable for objective evaluations of corporate management performance.Under such a stiffened regulatory approach, Wall Street firms would probably be confronted with more stringent capital requirements and closer supervision of all the activities under their holding companies. With the loss of much of their franchise, the number and size of securities firms will eventually shrink. Many will become parts of banks or other financial institutions.Already, there are voices here and there in the securities industry calling for an end to Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that required banking and securities to remain separate businesses. This may signal that a merger with a commercial bank might be a preferred way out of the troubled position that many Wall Street firms now face.Outside Wall Street, few will mourn this outcome, especially in view of the excesses of the recent past. But however understandable that reaction may be, there will be an indirect economic consequence that we all will have to shoulder.In the more concentrated U.S. financial structure of tomorrow, conflicts of interest will flourish. This will invite governmental intrusion, less innovation and, ultimately, a more inefficient allocation of capital.'"

"'08-10-12,'0','LIMA, Peru (Reuters) — A leftist provincial governor said Saturday that he had accepted an offer to become Peru’s prime minister, after President Alan García fired his entire cabinet on Friday over a widening corruption scandal involving oil and gas contracts.Yehude Simon, the governor of the northern province of Lambayeque, told RPP radio that he had been asked to take the job. “Unfortunately I’ve got ahead of myself, it is surely the president who will have to make the announcement,” he said.Mr. García had not confirmed the selection by Saturday afternoon.By picking Mr. Simon, Mr. García may be trying to place more emphasis on social programs, neutralize critics on the left and regain support in the provinces, where he is unpopular.Mr. García’s approval rating has fallen to 19 percent amid charges of corruption. He had faced calls from opposition leaders to reshuffle his cabinet after audio tapes emerged that linked members of his APRA party to a plan to steer lucrative petroleum contracts to favored bidders.The former prime minister, Jorge del Castillo, was mentioned in the taped conversations as someone who would provide favors in a plan to rig auctions of oil and gas concessions. Mr. del Castillo also had lengthy meetings with APRA party members who were working as lobbyists and involved in the auctions. He has denied any wrongdoing.Mr. Simon said Finance Minister Luis Valdivieso, a former I.M.F. official who recently joined Mr. García’s administration, would stay, as would Foreign Minister José Antonio García Belaúnde and Foreign Trade Minister Mercedes Aráoz.“I want to build a great alliance, friendship between sectors of the left and the government, and I have no doubt that businessmen of the so-called right will also draw near,” Mr. Simon said.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','The public has told the media what it wants. Early this year, roughly three-quarters of voters of all political persuasions surveyed by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press said they wanted more coverage of the candidates’ stands on issues. For the most part, they were disappointed, and their satisfaction with the news media has declined, according to Pew. In February, 55 percent said the election coverage was good or excellent. By June, 54 percent said it was fair or poor.The press needs “to do a better job of looking at what people say — provide more coverage of issues in a way that people can get it,” said Andrew Kohut, the Pew center’s director. He said he has been asking the same questions in surveys, and getting the same answers, for more than 20 years.The Times does provide on its Web site a side-by-side comparison of the candidates’ statements on 11 issues, ranging from abortion to the selection of judges. But there is no independent assessment of those statements and no direct links to news articles that the paper has published about those issues.Times editors know that their issues coverage has lagged but say much more is in the pipeline and that issues have been addressed throughout even the horse-race reporting. “We haven’t been able to get out there on some of these things as fast and as big as we’d like to,” said Richard Stevenson, the editor in charge of campaign coverage. Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news, said their best intentions were affected by the world financial crisis, which pulled away reporters who are experts on the economy. She said the paper did not move quickly enough to fortify the issues reporting staff.Even when the paper has addressed a big issue, it has not always done it in a way that might be most useful to readers. Take health care. An article last Tuesday reported that leaders of eight business trade groups were cool to McCain’s plan to tax employer-provided health benefits and offer tax credits in exchange. It went deeply into this part of McCain’s plan but did not report what the business groups thought of Obama’s health plan or compare the two in any serious way.Kevin Sack, the reporter, said it was not intended to. The article was part of an occasional series he has written on the candidates’ health plans. In July, he wrote about problems with McCain’s proposal for a high-risk pool to insure people with serious health problems, and two weeks later, he wrote an article raising doubts about Obama’s promise to cut a typical family’s premiums by $2,500.“I recognize that someone reading any of these pieces in a vacuum would wonder about balance,” Sack said. But he said the health plans are so complicated that they can be explained and compared only superficially in a single article of any practical length. He thought it better, he said, to dig deeply into different aspects of each plan so that “by Nov. 4 our readers have had access to stories that illuminate both plans, though perhaps not in one sitting.”But many readers do read news articles in a vacuum and want help in a single sitting. It is not realistic to expect them to remember a related article from three months before, especially when The Times does nothing to call attention to prior issues coverage and does not package it on its Web site.Elizabeth Skewes, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Colorado at Boulder, has been studying the election coverage of The Times and other major newspapers since 2000. She said that, typically, most articles about issues are published when there is a lull in the horse race — right after the primary season, for example. That appears to be the pattern at The Times this year. But much issues coverage from last spring or summer has been overtaken by dramatic events and needs to be revisited.Tom Rosenstiel, the director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, said there is a disconnect between how journalists approach an election — an exciting narrative about a contest — and how voters look at it. Voters “come into this narrative quite late and are just trying to figure out which of these guys they prefer,” he said.Abramson and Stevenson said they will be doing a lot more issues coverage before Nov. 4, and a special election edition of the Week in Review will have an important issues component.In such a momentous election — with two wars, a financial meltdown and a stalling economy — The Times owes readers much more help than it has given them to understand what the candidates propose to do and how that squares with reality.In last Sunday’s column, I reported that Bob DOLE had been the answer in Times crosswords 10 times and Bill CLINTON never. In fact, since 1994, DOLE has been the right answer 12 times and CLINTON once. The Clinton answer came on Election Day 1996, when BOBDOLE or CLINTON could have been the correct answer to this clue: “lead story in tomorrow’s newspaper.”'"
"'08-10-12,'0','In Pennsylvania, Robert A. Gleason Jr., the state Republican chairman, said he was concerned that Mr. McCain’s increasingly aggressive tone was not working with moderate voters and women in the important southeastern part of a state that is at the top of Mr. McCain’s must-win list.“They’re not as susceptible to attack ads,” Mr. Gleason said. “I worry about the southeast. Obama is making inroads.”Several party leaders said Mr. McCain needed to settle on a single message in the final weeks of the campaign and warned that his changing day-to-day dialogue — a welter of evolving economic proposals, mixed with on-again-off-again attacks on Mr. Obama’s character — was not breaking through and was actually helping Mr. Obama in his effort to portray Mr. McCain as erratic.“The main thing he needs to do,” said Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota, “is focus on a single message — a single, concise or clear-cut message, and stick with that over the next 30 days, regardless of what happens.“He’s had a lot of attack lines. But it’s time to choose.”John C. Danforth, a retired Republican senator from Missouri, said Mr. McCain should turn his attention mainly to drawing contrasts with Mr. Obama and “essentially go back to the basics.”“I don’t think it’s enough to talk about earmarks incessantly,” Mr. Danforth said. “He’s made that point. You’ve got to get beyond that and talk about the very dramatic taxes and spending in the Obama program.”Even that might not be enough, Mr. Danforth said. “This is a year where everything that could go in Obama’s favor is going in Obama’s favor,” he said. “Everything that could go against McCain is against him. It’s absolutely the worst kind of perfect storm.”Mr. McCain’s advisers said they remained confident of victory.“My sense of where things are: John McCain beat back what was a political climate that would have snuffed out any other candidate in the Republican Party,” said Nicolle Wallace, a senior adviser. “He’s beat back every hurdle that was ever placed in front of him.”Mr. McCain acknowledged the challenge Saturday as he campaigned in Iowa, where President Bush won narrowly in 2004 but where polls show Mr. Obama with a healthy lead.“I’d like to remind you that the political pundits have been wrong several times,” Mr. McCain said, “and they’re wrong because we will win the state of Iowa in November.”Yet there were continued signs of confusion and turmoil in the McCain campaign, as his aides wrestled with conflicting advice, daunting poll numbers and criticism from state party leaders increasingly distressed with the way the campaign has been run.Republicans said he had been damaged by several rallies last week in which supporters shouted insults and threats about Mr. Obama, prompting Mr. McCain on Friday night to chide audience members. His aides suggested that they were trying to find a balance between attacking Mr. Obama and painting him as untested and risky without stirring unruly crowd reactions.Emotions are raw in the campaign, where Mr. McCain’s top advisers have voiced frustration at what they said was an unfair focus by the news media on the rowdy crowds.“I think there have been quite a few reporters recently,” said Mr. McCain’s closest adviser, Mark Salter, “who have sort of implied, or made more than implications, that somehow we’re responsible for the occasional nut who shows up and yells something about Barack Obama.”The difficulties of the McCain campaign have led some Republican leaders to express concern that he could end up dragging other Republican candidates down to defeat. “If Obama is able to run up big numbers around the country,” said Mr. Anuzis, the Michigan party chairman, “the potential for hurting down-ballot Republicans is very big.”One sign of that has emerged in Nebraska, where Representative Lee Terry, a Republican, ran a newspaper advertisement featuring words of support for him from a woman identified as an “Obama-Terry voter.”In this churning environment, Mr. McCain was getting conflicting advice from party leaders about what to do. Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who was a rival of Mr. McCain for the Republican nomination, said Mr. McCain, who has offered scattershot proposals on the economy, should present a broad vision of how he would lead the country through the economic crisis.“I’m talking about standing above the tactical alternatives that are being considered,” Mr. Romney said, “and establish an economic vision that is able to convince the American people that he really knows how to strengthen the economy.”But no subject has more divided Republicans than the one that has been a matter of disagreement in the McCain camp: how directly to invoke Mr. Obama’s connection to his controversial former minister, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., and William Ayers, a former member of the Weather Underground who has had a passing association with Mr. Obama over the years.In Colorado, a traditionally Republican state that Mr. McCain is struggling to keep in his column, the party chairman, Dick Wadhams, urged Mr. McCain to hit the issue hard, arguing that it was fair game and could be highly effective in raising questions about Mr. Obama in the final weeks of the campaign. He said he was surprised Mr. McCain had failed to do so in the debate last week.“I think those are legitimate insights into who Senator Obama is,” Mr. Wadhams said. “I do not think it is irrelevant to this election.”But Fergus Cullen, the Republican chairman in New Hampshire, said Saturday that he thought it would be a mistake for Mr. McCain to go down that road, warning that it would turn off moderate voters in his state who have a history of supporting Mr. McCain.“I don’t think he should be giving into elements of the base who have been asking him to be going after, using Wright, using Ayers,” Mr. Cullen said. “Think about it as an undecided persuadable voter.”Although Mr. McCain has declared Mr. Wright off limits, the campaign has brought up Mr. Ayers. But the campaign appeared to step back a bit in raising that relationship Saturday. At a rally in Iowa, Mr. McCain stuck to his usual attacks on the Democratic nominee on taxes, the financial crisis and housing.For her part, Ms. Palin appeared to pull back on the sharp jabs at a fund-raiser in Philadelphia.“We just want to make sure that in this campaign, that we uphold the standards of tolerance and truth-telling,” she said. “There have been things said, of course, that have allowed those standards to be violated on both sides, on both tickets. We want to uphold those standards, and again it’s not mean-spirited, it’s not negative campaigning, when we call someone out on their record.”Mr. Cullen said he still thought that Mr. McCain could win his state but acknowledged it would be difficult. “The national news has not been politically favorable for us in the last two or three weeks,” he said. “He either has to come up with a way to make the discussion on the economy reflect better on the Republicans or change the subject to something else.”Mr. Romney referred to his own defeat at the hands of Mr. McCain in arguing that Mr. Obama should not be packing his bags for the White House quite yet. “Never count John McCain out,” he said. “Who knows? He has ground to make up. But he makes up ground in a big hurry. He did it in the primary.”'"
"'08-10-12,'0','The first day of school feels like a fresh start everywhere, and Iraq’s six million schoolchildren returned to much more hope and far less violence this year.But the start of school also seems an acute measure of one crucial part of Iraq’s overall improvement: whether uprooted families feel confident enough, after years of war, crime and sectarian bloodshed, to go back to their homes and old neighborhood schools. After all, few parents, if any, willingly expose their children to danger.A tentative answer, from interviews in a half-dozen Baghdad neighborhoods, begins with a far greater feeling of safety. That is borne out by figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.In August, the number of Iraqis who returned home from abroad or from internal displacement soared to 37,835, compared with 20,546 in July and 16,338 in June. Baghdad and Diyala Province, just to the north, account for more than 90 percent of them.Millions remain displaced, and in September the pace slowed, with 23,821 returning to their homes. But the monthly average for the 10 months beginning in August 2007, according to the United Nations figures, had been only about 11,000.Even for those who come back to Iraq from outside the country, there still seems much reluctance to return to their homes if they fled sectarian violence, particularly in areas that were mixed Sunni and Shiite.And so the opening of school, which for most Baghdad children was in October, is also a measure of how deeply the city’s sectarian map was redrawn in the violence of 2006 and 2007.Ms. Majid, for example, is a Shiite married to a Sunni, and she was willing to return this year from Egypt, but she drew the line at returning to Saydia, the southern neighborhood she had fled, which was one of the main battlegrounds for sectarian feuds. She now lives with her parents in Amel, a mainly Shiite area that was once more mixed.Over all, the sentiment around Baghdad seemed a mix of hope and anxiety, which together translated into endless calculations and complex compromises: Should the whole family return, or just the adults? Is it wise to reclaim a home in a previously mixed neighborhood? Or might it be better to find a new one in an area dominated by one’s own sect, and dare again to trust neighbors enough to contemplate a basic act like letting a child walk to school alone?Complicating the choices, many schools in the heart of Baghdad are overcrowded, understaffed and in ruins, lacking some basic infrastructure, like classroom benches and clean drinking water.In the southern city of Basra, more parents are opting this year to enroll their children in better-run private schools, despite the steep costs.“School is probably the most important institution that needs to be re-established for the return to normalcy,” said Maj. Tom Nelson, an American engineering officer in Baghdad.The American military seems to be bearing the brunt of costs associated with rebuilding and equipping schools. It has spent more than $85 million since October 2006 in Baghdad alone. Major Nelson’s unit of the 101st Airborne Division has spent $6.7 million in recent months on schools in northwestern Baghdad, more than double the Iraqi government’s $2.6 million.The Kifah elementary public school in Fadhil, a central Baghdad neighborhood that until recently was among the most dangerous, got from the American military a power generator, air-conditioners in every classroom and a bright blue paint job. Bordering the building, though, there remains a swamp of sewage.And notwithstanding the American help, the principal, Awatef Fadhel, said she could not get money from the district Board of Education to run the new generator, let alone hire a guard, a janitor and replacements for the teachers who fled Fadhil.The Iraqi education minister, Khudayr al-Khuzai, said the nation’s schools have been in shambles since the mid-1980s as a result of wars and international sanctions. Now that the security situation is better, he said, the government will embark on a multibillion-dollar program of renovations and building over the next four years.“I do not think we have serious problems,” he said. “The most serious problem is when the lives of students and teachers were being threatened.”United Nations officials say it is critical that the Iraqi government act quickly and be less bureaucratic in helping the returning refugees, including providing adequate education and schools. Experts hope improvements in schools will reinforce the idea that neighborhoods are safer, so that still more people will return.“Nothing is irreversible,” Andrew Harper, who is in charge of the Iraq desk in the Office of the High Commissioner, said, referring to the current calm. “We need to do things quickly and hit it while the iron is hot.”In the heart of Huriya, a sprawling working-class neighborhood in northwestern Baghdad ripped apart by reprisal killings and displacement, a sewage pool consumes half the playground of the Wasit elementary school for girls.Zahra Saheb, the school’s principal, conceded that progress toward normalcy had been limited. The school, which has 560 students, had lost nearly 50 students when Sunnis fled Huriya, and only three daughters of recently returned families have registered. “A lot of blood was spilled here,” Ms. Zaheb said.Almost no day goes by without reports of the acts against families returning to homes they had fled. Many encounter graffiti warning them not to stay, and some are threatened with bombs and grenades. Some meet a fate like that of a Shiite man who was killed late last month shortly after going back to his home in the now mainly Sunni neighborhood of Ghazaliya.Saleh Mahdi and his family returned this fall from Syria, after an absence of more than two years. On Monday he was registering his daughter Baraa at al-Amal high school in Amel.Mr. Mahdi, a Shiite, owns a house in Ghazaliya but recently rented a new one in Amel. He went back to check on his Ghazaliya home a few days ago and learned that a neighbor had been strangled with a bag, his body dumped on the street.At the Amal school on Monday, almost 50 students were crammed into a stuffy and dusty math classroom. For them, sectarian polarization is a part of life. The subject is broached in a matter-of-fact manner, often lacking in the passionate discourse of older generations.“We moved to Amel because it is a Shiite area now and the closest to Dora,” said Hawra Kadhim, 18, referring to her native neighborhood in southern Baghdad, until recently one of the city’s most violent areas.Although some Shiites have recently returned to their schools and homes in Dora, Ms. Kadhim said this was not a proposition her family would be contemplating any time soon.In Dolaie, an impoverished neighborhood roiled by violence that tipped the scale in favor of Shiite militiamen loyal to the cleric Moktada al-Sadr, the principal of an elementary school rejected outright the return of Sunni families.“When you kill me and harm me, why should you come back and live with me?” said Razzaq Darwish, the principal. “How would you expect me to react?”In the meantime, Mr. Darwish’s school is falling apart, and overwhelmed by the children of almost 4,000 Shiite refugee families who have settled in the Chukouk camp nearby.The roof is caving in, classroom floors and hallways are stripped bare, and in the playground a pile of burnt trash was smoldering. His school, which has 1,300 students attending in two shifts, is being temporarily consolidated with a nearby school.In another part of town, in the once upscale and leafy Mutanabi section of Mansour, the situation is so dire at a local elementary school, called Intifada, that there are not enough classroom benches. Teachers must bring their own chairs from home. Piles of uncollected trash fester behind the building. The street in front of the school was where Sunni extremists, who formerly controlled the area, deposited bodies of people they had killed.“We had doctors and engineers here; now it’s people from all over,” said Jassim al-Nuaimi, who leads the local citizen patrol, which is part of the nationwide, and mainly Sunni, Awakening security movement.He said the Shiite-led government was punishing his neighborhood because it is predominantly Sunni Arab. An estimated 70 mothers who live in the area lost their husbands in acts of violence over the past few years, he said.Back in Amel, Ms. Majid’s brother Hussein is trying to stitch back together and heal an entire neighborhood shattered by sectarian violence and displacement.He has just become principal of the Amel high school for boys, which until recently was controlled by Mr. Sadr’s Mahdi Army militia. The previous assistant principal, a Sunni, was assassinated in November 2006, and most Sunni students left.“There was a civil war,” Mr. Majid said. “Why should we lie about it?”The school was occupied until May by a Kurdish unit of the Iraqi Army. The soldiers vandalized classrooms, twisted ceiling fans and ripped out electrical cables. Mortar explosions punctured the walls with holes.Mr. Majid, however, has already received a pledge of almost $670,000 from the United States military to rebuild the school. Standing in its crumbling courtyard, he fantasized about reviving the theater, stocking a library and holding poetry readings.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','“Pursuit of an Edge, in Steroids or Stocks” (Economic View, Oct. 5) offered two conditions that must be met for today’s type of market “steroid” failure to occur: Investors must see a high probability of gain with only a small chance of significant loss from their actions, and rewards depend strongly on relative performance.But shouldn’t we consider that risk aversion has to do not only with probability, but also with timing?Many athletes are willing to risk having chronic health problems so long as those injuries manifest themselves after their athletic careers. In short, the further we can discount risks into the future (especially if our future predictions are unrealistic) the more chances we’re willing to take today.The problem on Wall Street is that the future arrived a little sooner than many participants had anticipated. Therefore, the most effective remedies will be those that short-circuit the discounting of risk.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','“Detroit Got Its Bailout” (editorial, Oct. 6) perpetuates the myth that foreign automakers are the only ones that have successfully invested in fuel-efficient cars.For the 2009 model year, General Motors is offering 18 models that get 30 miles per gallon on the highway — more than any other automaker, foreign or domestic, is offering.We are pursuing fuel-economy improvements across our product line, as well as investing in new technology, like the Chevy Volt, an extended-range electric vehicle slated for sale in late 2010.The federal direct loan program is not a bailout, but a loan, which must — and will — be repaid. The incentive program for manufacturing advanced-technology vehicles was passed last December as part of the energy bill.Last week Congress appropriated the funds for the program, which is intended to assist automakers and parts suppliers in developing and producing advanced propulsion vehicles. The measure passed last year already requires the loans be used solely to invest in new technologies.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','And the McCain campaign released a new commercial on Friday that lumps Mr. Ayers into a dog’s breakfast of negative buzz words: “Obama’s blind ambition. When convenient, he worked with terrorist Bill Ayers.” It veers to a mention of “risky” subprime loans and almost begs the listener to link Mr. Ayers and Mr. Obama with the collapse of the housing market.With fewer than four weeks until the election, why is the McCain campaign so focused on Mr. Ayers?Mr. McCain told ABC News in an interview broadcast Friday that Mr. Ayers was not just “a guy in the neighborhood,” as Mr. Obama has said, and that Mr. Obama had “launched his political career” in Mr. Ayers’s living room. (Mr. Ayers held a gathering for Mr. Obama in 1995, one of several in which Mr. Obama discussed whether to run for office.)“I don’t care about two washed-up old terrorists that are unrepentant about trying to destroy America,” Mr. McCain told ABC, referring to Mr. Ayers and his wife, Bernardine Dohrn, who was also a member of the Weather Underground. “But I do care, and Americans should care, about his relationship with him and whether he’s being truthful and candid about it.”Mr. McCain added, “I don’t care about Mr. Ayers, who on Sept. 11, 2001, said he wished he’d have bombed more.” (Mr. Ayers said in an interview with The New York Times that was published on Sept. 11, 2001, “I don’t regret setting bombs,” and added, “I feel we didn’t do enough.” He later said he meant that he did not do enough to protest the Vietnam War.)In any case, it is clear that Mr. McCain thinks — or hopes — that the Ayers issue has traction, and some analysts agree that it might, at least with the Republican base and possibly with the dwindling number of undecided voters.Darrell West, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Ayers was a potent symbol.“Bill Ayers combines 9/11 and Willie Horton into one target,” Mr. West said, referring to the convict in Massachusetts who was let out on a prison furlough and raped a woman and whose image was used against Michael Dukakis in his failed 1988 presidential campaign.Mr. West added: “Ayers represents someone who is far out of the mainstream and who endangered American security. So in the age of terrorism, he’s a great symbol.”Robert J. Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University, said Mr. McCain was trying to plant seeds of doubt about Mr. Obama’s character and who he really is so that undecided voters would think he is “risky.”“He’s just hoping that if you throw enough doubts out there, one of them will find its way to the craw of an undecided voter,” Mr. Thompson said.This has been evident at McCain rallies.“Who is Barack Obama?” Mr. McCain asked at a recent rally in New Mexico. The answer came back: “Terrorist!” At another rally in Pennsylvania, someone shouted, “He is a bomb!” At yet another rally, a supporter called out, “Off with his head!”Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, a Democrat, looked at the McCain tactic this way: “The McCain-Palin campaign and some of their followers unfortunately want you to be afraid of Barack Obama.”And some people say they are. One man at a McCain rally on Friday said he was “scared” to raise a child under a President Obama. Mr. McCain pulled back, saying Mr. Obama was a decent man, only to be jeered by his own supporters.Mr. Obama himself has highlighted Mr. McCain’s tone as a way of contrasting it with his own. “It’s easy to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division,” he said Friday. “But that’s not what we need right now in the United States. The times are too serious.”A McCain spokesman, Brian Rogers, instantly fired back, saying in a statement that “Barack Obama’s effort to silence and shame those who seek answers should make everyone wonder exactly what he is hiding.”Despite the McCain campaign’s zeal for invoking Mr. Ayers, however, Mr. McCain himself did not bring him up at his debate with Mr. Obama on Tuesday.He may have been concerned about doing it face to face with Mr. Obama — and did not want to provoke Mr. Obama into responding with a reference to Mr. McCain’s own questionable ties to Charles Keating, of the savings and loan scandal (not a good reminder in a time of financial crisis).Whatever the reason Mr. McCain did not bring up Mr. Ayers, that he continues to focus on him on the trail suggests that he thinks the name is energizing his base, those voters who are already committed to him, and perhaps those who are looking for a reason not to support Mr. Obama. And he wants to ensure they remain energized through Election Day.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','Financial companies shed 150,000 jobs last year and more than 100,000 so far this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a national job placement company. Yet amid the downturn, applications to graduate business schools rose this year, as they have in other periods of uncertainty.Adam Hallowell, 20, an economics major at Harvard, said his classmates were not overly upset by the market because they were prepared to change direction. “Mine is a generation that’s been told from high school onward, ‘You’re going to change careers five or six times throughout the course of your life,’ ” he said. Even as the Dow plunged day after day, Mr. Hallowell said the mood on campus had not changed, adding that “most students don’t personally have stock portfolios and 401(k) plans yet, which is probably why they aren’t very concerned.”This resilience has surprised Charissa Asbury, who runs a program at Columbia University’s School of Continuing Education for graduates who want to go to business school. Ms. Asbury said she expected to see a panic among her students. Many were working on Wall Street; some had lost their jobs.“I wondered if they would say, ‘Maybe this isn’t the time; I don’t want to spend the money if the salary is not going to be there,’ ” she said. “But instead they’re even more interested in finding exactly what they need to get into a top business school. Everyone’s worried about their prospects, but it’s translated into, ‘How do we get better credentials?’ ”She added, “Now they feel, if they want to go to business school, they need to be from one of the top ones.”Even at Harvard, students were more attentive at sessions and résumé round tables, said Robin Mount, interim director of career services. In previous years, they often spent these sessions sending text messages; this year, the sessions have been purposeful and heavily attended. Ms. Mount said she could have heard a pin drop.Beverly Principal, assistant director of employment services at Stanford, said she had already seen a reduction in campus recruitment by banks, though a spokeswoman at J. P. Morgan Chase said it would continue recruiting at target universities throughout the semester.When students do receive offers, they come under more scrutiny, before and after hiring, said Ronald Storch, a partner at Marcum and Kliegman, a large accounting firm. “A couple years ago there was too much work and not enough bodies,” Mr. Storch said. “We were hiring just to get bodies, and people could bounce from firm to firm. Now they’re not getting the same opportunities.”Jian Yang, 25, who is in his second year at the University of Chicago’s graduate business school, recently considered his prospects in this new climate. Mr. Yang said he had friends who had lost jobs or taken internships at Lehman and Bear Stearns expecting to land full-time jobs, only to watch the companies fail. He expects to graduate with $200,000 in student debt.“It’s definitely impacting the mood of the student body,” Mr. Yang said. “We’re all watching the news every day.” Where students in past years set their course on a single field, like investment banking, now they are looking in several areas to improve their chances, he said.But Mr. Yang said he was not reconsidering his career path because he felt there would still be good jobs available to people like him, who come from top schools and are willing to work abroad. He said he and his friends had not changed their lifestyles, either. “Life kind of goes on,” he said.“It’s almost a blessing to be in school while the economy is down; it’s a shelter,” Mr. Yang added. “So in one way I feel unlucky, because I missed the boom, but in another way I’m lucky. It’s a good way to spend three years of downturn.”In a June poll by the Rockefeller Foundation, people ages 18 to 29 were more pessimistic about the economy than any other age group, with half saying that America was a better place in the 1990s and would continue to decline. But they did not apply this pessimism to themselves; they were most likely to say that if they work hard and play by the rules, they will be able to achieve the American Dream.John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said that even as investment banking suffered, opportunities remained in health care, energy, international business and consulting. “It’ll be interesting to see if the top graduates flow to other industries,” Mr. Challenger said. “It remains to be seen whether we’ll see an increase in idealism or public service like we did after 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina.”For Tina Phoolka, 28, a graduate business student at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., the new reality means staying in school, even after she earns her M.B.A.“I thought I was going to get a $100,000-plus job and everything would be great, with lots of opportunities,” Ms. Phoolka said. “Now I’m wondering if I should extend my graduation date, enroll in a Ph.D. program or get a dual degree. I’ll probably study more or look for a job in another country.”For those who are out of school, the changes in the horizon have been more immediate.When Jon Cifuentes, 28, landed a job at Smith Barney out of college, he believed that within three years, he would be making more than $100,000 a year, reaping ever larger bonuses.Then this May, after two job changes, Mr. Cifuentes lost his job in a large layoff at Nomura, an investment bank based in Asia, leaving him with a $3,000 mortgage payment and a case of disillusionment.After a summer of working part time in his father’s contracting business, Mr. Cifuentes now has a temporary job at Macquarie Capital Partners and is finishing his master’s degree in economics. He and his wife moved into an apartment owned by his sister; they can rent theirs out.“Compared to some friends I used to work with, I’m doing well,” Mr. Cifuentes said. “Some guys are in their mid-40s, with a wife, kids, mortgage and a lot of bills. They’re in a much worse spot.”Jonathan Miller, 24, who joined a midmarket investment bank in July 2007, just before the market started to fall, has also tasted the new reality. Mr. Miller had majored in philosophy and English but was drawn to banking in his senior year by the prospect of a high salary and “something with sparkle and shine” for his résumé, he said.“When I got the job,” Mr. Miller said, “the recruiter told me, just don’t screw up and you’ll do well.” But he and his team were laid off last month — all now scrambling for work, along with thousands of others.Mr. Miller said he thought his skills and contacts would pull him through the downturn. Asked what he was doing with the 12 to 14 hours a day he previously spent at his job, he said: “Looking for work. I spend nine hours a day on the phone, writing e-mails, talking to headhunters. You need to be aggressive and focused. My prospects aren’t terrible.”He said if he did not find a job in the next few months, he would consider graduate school or a new field of work.“I don’t feel cheated,” Mr. Miller said. “But it’s unfortunate that by lack of timing I missed it by a year or two.”'"
"'08-10-12,'0','In Rhode Island, meanwhile, the rules have toughened considerably. That happened after The Providence Journal reported in March that producers of a straight-to-DVD picture called “Hard Luck,” which starred Wesley Snipes and Cybill Shepherd, had picked up $2.65 million in state tax credits on a budget of $11 million, even though it had reported paying only $1.9 million of the total to Rhode Islanders.“With this much money involved, there’s going to be a temptation to hype budgets,” said Peter Dekom, a veteran entertainment business lawyer who is an adviser to New Mexico’s incentive program.The vogue for state film subsidies appears to have started in Colorado early this decade, with a briefly financed Defense Against Canada law that was devised to win production back from Vancouver and Toronto. Louisiana and New Mexico soon came on board.By this year, about 40 states were offering significant subsidies, turning the United States into what the Incentives Office, a consulting firm in Santa Monica, Calif., has called the New Bulgaria. It is a reference to what was once the film industry’s favorite low-cost production site.Virtually all of the programs use a state tax system to reimburse producers for money spent on movies or TV shows shot in the state. Some, like Michigan’s, simply refund a percentage of expenditures to the producer. Others, like Louisiana’s, issue a tax credit that can reduce the taxes a production pays or be sold to someone else. Either way, the state gives up revenue that otherwise would be collected to put money in the producer’s pockets.Advocates, of course, argue that these programs create jobs.One of the country’s most successful programs is in New Mexico, which has backed movies like the Oscar-winning “No Country for Old Men” and next year’s “Terminator Salvation,” the latest sequel in the action series, with a reported budget of $200 million.New Mexico officials boast of having used a 25 percent production cost rebate to build a local film industry that has attracted more than $600 million in direct spending since 2003, and an estimated $1.8 billion in total financial impact, as of last June. And in fiscal year 2008, the productions in the state generated 142,577 days of employment, up from 25,293 in 2004.Elsewhere, however, critics have sharply challenged the notion that state subsidies for the film business can ever buy more than momentary glitter.“There’s no evidence yet that this is a particularly efficient or effective way to create jobs,” said Noah Berger, executive director of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center.The nonprofit center reviews budget and tax policies in Massachusetts, which is spending about $60 million a year on producer credits. A recent study by Mr. Berger’s center pointed out that the state’s film credit, at 25 percent, is five times higher than that offered to those who build in designated economic opportunity areas, and more than eight times the state’s standard investment tax credit.Until two years ago, Louisiana’s program offered a 15 percent credit for virtually the entire budget of a qualified film (and more for Louisiana resident wages), including money that may have been spent out of state. Things were fast and loose enough in Louisiana that Mark Smith, who oversaw the program, pleaded guilty last year to taking $67,500 in bribes to inflate budgets for a film production company that was not named by the authorities.Kathy English, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in New Orleans, said the case remained open.Louisiana’s new rules offer a larger credit, but only on spending within the state. That made the incentive less attractive for big-budget movies, like “Button,” which was done under old rules, and could recover parts of star salaries and other expenses that left Louisiana. But it has drawn a welter of smaller movies and TV shows, 70 of which have been shot so far in 2008, up from 56 the year before.“All areas of the state have prospered as a result; everyone sees it,” said Sherri McConnell, director of Louisiana’s Office of Entertainment Industry Development. (Ms. McConnell said she did not expect to have a detailed picture of economic impact until the completion of a planned study, early next year.)Others are not so sure. “There’s no way you can say this makes money for the public” treasury, said Greg Albrecht, chief economist for Louisiana’s legislative fiscal office.In 2006, the last year for which it has complete figures, the state granted about $121 million in credits. Mr. Albrecht estimates that only about 18 percent of that is ever recovered in taxes on expanded economic activity.“It’s an expensive way to create jobs,” Mr. Albrecht said. But he noted that Louisiana, like New Mexico, can afford it, thanks to rising oil and gasoline revenue. “We’re happy as larks right now to do this.”Not so happy are some folks up in Michigan, where a State Senate committee recently moved to cap the state’s film rebates at an aggregate of $50 million a year.“It’s just horrible right now,” Mike Bishop, a Republican state senator, said of Michigan’s financial condition. Mr. Bishop initially backed the film incentive. But he grew alarmed at outlays that he estimated could quickly exceed $110 million a year to subsidize movies like “Gran Torino,” directed by Clint Eastwood, and “Youth in Revolt,” a comedy by the filmmaker Miguel Arteta.Anthony Wenson, chief operating officer of the Michigan Film Office, said the actual amount of credits granted was only about $25 million so far. The annual number is impossible to reckon, he said, because plans for future projects are in flux.In any case, Nancy Cassis, another Republican who was the only Michigan senator to oppose the incentives when they began last spring, said she expected to see them capped with bipartisan backing later this year. And she does not look for Hollywood to hang around when the money dries up.“These are not long-term jobs,” Ms. Cassis said. “If just one state offers more, they’ll be out of here before you can say ‘lickety-split.’ ”'"
"'08-10-12,'0','Recent scandals involving former Representative Randy Cunningham, Republican of California, and the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, both now in prison, provided a glimpse into how special interests manipulate the federal government.Mr. Cantrell’s story, by contrast, pieced together from federal documents and dozens of interviews, is a remarkable account of how a little-known, midlevel Defense Department insider who spent his entire career in Alabama skillfully gamed the system.Mr. Cantrell worked in a division that was a small part of the national missile defense program. Determined to save his job, he often bypassed his bosses and broke department rules to make his case on Capitol Hill. He enlisted contractors to pitch projects that would keep the dollars flowing and paid lobbyists to ease them through. He cultivated lawmakers, who were eager to send money back home or to favored contractors and did not ask many questions. And when he ran into trouble, he could count on his powerful friends for protection from Pentagon officials who provided little oversight and were afraid of alienating lawmakers.Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican, for example, chewed out Pentagon officials who opposed a missile range Mr. Cantrell and his contractor allies were seeking to build in Alaska, prompting them to back off, while a staffer for former Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, intervened when the Pentagon threatened to discipline Mr. Cantrell for lobbying, a banned activity for civil servants.“I could go over to the Hill and put pressure on people above me and get something done,” Mr. Cantrell explained about his success in Washington. “With the Army, as long as the senator is not calling over and complaining, everything is O.K. And the senator will not call over and complain unless the contractor you’re working with does not get his money. So you just have to keep the players happy and it works.”The national missile defense program has cost the United States more than $110 billion since President Ronald Reagan unveiled his Star Wars plan 25 years ago. Today, the missile defense effort is the Pentagon’s single biggest procurement program.The Army declined to discuss the Cantrell case, other than to say it had taken steps to try to prevent similar crimes from happening again.But some current and former Defense Department officials say the exploiting of the system that preceded Mr. Cantrell’s kickback scheme has had a damaging impact, slowing progress toward building a viable missile defense system by diverting money to unnecessary or wasteful endeavors. That pattern of larding up the defense budget with pet projects pushed by lawmakers and lobbyists is a familiar one.“What they did may have been a scandal,” said Walter E. Braswell, Mr. Ennis’s lawyer, referring to the actions of his client and Mr. Cantrell. “But even more grotesque is the way defense procurement has disintegrated into an incestuous relationship between the military, politicians and contractors.”Dr. J. Richard Fisher, one of Mr. Cantrell’s former bosses, said: “The system needs to change. But it is not likely to do that. There is just too much inertia — and too much self-interest.”Getting Around the SystemTowering over the highway near the entrance to Huntsville is a replica of the Saturn V rocket, the powerful missile that lifted the first man to the moon.Created in Huntsville, it is a fitting icon for this once-sleepy cotton mill town, now so dominated by the aerospace industry that it is nicknamed Rocket City. An estimated 18,000 uniformed and civilian federal employees work in the aerospace industry in the Huntsville area today, augmented by about 40,000 others, who work for federal contractors.Michael Cantrell grew up on a dairy farm nearby, listening to the rumble of rocket test flights. As a young engineer, he became a civilian employee of the Army and quickly impressed his bosses. “Mike moved at the speed of sound,” said Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, who briefly headed the missile command.By 1990, Mr. Cantrell, then 35, took over an experimental program to develop faster, cheaper and lighter missiles that could intercept and knock out enemy missiles flying within the atmosphere. Under the Reagan administration, money was plentiful for such research, but with the fall of the Soviet Union and the arrival of the Clinton administration, Pentagon bosses were forced to make budget cuts.Like other Army employees, Mr. Cantrell was prohibited from lobbying or even visiting Capitol Hill unless he had permission from his agency’s Congressional liaison, a prohibition intended to block employees from promoting initiatives that Pentagon leaders did not see as a priority.But General Garner said it was obvious to his managers what they had to do if they did not want their programs — and jobs — eliminated.“If the money does not end up in the POM and you need it,” he said in an interview, referring to the Program Objective Memorandum, “the only other place you can go to get it is the Congress.”Soon enough, Army missile program managers started opening what amounted to their own lobbying shops in Washington, according to Mr. Cantrell and his former supervisors.Mr. Cantrell became a regular on Capitol Hill, both in the halls of Congress and in the bars and restaurants where Hill staffers gather after hours. He set up a makeshift office in the US Airways lounge at Reagan National Airport, where he followed up on pitches for money to lawmakers and hid out from his Defense Department bosses. He identified lobbyists who could prove useful and contractors — many of them campaign donors — with projects that needed nurturing.With the backing of the New York Congressional delegation, for example, he blocked cuts in financing for a sophisticated wind tunnel in Buffalo, where he promised to test his missile components. With help from then Representative Curt Weldon, Republican of Pennsylvania, who wanted Army assistance for a “technology corridor” in his district, Mr. Cantrell managed to get millions more for his program. Eventually, a dozen or so lawmakers helped him.“It was like I was going hunting in Washington,” Mr. Cantrell said. “And I would always come up with money.” One colleague was so impressed with Mr. Cantrell’s record that she gave him a bobblehead doll carrying a briefcase marked with dollar signs.The Pentagon had objected to Mr. Cantrell’s financing requests, but he was not discouraged. “He kept trying to kill our programs,” Mr. Cantrell said of one supervisor. But “we would go around” and get a lawmaker “to whack him.”Inspired by his successes, Mr. Cantrell soon embarked on a more ambitious project that would all but guarantee sustained financing.His proposal, which was based on the premise that Congress would significantly increase annual financing for his experimental missile defense work, involved not just five test launchings, but the construction of a new launching site on a remote Alaskan island and the lease of a mothballed Navy helicopter carrier, which would be used to send the simulated attack missile.It was easy to find willing partners.The program’s main contractors, including the defense giant Lockheed Martin, prepared presentations for Congress making the case for an extra $25 million to $50 million a year for the project.Officials in Alaska, who had been seeking money for a spaceport on Kodiak Island to launch commercial satellites, eagerly chimed in. And nearly a dozen lawmakers also did their part, Mr. Cantrell said, including Senator Stevens of Alaska; Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama; Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine; and Representative C. W. Bill Young, Republican of Florida, all members of the Appropriations or Armed Services committees with missile defense contractors in their districts.But the military already had rocket launching sites around the globe, and Gen. Lester L. Lyles of the Air Force, who then ran the missile defense program, had no intention of spending money on another one.General Lyles and his deputy, Rear Adm. Richard D. West of the Navy, were particularly incensed when they learned of the plans to lease the helicopter carrier, the Tripoli, and spend several million dollars renovating it.Summoned to Washington in 1997 to explain the project, Mr. Cantrell offered little information. That only further infuriated his bosses.“Who in the hell is in charge of this program?” Admiral West finally demanded in an exchange both men recall.Mr. Cantrell was ordered to remove his experimental equipment from the planned launching. But the money kept coming. Mr. Stevens’s office had called to insist that the Kodiak project proceed, Admiral West and Lt. Gen. Edward G. Anderson, then the head of Army Space and Missile Defense Command, said in interviews.“I got hammered pretty hard,” Admiral West recalled. The military men backed off, and the construction at Kodiak continued.Mr. Cantrell said he knew that building a new launching facility was wasteful. “It doesn’t make sense,” he said. “The economics of it, they just don’t work.”But he did not care.“I went up there to get the money,” Mr. Cantrell said of his dealings on Capitol Hill. “And we got what we needed.”Mr. Cantrell and his deputy, Mr. Ennis, visited Kodiak Island on the afternoon of the inaugural test launching in November 1998. The Air Force had substituted other equipment for Mr. Cantrell’s payload.The two men, armed with a cooler filled with Miller Lite beer, watched the launching from a trailer, emerging just in time to see the missile burn an orange streak into the sky. They had hidden out to avoid any local newspaper reporters who might discover that Mr. Cantrell’s missile parts — the justification for millions of dollars in spending — were not even being tested. “There is no way we can explain this,” Mr. Cantrell remembered telling Mr. Ennis.The hand that grabbed Mr. Cantrell by the shoulder startled him.It was General Lyles, who happened to be on Capitol Hill when he spotted Mr. Cantrell outside Mr. Lott’s office. It was February 1998, even before the dispute over the Alaska project had played out. But the general said he immediately suspected Mr. Cantrell was up to no good.“Are you over here lobbying?” General Lyles asked in an exchange the two men recalled.Mr. Cantrell had been working with Mr. Lott, then Senate majority leader, for several years. The lawmaker included several million dollars in the defense budget for an acoustics research center in his home state, and Mr. Cantrell made sure it went to the intended recipients: the University of Mississippi in Oxford and a Huntsville defense contractor that had a branch office in Oxford. In turn, Mr. Lott’s office helped get extra financing — $25 million or so every year — for Mr. Cantrell’s program.It was an arrangement that Mr. Cantrell did not want to discuss with General Lyles. While he did not consider himself to have been lobbying that day, he readily acknowledges that he often did.“I just mumbled a lot,” he recalled of his response to the general.By then, Mr. Cantrell felt confident that he could find his way out of any trouble with the help of his many friends in Washington. Several were lobbyists or consultants working on his behalf; he had /placed them with friendly contractors, allowing them to bill the government for the costs, even though federal law prohibits paying any expenses associated with lobbying.For example, Mr. Cantrell arranged for James Longley, a former Republican congressman from Maine who started his own consulting firm, to be hired as an employee by Computer Systems Technology, a missile defense contractor.“The man could put ‘honorable’ in front of his name and go places with that,” Mr. Cantrell explained, saying that Mr. Longley introduced him to lawmakers and appealed to senior Pentagon officials to protect Mr. Cantrell’s program.Mr. Longley, in an interview, insisted that he never sought money from Congress, but simply provided strategic advice to Mr. Cantrell.But several people, including Dr. Fisher, one of Mr. Cantrell’s bosses, thought the arrangement improper.“Here is an ex-congressman out there promoting Mike’s programs,” Dr. Fisher said. “He can call himself what he wants, but he is basically a lobbyist.”The incident with General Lyles prompted a formal investigation into Mr. Cantrell’s activities that same year.But Mr. Cantrell got Mr. Longley to call Army officials. Then Mr. Lott’s office requested that the case be closed, Mr. Cantrell said. Eric Womble, a former aide to Mr. Lott, said he could not remember taking such a step, but added that it would not have been surprising.“Senator Lott’s staff protects people who are trying to help us and help the nation,” Mr. Womble said.Soon, the investigation of Mr. Cantrell came to a close. He got only an oral warning from his boss.That episode would embolden Mr. Cantrell. On several occasions, he would again be caught violating Pentagon rules and each time escape with nothing more than a reprimand.“If you have the Senate majority leader’s office calling over to get you out of trouble, you can’t help but get a little cocky,” Mr. Cantrell said.From the US Airways club, Mr. Cantrell could see the symphony of the arriving and departing planes, the Potomac River and off in the distance, the Capitol dome.One day in 2000, Mr. Cantrell met in the airport lounge with Mr. Ennis, his deputy, and a Maine contractor to figure out how to pocket some of the government’s money.There were easy ways to cheat. The prototype missile nose cone and heat shields that the Army had paid the Maine company to design for the Alaska tests. Why not hire the business to pretend to design them again? Mr. Cantrell asked.The ballute — an odd cross between a balloon and a parachute — had been rejected by experts as a tool to strike an enemy missile. But why not pay the Maine company to develop them anyway? Mr. Cantrell suggested.He could pull off such shenanigans because, by then, he had an extraordinary degree of independence. Mr. Cantrell’s experimental missile program, which had cost nearly $250 million, was about to be canceled. No working missile system had been built — and almost none of the components had ended up being tested in real launchings as planned. The effort had produced some benefits for the players involved: Congress sent an annual allotment of extra money to the Alaska launching site now totaling more than $40 million, and one of the contractors that had worked with Mr. Cantrell initially to pitch the space port, Aero Thermo Technology, had secured a no-bid federal contract to provide launching services.Now Mr. Cantrell was on to another assignment overseeing missile defense research in Huntsville, and through his friends on the Hill, he was once again getting money for projects that the Pentagon did not want.Mr. Cantrell, who by now was helping to oversee 160 or so contractors and managing a $120 million a year contracting budget, said he knew that if he only requested a few million dollars at a time for his scheme, there would be little scrutiny of his requests or demands that he prove that the work was actually done.For example, the missile nose cones and other parts now made round trips from Huntsville to Maine with little or no change. Mr. Cantrell or his deputy simply marked off the work as complete, and that was the end of it.For nearly six years, from 2001 to 2007, the men collected kickbacks from contractors. During one visit to the US Airways Club, Mr. Ennis picked up a briefcase stuffed with $75,000 in cash, according to federal court records. Mr. Cantrell also got checks, ranging from $5,000 to $60,000, once or twice a month, court records show.The Maine contractor, Maurice H. Subilia, is under investigation; his lawyer, Toby Dilworth, a former federal prosecutor, declined to comment. Dennis A. Darling, a Florida contractor who got government research grants and then divvied them up with Mr. Cantrell, was indicted last month on a charge of paying Mr. Cantrell $400,000 in bribes from 2005 to 2007.With his new wealth, Mr. Cantrell, now 52, built himself a $1.25 million home in an exclusive Huntsville neighborhood called the Ledges.Mr. Cantrell, who received the bulk of the kickbacks, acknowledges his crime but he ticks off the failings of the system that he exploited: lawmakers who are eager to please contractors and campaign donors; unwillingness by the Army to push back against members of Congress whose agendas were at odds with those of the military; and little scrutiny.“We just paid for meaningless work,” he said. “And there was so little oversight that no one noticed.”Admiral West, the former deputy director of the Pentagon missile defense program, faults Mr. Cantrell for wrongdoing, but says there were multiple missed opportunities to investigate his activities.“The blame needs to go around widely here,” he said. “Congress should know better; the contractors, too.”Mr. Cantrell, who is awaiting sentencing on conspiracy and bribery charges, now spends his days sitting in the kitchen of his father-in-law’s house; his dream home was seized by the federal government.On top of the kitchen table, next to a King James Version of the Bible and bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin, is a stack of books on how to master poker. Mr. Cantrell has reduced them to mathematical formulas pinned onto a bulletin board in front of a computer terminal, where he plays Internet poker for hours at a time. Even now, he is trying to beat the system.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','The law calls for all students in the United States, including English language learners and students with special needs, to perform at grade level by 2014. Some officials complain that because the standards are raised every two years, more and more schools are failing to fulfill the law’s requirements.But that does not mean the state will not keep working hard to meet the goals, Mr. McQuillan said.The State Department of Education has introduced a new accountability system that assigns teams and support personnel to struggling districts, and helps districts put improvement plans into action, state officials said.And the strategy is working in some districts. Two elementary schools in Norwalk found out that they had finally come off the list of schools “in need of improvement.”Brookside Elementary and Kendall Elementary schools were in a group of only five elementary schools statewide that improved enough to meet this year’s standards.Salvatore J. Corda, superintendent of Norwalk Public Schools, said the improvements came after systemic shifts in teaching and methodology that the district had been working on for a couple of years. “When you try to move an entire system, it takes a while for things to take hold,” he said.When Tony Ditrio took over as principal of Kendall Elementary School 10 years ago, his first piece of business was getting order in the building. “There wasn’t any,” he said. “That took a few years. Once we had a safe, orderly environment, we started to tackle the curriculum.”All of the most recent data is based on scores from testing of 230,000 third through eighth graders and 50,000 tenth graders last spring. The latest results show that keeping children reading at grade level is “a real and growing challenge,” Mr. McQuillan said. At the high school level, he said, “mathematics is the greater issue.”This year, for the first time, the Greenwich school district as a whole did not make adequate yearly progress. The district is one of 44 of the state’s 171 districts that did not meet this year’s standards.Districts are considered not making adequate progress when certain student groups fail to meet benchmarks in the same category on both the elementary and high school tests. Students with disabilities and economically disadvantaged students in Greenwich did not score at grade level in both reading and math.“Does this mean we have a bad school system?” said Betty J. Sternberg, superintendent of Greenwich Public Schools. “The strength of a school system does lie in meeting the needs of each child, no matter what their background is. So to that extent if I’m a parent of a child in a subgroup that hasn’t met it,” she said, referring to the standards, “I would be concerned.”Special education students should not be expected to perform at grade level, Dr. Sternberg said. “We’ve had reports of special ed students sitting in front of tests and they’re crying. They can’t possibly do it,” she said.Additionally, testing students every year between third and eighth grade leaves schools inundated with data that needs to be analyzed and reported, said Dr. Sternberg, who served as Connecticut’s commissioner for education from 2003 to 2006. While some teachers and school administrators complain about the tests, others say the law has forced them to take action.“No Child Left Behind has been a really good kick in the pants for us,” said Joshua P. Starr, superintendent of schools in Stamford. “It was too easy to sweep some kids under the rug. We’re not allowed to do that anymore, and that’s a good thing.”Connecticut’s attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, sued the Bush administration in 2005, charging that No Child Left Behind illegally requires states to spend their own money to meet the law’s standards. A federal judge threw out the case last April, and Mr. Blumenthal is appealing that decision. The state’s appeal is likely to be argued next spring, according to Mr. Blumenthal’s staff.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','WHEN the 15th annual Westchester Craft Show opens its doors on Friday, it will transform the Westchester County Center into a showcase for 112 artisans from across the United States. For three days, an anticipated 6,000 visitors will wander among booths displaying wares, including jewelry, apparel, basketry, ceramics and items made from leather, fiber, metal, paper, wood and mixed media.“This show is not like an outdoor crafts fair for the whole family,” said Elizabeth F. Kubie, the founder and president of Crafts America, which organizes the event. “It is for people who want to see the most accomplished and respected craftspeople in the country.”The participating artists were selected from more than 500 applicants by a jury composed of Bennett Bean, a ceramic artist from Blairstown, N.J.; Michael W. Monroe, executive director of the Bellevue Art Museum in Bellevue, Wash; and Lois Moran, former editor in chief of American Craft magazine.This year, the show is participating in the countywide “All Fired Up! A Celebration of Clay in Westchester.” In recognition of that event, it will present a panel discussion — “Contemporary Ceramic Artists Explore Their Diverse Cultural Influences” — at 1:30 p.m. Friday. Judith S. Schwartz, an Armonk resident who is a curator, writer and professor of art at New York University, will moderate the discussion, which will feature three American ceramicists — Lindsay Feuer; Cliff Lee, who was born in Taiwan; and Noi Volkov, who was born in Russia — speaking about the influence of their backgrounds on their work.The show will also feature a lecture by Scott Grove, “Elements of Design and Structure: Insights on Sculptural Furniture Construction,” at 10:30 a.m. Friday. Mr. Grove is a Rochester-based furniture maker who grew up in Cortlandt Manor.Crafts America, based in Green Farms, Conn., also organizes the Washington Craft Show, now in its 21st year, and the Palm Beach Fine Craft Show, first held in 2003. Ms. Kubie, a former interior designer, said items at the Westchester show will be available for $100 to $25,000.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','OH yeah! “First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is ...”Brings it all back, doesn’t it? Mantras, maharishi, meditation and, yes, Donovan, the man-child Scottish musician who parlayed a gentle manner, a seriously tousled head of hair and a knack for writing catchy tunes into a career as the quintessential 1960s hippie Hurdy Gurdy Man.As with many pretty young men (Paul McCartney, case in point), age has rendered Donovan into someone who more closely resembles a fussy old lady than a grandpa, which he is. (He is also Ione Skye’s dad, and father-in-law to the model Kristy Hume.) On Tuesday night, playing for an audience of around 70 in the private 10th-floor quarters at ABC Carpet & Home in Manhattan, Donovan, 62, sang sweetly, decked out in something that looked like a transcendental tea cozy.The graying fans and some second-generation converts sat on floor cushions and ottomans and nodded along to lyrics like “Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind,” “Yellow is the color of my true love’s hair” and “They call me mellow yellow.” At one point Donovan urged everyone to do the “jazz clap,” on the off beat. But the friends, family and V.I.P.’s hardly needed encouragement. Most were singing along, including his wife, Linda Lawrence, seated at the back of the room, who, at one point, could be seen mouthing the words to “Sunshine Superman.”Linda, and her sister Carol Lawrence, who works as Donovan’s assistant, were wearing age-appropriate groupie garb, luxurious knitwear dresses from the Irish designer Lainey Keogh. The rest of the crowd tended toward jackets and ties for men; for women the look ranged from Birkenstocks to, oddly, sequins.Among those gathered were Rebecca Hoffberger, founder of the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore; Martha Roth, a New York midwife; Alex Grey, the visionary artist based in New York, who made a pen and ink drawing of Donovan during the concert; and the physicist John Hagelin of the Institute of Science, Technology, and Public Policy at the Maharishi University of Management, who teaches that the United States can be protected from terrorism, missiles and war by a Vedic defense shield, created through transcendental meditation.There was a burst of applause as Donovan began a more serious song, “Universal Soldier,” and murmurs of agreement with its antiwar message.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','Q. A timely question for apple-picking season: I was once told that the best apples in Colonial America came from Newtown Creek in Queens. Is that true?A. Indeed. The Newtown Pippin (the “pippin” is from the French “pépin,” for pit or seed) is considered the oldest commercially grown native variety in the United States. A favorite of Franklin’s, Washington’s and Jefferson’s, it was the first American apple to become popular in England.It is traced back to the late 17th or early 18th century, to a single tree on the Moore family estate, which stretched from the East River to what is now 54th Street in Elmhurst (formerly Newtown), Queens, according to an article published in 2003 in The New York Times. Most of the apples were shipped from Newtown Creek.As early as 1759, the apple had reached England, where an export business based on it lasted for a century, Peter Wynne wrote in the book “Apples.”“Every amateur fruit grower wanted a Newtown Pippin tree in his orchard, and the original tree succumbed to excessive cutting in 1805,” Mr. Wynne added. But it lives on in several strains.'"
"'08-10-12,'0','Since then — a vague period — Rubyfruit has become one of those institutions that, like aging athletes, have outlived their glory days and taken up residence in their own long shadows.The economic turmoil that has rocked the city, the nation and the world in recent months has defined Ms. Fierro’s reality for the past two years. Rubyfruit is a portrait in miniature of these large-scale troubles, one of countless unassuming businesses around the city being battered by forces beyond their control and sometimes deeply mysterious to them.“I had this formula that worked,” Ms. Fierro said. “But then it didn’t work anymore.”For about 12 years, Rubyfruit got along, never making much money but resting comfortably on its reputation. In recent years, though, Ms. Fierro returned from her daily run to a barrage of reminders that, in her mind, amounted to warnings of structural fragility, as if the place might collapse any day.Until two years ago, she began each day with $300 in the cash register. Now, she started with $30. If someone paid with a large bill and needed change, an employee had to run to an A.T.M., an embarrassing display, Ms. Fierro knew.She once kept tanks of soda under the bar, but recently, when a customer ordered a rum and Coke, a bartender would grab the soda from the fridge. When the soda ran out, an employee would run around the corner and buy another case.These small tasks added up to a wearying, ragtag performance, like a play being presented without the necessary props.“You’d never know that this business was so depressed if you walked in, because everything looks the same,” said Ms. Fierro, who wears her blond hair neatly parted on the side and reaching just to her shoulders. “But I know there’s no ice machine down there; there’s no soda in the guns.”This month, the rent rose to $11,330 from $6,500 in 1994. Her clientele had largely passed through its nightlife phase. As one longtime customer, Alisa Wiles, said recently, “A lot of the lesbian crew moved out to Brooklyn.” Or as Jillian Bradley, a 70-year-old veteran of the lesbian nightlife scene who owns a downtown escort service, put it, “Those girls are now dead or on blood-pressure medication.”Whatever the reasons, Ms. Fierro couldn’t pay the rent, and during Gay Pride Week in late June, as a friend distributed T-shirts and baseball caps stitched with the words “Rubyfruit — Last Call” to a moist-eyed Hudson Street crowd, Ms. Fierro told them she had no choice but to close it down.A few weeks later, Ms. Fierro changed her mind. More practical thinking gave way to her sheer desire to keep Rubyfruit open, bolstered by support from neighbors and patrons. The bar stayed open and Ms. Fierro, making no promises, braced for a bleak summer.Through July and August, her employees came to work not knowing whether Rubyfruit would be around for their next shift. In addition to Ms. Fierro, those employees included a few full-timers who oversaw the ranks of bartenders, servers and cooks — workers who mostly split their time between Rubyfruit and other tasks, among them D.J. gigs, tending other bars and artistic pursuits.The money crunch was nowhere more evident than in its effects on two of the bar’s most dedicated workers, who for the past two years have taken almost no pay.One is Annette Marino, 63, who lives with her cat in Chelsea and relies mainly on Social Security. “As long as I have money for cat food and cigarettes, I’m fine,” Ms. Marino said. “It stops me from doing some things I’d like to do. But you know, we’re here, the bar’s still open, and that’s what counts.”The other worker is a woman named Miriam, who lives in Clifton, N.J., and declined to give her last name because some friends and relatives do not know she is gay. She takes no salary at all.Not all of the employees, though, can afford to be on the no-payment plan; they include Antonio Corona, a 49-year-old Mexican.“Antonio gets paid,” Ms. Fierro said. “I have to make sure he gets paid.”When Ms. Fierro told Mr. Corona of the bar’s imminent closing, he said he would follow her wherever she went — to New Jersey, if it came to that.Mr. Corona was working at a Midtown restaurant during Rubyfruit’s early days. He speaks little English, but his brother-in-law helped get him a job at Rubyfruit as a dishwasher. “Look, they can’t pronounce your first name,” the brother-in-law advised. “Just tell them to call you Antonio.”More than a decade has passed since then, and during those years, Mr. Corona rose from a dishwasher to a cook. When Alexandra Fernandez, Ms. Fierro’s partner, learned one recent afternoon that Mr. Corona’s first name was, in fact, Cosme, she ran it past Ms. Fierro.“You want me to call him something else?”“It might not be comfortable at this point,” Ms. Fernandez admitted.After passing through Rubyfruit’s front door, a visitor can walk upstairs to the bar or downstairs to Rita Mae’s, the restaurant portion of the establishment. Wednesday nights found Rita Mae’s lively with song, customers and employees belting out show tunes and standards accompanied by a charmingly out-of-tune piano.But one night in August, as the music played, an inspector from the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene stopped in, and finding that the bar’s health department certificate had expired in June, imposed a $1,000 fine.Two days later, at 3:45, Ms. Fierro, Ms. Marino and Miriam climbed into Miriam’s car, and the three women, fearing the inspector’s return and additional fines, set about to renew the health department certificate. “We’ve got 45 minutes,” Ms. Marino announced.Usually, such trips are a pleasant ritual for the women, though they are also a reflection of Rubyfruit’s financial difficulties. Often, the women go to Western Beef, a supermarket on 16th Street, and load steaks and chicken into the trunk of the car. Or they make their way to Jetro, a warehouse in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, in the shadow of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, where swarms of mostly male restaurant owners push around orange metal carts stacked high with wholesale food items.On this day, though, the three women were headed downtown to the health department. At one point, frustrated by the Friday afternoon traffic, Ms. Fierro jumped out of the car, papers in hand, to make a run for it. But after running about 20 blocks, she changed her mind.“There was a lot of traffic on the sidewalk,” Ms. Fierro said, panting as she climbed back into the back seat. When the three women arrived at the building on John Street that houses offices for a number of city agencies, including the health department, Ms. Fierro sprinted again, to the elevator that would take her to the 11th floor.Ms. Fierro had arranged to meet Jimmy Baig, a former health department inspector who now works as a consultant helping business owners pay fines and deal with violations and license renewals. Mr. Baig was waiting near the health department window, looking at the clock. It was 4:30, closing time for the office.“Why did you wait till the last minute?” he asked. A minute later, after thinking it over, a female employee behind the glass reluctantly agreed to process the paperwork. Ms. Fierro grumbled a good-humored complaint about the fines. The clerk shrugged.“The city needs money,” she said.“They think they’re the only people who need money?” Mr. Baig countered.“In this climate, you’d think they’d let you pay it off little by little,” Ms. Fierro said to Mr. Baig. “But it’s so unforgiving.”Turning to face her, Mr. Baig said, “You’re lucky they didn’t close you.”September began as usual for Ms. Fierro, with worries about money tempered only by her chronic good cheer. Suddenly, though, her luck changed.Stacy Ledwith, a Rubyfruit D.J. and bartender with buzzed dark hair and a high, scratchy voice, arranged for Ms. Fierro to meet with a woman who Ms. Ledwith thought could help Rubyfruit. The woman, a wealthy financial consultant from Guyana who lives in Greenwich Village, was Annetta Budhu, and she had occasionally visited Rubyfruit over the years.“I happen to be a prominent gay woman,” Ms. Budhu said one day recently. “I said to myself, ‘I have the means to do something, and I’m going to save this.’ ”Within days, Ms. Budhu had agreed to join Ms. Fierro as a partner, laying out a plan, and the money, for Rubyfruit’s physical and philosophical transformation. “It’s going to be very Zen,” Ms. Budhu said, “a very upscale lesbian bar, a women’s lounge.”Ms. Fierro was hugely relieved. “This place was a sinking ship with so many holes that couldn’t be plugged up fast enough,” she said. “And then someone just threw a lifeboat. No, somebody drove by in a yacht.”The new version of the bar, to be called R.F. Lounge, would be fashionable in ways Rubyfruit was not, offering high tea, tapas, wireless Internet, fine wines and beer on tap. The bar closed for renovations in September and is scheduled to reopen in early December with a black-tie event.Although many in the restaurant business live hand to mouth and cannot go for long without a job, nearly all of Ms. Fierro’s employees have said they will return, and in the interim will either seek shifts elsewhere or take a vacation.On a Sunday evening, the night before Rubyfruit shut down for renovations, Ms. Fierro held a party. By early evening, the place was filled with young women dancing and kissing. It was a striking change from the usual mellowness and the spare, slightly older crowd the space usually accommodated. As music pulsed, Ms. Ledwith stood on the bar and poured orange-flavored vodka into the open mouths of young women who, with their necks craned and tilted in expectation, resembled a cluster of chic baby birds.An evening a month earlier, however — when the bar’s uncertain future did not warrant such celebration — perhaps gave a better sense of the old Rubyfruit, the one Ms. Fierro and her employees had worked so hard to save.A few women in their 50s sat at the bar and, after a drink, began to chat with one another. It was the final night of the Democratic National Convention, when Senator Barack Obama accepted his party’s nomination for president, and a large screen was rolled down from the ceiling. Because no employee was tall enough to turn on the ceiling-mounted projector, a large rainbow flag was retrieved from a corner office, and a worker jabbed the staff of the flag toward the ceiling in search of the “on” button.Patricia Avallone, a 60-year-old artist and former art teacher who moved to the neighborhood in 1979, was sitting at the far end of the bar. “I came to the Village for the artists, the poets, the cafes,” she said with faint melancholy.She wondered aloud if the city was changing, or if she was the one who had changed. She had heard of Rubyfruit’s financial difficulties, and yet the place endured, which was why she continued to come in, for a single drink, early in the evening, before going home.“As I got older,” she said, “everything was taken away, the sweet stuff. But this, it’s like a little chapel.”'"

"'08-10-13,'1','I'm not going to spend $700 billion dollars of your money just bailing out the Wall Street bankers and brokers who got us into this mess. I'm going to make sure we take care of the people who were devastated by the excesses of Wall Street and Washington. I'm going to spend a lot of that money to bring relief to you, and I'm not going to wait sixty days to start doing it.I have a plan to protect the value of your home and get it rising again by buying up bad mortgages and refinancing them so if your neighbor defaults he doesn't bring down the value of your house with him.I have a plan to let retirees and people nearing retirement keep their money in their retirement accounts longer so they can rebuild their savings.I have a plan to rebuild the retirement savings of every worker.I have a plan to hold the line on taxes and cut them to make America more competitive and create jobs here at home.Raising taxes makes a bad economy much worse. Keeping taxes low creates jobs, keeps money in your hands and strengthens our economy.The explosion of government spending over the last eight years has put us deeper in debt to foreign countries that don't have our best interests at heart. It weakened the dollar and made everything you buy more expensive.If I'm elected President, I won't spend nearly a trillion dollars more of your money, on top of the $700 billion we just gave the Treasury Secretary, as Senator Obama proposes. Because he can't do that without raising your taxes or digging us further into debt. I'm going to make government live on a budget just like you do.I will freeze government spending on all but the most important programs like defense, veterans care, Social Security and health care until we scrub every single government program and get rid of the ones that aren't working for the American people. And I will veto every single pork barrel bill Congresses passes.If I'm elected President, I won't fine small businesses and families with children, as Senator Obama proposes, to force them into a new huge government run health care program, while I keep the cost of the fine a secret until I hit you with it. I will bring down the skyrocketing cost of health care with competition and choice to lower your premiums, and make it more available to more Americans. I'll make sure you can keep the same health plan if you change jobs or leave a job to stay home.I will provide every single American family with a $5000 refundable tax credit to help them purchase insurance. Workers who already have health care insurance from their employers will keep it and have more money to cover costs. Workers who don't have health insurance can use it to find a policy anywhere in this country to meet their basic needs.If I'm elected President, I won't raise taxes on small businesses, as Senator Obama proposes, and force them to cut jobs. I will keep small business taxes where they are, help them keep their costs low, and let them spend their earnings to create more jobs.If I'm elected President, I won't make it harder to sell our goods overseas and kill more jobs as Senator Obama proposes. I will open new markets to goods made in America and make sure our trade is free and fair. And I'll make sure we help workers who've lost a job that won't come back find a new one that won't go away.The last President to raise taxes and restrict trade in a bad economy as Senator Obama proposes was Herbert Hoover. That didn't turn out too well. They say those who don't learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. Well, my friends, I know my history lessons, and I sure won't make the mistakes Senator Obama will.If I'm elected President, we're going to stop sending $700 billion to countries that don't like us very much. I won't argue to delay drilling for more oil and gas and building new nuclear power plants in America, as Senator Obama does. We will start new drilling now. We will invest in all energy alternatives -- nuclear, wind, solar, and tide. We will encourage the manufacture of hybrid, flex fuel and electric automobiles. We will invest in clean coal technology. We will lower the cost of energy within months, and we will create millions of new jobs.Let me give you the state of the race today. We have 22 days to go. We're 6 points down. The national media has written us off. Senator Obama is measuring the drapes, and planning with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid to raise taxes, increase spending, take away your right to vote by secret ballot in labor elections, and concede defeat in Iraq. But they forgot to let you decide. My friends, we've got them just where we want them.What America needs in this hour is a fighter; someone who puts all his cards on the table and trusts the judgment of the American people. I come from a long line of McCains who believed that to love America is to fight for her. I have fought for you most of my life. There are other ways to love this country, but I've never been the kind to do it from the sidelines.I know you're worried. America is a great country, but we are at a moment of national crisis that will determine our future. Will we continue to lead the world's economies or will we be overtaken? Will the world become safer or more dangerous? Will our military remain the strongest in the world? Will our children and grandchildren's future be brighter than ours?My answer to you is yes.

"'08-10-13,'1','Senator John McCain will get a chance to repair his relationship with David Letterman on the “Late Show” on Thursday. But once he sits down on that chair, he is going to have some explaining to do.Mr. McCain abruptly canceled his appearance on the CBS show on Sept. 24 after he decided to temporarily “suspend” his presidential campaign and travel to Washington amid Congressional talks on a $700 billion bailout of financial institutions. But Mr. McCain stayed in New York long enough to be interviewed on the “CBS Evening News” while Mr. Letterman’s show was being taped, prompting the comedian to say he felt like “an ugly date.”Since then, Mr. Letterman has kept the pressure on Mr. McCain, saying last Monday that the candidate’s problems “began when he bailed out on this show.” While tinged with humor, the televised complaints could not have helped Mr. McCain’s standing among Mr. Letterman’s nightly audience of almost four million people.Last Thursday, Mr. Letterman told his viewers that “in an attempt to save his campaign, they’re talking about coming back.” On Sunday, CBS announced that Mr. McCain had rescheduled his appearance for this Thursday, the day after the final presidential debate takes place at Hofstra University on Long Island.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','Instead, race has erupted as an issue mostly in ways that seem to confirm how deep the divide remains for some voters — those expressing mistrust over Mr. Obama’s ties to his controversial former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., or those describing Mr. Obama as “uppity” or “elitist.” While Mr. Obama’s advisers say they do not think race will be a factor in the election, the actual extent of the racial divide is likely to become clear only on Nov. 4.“Obama has been running as a post-racial candidate from the start, and he has been doing it very well,” said Douglas Brinkley, the presidential historian, “but the fact of the matter is that some voters — we can’t know yet how many — will not get past his race. And I very much believe that the McCain-Palin ticket is tapping into that.”On Saturday, Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat and civil rights leader, went as far as invoking George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama, to accuse Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, of fomenting racial hatred. For Mr. Lewis and many other Democrats, the recent heckling of Mr. Obama at Republican rallies — where he has been called Arab, Muslim, traitor, terrorist, friend of terrorists, Barack Hussein Obama — amounts to code words that reflect latent or overt racism inspired by the first presidential nomination of an African-American by a major party.Mr. Lewis’s remarks outraged some of Mr. McCain’s supporters and other Republicans. Race is indisputably a backdrop against which this campaign has unfolded, they agree, but that does not mean opposing Mr. Obama or using harsh words is racist.Put another way, simply because Mr. Obama is black does not mean that the expression “not one of us,” as he has been called at Republican rallies, is an appeal to the worst instincts of voters.“At first I was open to Obama because I thought we needed new thinking about jobs and the economy,” said Burton Reed, a Republican at the rally here. “But the more I heard about him, the more worried I became. He says he’s Christian, but I hear he’s Muslim. And he just doesn’t sound pro-U.S.A. I kind of question his devotion to this country.”One factor for Mr. Reed and several other Republicans and independents interviewed along the bus route on Sunday was Mr. Obama’s long association and friendship with Mr. Wright. Others said they simply had a hard time relating to Mr. Obama’s background or accepting his political positions, which are widely seen as liberal.“The bottom line is, he isn’t one of us, and I’m scared to death of him,” said Lloyd Wood, a Republican and farmer in this rural town in southeast Ohio who came to the local Wal-Mart on Sunday for a campaign visit by Ms. Palin, Mr. McCain’s running mate.“Guns, abortion, homosexuality, religion, protecting Israel, taxes,” Mr. Wood continued. “I feel like he is totally different from where I stand, and I worry what he would do to this country. And listen, I’ve voted for black Republicans before — voted for one for governor last time — but Obama is just this very privileged kind.”Other voters said that they were torn between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, and that the issue for them was the economy.“Obama seems creative and has a lot of good ideas, but McCain’s experience is very appealing,” said Matt Miller, a Republican who was at a farm stand in Marietta, Ohio, when Ms. Palin dropped by.Asked about race, Mr. Miller said: “I think the country is ready for a black president, but a lot of people around here may not be. I just hope that whoever we elect, we all have faith that the person will do the best he can.”Ms. Palin, who drew sharp criticism from Democrats last week for saying that Mr. Obama had a history of “palling around with terrorists,” refrained from personal attacks on Sunday and hammered Mr. Obama on issues like taxes and late-term abortion.At one point, Ms. Palin said “we know who the bad guys are,” and a man in the crowd here screamed “Obama!” It was unclear if Ms. Palin heard him; she did not address his remark.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','Mr. Salter, taking a little literary license, assembled from Mr. McCain’s recollections a neat narrative that he had never before articulated. It became a best seller, a television movie and the first of five successful McCain-Salter volumes. And on the eve of Mr. McCain’s 2000 Republican primary run, its story line reshaped his political identity. In interviews and speeches, Mr. McCain has increasingly described his life in the book’s language and themes, and never more so than during his current campaign, which has turned back to the story of “Faith of My Fathers” for everything from its first television commercial to his speech at the Republican convention.Politics was imitating art, said Stephen Wayne, a political scientist at Georgetown who has studied Mr. McCain’s career and memoir. “It is almost as if McCain had described himself as a literary character,” Professor Wayne said, “and then he tried to be that person in real life.”Some friends say it is only natural that Mr. McCain would begin to sound like his autobiography. “If I have some thoughts in my mind and I take the time to write them down,” said Orson Swindle, a close friend from prison camp, “I find that I will be inclined to say them exactly that way over and over, too.”Still, other friends say they marvel at how heavily the McCain campaign relies on the chastened-hero image created by “Faith of My Fathers,” for example, citing his prison experience to deflect questions on array of unwelcome questions about his campaign tactics, his personal wealth and his health insurance, among other matters.Robert Timberg, a marine wounded in Vietnam who became Mr. McCain’s biographer and admired his memoir, said the John McCain he knew 15 years ago would never have suggested that he was more patriotic than a rival the way the senator has in attacking his Democratic opponent, Senator Barack Obama.“Political campaigns have a way of distorting reality and turning political candidates into caricatures of themselves,” Mr. Timberg said, adding, “In some ways that has happened to him, and in some ways he may have contributed to that.”“People who say that kind of thing — I know a lot of reporters who have said it — don’t have the faintest concept or grasp of what motivates John McCain and his personal conception of honor,” Mr. Salter said. “He earned the right to tell that story.”Mr. McCain’s career as an author began not long after the 1995 publication of Mr. Timberg’s book, “The Nightingale’s Song,” which explored the legacy of Vietnam through the lives of the senator and four other graduates of the Naval Academy. It drew critical praise but moderate sales. Mr. Timberg’s literary agent, Philippa Brophy, saw a whole book in Mr. McCain alone.When she visited his office, however, Mr. McCain resisted. He had turned down plenty of other book offers, and he worried that the image of him as a prisoner could make him look weak, several advisers said. He preferred to rely on black humor in talking about the period — telling an anecdote about stealing a fellow prisoner’s wash rag, or falling out of a shower trying to catch a glimpse of a ponytailed Vietnamese laundress.Until then, Mr. McCain had always campaigned as an uncomplicated go-getter, full of energy and ideas. A former Navy liaison to the Senate, he presented himself as a well-connected insider with “experience in Washington,” in the words of his first 1982 campaign commercial, who could get things done for Arizona, his newly adopted home. He brought up his five years in Hanoi mainly to rebut criticisms that he was a carpetbagger (prison had made him appreciate the Arizona sunset, he said in the advertisement, smiling behind the wheel of a sports car).Mr. McCain told Ms. Brophy that the only book he wanted to write was a tribute to others, like John F. Kennedy’s “Profiles in Courage” — just what every senator says, she recalled thinking to herself.Whom might he profile? she said she asked, playing along. Mr. McCain started by naming his grandfather and father, both four-star admirals with storied careers.Conceiving of the project as a tribute to his family, Mr. McCain signed on, tapping Mr. Salter to help write it. Mr. Salter, now 53, had been writing speeches for Mr. McCain, 72, for nearly a decade. “Mark literally loves John McCain like a father,” Mr. Swindle said. “Like brothers,” Mr. McCain has said.An admirer of William Trevor, the often-bleak Irish author — a taste Mr. McCain has picked up — Mr. Salter is known among colleagues for his gloomy view of human nature and the world. Mr. McCain has a similar streak. “It’s always darkest before it’s totally black,” he often says, a motto borrowed from the “Peanuts” character Charlie Brown that he jokingly misattributes to Mao.The McCain-Salter collaboration imbued the memoir with its confessional, often foreboding tone, friends say. The combination “was like taking darkness and fatalism, then pulling down the shades and contemplating our dark fate,” said John Weaver, a friend and former adviser to Mr. McCain.Mr. McCain grew up in a family full of aspiring writers, where “people talked about characters in books as though they were real people,” said Elizabeth Spencer, a novelist and a second cousin of Mr. McCain’s who spent much of World War II with him as a child at the family’s Mississippi plantation.A beloved uncle, Bert Andrews, won a Pulitzer Prize as a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune in 1948. The senator’s grandfather, the first Adm. John S. McCain, had left behind a drawer full of unpublished fiction, including adventure stories under the pseudonym Casper Clubfoot. And the senator’s father, Adm. John S. McCain Jr., loved to recite martial poems to his sons, especially “Ave Imperatrix,” Oscar Wilde’s eulogy for the waning British Empire.As a student, Mr. McCain was always more enthusiastic about reading and writing than science or math. At the Naval Academy and then in flight school, he almost flunked out because of his indifference to technical subjects like fluid dynamics, Mr. Swindle said. “He would rather be reading ‘The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.’ ”Sitting down with Mr. Salter for more than 50 hours of recorded interviews that furnished the memoir’s raw material — many episodes were set in print almost as Mr. McCain described them, Mr. Salter said — the senator often brought up the stories and characters that influenced him and they in turn infused the book. “When he tells his story,” Mr. Salter said, “they come through.”The John McCain of “Faith of My Fathers,” for example, bears more than a little resemblance to the fictional Robert Jordan of “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” the Hemingway hero Mr. McCain later celebrated in another book with Mr. Salter, “Worth the Fighting For,” which was named for a line of Jordan’s dying thoughts. He was “a man who would risk his life but never his honor,” Mr. McCain wrote with Mr. Salter, a model of “how a great man should style himself.”Each book is heavy with premonitions of mortality. Robert Jordan and John McCain each confront great tests (the temptation to escape a doomed mission for one, the offer of early prison release for the other) in the service of a lost cause (the socialists in the Spanish Civil War, the Americans in Vietnam). And in accepting his fate, each makes peace with his father and grandfather.Mr. McCain’s admirers, like Mr. Timberg, have often puzzled over what drew him to Maugham’s “Of Human Bondage.” It is a convoluted psychodrama about a young man with a club foot; he seethes with resentment over his disability and nearly ruins his life in the thrall of a waitress-turned-prostitute who rejects him. But the character’s final realization could fit almost as well near the conclusion of Mr. McCain’s memoir: “It might be that to surrender to happiness was to accept defeat, but it was a defeat better than many victories.”“That explains it,” Mr. Salter said when he heard the line. “Perfect McCainism.”The appeal of the young Marlon Brando, whose career was at its height during the senator’s adolescence in the 1950s, is easier to see. Both he and Mr. McCain were short (about 5-foot-9) tough guys with volatile tempers and surprisingly soft voices. (Friends say Mr. McCain likes to imitate Brando erupting in rage: “You scum-sucking pig!”)Brando would have been well cast as the young John McCain of “Faith of My Fathers” — a thin-skinned troublemaker with an authority problem and a righteous streak.Mr. McCain has often described the Brando film “Viva Zapata!” as the “greatest movie of all time.” It is the tale of a mercurial Mexican revolutionary who forms a new government, then fights against it. “I loved so much the idea of one man on a white horse, fighting for justice,” Mr. McCain wrote. “That was the essential truth of his life: he was a man who fought.”Like “Faith of My Fathers,” Mr. McCain’s other Brando favorite, the Western “One-Eyed Jacks,” is a father-son story of sorts. Brando played an outlaw known as Kid who kills a former accomplice-turned-sheriff named Dad and runs off with his stepdaughter.To Mr. Salter, Mr. McCain opened up about his feelings for his father — discomfort at his binge drinking, resentment of the presumption that the son would follow his father to the Naval Academy, and the unexpected emotions he experienced in midlife when his fame had at last exceeded his father’s.“It is a wonderful narrative, spiced with psychological insights,” said Stanley Renshon, a psychoanalyst and political scientist at the City University of New York who has written about Mr. McCain and his book. “Almost like McCain’s version of psychoanalysis.”But Mr. McCain was still reticent about his experience in Hanoi. “He kind of shorted me on the prison stuff,” Mr. Salter said.To fill in the details, Mr. Salter consulted the McCain family, Navy archives and fellow former P.O.W.’s. “I would say 50 to 60 percent of it was from McCain,” Mr. Salter said.Mr. Salter said he found a summary of what became the arc of the story in a quote tucked deep inside Mr. Timberg’s book, from a Senate aide and Korean War veteran who admired Mr. McCain. “I knew 200 John McCains,” said the aide, William Bader. “They’re vaguely paunchy, overgrown boys. If John McCain had not had this Vietnamese experience, of prison, of solitude, of brutality, he would have just been one more Navy jock.”Retelling his captivity as a coming-of-age tale was partly a literary device, Mr. Salter acknowledged. By the time Mr. McCain, a Navy pilot, was shot down at age 31, he had already outgrown his extended adolescence, married and become a father, and gotten serious about his Navy career, he told Mr. Salter.Still, Mr. McCain also said more vaguely that he had matured in prison, that he had learned to see that life was about more than his career and his reputation, Mr. Salter said. As Mr. McCain had put it in his first television commercial, “I have certainly become a better and enriched person for having had that experience, in a myriad of ways.”In the memoir, Mr. Salter helped sharpen that point into what became the new refrain of his boss’s political ascent. Mr. McCain had thought “all glory was self-glory,” but prison taught him “there are greater pursuits than self-seeking,” Mr. Salter wrote for the senator. “Glory belongs to the act of being constant to something greater than yourself, to a cause, to your principles.”In the United States Naval Institute archives, Mr. Salter found an oral history in which the senator’s father recounted his last meeting with his own father, on an American ship in Tokyo Bay at the end of World War II.“Son,” the first Admiral McCain had told the second, “there is no greater thing than to die for the principles — for the country and the principles that you believe in.”Senator McCain might have heard the sentiment, but he had never seen the quotation. “He was pretty fascinated,” Mr. Salter said.To tie together the three generations of Mr. McCain’s family memoir, Mr. Salter put the grandfather’s words into the mind of the young John McCain as he was returning home from Vietnam on the last page of “Faith of My Fathers”: “Down through the years, I had remembered a dying man’s legacy to his son,” Mr. Salter wrote in Mr. McCain’s voice, “and when I needed it most, I had found my freedom abiding in it.”Critics praised the book as a much more gripping tale than the usual Washington fare. Some who knew the senator and Mr. Salter, though, rolled their eyes at the heavy emotion and tidy moral. “I thought, ‘Oh guys, come on!’ ” recalled Victoria Clarke, Mr. McCain’s friend and former press secretary. “In his early years,” Ms. Clarke said, “he tried so hard to make sure people didn’t see him as a P.O.W.”But when 1,200 people crammed into a church near Kansas City for a book signing on a September night in 1999, Mr. McCain’s campaign managers realized they had found a potent new tool. They quickly expanded a two-week book tour into a major part of Mr. McCain’s 2000 Republican primary campaign. “Faith of My Fathers” sold more than 500,000 copies, easily exceeding the $500,000 advance. (Mr. McCain gave half the proceeds from his books to Mr. Salter, with the other half going to charity.)When it came time to write Mr. McCain’s speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination this summer, Mr. Salter said, it was only natural to return to “Faith of My Fathers.” “To remind people who he is,” Mr. Salter said. “ ‘Here is who I am, here is why you can believe me.’ ”Mr. McCain owes much to the book, said Mr. Weaver, who guided the senator’s 2000 campaign. “It made his persona much grander, much more cause-oriented,” Mr. Weaver recalled. “The book played a major role in creating the brand that has served McCain so well.”'"
"'08-10-13,'1','“The same mechanisms that led to the crisis in the United States were operating here,” said Arnoud Boot, a professor of finance and banking at the University of Amsterdam. “It’s totally misplaced for European leaders to put the blame on the Americans.”While the deposit guarantees and capital injections deployed in Britain and Ireland and across the Continent from France and Belgium all the way to Greece might allay the immediate panic, these steps will not necessarily free up credit for European businesses already hard hit by the global economic slowdown.In fact, an ocean of short-term debt issued by European banks is set to come due over the next two quarters, with $375 billion maturing in the fourth quarter of 2008 and another $339 billion needing to be refinanced in the first quarter of 2009.“If the banks do not manage to roll over this debt, we may witness balance sheet contraction with major negative implications for the real economy or more bank failures,” said Vasco Moreno, who tracks European banks for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a research firm specializing in financial institutions.The American subprime loan crisis may have been the trigger, Mr. Boot said, but dangers like too much leverage, too little oversight and an executive-bonus culture that encouraged risk-taking had been building for years in Europe, just as in the United States.By some measures, in fact, European banks exposed themselves to even higher levels of debt than American banks did. And the after-effects are likely to be felt for years, potentially reducing European demand for American exports, a rare bright spot for domestic companies until recently.European institutions do not directly face the kind of bad mortgages that brought down Wachovia and Washington Mutual, because local lending standards here never fell as far as they did in the United States. But their own heavy borrowing has made European banks vulnerable now that easy credit is a thing of the past and plunging stock prices make it harder to raise money.“The market is really efficient in identifying the weakest players in the industry here in Europe,” said Christophe Ricetti, a banking analyst with Natixis.A glaring example is Hypo Real Estate, Germany’s second largest commercial real estate lender, whose loans exceeded its deposit base by more than eight times.Less than 24 hours after Mr. Berlusconi and Mr. Brown blamed the United States about a week ago for the crisis and offered assurances about Europe’s relative stability, Hypo’s near collapse forced Germany to hastily guarantee all consumer deposits and mount a $67 billion rescue effort to save the stricken bank.Several days later, British authorities would unveil a $255 billion plan to shore up its own shaky banking system.Other banks that overreached include the Royal Bank of Scotland and Fortis, a Dutch-Belgian lender, which last year took on huge debt to finance a $100 billion takeover of rival ABN Amro — a deal that had the bad timing to coincide with the market’s peak.Late Sunday night, the British government appeared poised to take a majority ownership stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland, while Fortis has already been taken over and broken up by the Dutch and Belgian governments.“The high leverage could have been sustainable if the risks were kept under better control,” Mr. Boot said, “but clearly, supervision was insufficient.”In Ireland, loans at the biggest banks also far outpaced deposits. That led the Irish government to issue a blanket guarantee on private savings accounts on Sept. 30, a move that set off criticism by other European governments — until they found themselves forced to follow suit.Despite having to take drastic action close to home, in recent days European leaders have continued to focus on the American role in the global economic debacle, especially the decision last month by Federal Reserve and Treasury Department officials to let Lehman Brothers collapse.“For the equilibrium of the world financial system, this was a genuine error,” Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, said last week.And on Sunday, after a conference of European leaders at the Élysée Palace here aimed at easing the panic, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France returned to this theme.“This crisis was not born in Europe,” Mr. Sarkozy said. “This crisis was born in America. It is now a global crisis.”But according to one commonly used yardstick to measure borrowing — the ratio of assets to equity — European banks employed more than twice as much leverage as their American counterparts, Mr. Moreno, the analyst, said.“The banks have a large amount of debt to roll over until the end of 2009,” he said.To be sure, not all European institutions indulged in risky borrowing and lending, Richard Portes, professor of economics at London Business School, said. Despite a rapidly deflating housing bubble in Ireland, Spain and Britain, the French bank BNP Paribas, Santander of Spain and Britain’s HSBC have emerged largely unscathed, he noted.Even as excessive debt emerges as the most pressing concern, the decision by other European institutions to wade into the market for complicated, mortgage-backed American securities and other derivatives overhangs the system.UBS, the Swiss giant, for example, bought tens of billions of dollars in American subprime debt in a bid for higher yields, only to find out too late that it was toxic, generating huge losses at UBS over the last year.And after Fortis was divided up earlier this month, with the Dutch government nationalizing local operations, and Belgian authorities selling most of the remainder to BNP Paribas, experts found that it owned more than 10 billion euros worth of toxic, illiquid securities.As part of the deal worked out by Belgian authorities, those mostly American asset-backed securities have been placed in a separate “ring-fenced” entity, meant to quarantine them from more valuable holdings. As part of the deal, Belgian taxpayers got stuck with nearly a quarter of this hard-to-sell portfolio.At Dexia, a French-Belgian lender to municipalities that was saved by a government-led $9.2 billion capital injection in September, the difficulties can also be traced to a similar mix of hazardous American securities and European mishandling of them.In 2000, Dexia entered the fast-growing market for municipal bond insurance in the United States, acquiring Financial Security Assurance. To lift profits, the unit relied on credit default swaps and other now beaten-down derivatives, ultimately draining Dexia’s capital and forcing the recent government intervention.“Using credit-default swaps was cheaper, but it was opaque and the board of Dexia couldn’t follow all that,” said one government official who was involved in the rescue. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal matters.Officials from Dexia and Fortis declined to comment.Even worse, added this official, oversight of Dexia was split between Paris and Brussels. French regulators oversaw the unit of the company that included Financial Security Assurance, while Belgian authorities were responsible for monitoring the entire company.“Nobody understood it,” the government official said.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','Many of the financial support measures rushed through by American and European leaders recently have been aimed at restoring that lost faith. But while it is not at all clear that a return to normal lending between banks would restore credit availability to companies that are finding it difficult to borrow, it is hard to imagine that happening unless the interbank market starts functioning smoothly again.Denmark sought to overcome this problem last week by guaranteeing all loans between banks, an unprecedented initiative that its parliament approved Sunday, the same day other European countries promised to do something similar.The United States has so far not embraced such guarantees, which would go well beyond previous practices and draw the government yet more rapidly into the financial crisis.Instead, to help companies more directly, it has agreed to make loans to businesses that can no longer borrow in the commercial paper market, and Congress has approved a $700 billion bailout fund that will be used to purchase bank assets and to buy stock in financial institutions. It has also raised the level of deposit insurance in banks to $250,000 per depositor from $100,000.And while a growing chorus of voices is urging the government to consider guaranteeing interbank lending, there is concern that such a move would risk putting taxpayers on the hook for far more if a failing bank borrowed heavily in that market to offset falling deposits.Seeking to assure investors that the financial systems would return to normal, the finance ministers of the Group of 7, the major industrial countries, announced a set of five general principles on Friday night. Bankers immediately complained that they needed more information and remained reluctant to lend until politicians were clearer on how the rescue plans would work.“These are the right principles,” said Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank. “It needs much more specific details.”The European announcement on Sunday, made after a summit meeting in Paris, did not include a Europe-wide fund, which some governments have resisted out of fear they would have to bail out banks in other countries.That left it possible that some banks would get a competitive advantage from having guarantees from a government that was thought to be better able to meet its new obligations if a major bank were to fail.“Once this has sunk in, people are going to think about the consolidated balance sheets of governments,” said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and now a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.“Some of these banks have $2 trillion to $3 trillion balance sheets, which is huge compared to the capacity” of such governments as Britain and Germany, he said.Mr. Johnson said he thought the United States might have to follow if Europe came up with effective guarantees.Without a uniform international standard for such guarantees, Mr. Ackerman warned that cash would flow from unprotected banking systems to protected ones, what is known as “regulatory arbitrage.”That could also happen within the United States if loans between commercial banks were guaranteed but loans to savings associations, brokerage firms and insurance companies were not.Behind that lurks another risk: Some bankers said that they dared not resume normal lending in the interbank market, in part because investors might think that banks making loans to weaker institutions were taking on too much risk. One promise from the finance ministers was to “support systemically important financial institutions and prevent their failure.”On Friday, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, refused to say whether Goldman Sachs, the firm he used to run, or Morgan Stanley, whose share price has collapsed, qualified as such an institution. But by Sunday the government appeared ready to provide some sort of support for that company.Part of the weekend was devoted to promises that this would never happen again, with bankers saying they had strengthened their risk management systems and expected new regulatory arrangements to be made.Richard Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said the Fed had moved quickly to stem the crisis and would do more as needed. But he was silent on what role, if any, the Fed had played in bringing on the crisis.There were plenty of “I told you so’s,” with two of the most poignant ones coming from Jacob A. Frenkel and William R. Rhodes.Each of them, well-known economists active in international forums, had warned about the risks of a financial system growing more and more leveraged, with house prices rising to unsustainable levels.“We were ignored,” Mr. Rhodes said in a speech to the Institute of International Finance, a group of the major financial institutions, of which he is a vice chairman.Among those who evidently disregarded the warnings were their employers. Mr. Frenkel, formerly the governor of the Central Bank of Israel, is vice chairman of American International Group. Mr. Rhodes is a senior vice chairman of Citigroup.In a speech to the institute, Mr. Frenkel complained that the new G-7 principles left many important questions unanswered.“How?” he inquired after reading the finance ministers’ promise to “unfreeze credit and money markets.”“What about the ones that are not?” he asked after reading the promise to keep “systemically important” institutions from failing.Monday is a partial holiday in the United States, with the stock market open but some banks celebrating Columbus Day. That could delay until Tuesday the development of clear evidence of whether the banks are still afraid to lend to each other — and of whether the credit crisis will continue to worsen.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','WASHINGTON — Despite signals that Senator John McCain would have new prescriptions for the economic crisis after a weekend of meetings, his campaign said Sunday that Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, would not have any more proposals this week unless developments call for some.The signs of internal confusion came as the campaign was under pressure from state party leaders to sharpen his message on the economy and at least blunt the advantage that Democrats traditionally have on the issue in hard times. Republicans have grown fretful as Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, has edged ahead in polls three weeks before the election, while Mr. McCain has veered between ill-received economic plans and attacks on Mr. Obama’s character.Mr. McCain took a break Sunday from filming campaign advertisements and practicing for a final debate with Mr. Obama on Wednesday to cheer volunteers at a phone bank near his Northern Virginia headquarters. Mr. McCain told them he planned to “whip his you-know-what in this debate.” The group erupted with laughter and applause.On Saturday, his advisers were considering a range of economic ideas, one indicated. On Sunday, on the CBS News program “Face the Nation,” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a confidant of Mr. McCain, confirmed a report on Politico.com that Mr. McCain was weighing proposals to cut taxes on investors’ capital gains and dividends. “It will be a very comprehensive approach to jump-start the economy,” Mr. Graham said, “by allowing capital to be formed easier in America by lowering taxes.”But McCain advisers later said they did not know why Mr. Graham said that. One noted that Mr. McCain’s economic plan already would cut capital gains and dividend tax rates, by extending President Bush’s 2003 tax cuts. At the phone bank, Mr. McCain declined to answer a question from a reporter about what he was considering.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','This is the third major investment in media undertaken by Abu Dhabi recently. Another arm of the government, the Abu Dhabi Media Company, last year agreed to a $1 billion deal to make video games and movies with Warner Brothers, the Hollywood studio owned by Time Warner. More recently, the company announced it would spend $1 billion to start a film financing offshoot that will invest in Hollywood-style movies for English-speaking audiences.For CNN the move amounts to a significant investment in the region — a big step beyond its announcement last year that it would expand its international news gathering and add a correspondent in Abu Dhabi. CNN plans to move close to 30 staff members to the city and begin broadcasting a daily prime-time news show from Abu Dhabi on CNN International. Abu Dhabi becomes the fourth international outpost for CNN in which it can produce studio broadcasts, the others being London, Hong Kong and Mexico City.“News organizations, for a variety of reasons, have been cutting back,” said Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide. “We think it’s critical to invest. This is a pretty sizable investment for us.”HarperCollins, the book publishing division of the News Corporation, is establishing a presence in Abu Dhabi to capitalize on what the company says is growth in the sale of English-language books in the Middle East. Erin Crum, a spokeswoman for HarperCollins, said the book publisher signed on to “explore the potential of the area and forge relationships.”With credit markets tight, the Middle East could become an increasingly important source of funds for Hollywood. Last week, as tumult continued on Wall Street, the Abu Dhabi government held its second annual Circle Conference, a gathering of investors, movie executives and producers in which the Fox Filmed Entertainment chairman, Jim Gianopulos, gave the keynote speech. That conference was followed by the Middle East International Film Festival, hosted by Abu Dhabi.Michael Young, provost for the New York Film Academy, which opened a campus in Abu Dhabi in February, said, “I can’t think of a place where there’s more enthusiasm for film and film education.”Nor, perhaps, a place where there is more money to be spent by the government in creating an environment for the arts. In addition to the $2 billion the country has committed to Hollywood through the Abu Dhabi Media Company, the country has lured the Louvre and Guggenheim museums to establish outposts there, and established The National, an English-language broadsheet newspaper in Abu Dhabi.All of this raises questions of whether the government, which is building the state-of-the-art facility, would exert control of the media — an idea antithetical to traditions in the United States and Western Europe. “Creatively, I have not seen any kinds of limitations,” Mr. Young said.Mr. Walton said CNN was paying for its space. “We’re very mindful of protecting the CNN brand,” he said. “We can’t have anyone influence our editorial.”Mr. Borg, who runs the media center’s day-to-day operations, said the government offered space “at negotiable rates.”Monique Villa, the chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, which will use its space to teach journalism skills to participants from around the region, said she was not worried about the country’s lack of press freedoms. Last month, journalists there held the first U.A.E. Press Freedom Day, seeking more openness from the government and more access to information.“What we would expect is that we would be able to train them like we have in other parts of the world,” she said.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','Once again this year, opponents of women’s reproductive rights have managed to get initiatives aimed at ending or limiting rights on ballots — in , and . These measures, which violate women’s privacy and threaten their health, have implications far beyond those states. If voters approve them, they will become a weapon in the right-wing campaign to overturn Roe v Wade.The South Dakota initiative is a near twin of the sweeping abortion ban handily rejected by South Dakota voters just two years ago. To make the ban seem less harsh, its backers have included language purporting to make exceptions for incest, or the life and health of the mother. But no one should be fooled. The exceptions were drafted to make it nearly impossible to get an abortion, even during the first trimester of .The measure is clearly unconstitutional under existing rulings, and that’s just the point. The underlying agenda is to provide a vehicle for challenging Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion.The Colorado ballot proposal attacks Roe v. Wade by a different route. Known as Amendment 48, this preposterous measure would redefine the term “person” in the state’s Constitution to include fertilized human eggs — in effect bestowing on fertilized eggs, prior to implantation in the womb and pregnancy, the same legal rights and protections that apply to people once they are born.The amendment, which has split anti-abortion groups, carries broad implications, ranging from harmful to downright ridiculous. Potentially, it could ban widely used forms of , curtail medical research involving embryos, criminalize necessary medical care and shutter fertility clinics. A damaged fertilized egg might be eligible for monetary damages.Noting the “legal nightmare” the amendment would create, and its potential to endanger the health of women, Gov. Bill Ritter, a self-described “pro-life” Democrat, has joined the opposition to Amendment 48.In California, meanwhile, abortion opponents have put the issue of parental notification on the ballot for the third time in four years. The proponents of Proposition 4 say mandating notification is necessary to safeguard underage girls. But most 15-year-olds who find themselves pregnant instinctively turn to a parent for support and guidance. Far from protecting vulnerable teens, Proposition 4 would make it difficult for young women caught in abusive situations to obtain an abortion without notifying their parents, even in cases where the father or stepfather is responsible for the pregnancy.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','In the latest Gallup tracking poll, Mr. Obama leads Mr. McCain 50 percent to 43 percent among registered voters. Mr. McCain’s deficit in that survey has remained seven percentage points or more for most of the last two weeks.Since Gallup began presidential polling in 1936, only one candidate has overcome a deficit that large, and this late, to win the White House: Ronald Reagan, who trailed President Jimmy Carter 47 percent to 39 percent in a survey completed on Oct. 26, 1980.Yet Mr. Carter, like Mr. McCain today, represented the party holding the White House in bad times. After Mr. Reagan successfully presented himself as an alternative to Mr. Carter in their lone debate, held on the late date of Oct. 28, he surged ahead. After two debates, Mr. Obama holds a lead that is approaching Mr. Reagan’s eventual margin of victory.In 1968, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey all but erased a 12-point early-October deficit before losing narrowly to Richard M. Nixon. In 2000, Vice President Al Gore wiped out a seven-point deficit in the final 10 days of the election, winning the popular vote but losing the Electoral College to Mr. Bush.But since polling began, the pattern is that swings in opinion get smaller as Election Day approaches and voters gather more information. As American politics have grown more polarized, the opportunity for large swings has become smaller still.Four years ago, Senator John Kerry trailed Mr. Bush slightly in the homestretch. A near-even split on Election Day among the few remaining undecided voters sealed Mr. Kerry’s defeat.“There appears to be more flex in the current electorate than in 2004, but less than in 2000,” said Richard Johnston, research director of the National Annenberg Election Survey, at the University of Pennsylvania.Mr. McCain’s strategists acknowledge that for a realistic chance to win the election through battleground states, Mr. McCain must reduce Mr. Obama’s advantage in the national popular vote to no more than three or four percentage points. In 2000, Mr. Bush finished less than one percentage point behind Mr. Gore in the popular vote.Since 1948, front-running candidates have typically preserved three-fourths of their October leads, said Larry M. Bartels, a political scientist at Princeton. Applying statistical theory to current polls, he pegged Mr. Obama’s chance of winning the popular vote at “a little over 90 percent.”Mr. Bartels noted three factors that might skew the results. Two of them, a potential surge in voter turnout and the tendency of undecided voters to punish the party holding the White House during an economic downturn, appear to favor Mr. Obama. The third, racial resistance among white voters, favors Mr. McCain.Ahead in once-reliably red states like Colorado, Florida, Ohio and Virginia, Mr. Obama need not win any new voters. If he holds his 50 percent share in Gallup’s survey, and third-party candidates like Bob Barr and Ralph Nader draw 3 percent collectively, Mr. McCain can pull no closer than 47 percent.The McCain campaign sees scant opportunity to erode Mr. Obama’s strong support among blacks and his two-to-one edge among Hispanics. But Mr. McCain’s strategists think that one in five white voters — roughly 15 percent of the electorate — remains open to persuasion.The campaign says that those voters tend to be younger, single, less educated and female, and that they also include senior citizens distressed over sagging investments. Those voters are the target audience for Mr. McCain’s recent attacks on Mr. Obama’s ties to William Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground.If one-third of those voters shift allegiance from Mr. Obama to Mr. McCain, they will produce a 10-percentage-point swing, wiping out Mr. Obama’s lead. Mr. Obama’s strategists say voter preferences have hardened enough to make that difficult.Mr. McCain’s assessment of whether it is possible may influence his campaign’s efforts to assail Mr. Obama’s character. Facing heavy criticism, Mr. McCain late last week turned ambivalent.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','In the Democratic primary in April, Mrs. Clinton trounced Senator Barack Obama 74 to 26 percent in Lackawanna County, which includes Scranton. Mr. Obama has deployed Mr. Biden here and in other white working-class enclaves to try to win those voters who preferred Mrs. Clinton by such huge margins.Mr. Clinton, in brief remarks at the beginning of the program, spoke as much about his wife as about the Obama-Biden ticket. People close to Mr. Clinton say he remains bitter about suggestions by Mr. Obama’s supporters that he incited racial animosity during the primaries in support of his wife’s candidacy.Mr. Obama has been sparing in his use of the former president as a campaign surrogate, although Mr. Clinton left Scranton immediately after speaking to campaign for Mr. Obama in Virginia, a state, Mr. Clinton noted, that had not gone Democratic in a presidential contest for 40 years.Mr. Clinton said Mrs. Clinton had already made 50 appearances on behalf of Mr. Obama. “She has not only done more to support him than any runner-up in the Democratic primary process in my lifetime,” he said, “she has done more than all the other runners-up combined.”He spoke warmly of Mr. Biden, whom he has known for more than two decades. He said the choice of vice president was more crucial this year than in the past because the next president would be consumed by the global financial emergency.“I hope you know that the next vice president for the first two years will be relatively more important in the larger world than has ever been the case because the president is going to have to close the door to the Oval Office and get this country out of the ditch,” Mr. Clinton said.In her remarks, Mrs. Clinton offered an updated version of an applause line from her own campaign, saying: “It took a Democratic president to clean up after the last President Bush. It’s going to take a Democratic president to clean up after this President Bush.” (In the primaries, it was “It took a Clinton ...”)She then added a new coda: “We’ve done it before, and we’ll do it again. America will once again rise from the ashes of the Bushes.”Mr. Biden barely mentioned his Republican vice-presidential rival, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska. But he did say that in their televised debate 10 days ago Ms. Palin said she was not certain that global warming was caused by human activity.“How in the hell — heck — are you going to change it,” Mr. Biden said, “unless you know what caused it?”The Democratic ticket is leading in Pennsylvania, according to recent polls, although the McCain campaign is devoting a significant effort to trying to narrow the gap.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','Still, the Russian stock market declines seem to be signaling investors’ pessimism over the future of the economy and the government’s stewardship of it. Even as Russia has experienced strong growth in recent years, driven by oil and gas revenue, it has not achieved gains in diversifying its economy. Nor has it had significant success in modernizing decrepit roadways, power grids and housing.Russia’s invasion of neighboring Georgia, the perception that the Kremlin has meddled in the affairs of large companies and pervasive corruption have deepened investor concern. These issues may help explain why Russia’s stock market has declined more than those in other emerging economies like Brazil’s.Russia has run budget surpluses in recent years, putting $190 billion in contingency funds. The fear seems to be that this money will provide only a short-term cushion.“The market drop has revealed one of the basic flaws in the Russian economy,” said Christopher Weafer, chief strategist at Uralsib Bank in Moscow. “Over the last eight years, they have gotten $1.3 trillion in oil and gas revenues, but that money has not been able to bring up the country’s infrastructure. The bureaucracy and red tape and corruption are all lagging. This is a big problem for the market.”Moreover, while average Russians have so far been insulated from the anxiety of Americans who have watched their retirement plans shrivel, they could begin feeling pain soon. Major Russian companies — including Gazprom, the gas monopoly, and others controlled by the government — have lost large chunks of value, which could force them to cut employment and spending.Another danger is the drop in the price of oil, gas, metals and other natural resources, which form the base for Russia’s economy. If the financial crisis causes a sustained recession in the West, depressing demand for these commodities, government and industry in Russia could suffer a sharp decline in revenue.The price of oil closed at $78 a barrel on Friday, only slightly above the level that the Kremlin has factored to maintain its current spending. If prices go much lower, the federal budget will run a deficit, officials said.“It will take some time to be felt on Main Street in Russia,” said Edward Parker, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, the bond rating firm. “We are seeing the failure of some companies and banks. We will see an increase in unemployment and gradually see a reduction in wages. With falling oil prices, Russia’s terms of trade are now moving against it. It will take some time, but it certainly will be felt.”It is already being felt by Russia’s oligarchs, the Kremlin allies who control large portions of the economy. One of Russia’s richest men, the metals tycoon Oleg V. Deripaska, said to be worth more than $20 billion before the crisis, has absorbed such steep losses that his associates have been obliged to give assurances that he is not sinking under debt.The Kremlin has announced several plans to support the economy using its reserves, and last week, Mr. Putin, the former president and current prime minister, tried to project an image of calm, if not nonchalance. A judo expert, he released an instructional judo DVD in which he stars, and he was later shown on Russian television receiving a tiger cub for his 56th birthday.He also seemed to take satisfaction in the economic distress in the United States.“You are right in that confidence in the United States as leader of the free world and the free market, the trust in Wall Street as the center of this confidence, has been undermined — for good, I think,” he told members of Parliament from the Communist Party.Mr. Putin and his protégé, President Dmitri A. Medvedev, remain popular, in part because the stock market plunge has not yet touched most of the population. In 1998, when the government defaulted on its debt and devalued the ruble during the last major economic crisis here, things were far different, as many Russians lost their life savings.The Kremlin’s popularity has also risen because of Russia’s victory in the conflict in Georgia in August. Yet analysts said that over time, if the current crisis spreads and economic growth turns anemic, Mr. Putin’s leadership could be called into question.“The Russian population had gotten used to the fact that life was getting better, perhaps not as quickly as Russians thought they deserved, but getting better,” said Boris Makarenko of the Center for Political Technologies, a nonpartisan consulting group in Moscow.“All that was the foundation for a very positive attitude of Russians toward the Kremlin, and optimistic behavior in general,” he said. “The long-term effects will erode this support somewhat. But it is not like in the United States, where the financial crisis reinvented the presidential campaign.”Even so, the Kremlin seems to be trying to forestall a public backlash by curbing news of the Russian stock market on the television networks.One morning last week, regulators, worried about another plunge, closed the market. On the main television news at noon, the anchor described “a new drop in world stock markets,” discussing declines in Japan and Europe that he called a reaction to losses the day before in New York.Only at the end of the segment did the anchor mention in passing that the Russian market was not even open, without saying why.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','“What should I do about the crisis?” Anyone who follows finance has been asked that question a lot lately by friends and relatives. It’s hard to answer, but not because there’s nothing to be done. As yet, there’s just not much of a crisis for them to do anything about. Things will get worse — but probably not horrendously so.True, financial woes are severe. Adjusted for inflation, the S.& P. 500 index of domestic stocks has fallen by 45 percent from its 2007 high. That’s not far from the 55 percent inflation-adjusted tumble from 1972 to 1974, itself the worst drop since the Great Depression. Money markets — central to the daily operation of the financial system — are virtually frozen. And the list of storied financial firms that have failed or been forced into mergers keeps getting longer.For those employed in finance, these are truly dark times. Optimists think the industry head count will shrink by 20 percent. Pay this year and next will be down by much more. Financiers are also rapidly becoming social lepers.But back in the nonfinance world, which represents about 90 percent of the United States population, it doesn’t look nearly so bad. To begin with, in comparison to real human calamities — natural disasters, epidemics and wars — messed-up markets aren’t a big deal. But even in pure economic terms, the disruption is still relatively minor.Sure, the domestic unemployment rate is up to 6.1 percent, from 4.4 percent in 2007, and set to rise further. But it’s unlikely to hit the 1982 postwar peak of 11 percent, let alone the 25 percent or higher that occurred in the 1930s.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','Alan Greenspan’s name has come up dozens of times on MSNBC in the last month, but never during the 1 p.m. hour. That’s the hour anchored by Andrea Mitchell, who is married to Mr. Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve.For years Ms. Mitchell, the veteran NBC News correspondent who specializes in foreign affairs and politics, has carefully kept her potential conflict of interest in check. But in the last month, as the weakness of the nation’s economy has dominated cable news and the campaign trail, Ms. Mitchell has faced the kind of ethical quandary that energizes the staff of the Columbia Journalism Review.The Review raised questions about Ms. Mitchell’s status in an Internet article in late September. The writer, Megan Garber, observed that Mr. Greenspan is inextricably linked to the fate of the financial markets and wondered whether the MSNBC and NBC viewers “are best served by an anchor and reporter who is, in so many ways, so close to the story she’s covering.”Steve Capus, the president of NBC News, called the article “overly simplistic.” The news division has allowed Ms. Mitchell to continue covering the presidential election, even when the candidates have debated the financial crisis, and has decided on a day-by-day basis what stories are not appropriate for her to cover.“To me it’s a pretty easy balancing act,” Mr. Capus said in an interview Sunday. “She knows where to draw the line.”That line, NBC has decided, exists when past economic decisions are being re-examined. The fiscal policies championed by Mr. Greenspan, who retired in January 2006, have come under scrutiny in recent weeks.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','Thank you for encouraging California voters to support the state’s Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, or Proposition 2, on the November ballot. This modest proposal would bring a smidgen of comfort to millions of hens used for egg production.While some have suggested the egg industry should police itself, history shows that industries based on the backs of the disenfranchised do not voluntarily soften the suffering of those they exploit — all the more so when the victims are millions of hens the public never sees.Recent investigations by nonprofit groups in California, Ohio and Pennsylvania have revealed the atrocious living conditions of egg-laying hens, though their owners said they were humanely cared for.Consumer boycotts and protective laws are desperately needed. Proposition 2 is a modest step that deserves voter support and extension to other states.The writer is president of United Poultry Concerns, a nonprofit organization that is a sponsor of Proposition 2.'"
"'08-10-13,'1','Senator John McCain has agreed to appear on David Letterman’s “Late Show” on CBS this Thursday, according to the show’s Web site, lateshow.cbs.com. The appearance comes after Mr. McCain canceled a Sept. 24 appearance, saying he was suspending his campaign and heading to Washington to give the economic crisis his immediate attention. When Mr. Letterman, above right, learned that Mr. McCain was staying in New York for another day and sitting for an interview with Katie Couric, he ripped into the candidate on the air, saying he felt like “an ugly date” and questioning the wisdom of Mr. McCain’s campaign suspension. This all should provide some interesting tension for the newly scheduled appearance by Mr. McCain, who will be interviewed the night after the final presidential debate.'"

"'08-10-14,'0','This financial crisis started with our housing crisis, and we cannot fix our markets and the economy until we fix the housing crisis. My plan will protect the value of your home and get it rising again by buying up bad mortgages and refinancing them so if your neighbor defaults he doesn't bring down the value of your house with him. I will direct the government to refinance troubled mortgages for homeowners and replace them with mortgages they can afford. This is what we did during the Great Depression and we can do it again. Helping families who face default, foreclosure, and possible bankruptcy helps all homeowners, and will begin the process of recovery from this crisis. With so much on the line, the moment requires that government act -- and as president I intend to act, quickly and decisively.When the government does provide funds to shore up companies, the terms will be demanding, there will be complete transparency and the safety net for our financial system will not become a golden parachute for failed executives. Moreover, we will not merely inject billions of dollars into companies and walk away hoping for the best. We will require that those companies be reformed and restructured until they are sound assets again, and can be sold at no loss -- or perhaps even a profit -- to the taxpayers of America.And when that is accomplished, in each instance, government will relinquish its interest in these private companies. We're going to get government out of the business of bailouts and equity stakes, and back in the business of responsible regulation. We will learn from this crisis to prevent the next one, with much stricter oversight. No more wild overleveraging, no more liabilities concealed from the public and from shareholders, no more bundling of assets to maximize profit by assuming insane risks. Those days are over on Wall Street. With new rules of public disclosure and accounting, my reforms will make certain these betrayals of shareholders and the public trust are never repeated.We must restore trust to our financial system. On my orders, the Department of the Treasury will guarantee one hundred percent of all savings accounts for a period of six months. This will calm the understandable fears of widespread bank failure, while also restoring rational judgment to the choices of the market.As president, I will also act to protect investors -- especially those relying on their investments for retirement. Current rules mandate that investors must begin to sell off their IRAs and 401Ks when they reach age 70 and one half years old. Those rules should be suspended to spare senior citizens from being forced to sell their stock just as the market is hurting the most. Under the emergency measure I propose, we will also cut the tax rate for withdrawals from tax-preferred retirement accounts to ten percent. Retirees have suffered enough and need relief, and the surest relief is to let them keep more of their own savings.It is essential that we avoid an exodus of capital from the market. Senator Obama yesterday offered up a proposal that would have the effect of encouraging early withdrawal of funds from 401(k) accounts, by suspending penalties through 2009. This is an invitation to capital flight, and therefore to continued instability in the market, at a moment when exactly the opposite is needed. Any family that takes part in this will not see the benefits of the market recovery that smart policy can help bring about. In my administration, we will instead revive the market by attracting new investment. I will cut in half the capital gains tax on stocks purchased and held for more than a year -- from a rate of 15 to 7.5 percent. This vital measure will promote buying, raise asset values, help companies and shore up the pension plans for workers and retirees.We should also not penalize Americans who are forced to sell investments in today's tough markets. I will increase the amount of capital losses from $3,000 to $15,000, which can be deducted from your ordinary income in tax years 2008 and 2009. So much of this decline in our markets and value destruction was due to the failure of Congress and the Administration to come out with a timely rescue package. Investors are always responsible for their investment decisions, but the hard earned savings of Americans should not be penalized by the erratic behavior of politicians.It will not be enough for the federal government to correct the excesses of Wall Street without reforming its own reckless practices.Spending in Washington is out of control and I am going to rein it in. As president, I will veto the pork barrel special interest projects that are wasting your tax dollars, driving up our debt, and weakening our dollar. I have proposed a one year spending freeze with certain exceptions for such things as defense and veteran care. We are going to use that year to turn Washington inside out and get rid of wasteful, inefficient programs that do no one any good.While we put government back on your side, we must reform our tax system to deliver needed tax relief to working Americans, and to create jobs. I will double the child deduction, from 3,500 dollars to 7,000 dollars. Every person in America who chooses it will receive a 5,000 dollars towards the purchase of health insurance -- health plans that will be theirs to keep, even if they change jobs or move to another state. And we will reduce the federal business tax rate from 35 percent -- the second-highest in the world -- to 25 percent. I am also proposing today that for those who are between jobs, we eliminate all taxes on unemployment benefits. It is unclear to me why the government taxes money it has just sent you, and we should relieve this burden from Americans who've been hit the hardest.Reducing business tax rates has the potential to stop and reverse the rise of unemployment, and could create millions of new jobs. Despite the frequent changes to my opponent's tax plans in recent months -- he seems to revise them with each new poll -- his plan to raise taxes on 50% of small business income has survived. And even as he rails against companies that shut down their plants and move overseas, he refuses to cut the tax rate that drives many of these companies away.A typical middle-class family of four making 42,000 dollars a year with health insurance will get 4,350 more dollars under my plan than they would under Senator Obama's plan. That example of 42,000 a year in wages is especially relevant, because just last year Senator Obama voted to raise taxes on individuals making that amount.Senator Obama is also the same fellow who requested a million dollars a day in pork barrel earmarks ... who thinks that wasting 18 billion dollars a year in earmarks is not worth worrying about, who proposed a near doubling of the taxes on dividends and capital gains during the primary, who has voted 94 times for tax increases or against tax cuts, who is promising almost a trillion dollars in new spending, who came to the Senate a few years ago and already earned the title of its most liberal member -- this is the man who now presents himself as a tax cutter and champion of middle-class America.He is an eloquent speaker, but even he can't turn a record of supporting higher taxes into a credible promise to cut taxes. What he promises today is the opposite of what he has done his entire career. Perhaps never before in history have the American people been asked to risk so much based on so little.You can look at the record of what he's done or you can just go with your gut, but either way you're left with the same conclusion: Senator Obama is going to raise your taxes. And in this economy, raising taxes is the surest way to turn a recession into a depression.Senator Obama also promises to restrict international trade and risk access to foreign markets for American goods and services. The last President to raise taxes and restrict trade in a bad economy was Herbert Hoover. That didn't turn out to well. They say those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. Well, I know my history lessons, and I sure won't make the mistakes Senator Obama will. And were my opponent elected with a Democratic Congress in power, not only would there be no check on my opponent's reckless economic policies, there would be considerable pressure on him to tax and spend even more.This weekend, a plumber concerned that Senator Obama was going to raise his taxes asked him directly about his plan. The response was telling. Senator Obama explained to him that he was going to raise his taxes to quote ""spread the wealth around."" This explains how Senator Obama can promise an income tax cut for millions who aren't even paying income taxes right now. My friends, my plan isn't intended to force small businesses to cut jobs to pay higher taxes so we can ""spread the wealth around."" My plan is intended to create jobs and increase the wealth of all Americans.My plan for economic recovery does not require guesswork or blind faith from the American people. You know my record. You don't have to hope I will do what I promise. When I say I will cut spending, you need only look at my record to know it's true. When I say I will defend taxpayers, you know it's true because it's what I've always done. When I say I will work across the aisle, you can see it in the results I've delivered.And when I say I will change Washington, you know I'll do it, because for me change isn't a political slogan, it's what I've been doing my whole career.I know you're worried. America is a great country, but we are at a moment of national crisis that will determine our future. Will we continue to lead the world's economies or will we be overtaken? Will the world become safer or more dangerous? Will our military remain the strongest in the world? Will our children and grandchildren's future be brighter than ours?My answer to you is yes. Yes, we will lead. Yes, we will prosper. Yes, we will be safer. Yes, we will pass on to our children a stronger, better country. But we must be prepared to act swiftly, boldly, with courage and wisdom.I know what fear feels like. It's a thief in the night who robs your strength.I know what hopelessness feels like. It's an enemy who defeats your will.I felt those things once before. I will never let them in again. I'm an American. And I choose to fight.Don't give up hope. Be strong. Have courage. And fight.Fight for a new direction for our country.Fight for what's right for America.Fight to clean up the mess of corruption, infighting and selfishness in Washington.Fight to get our economy out of the ditch and back in the lead.Fight for the ideals and character of a free people.Fight for justice and opportunity for all.Stand up to defend our country from its enemies.Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. America is worth fighting for. Nothing is inevitable here. We never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history.Now, let's go win this election and get this country moving again.'"

"'08-10-14,'0','The team knows that many of its fans’ wallets are thinner and their 401(k) accounts are slimmer, if not gone. But still, the message seems to be, make room in your budget for seats behind the Jets’ bench that get you free parking and access to a great lounge and a 120-by-15-foot patio close behind Coach Eric Mangini and his men.“Luxury items like this will be under pressure,” said Raymond D. Sauer, chairman of the economics department at Clemson University and an expert on sports finance. “I think this is going to test the axiom that sports are recession-proof. I don’t think they are. And this auction will tell you a lot.”Such an auction has never been tried before so it is difficult to predict behavior.Are the thousands of season-ticket holders and others registered ready for bidding wars? Or are they devoted bargain hunters willing to play online chicken in hopes of keeping the top price below $25,000? The auction could, in the end, mimic the squeeze in capital markets where people, instead of banks, lack sufficient liquidity.Sauer said it was possible that the Jets might pull some licenses back for lack of interest, but Higgins said that would not happen. “We went into this four weeks ago with the economy not in great shape,” he said. “We went into this with eyes wide open.”The 2,028 licenses will be split into several mini-auctions, some of which will overlap. If fans lose bids in one, they can join others. Only those willing to bid on at least two licenses for floor bids of $5,000 each can play the Jets’ P.S.L. game.Eric T. Bradlow — the K. P. Chao professor of marketing, statistics and education at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton school — said the Jets grasped auction psychology, particularly in setting the $5,000 minimum bid well below the highest fixed price of $25,000 in other prime sections of the stadium.“The advantage of a low minimum is almost everyone feels they got a good price despite the fact that they might pay a higher price than if it had been a fixed price,” he said. “People like to gamble, they like to win, they like to compete.” In simultaneous auctions, he added, bidders who lose in one, are often willing to go higher in others.If the team fails to get at least $25,000 for each license, Bradlow said, “They’d have a bunch of satisfied customers, and maybe they’ll spend more in other ways at the stadium.”Still, even if the average price does not exceed $25,000, gross revenues would be $50.7 million — nice for creating money out of thin air. But the Jets are hoping for a windfall. In promoting their 5- to 15-year payoff plans, the Jets list the annual costs, with interest rates of 6.5 to 8 percent, for licenses costing between $10,000 and $50,000 each.“Irrational or not, people might feel they will have more disposable income for sports events in 5, 10 or 15 years,” Bradlow said.Irrationality, indeed. Isn’t that the emotion that leads some fans to buy steeply-priced seat licenses (that will also require tickets priced at $700 a game in the Jets and Giants’ case)? Or $2,500-a-game tickets at the new Yankee Stadium?“In times like this, people want something they enjoy or really connect to,” said Leila Dunbar, a former Sotheby’s executive who runs a collectibles appraisal firm. “There are people who will go without in other areas for sports and entertainment.”'"
"'08-10-14,'0','Some experts greeted the rally as a turning point in the slow-motion crash that has erased five years worth of value from the stock market in the last few weeks. When Monday began, shares of some blue-chip companies were at their cheapest levels in years. “The market clearly was getting priced for an Armageddon, a depression, for the end of Western civilization as we know it,” said Edward Yardeni, the investment strategist. “A lot of people realized these were extraordinarily good prices to buy stocks.”But others warned that the problems at the center of the current crisis, including a global credit squeeze and worsening economic conditions, were far from solved, and could set the stage for more volatility in markets.Reeling from the worst week in stocks since 1933, officials announced over the weekend that they would flood the financial system with billions of dollars in liquidity and provide capital for troubled banks, throwing out the traditional financial playbook in favor of a series of moves that officials hoped would get banks lending again.Relief poured through the markets. The 11.6 percent gain in the broad Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was that gauge’s best single-day gain since 1939. Stocks in Paris and Frankfurt had their best single-day gains ever, rising more than 11 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at 9,387.61, up 11.1 percent, is now back to its level on Thursday. Only four times in its history has the Dow risen more percentage points in a day. Those gains came in 1929, 1931, 1932, and 1933.But trading volume was lighter than last week, meaning fewer investors jumped in to buy than were selling last week. Portions of the credit markets — which remained locked tight before the weekend — were closed for the Columbus Day holiday, so investors may have had trouble gauging the reaction among banks and big lenders to the new global initiatives. Some analysts said that stock investors held off on their trades to see how the credit markets would react.“If the credit markets open up tomorrow and you can’t see money flowing where it’s supposed to flow, you imagine that this whole thing reverses itself quite dramatically,” said Randy Cass, chief executive of First Coverage, a firm that collects and analyzes investment advice offered by brokerage firms.Investors may also be eager to pocket their profits from Monday’s gains, which could send stocks lower when the markets reopen Tuesday.There were signs on Monday, however, that the coordinated government efforts had started to make some headway in loosening the flow of credit. The cost to insure the debt of several major corporations fell significantly, a sign that investors were more confident about the health of the nation’s big banks and businesses.The seeds of the rally began on Sunday afternoon, after more than a dozen European countries — including Britain, France, Germany and Spain — announced aggressive plans to guarantee loans, take ownership stakes in banks, or prop up ailing companies with billions in taxpayer funds.“There’s a mixture of surprise and relief, certainly in Europe, as to the scale of the measures that have been announced since the weekend,” said Mark Cliffe, chief economist of ING Group. “There was considerable nervousness, to say the least, that the Europeans wouldn’t come through with a concerted effort, and essentially they have.”The Treasury Department followed suit on Monday after Wall Street closed, unveiling similar plans to take stakes in troubled companies and provide blanket insurance for deposits.'"
"'08-10-14,'0','Janet Brown, executive director of the commission, said fund-raising for the debates was “difficult,” since opportunities for product placement and marketing are not the same as at the two political conventions or other widely attended events.“We are really grateful to the corporations,” Ms. Brown said. “They see it as part of civic and community support, and they don’t get a lot for it. They don’t get any access to candidates, and their name is not mentioned on air.”Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., the Republican chairman of the commission and the president of the American Gaming Association, a trade group, said corporations had “no control, input or say. They are only giving as good citizens.”The commission’s Web site lists eight national sponsors of the three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate. They include BBH New York, an advertising firm that has produced an educational Web site called mydebates.org; JetBlue, which provides airline tickets; and the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, a charitable organization created by the son of the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett.By far the most prominent backer is Anheuser-Busch, a debate sponsor since 1992. Not only does the beer company donate directly to the commission, but it also sponsors a hospitality tent at each debate, where members of the news media and others who are working can receive free food, beer and other refreshments.“We hope our hospitality area will provide a welcome opportunity to relax with some great food and ice-cold beverages,” said an Anheuser-Busch invitation to the tent. “If you’re looking for a little entertainment, you’ll be able to watch some of our latest television spots and enter a drawing for a chance to win a Budweiser fire pit, perfect for outdoor gatherings this fall.”Francine Katz, vice president for communications and corporate affairs at Anheuser-Busch, declined to say how much the company spent on the debates, except that it is “a very significant sum.” Compared with events like the Olympics and the political conventions, the debates offer minimal opportunities for Anheuser-Busch to promote its brand, she said.“A lot of what we do is as a corporate citizen and not for recognition,” Ms. Katz said. “This is probably the most-watched election, and it is an honor for Anheuser-Busch to be at the epicenter of that process. These are important debates, and we are proud to help make them possible.”Joseph K. Doss, the president of the International Bottled Water Association, says his group donates the services of its top lobbyist and provides bottled water to the debates, but does not make a cash contribution.“The debates are a great cause and a good opportunity for us,” Mr. Doss said. “It gives us visibility having our name as a sponsor, and it’s good for us to be associated with something so visible.”'"
"'08-10-14,'0','The Boeing Company, whose factories have been shut since its 27,000 machinists walked out on Sept. 6, said a new round of talks last weekend have failed.“We worked very hard to find solutions, and we are extremely disappointed that the talks broke off,” Doug Kight, Boeing’s lead negotiator, said in an e-mailed statement on Monday. “We want to resolve this strike so employees can return to work, but we cannot sacrifice our ability to continuously improve productivity and our long-term competitiveness for an agreement.”Boeing, based in Chicago, had been in discussions with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents about 27,000 hourly production workers.Boeing and the union broke off talks on Sept. 5. The company closed its assembly lines the next day, further delaying its 787. The two sides are at odds over Boeing’s increasing use of outside contractors and its proposal that workers pay more for health care. Boeing’s 11 percent raise offer over three years also fell short of union demands.The union says the workers it represents in Washington State, Oregon and Kansas deserve a bigger share of Boeing’s profits, as airlines have placed record orders for new jets that use less fuel. Union demands include more opportunities to compete for work that Boeing finds necessary to outsource and the exclusive use of union workers in the delivery of materials within company factories.'"
"'08-10-14,'0','“There is an easy way out, but I’m not the one who is going to take it,” Mr. Trafelet said in an investor call on Thursday. “I feel an absolute personal and moral obligation to work as hard as possible especially through a difficult period.”Still, managers like Mr. Trafelet confront formidable challenges. His fund has dwindled to about $3 billion, from $6 billion at its peak in 2006. It has been three years since he produced the kind of double-digit returns that many funds generated in the industry’s heyday, before thousands of new managers crowded in and made spotting profitable trades far more difficult.It might be easy to dismiss Mr. Trafelet’s story as a simple tale of a highflier falling back to earth. But the fortunes of the hedge fund industry matter to nearly every investor big or small. In recent years, public and corporate pension funds, endowments and foundations poured money into these private investment vehicles in the hope of reaping market-beating returns.So far this year, the average hedge fund is down 17 percent, about half as much as the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.As losses mount, hedge fund managers are consulting lawyers to determine whether their fiduciary duty dictates that they should shut their doors, liquidate their holdings and use the proceeds to pay back investors — before the losses get worse — or stay in business and try to trade their way out of the hole.It was easy to look like a star during the bull market. Mr. Trafelet returned 42 percent in 2005, 17 percent in 2004 and 39 percent in 2003. He made money after the technology bubble burst and others struggled.Mr. Trafelet says he believes he can survive. He said in an interview on Friday morning that he had shifted half of his Delta Institutional fund’s money into cash and that he thought his bets would turn around.“We wouldn’t be working this hard and investing in the firm if we didn’t see the massive opportunity,” Mr. Trafelet said.But Trafelet, founded in New York in 2000, is in a weaker position than other hedge funds because the fund returned only 6 percent last year and 2 percent in 2006, according to an investor. Investors who are evaluating whether to leave Mr. Trafelet’s fund versus other funds may choose to remain with funds that made them more money recently.Much of Trafelet’s money is Mr. Trafelet’s own, so to an extent, he can choose to keep going regardless of investor flight. In the hedge fund world, traders have remade their fortunes dozens of times over, and Mr. Trafelet may impress again in the coming years.It has been quite a ride for Mr. Trafelet, who developed his taste for stock-picking while attending the elite boarding school Phillips Exeter Academy. After graduating from Dartmouth College, he took a job at Fidelity. By age 25, he was managing a $500 million mutual fund.Today, Mr. Trafelet enjoys the trappings of success and is still rich by most standards. He has a home on Park Avenue and takes vacations in places like Fishers Island, the private island in Long Island Sound whose beaches have long attracted old money. In a single good year like 2005, his fund generated hundreds of millions of dollars, which would have been divided between Mr. Trafelet and a few partners after paying expenses.Unlike some hedge fund traders who use complicated computer models and formulas to spot investments, Mr. Trafelet picks stocks the old-fashioned way: by combing through corporate fundamentals like profits and sales. He makes long-term bets on companies large and small, based on research and meetings with executives at those companies. It has become an urban legend among the stock-picking community that Mr. Trafelet paid college students to count the cars in shopping strips as part of his research.He is still spending most of his time studying companies, despite the market turbulence, he said, and he says he thinks there is money to be made when the storm passes.“I don’t know if the market’s going straight up from here or straight down from here,” he said in the investor call. “But I can tell you that there’s massive mispricings all over the place.”While Mr. Trafelet bets both for and against stocks, he was more long going into September. He lost big on his largest position, the Ultra Petroleum Corporation of Houston, which plunged from $84 three months ago to $40 on Monday, before the broad market rally lifted the stock.In the middle of September, when regulators temporarily banned short-selling, Mr. Trafelet, like many hedge fund traders, was squeezed. He had to exit some short positions. By the time the month was over, he had lost a stomach-churning 18.5 percent, according to an investor.Others in the industry started asking questions when Mr. Trafelet laid off a sizable portion of his back-office staff in the middle of the month. He says those cuts were because of a technology upgrade. Last week two more senior employees left. Mr. Trafelet said the departures were not because of the fund’s performance.Mr. Trafelet’s fund is up 4.5 percent in October, according to an investor, while hedge funds on average are down. But Mr. Trafelet knows the clock is ticking. He has to retain his staff to have any hope of pulling back into the black. At the end of August, he personally guaranteed bonuses for his top traders for this year and told them that, if needed, he would pump more of his own money into his fund in 2009 to safeguard their pay.'"
"'08-10-14,'0','John J. Mack got his deal — and, at long last, some relief on Wall Street.On Monday, Mr. Mack, the chairman and chief executive of Morgan Stanley, completed a long-awaited deal to sell a fifth of his Wall Street giant to a big Japanese bank for $9 billion.Wall Street responded with euphoria. Morgan Stanley’s share price soared after weeks of crushing losses. The shares nearly doubled, gaining $8.42, to $18.10. The surge punctuated an explosive rally in the broader stock market that was touched off by the government’s plan to buy stakes in big banks, including Morgan Stanley, to shore up the financial industry.“Clearly, this gives us a lot more strength,” Mr. Mack said of the Japanese investment. “You have a powerful investor here, a partner.""The deal came after a weekend of tense talks that involved the Treasury Department and the Japanese government. Only last week, some investors feared that the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan might walk away, leaving Mr. Mack and his bank in a lurch. Instead, Mr. Mack renegotiated the terms after federal officials assured Mitsubishi that its investment would be protected. Now, Morgan Stanley has Mitsubishi, the second-largest bank in the world, with $1.1 trillion in deposits, in its corner.“Morgan Stanley has bought itself more time,” said Brad Hintz, a banking analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “Certainly the Good Housekeeping seal of approval from Mitsubishi does a lot to tell the market that there’s value in these franchises.”'"
"'08-10-14,'0','The speech, written by Mark Salter, the co-author of Mr. McCain’s books and the candidate’s adviser of two decades, had dark, Salteresque metaphors — “I know what fear feels like, it’s a thief in the night who robs your strength” — and noted that the campaign was six points behind. Mr. McCain said that “the national media has written us off” and that “Mr. Obama is measuring the drapes.”In one particularly bleak passage, Mr. McCain said: “Financial markets are collapsing. Credit is drying up. Your savings are in danger, and your retirement is at risk. Jobs are disappearing. The cost of health care, your children’s college, gasoline and groceries are rising all the time with no end in sight, while your most important asset — your home — is losing value every day.”But the address, delivered on a day when the Dow Jones average jumped 936 points, recalled the old McCain brand of the experienced fighter whom, he said, voters should trust in a foxhole.“The next president won’t have time to get used to the office,” Mr. McCain said, with his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, at his side at the Virginia appearance. “He won’t have the luxury of studying up on the issues before he acts. He will have to act immediately. And to do that, he will need experience, courage, judgment and a bold plan of action to take this country in a new direction.”Then he added, in a knock at President Bush, “We cannot spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight: waiting for our luck to change.”Mr. McCain’s advisers, who are facing polls that show Mr. Obama gaining momentum and Mr. McCain’s negative attacks of recent weeks as largely counterproductive, said he would deliver a new speech on the economy on Tuesday, a day after Mr. Obama released several new proposals for dealing with the economic crisis. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain’s chief economic adviser, told reporters the speech would contain “specific new measures,” although it was unclear how extensive those measures would be.Over all, the McCain campaign has sent out confused signals in recent days as top advisers have presented conflicting versions of when Mr. McCain would deliver his economic speech and what he would say. A Republican close to the campaign said Saturday that donors had been told Mr. McCain would deliver a major economic address on Monday, but a top adviser said later on Saturday that no speech had been written and that the campaign did not know what Mr. McCain was doing Saturday night, let alone Monday.On Sunday morning, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a confidant of Mr. McCain, said on the CBS News program “Face the Nation” that Mr. McCain was weighing proposals to cut taxes on investors’ capital gains and dividends, even though Mr. McCain’s existing economic plan already calls for such cuts. Mr. McCain’s advisers later said they did not know why Mr. Graham had said what he did.Even in the face of the dismal polls, most of Mr. McCain’s campaign staff continues to hold out hope, however distant, that Mr. McCain or events will somehow turn the situation around. But more often the mood is anxious, angry or subdued, interspersed with occasional moments of escape. Last Tuesday after the presidential debate in Nashville, Mr. Salter and Steve Schmidt, who is managing Mr. McCain’s campaign, were at a karaoke bar until the small hours of the morning as Mr. Salter sang his way through a range of Bob Dylan songs.'"
"'08-10-14,'0','The Connecticut Supreme Court deserves praise for acknowledging, as other states that allow same-sex marriage have not, the constitutional principles that compelled the justices to guarantee all consenting adult Americans the right to enjoy the freedoms and bear the responsibilities of citizenship, including marriage.Peter Wolfgang, executive director of the Family Institute of Connecticut, which opposes the ruling, could not be more correct when he says: “This is about our right to govern ourselves. It is bigger than gay marriage.”With Friday’s ruling, the Connecticut Supreme Court recognized exactly that.Re “Separate Is Not Equal” (editorial, Oct. 11): In a few weeks, Californians could put same-sex relationships back into the closets, if Proposition 8 passes and discrimination is written into our Constitution.Same-sex couples have never sought to take away or marginalize the marriage rights of others.

More than 1,400 voters in that category have been disqualified so far in 2008. The judge said that it was unclear how many cancellations were actually wrong but that it was a violation of federal law. Judge Murphy said those people should not be prevented from voting if they can produce more proof of residency at the polls.'"
"'08-10-14,'0','“Sovereign funds are piling up cash because there has not been a big reward of putting your money to work,” said Brad W. Setser, an international finance analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. “But what I find to be more worrisome is a complete unwillingness on the part of sovereigns to hold anything else but supersafe Treasury bills.”That sovereign funds appear to have the same buyers’ fright as the portfolio manager of a mutual fund should not necessarily be a surprise, given their aversion to assets with even the slightest risk. But with their longer-term investment horizons, the funds were expected to be more willing to ride out the stomach-churning ups-and-downs of the market.The plunge in the value of oil, along with fears that the global economic downturn is likely to be deeper and longer-lasting than expected, has probably been the most significant factor in changing that thinking.Mr. Setser points to data showing a spike in the holdings of Treasury bills by foreign institutions since the credit downturn began about 15 months ago. At the same time, the funds have reduced their purchases of riskier securities, like the equities and bonds issued by corporations and the mortgage lending giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.In the 12-month period that ended in July, the net purchase by foreigners of American long-term securities almost halved — to $456 billion for the period ended in July, from $751 billion in the year to July 2007.Both Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, which has a mandate to invest overseas, were early buyers of big Wall Street financial firms. Abu Dhabi invested in Citigroup and Kuwait purchased a stake in Merrill Lynch and a subsequent position in Citigroup.The investment returns have been poor — Citi closed at $15.75 Monday, down from $31 when Abu Dhabi invested. What is worse, economic troubles are now cropping up closer to home.In Kuwait, the stock exchange has stumbled badly, prompting its sovereign fund to promise to invest $1 billion to prop it up.As for Abu Dhabi, it may become distracted by a slowdown in Dubai, its neighboring emirate. Dubai has attracted global renown for its debt-fueled development boom, which was undertaken through heavy reliance on now-stricken international loan markets. Unlike Abu Dhabi, Dubai does not sit on a large oil reserve.This week Moody’s released a report in which it estimated Dubai’s liabilities to be about $46 billion, the size of its gross domestic product. With many ambitious development projects depending on rising property prices, the combination of a price correction and an inability to borrow could lead to problems similar to those plaguing the American and British economies.“Cumulative liabilities are currently rising faster than investments are able to generate returns,” said Philipp Lotter, a Moody’s analyst and co-author of the report.While the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority’s international orientation makes a bailout of Dubai less feasible, analysts say that Dubai’s difficulties and lower oil prices will slow what had been a growing flow of petrodollars to Western stock and bond markets.Indeed, Gulf Arab states took emergency measures to support their financial systems Sunday. These included a rare cut by Saudi Arabia in its benchmark lending rate and a vow by the United Arab Emirates to protect national banks and guarantee deposits.More starkly, the Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign fund for Qatar, committed $5.3 billion on Monday to buying stakes of 10 to 20 percent in the country’s banks.Gulf stock markets have been falling for weeks now, driven lower mostly by the decline in oil prices.Wealth funds outside the Middle East are facing similar pressures.The $5 trillion explosion in global dollar reserves during this decade was driven by an export boom in Asian countries including China, South Korea and India, which relied largely on satisfying consumer demand in the United States and Europe. As a recession takes hold, demand will flag and foreign institutions in these counties are likely to be more concerned with using their surpluses to stimulate their own economies, analysts say.In recent months, many troubled financial firms made the pilgrimage from Abu Dhabi to Singapore in search of an investment lifeline. They went home empty-handed.“These funds are risk-averse like others are now,” said Edwin Truman, a long-time observer of global finance at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “Because of the attention paid to them in the past two years, they may be even more so.”'"
"'08-10-14,'0','A Nissan official said the car maker would lay off 1,680 workers at a plant in Spain because of poor demand. Fumiaki Matsumoto, left, the company’s vice president in Spain, says the job cuts will be at its Barcelona factory, which assembles 4x4 vehicles. The move will affect about 37 percent of Nissan’s work force in Spain, Mr. Matsumoto, left, said. Last month, car sales in Spain fell by 32 percent from a year ago. Nissan’s production in Barcelona for 2009 is estimated at 110,000 vehicles, down 83,000 from the 2007 figure, the company says. Mr. Matsumoto said at a news conference in Barcelona on Monday that increased fuel costs, difficulty raising loans and new carbon dioxide limitations have all contributed to a downturn in the world’s 4x4 vehicle market'"
"'08-10-14,'0','Nations in the European Union were divided over whether to resume talks on a political and economic pact with Russia that were frozen in protest over its war with Georgia. Germany and Italy led the campaign to resume discussions on trade, energy and political ties after Moscow withdrew its forces from parts of Georgia according to the terms of a cease-fire brokered by the European Union. But some foreign ministers, led by David Miliband of Britain, said they wanted to see progress in talks on the future of the disputed Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia before pressing for closer ties. The union is holding a two-day session starting Wednesday in Brussels, officials said. European Union leaders agreed last month to suspend the talks to show their opposition to Moscow’s invasion, a move that irked Russian officials.'"

"'08-10-14,'0','A scant few months ago, Americans were seen as participants in a bidding war with the emerging Chinese, Indian, Russian and Brazilian middle classes for a basket full of products. But that was before an extreme slowdown in demand for things as diverse as gasoline and aluminum and the retreat of investment money from commodity futures into safer havens like government bonds.The commodity bust began before last week’s broad market declines, though the panic has exacerbated the pressure on commodities. Oil dropped by 10 percent on Friday alone, but then recovered some of that loss Monday to settle at $81.19 a barrel, far below its high in July of $145.29.“Commodities followed the euphoria cycle that we had along with housing,” said Robert J. Shiller, an economist at Yale who specializes in market bubbles. “We had the idea that the world is growing very fast, people are getting very rich and, by the way, we are running out of everything. That theory doesn’t seem so good when the economy is collapsing.”Some analysts, while welcoming the recent declines, say they believe that prices are likely to remain above long-term norms. Food, in particular, could be a continuing problem: today’s prices are still too high to allow many people in developing countries to afford adequate diets. Nor have the recent declines been passed along in American grocery stores, at least as of yet. The United Nations has projected that global food prices will remain elevated for years.The price increases of recent years served their economic function, calling forth additional supplies of many commodities — farmers planted every acre they could, mining companies opened new mines and oil companies went to the far corners of the earth to drill wells. In many cases, the prices also caused demand to decline even as supply started rising.Americans, the world’s largest fuel consumers, have been cutting back on gasoline all year, and the decline is approaching double digits. Motorists pumped 9.5 percent less gasoline for the week ended Oct. 3 compared with the same week a year earlier, according to MasterCard Advisors, which tracks spending. In a report on Friday, the International Energy Agency cut its forecast for global oil consumption yet again, projecting that 2008 would end with the slowest demand growth in 15 years.Big increases in world wheat production because of increased acreage in the United States, Canada, Russia and much of Europe have brought wheat prices to less than $6 a bushel today from nearly $13 in March.Soybean prices have dropped to $9 a bushel from $16 since July, in part because of a record crop in China and a slowdown in Chinese imports. Corn prices are also easing amid expanded supply.A theory among economists is that commodity prices are still at the beginning of a steep fall as the credit squeeze takes the world economy into a deep recession.“When you have a seven-year bull run, you are going to have more than a four-month correction, and we are just beginning our fourth month,” said Richard Feltes, senior vice president and director of commodity research at MF Global Research. “We have got more deflation coming in the housing sector, in capital assets, and it’s going to continue in commodities as well.”But many economists say a lasting price collapse is unlikely because the emerging middle class and growing populations in developing economies will continue to have strong appetites for fuels and metals.Some say that the other commodity bull markets in modern history — approximately spanning 1906 to 1923, 1933 to 1955 and 1968 to 1982 — lasted more than twice as long as the current run. They included some sharp corrections before they ran their course, suggesting that the current drop, however precipitous, could be temporary.Though the picture is slightly different for every commodity, prices generally hit a low point for the decade soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, then rose as the global economy strengthened in the following years. From late 2001 until mid-2008, the price of oil rose 800 percent, copper rose 700 percent and wheat rose 400 percent.The decline of recent weeks has taken virtually every major commodity more than halfway back to its late 2001 price, adjusted for inflation. The recent drop has been so rapid that if the pace continued, it would take only a few more weeks to erase the gains of the bull market entirely.That suggests to some analysts that prices could hit a floor fairly soon. “The underlying fundamentals of strong demand for energy, food and industrial commodities will come back,” said Michael Lewis, global head of commodities research for Deutsche Bank.Many analysts think oil could fall to $70 a barrel in the next few months, if not sooner. But it is hard for them to believe it will go much lower: oil is not becoming easier to find, as fields in Mexico peter out and suppliers like Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela remain unreliable.The costs of finding oil in deep waters or mining oil sands in Canada remain high, in the $60 to $70 a barrel range — and since those are now vital sources of supply, they could help put a floor under the oil price. Additionally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could cut production to try to shore up prices, probably at an emergency meeting it will hold Nov. 18. Analysts note that the credit crisis and economic slowdown will inevitably stall new industrial projects, reducing demand for metals. But the falling prices will also discourage new mining and drilling. When economic growth resumes, that could produce metal shortages that would drive prices back up.The biggest single factor that will decide whether a prolonged bull market in commodities is over, or just in a lull, is the Chinese economy. The industrial development of that country in recent years was responsible for much of the world’s increased consumption of copper, aluminum and zinc, and almost a third of the increase in oil consumption.Chinese growth has slowed but is still running above 12 percent, and that country is expected to undertake some huge projects in coming months as it repairs damage from earthquakes and storms.Kevin Norrish, a senior commodities researcher at Barclays Capital, said that in a recent visit to China he found that domestic demand for copper was still strong but that exports were weakening. Chinese copper wire manufacturers, he said, “are very depressed indeed because their export orders have fallen a long way.”He said that as high as prices for commodities rose in recent years, the bull run in the late 1970s and early 1980s was even more buoyant. Of all the major commodities, only oil at its peak in July traded at a higher price than in the last bull market, adjusted for inflation.That previous bull run, stimulated by years of high economic growth and inflation, was followed by nearly two decades of weak prices that accompanied the transition in the United States from an industrial to a service economy. Then China and India appeared on the world stage as major economies at the turn of the new century, followed by the oil-driven economy in Russia and greater consumption in the Middle East the last four or five years. Mr. Norrish is one of many commodities analysts who think that the story of China, India and other developing countries’ spurring commodity demand is not over.“What we are seeing is a pause in what we see as a very, very long bull run,” Mr. Norrish said.'"

"'08-10-14,'0','LOS ANGELES — If Senator John McCain has more to say publicly about his time in a North Vietnamese prison before next month’s election, it will not be with help from Warner Brothers.The studio moved quietly over the last few weeks to block any promotional showing of an interview — tied to the release of the first DVD version of the 1987 film “Hanoi Hilton” — in which Senator McCain spoke of his imprisonment in the Hoa Lo prison during the Vietnam War. The studio is concerned that any pre-election showing might embroil the project in electoral politics.“It’s just us trying to be cautious and not affect the election one way or the other,” said Ronnee Sass, a spokeswoman for the studio’s home entertainment division.The prohibition came amid a rising tide of politically edged entertainments, from Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11,” a Lions Gate Films release that presented an unflattering portrait of President Bush in the last presidential election, to Tina Fey’s more recent barbed portrayals of Gov. Sarah Palin on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.”The interview was recorded in May by the filmmaker and well-known Hollywood conservative Lionel Chetwynd for inclusion on the “Hanoi Hilton” DVD, which is set for release on Nov. 11.“Finding someone in Hollywood who says they don’t want to affect the election is like finding a virgin in a brothel,” Mr. Chetwynd said on Monday. He noted that studios were plugging movies with far more potential political impact, Oliver Stone’s Bush biography “W.” among them.'"
"'08-10-14,'0','Goldman Sachs Bank USA is coming to New York.The financial company long known for investment banking has applied for a New York State bank charter, Gov. David A. Paterson announced on Monday.The announcement does not mean a move for Goldman Sachs, which has been based in New York City since its founding in 1869. But it does provide glimpses of Goldman’s roadmap as it transforms itself into a commercial bank.Goldman’s state charter, if approved, would set it apart from its direct competitors — Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Those banks operate under a national charter, allowing them to open branches across states without separate applications.Goldman’s decision could indicate that the firm is not interested in a national consumer-focused business — which will differentiate it from its peers. Goldman is expected to focus on managing assets for wealthy individuals rather than providing retail banking services.Richard H. Neiman, the state’s superintendent of banks, said Goldman’s decision lends support to the state banking system, which has fallen into question in the last decade as large banks applied for national charters.“The decision should eliminate any doubt that the dual banking system is alive and well,” Mr. Neiman said.'"
"'08-10-14,'0','Reeling from the worst week in stocks since 1933, officials announced over the weekend that they would flood the financial system with billions of dollars in liquidity and provide capital for troubled banks, throwing out the traditional financial playbook in favor of a series of moves that officials hoped would get banks lending again.Relief poured through the markets. The 11.6 percent gain in the broad Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was that gauge’s best single-day gain since 1939. Stocks in Paris and Frankfurt had their best single-day gains ever, rising more than 11 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at 9,387.61, up 11.1 percent, is now back to its level on Thursday. Only four times in its history has the Dow risen more percentage points in a day. Those gains came in 1929, 1931, 1932, and 1933.But trading volume was lighter than last week, meaning fewer investors jumped in to buy than were selling last week. Portions of the credit markets — which remained locked tight before the weekend — were closed for the Columbus Day holiday, so investors may have had trouble gauging the reaction among banks and big lenders to the new global initiatives. Some analysts said that stock investors held off on their trades to see how the credit markets would react.“If the credit markets open up tomorrow and you can’t see money flowing where it’s supposed to flow, you imagine that this whole thing reverses itself quite dramatically,” said Randy Cass, chief executive of First Coverage, a firm that collects and analyzes investment advice offered by brokerage firms.Investors may also be eager to pocket their profits from Monday’s gains, which could send stocks lower when the markets reopen Tuesday.There were signs on Monday, however, that the coordinated government efforts had started to make some headway in loosening the flow of credit. The cost to insure the debt of several major corporations fell significantly, a sign that investors were more confident about the health of the nation’s big banks and businesses.The seeds of the rally began on Sunday afternoon, after more than a dozen European countries — including Britain, France, Germany and Spain — announced aggressive plans to guarantee loans, take ownership stakes in banks, or prop up ailing companies with billions in taxpayer funds.“There’s a mixture of surprise and relief, certainly in Europe, as to the scale of the measures that have been announced since the weekend,” said Mark Cliffe, chief economist of ING Group. “There was considerable nervousness, to say the least, that the Europeans wouldn’t come through with a concerted effort, and essentially they have.”The Treasury Department followed suit on Monday after Wall Street closed, unveiling similar plans to take stakes in troubled companies and provide blanket insurance for deposits.The rescue efforts spurred rallies in stock markets around the world. At midday on Tuesday, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was up nearly 4 percent and the Australian S.& P./ASX 200 index in Sydney had gained more than 3 percent. The Nikkei in Tokyo, which was closed Monday for a national holiday, had soared more than 13 percent at midday.At 2 a.m. Monday in New York, one hour before the start of trading in Europe, the Fed issued a statement saying it would make billions of dollars available to banks in coordination with the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank. It was the latest unprecedented move by the central bank: effectively a pledge to “provide unlimited liquidity to the world’s banking system,” as Mr. Yardeni put it.Stocks in Europe surged higher at the open by more than 5 percent. Shares of BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, and Royal Bank of Scotland — among other major European banks — rallied.Just after 8 a.m. came another cause for relief. Morgan Stanley, the embattled Wall Street bank, announced that it had closed on a $9 billion financing deal with a large Japanese bank, the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The deal had been closely watched for weeks by investors who considered it a critical gauge of confidence in the global banking system. Its completion was considered so important to financial markets that officials from the Treasury Department and the Japanese government joined in talks between the companies.The agreement also restored confidence in the health of Morgan Stanley, sending the company’s shares up 87 percent, to close at $18.10. Morgan Stanley was the best-performing stock in the S.& P. 500 on Monday.As investors received word on their BlackBerrys of the success by Morgan Stanley, their eyes were glued to television sets where a speech by Neel T. Kashkari, the assistant Treasury secretary for the government’s rescue plan for Wall Street banks, was being broadcast. Mr. Kashkari appeared in Washington to present the first glimpse at the plan’s inner workings and its personnel. He pledged that the government would begin injecting money into banks almost immediately.The stage was set for a huge rally. The Dow zoomed nearly 400 points higher two minutes after the opening bell as shares of nearly every type of business surged. Stocks surged further after reports that Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, would meet in the afternoon with the chiefs of the nation’s top banks, a signal to investors that a new round of government aid was on its way.The gains were led by shares of energy companies, which received a boost from a $3.49 rise in the price of oil, to $81.19 a barrel. Telecommunications companies also moved higher as did banks. Goldman Sachs gained 25 percent, to $111; Bank of America rose 9.2 percent, to $22.79; and Citigroup gained 11.6 percent, to $15.75.'"

"'08-10-15,'0','Mr. Harper was blindsided, however, by the recent turmoil in financial markets. Canada’s banks have avoided the troubles experienced in the United States and Europe, but the Toronto Stock Exchange has gyrated with its counterparts elsewhere.If anything, Mr. Harper made an undesirable situation even worse for his party by projecting an attitude of nonchalance.During a debate, he found himself on the defensive after saying, “What Canadians are worried about right now is not the job situation, not losing their home like in the U.S.” Their concerns, he said, were limited to their investments.Later, in a television interview, he suggested that the world’s economic problems might not be all bad. “I think there are probably some gains to be made in the stock market,” Mr. Harper said.Canadians do not vote directly for a political party or the prime minister, but elect a local member of the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament.For Mr. Harper to achieve a majority in Parliament, it was essential for him to expand from his base in Western Canada and substantially improve his party’s standing in Ontario and Quebec, which control 181 of the 308 seats.The current economic uncertainty has been a particular concern in parts of Ontario where industries rely heavily on exports to the United States.A rise in the value of the Canadian dollar over the last two years made many of those factories much less competitive. The economic slowdown in the United States has only aggravated the problem.Peter Donolo, a former official in a Liberal government who now is an executive at the Strategic Counsel, a polling firm, said the perception of Mr. Harper in Quebec reversed during the campaign, from 60 percent approval to 60 percent disapproval.“The support just evaporated,” Mr. Donolo said. “He chased away Quebec votes kind of off-handedly.”French-speaking Quebecers reacted poorly to suggestions by Mr. Harper that artists were members of the elite who spent too much time at government-financed galas. A proposal to stiffen penalties for young people who commit crimes also found little following in the province.The collapse of the Conservatives in Quebec helped the separatist Bloc Québécois, which had been written off by some of its supporters as the election began, retain 48 of the 51 seats it won in 2006.But the Liberal campaign had its share of problems. The party was led for the first time by Mr. Dion, a former academic. He has vigorously opposed Quebec separatism, which made him unpopular in many parts of his home province. His often peculiar English sometimes made him difficult to understand.The Liberals’ biggest problem was the key element of their platform. Mr. Dion proposed controlling greenhouse gas emissions by introducing a carbon tax on all fossil fuels except gasoline.Under Mr. Dion’s plan, the revenue would be used to reduce income taxes. The Conservatives relentlessly attacked the plan as a tax grab.Adding to Mr. Dion’s woes was the resurgence of two other left-of-center parties. The New Democratic Party, supported by organized labor and led by Jack Layton, won 37 seats, according to incomplete results, up from 29.The Green Party had an unusually high profile during the campaign, but won no seats.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','“He looks presidential,” said Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant who has advised Mr. McCain at times in this campaign, speaking of Mr. Obama. “America is getting more comfortable seeing him in the ring. The more they see him, the more comfortable they’ve gotten.”In one strong indication of this, the Times/CBS News poll found that the number of people who said he had prepared himself well enough to be president had jumped to 51 percent now from 44 percent in August. And 17 percent of respondents said that Mr. Obama’s debate performance had improved their opinion of him.Mr. McCain is highly unlikely to let this third and final debate — the last time in the campaign that he will command an audience anywhere near this size — pass without a fight. He said on Tuesday that he would do Wednesday what he did not do at the debate last week, which is bring up the subject of Mr. Obama’s occasional interactions in Chicago with William Ayers, a former member of the Weather Underground. Setting the stage for that, Mr. McCain has turned up his advertising mentioning the “domestic terrorist.”If he does, it will not be an obscure reference. The poll found that 61 percent of respondents said they had heard or read about Mr. Ayers and Mr. Obama; 9 percent volunteered his name when asked to identify an association of Mr. Obama’s that bothered them.Still, history suggests that barring a major mistake by Mr. Obama — who has over this year not made many — or some startling new attack or appeal by Mr. McCain, it will be hard to erase the impressions that Mr. Obama left in the first two debates. If that is the case, he may find that he has passed the Reagan threshold.Both the 1980 election and this one, presented a choice between someone who intrigued but worried voters and a familiar figure who was not particularly well liked but was viewed as experienced in the ways of Washington. In both cases, a pressing international matter was at hand — the Iranian hostage crisis in 1980 and the threat of terrorism now — making voters reluctant to take a chance on an unknown commodity. At the end of the 1980 campaign, though, the dam broke. And strategists in both parties think it has — or is about to break again.“Once he passed the threshold on national security, that was it,” Robert Shrum, a Democratic consultant, said of Mr. Obama.But Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, said this year was different from 1980 in one important way: While Mr. Obama has improved his standing with the American public during this campaign and the debates, Mr. McCain has hurt his. Polls show that in particular he lost ground over his response to the economic crisis and his choice of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as a running mate. Still, Mr. Kohut said, the comparisons with Reagan were telling.“It’s somewhat of a breakthrough for Obama and somewhat of a collapse for McCain,” Mr. Kohut said. “So it’s not only people feeling better about Obama — as it was with Reagan in 1980 — but also people feeling less comfortable with McCain.”Another difference between the two campaigns is that in 1980, there was just one debate, and it took place the Thursday before Election Day. “The race held to the end,” said Tad Devine, a Democratic consultant. “And than the debate happened and boom — it just moved. “This time, the final debate of three is three weeks before Election Day, meaning that the shift to Mr. Obama has been more gradual and that Mr. McCain has, at least in theory, time to recover.“But I think this time, after the next debate, people will feel that they’ve seen enough and make their decision,” Mr. Devine said.'"

"'08-10-15,'0','HONG KONG — Asian stock markets fell modestly on Wednesday as analysts and investors digested the details of the massive bailout plans in the United States, and as the poor state of the global economy returned to center stage.In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index, which had rocketed 14.1 percent Tuesday in its biggest-ever one-day jump, eased 1.4 percent Wednesday morning.The prospect of recession in Japan returned Wednesday, with data for August showing Japan’s current account surplus shrank 52.5 percent, more than economists had expected.More alarming for the export-dependent Japanese economy, exports during the month edged up only 0.9 percent, while imports soared 20.2 percent from a year earlier, mostly because of higher oil prices.Although a fall in oil prices in recent weeks will have helped importers of the raw material in September, export volumes are expected to soften further as overseas demand, hurt by slowing global growth, falls.Exporters like the leading carmakers Honda, Toyota and Mazda have been hard hit by falling overseas demand, and were among the biggest decliners in Tokyo on Wednesday.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','Mr. Harper was blindsided, however, by the recent turmoil in financial markets. Canada’s banks have avoided the troubles experienced in the United States and Europe, but the Toronto Stock Exchange has gyrated with its counterparts elsewhere.If anything, Mr. Harper made an undesirable situation even worse for his party by projecting an attitude of nonchalance.During a debate, he found himself on the defensive after saying, “What Canadians are worried about right now is not the job situation, not losing their home like in the U.S.” Their concerns, he said, were limited to their investments.Later, in a television interview, he suggested that the world’s economic problems might not be all bad. “I think there are probably some gains to be made in the stock market,” Mr. Harper said.Canadians do not vote directly for a political party or the prime minister, but elect a local member of the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament.For Mr. Harper to achieve a majority in Parliament, it was essential for him to expand from his base in Western Canada and substantially improve his party’s standing in Ontario and Quebec, which control 181 of the 308 seats.The current economic uncertainty has been a particular concern in parts of Ontario where industries rely heavily on exports to the United States.A rise in the value of the Canadian dollar over the last two years made many of those factories much less competitive. The economic slowdown in the United States has only aggravated the problem.Peter Donolo, a former official in a Liberal government who now is an executive at the Strategic Counsel, a polling firm, said the perception of Mr. Harper in Quebec reversed during the campaign, from 60 percent approval to 60 percent disapproval.“The support just evaporated,” Mr. Donolo said. “He chased away Quebec votes kind of off-handedly.”French-speaking Quebecers reacted poorly to suggestions by Mr. Harper that artists were members of the elite who spent too much time at government-financed galas. A proposal to stiffen penalties for young people who commit crimes also found little following in the province.The collapse of the Conservatives in Quebec helped the separatist Bloc Québécois, which had been written off by some of its supporters as the election began, retain 48 of the 51 seats it won in 2006.But the Liberal campaign had its share of problems. The party was led for the first time by Mr. Dion, a former academic. He has vigorously opposed Quebec separatism, which made him unpopular in many parts of his home province. His often peculiar English sometimes made him difficult to understand.The Liberals’ biggest problem was the key element of their platform. Mr. Dion proposed controlling greenhouse gas emissions by introducing a carbon tax on all fossil fuels except gasoline.Under Mr. Dion’s plan, the revenue would be used to reduce income taxes. The Conservatives relentlessly attacked the plan as a tax grab.Adding to Mr. Dion’s woes was the resurgence of two other left-of-center parties. The New Democratic Party, supported by organized labor and led by Jack Layton, won 37 seats, according to incomplete results, up from 29.The Green Party had an unusually high profile during the campaign, but won no seats.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','The top reasons cited by those who said they thought less of Mr. McCain were his recent attacks and his choice of Gov. of as his running mate. (The vast majority said their opinions of Mr. Obama of , the Democratic nominee, and Mr. McCain of , the Republican nominee, had remained unchanged in recent weeks.) But in recent days, Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin have scaled back their attacks on Mr. Obama, although Mr. McCain suggested he might aggressively take on Mr. Obama in Wednesday’s debate.With the election unfolding against the backdrop of an extraordinary economic crisis, a lack of confidence in government, and two wars, the survey described a very inhospitable environment for any Republican to run for office. More than 8 in 10 Americans do not trust the government to do what is right, the highest ever recorded in a Times/CBS News poll. And Mr. McCain is trying to keep the White House in Republican hands at a time when President Bush’s job approval rating is at 24 percent, hovering near its historic low.While the poll showed Mr. Obama with a 14 percentage-point lead among likely voters in a head-to-head matchup with Mr. McCain, when and Bob Barr, the Libertarian candidate, were included in the question, the race narrowed slightly, with 51 percent of those surveyed saying that they were supporting Mr. Obama and 39 percent supporting Mr. McCain, with Mr. Nader getting the support of 3 percent and Mr. Barr 1 percent. Other national polls have shown Mr. Obama ahead by a smaller margin.The poll suggested that the overwhelming about the economy and distrust of government have created a potentially poisonous atmosphere for members of Congress. Only 43 percent of those surveyed said that they approved of their own representative’s job performance, which is considerably lower than approval ratings have been at other times of historic discontent. By way of comparison, just before the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994, 56 percent of those polled said that they approved of the job their representative was doing.And after nearly eight years of increasingly unpopular Republican rule in the White House, 52 percent of those polled said that they held a favorable view of the , compared with 37 percent who said they held a favorable view of the . Voters said they preferred Democrats to Republicans when it came to questions about who would better handle the issues that are of the greatest concern to voters — including the economy, health care and the war in .The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Friday through Monday with 1,070 adults, of whom 972 were registered voters, and it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for both groups.After several weeks in which the McCain campaign sought to tie Mr. Obama to , a founder of the Weather Underground terrorism group, 64 percent of voters said that they had either read or heard something about the subject. But a majority said they were not bothered by Mr. Obama’s background or past associations. Several people said in follow-up interviews that they felt that Mr. McCain’s attacks on Mr. Obama were too rooted in the past, or too unconnected to the nation’s major problems.“What bothers me is that McCain initially talked about running a campaign on issues and I want to hear him talk about the issues,” said Flavio Lorenzoni, a 59-year-old independent from Manalapan, N.J. “But we’re being constantly bombarded with attacks that aren’t relevant to making a decision about what direction McCain would take the country. McCain hasn’t addressed the real issues. He’s only touched on them very narrowly. This is a time when we need to address issues much more clearly than they ever have been in the past.”The poll found that Mr. Obama is now supported by majorities of men and independents, two groups that he has been fighting to win over. And the poll found, for the first time, that white voters are just about evenly divided between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama, who, if elected, would be the first black president. The poll found that Mr. Obama is supported by 45 percent of white voters — a greater percentage than has voted for Democrats in recent presidential elections, according to exit polls.Mr. McCain was viewed unfavorably by 41 percent of voters, and favorably by 36 percent. Ms. Palin’s favorability rating is now 32 percent, down 8 points from last month, and her unfavorable rating climbed nine percentage points to 41 percent. Mr. Obama’s favorability rating, by contrast, is now at 50 percent, the highest recorded for him thus far by The Times and CBS News.There were still some strong findings for Mr. McCain. Sixty-four percent of voters polled said Mr. McCain, 72, was well-prepared for the presidency, which has been a central theme of his campaign. Fifty-one percent said Mr. Obama, 47, was.But roughly 7 in 10 voters said Mr. Obama had the right kind of temperament and personality to be president; just over half said the same of Mr. McCain.Mr. Obama’s supporters continued to be more enthusiastic about him than Mr. McCain’s supporters, the poll found, and more of those surveyed said they had confidence in Mr. Obama than in Mr. McCain to make the right decisions about the economy and health care. And while more than 6 in 10 said Mr. Obama understood the needs and problems of people like them, more than half said Mr. McCain did not.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','Another said, “What in the world is this volunteer thinking?”But Ms. Vance’s efforts reflect the complex task that many volunteers canvassing for Mr. Obama face. While she and other Obama volunteers may feel offended by remarks like Ms. Mendive’s, an admonishment would not persuade a voter on the fence to pull the lever for Mr. Obama. So she often takes another tack.“I meet people like that from time to time,” Ms. Vance said later. She described one woman she met who explained that she knew herself to be “prejudiced,” had come to abhor that quality in herself, and also saw it reflected through her young son, “who she said was full of hate,” Ms. Vance explained.“We sat and talked at her kitchen table for a long time that day,” Ms. Vance recalled. “I tried to explain to her that maybe the only way to heal those years of hatred and prejudice was to finally make the move and vote for Obama.”David W. Nickerson, a professor of political science at Notre Dame who studies campaign voter outreach, called it unusual for someone to admit racial bias to a stranger. A person from the community where the voter lives might be more persuasive on racial issues, he said.“If you were going to persuade someone on an issue like race,” Professor Nickerson said, “I’d imagine that it would have to come from a credible source. Having it come from someone you know or someone from your neighborhood that represents.”Darry A. Sragow, a political consultant based in Los Angeles who has worked on various Democratic campaigns, said volunteers were generally trained to “shift the discussion from anything that sounds like it may be race-based to arguments that are working best for the Obama campaign, like the economy.”He added: “It’s like selling a car. You’re not going to convince them it’s a beautiful car if they think its ugly. But you get back to whatever the strongest points are. You don’t get far trying to convince someone that something they think of as negative is positive.”Another person who posted a comment in response to the nytimes.com blog item from Elko wrote: “I’m canvassing for Obama. If this issue comes up, even if obliquely, I emphasize that Obama is from a multiracial background and that his father was an African intellectual, not an American from the inner city. I explain that Obama has never aligned himself solely with African-American interests — not on any issue — but rather has always sought to find a middle ground.”'"
"'08-10-15,'0','Compensation experts say that the provisions, though politically prudent to appease public anger, will probably have little real impact on how financial executives are paid in coming years.They predict banks will simply pay higher taxes and will find other creative ways of paying their executives as they see fit. Some say there could even be a sudden surge in compensation as soon as the government program ends, in a few years, leading to eye-popping numbers down the road.“Congress’s record of regulating executive pay has been unblemished by success,” said Kevin J. Murphy, a finance professor at the University of Southern California, pointing to perverse outcomes of past efforts.When Congress limited the tax deductibility of cash salaries to $1 million, for example, it simply led to an explosion in stock options used as compensation and even higher total payouts.Like other experts, Professor Murphy expects the $500,000 cap to be largely ignored, with banks willing to accept the tax consequences. For many of the top executives, such a salary would simply not be competitive: “$500,000 was supposed to be a good week,” he said, adding that many of these executives would respond to such suggestions by leaving for jobs at unregulated banks or hedge funds.But what Treasury cannot easily achieve under its plan might be achieved temporarily by the weak economy, falling stock prices and frustrated boards who are pressured by shareholders disgusted over past excess, say some experts. “The market may take care of it just by default,” said Paul Hodgson, a senior analyst at the Corporate Library, a governance research group.The government’s sudden sweeping presence may prod some boards to take a harder line, said Charles M. Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware. “Every board is going to be under tremendous pressure on compensation, by shareholders and by the government’s investment.”Some of those discussions have already begun among board members, said Ira T. Kay, a compensation specialist at Watson Wyatt Worldwide. “These rules will have a chilling effect on executive pay practices,” he said.Severance payments have begun to fall, he said, and he predicts there will be “much more downward pressure.”Of course, there have been past predictions that executive pay would be crimped, but that effect tended to be a more short-term reaction to weak business results, as companies and executives simply adapted.“Every prediction of the demise of C.E.O. pay has been overstated,” said Professor Murphy. After the dot-com bubble burst, for example, executives no longer made significant sums through stock options but turned instead to restricted stock. Compensation soon moved upward.The new Treasury rules, which still need to be clarified, also provide some broad guidelines, requiring the banks that get government capital to make sure their compensation packages do not reward excessive risk-taking and instituting a “claw-back” rule to force repayment of compensation that was based on results that later prove to be inaccurate.Exactly how some of these provisions will work is unclear, as well as how Treasury will eventually enforce them.Along with banks that get government capital, banks that participate in the government’s program to buy targeted assets will have limits on compensation. Banks that sell the government more than $300 million in assets will face significant taxes if they offer a golden parachute to a departing executive.Michael Useem, a professor at the Wharton School, said that while the Treasury proposals have shortcomings in addressing inflated pay packages, Congress had to do something. “The bigger concern is the need for strong political support of the bailout agenda,” he said.Banks ignore the provisions at their peril, he argued. “The spirit of the provision is quite clear,” he said. “If executives begin to not follow the spirit of the provisions, they will politically weaken support for what is being done.”'"
"'08-10-15,'0','Nathaniel Persily, a law professor at Columbia, said Justice Kennedy’s comments were a good guide to the case’s probable outcome, as he has been the swing vote in similar cases.“Justice Kennedy seemed frustrated with the potential slippery slope that the state was falling down,” said Professor Persily, who attended the argument and had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case supporting neither party. “In race and redistricting cases in particular, and in redistricting cases in general, he has been the critical justice.”In its decision last year, the North Carolina Supreme Court applied a strict numerical-majority requirement and rejected the district. The appeal in the case, Bartlett v. Strickland, No. 07-689, was filed by North Carolina’s attorney general, Roy Cooper, and other state officials. They said that nothing in the text of the federal law, its purpose or the court’s earlier cases mandated a numerical-majority requirement.Several justices seemed to agree, saying or suggesting that a 50 percent requirement had the usual costs and benefits of what lawyers call “bright line rules.” They are easy to apply, but they can be arbitrary and inflexible.The federal government, although it appeared in support of the residents of Pender County, N.C., who had successfully challenged the district in question, said a 50 percent requirement was too rigid. The underlying census data, the federal government said in its brief, can be subject to sampling errors and undercounting, and the data are in any event a historical snapshot that does not take account of changing demographics later.“We would impose about a 2 percent cushion,” Daryl Joseffer, an assistant to the United States solicitor general, said Tuesday.Justice Stephen G. Breyer proposed yet another number, one tied to the amount of crossover voting from whites needed to elect the minority group’s preferred candidate. “There’s a kind of natural stopping place,” he said. “When I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural stopping place fell around 42-43 percent.”Justice John Paul Stevens said all rigid mathematical rules had a common flaw. They assume, he said, “that the minority communities throughout the country are all alike.”The court took no action on Tuesday in a case from West Virginia concerning campaign spending and judicial recusal. The case, Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Company, No. 08-22, concerns what role the federal Constitution ought to play, if any, in determining whether a State Supreme Court justice must disqualify himself from a $50 million case against a coal company after receiving more $3 million in campaign support from the company’s chief executive.The court will again consider whether to hear the case at its private conference on Friday.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','The son of a severe Presbyterian minister, he decried the culture of bonuses in finance and promised that high pay would be reined in at government-owned banks. As a student of international finance, he argued for the formation of a global body to oversee today’s complex capital flows.And, forgetting for the moment his past enthusiasm for the free-wheeling global capitalism championed by Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, whom Mr. Brown has called a mentor, he took full credit where he seemed to feel credit was due.“We defined the problem as strengthening the banks so that they could deal with their bad assets,” he said of his plan of injecting money directly into banks in return for the government’s taking ownership shares. He argued that the issue was not only providing additional funds for the banking system but also getting banks themselves to lend again to their business customers and consumers alike.Then he dropped the names of those that had fallen in line with the Brown approach: much of Europe, Australia, New Zealand and, on Tuesday, too late for him to name it, Hong Kong.Not to mention the United States, he added, saying that he would soon speak to President Bush, who went on television Tuesday morning to endorse a remarkably similar plan from his Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.“I am pleased that countries around the world have moved to these proposals,” Mr. Brown concluded.A British head of government does not typically attract the notice of his European and American counterparts. And that is particularly true of Mr. Brown, who takes pride in his flintiness and his sharp contrast to Mr. Blair.He sat alone at a table, dressed in a loose-fitting suit and a featureless tie, more technocrat than politician as he gave a short lesson on the roots of the mortgage crisis, touching on topics including triple-A rated mortgage securities, the Bretton Woods agreement that established the post-World War II global economic framework, and the demand for oil in China and India.But the more than 100 journalists in his audience were in no mood for lectures.Would you call yourself a superhero? a reporter asked. What do you think of Paul Krugman, the Princeton professor and Op-Ed page columnist for The New York Times, who was just awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics referring to you as the savior of the world? Are you planning to call a snap election?He could not help but wallow a bit. The FTSE 100 stock index was up strongly from its recent lows, and even the British pound had reversed its downward trend.In response to one awestruck question on Tuesday, Mr. Brown was characteristically cautious. “I’m grateful for your deep interest in my personal fate,” he said. “But politics is about ups and downs, and you need to treat them both with equanimity.”Until the last few days, it was mostly down. Less than a year ago, during one particularly vicious round of parliamentary debate, an opposition party member said that Mr. Brown had gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean, the bumbling British comedian, creating chaos out of order instead of the reverse.In interviews, Mr. Brown has compared his crisis management to that of Captain MacWhirr in Joseph Conrad’s “Typhoon,” who knowingly sailed his ship into the great storm before him. He was a man of “literal mind” and “dauntless temperament,” wrote Conrad, but who also had “just enough imagination to carry him through each successive day, and no more.”Despite his powerful intellect — he entered college at 16 and has a Ph.D. in history — and his 10 years overseeing a once ascendant British economy, Mr. Brown has repeatedly suffered by comparison with Mr. Blair.But now, in contrast to Mr. Blair’s decision to follow President Bush in the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Brown is hoping to achieve a greater stature for Britain by asserting his independence, coming up with a plan that veered from Washington’s approach but then was followed by the Bush administration almost to the letter.Not content to stop there, however, Mr. Brown is calling for a supranational body to address the “lack of transparency, accountability and responsibility” that led to the crisis.That may be fine talk, but regulatory specialists are not clear how it will actually happen.“Mr. Brown has a good record on this topic,” said Sir Howard Davies, director of the London School of Economics and former chairman of Britain’s top regulator, the Financial Services Authority. “But I am not sure that you can turn the International Monetary Fund into a super regulator.”At the moment, the combined efforts of Mr. Brown and Alistair Darling — his equally dyspeptic chancellor, who just two months ago was ridiculed for saying that Britain’s economic downturn could be the worst in 60 years — seem to be in tune with a revulsion that Britons express about their high-flying bankers.Still, there is no doubt that Mr. Brown is more comfortable discussing reform of the International Monetary Fund than sipping tea with a middle-class couple in Birmingham who are overwhelmed by soaring electricity bills and mortgage payments.Unlike Mr. Blair and Bill Clinton, he is not good at feeling other people’s pain, although he has had his share of suffering. A kick in the head during a rugby game when he was 16 caused him to lose sight in his left eye; he was forced to wait all those years before becoming prime minister; and most recently he lost his first child.And no matter how much the international community may cheer him, Mr. Brown must ultimately face a deeply discontented British electorate before June 2010. But finally, things are looking up.As the press conference came to an end, a Swedish journalist asked Mr. Brown if he was Flash Gordon. He made the quickest of smiles and his faced flushed an immediate red.“No, just Gordon,” he said. “Just Gordon.”'"

"'08-10-15,'0','Another medical products company, Abbott, is set to announce its earnings Wednesday morning. Many analysts predict those numbers will also be strong, largely because of the company’s Xience drug-coated heart stent, a device that has become popular among interventional cardiologists, Mr. Roman said.Xience’s success is coming in part at the expense of Johnson & Johnson’s Cypher stent, which is one of the rare devices in the company’s portfolio that did not show solid growth.In Johnson & Johnson’s earnings call with analysts on Tuesday, Dominic J. Caruso, the chief financial officer, said that the company’s access to commercial paper had been unfettered and available at what he called “very, very good” rates. That could bode well for other health products companies.“That’s important,” said Ronny Gal, a pharmaceuticals analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “The markets are not frozen for health care companies.”Mr. Gal said the news could mean that Teva, the Israeli maker of generic drugs, would have no problem completing its pending $7.5 billion acquisition of Barr Laboratories, another generic maker. To finance that deal, Teva plans to raise more than $2 billion, Mr. Gal said.Johnson & Johnson announced sales of $15.9 billion for the third quarter, up 6.4 percent from a year earlier. The company said it earned $3.31 billion, or $1.17 a share in the third quarter, compared with $2.55 billion, or 88 cents a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had been expecting earnings of $1.11 a share. Excluding special charges, the company’s net earnings for the quarter increased 7.6 percent compared with last year’s period.Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., also raised its guidance for the year.. The company increased its earnings guidance for full-year 2008 to $4.50 to $4.53 a share. Its previous forecast ranged from $4.45 to $4.50 a share.Johnson & Johnson’s shares were up more than 2 percent Tuesday, closing at $64.The company said its results improved despite generic competition to its Duragesic painkiller patch and its schizophrenia medication Risperdal, as well as sales declines in Europe for its injectable anemia medication Epogen.The company’s acquisition in December 2006 of Pfizer’s consumer products division — which included the Listerine line of products — seems to be a successful move, with the company citing strength in that part of its business.Among strong sellers for Johnson & Johnson during the quarter was Zyrtec, an over-the-counter allergy treatment that the company introduced this year. Zyrtec was part of the Pfizer consumer products acquisition. Also in that acquisition was Listerine mouthwash, another strong seller.Consumer products generally are steadier and less risky than pharmaceuticals, with lower research and development costs, fewer regulatory demands, lower litigation costs and less impact from generic competition.Eli Lilly, for example, recently announced it would pay $70 a share, or $6.5 billion, for ImClone Systems, the maker of the cancer drug Erbitux. The price was considered high, but the move was thought to be critical to Lilly, which faces the loss of patent exclusivity on its best-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug in 2011.Lilly “is between a rock and a hard place from the standpoint that it desperately needs to get new product into its portfolio,” Dr. Timothy Anderson, another pharmaceutical analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note to clients. Lilly reports its earnings on Oct. 23.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','YOU would think that chefs trained in French technique, in which slowly simmered stocks are the carefully concocted foundations of almost every dish, would find it laughable to rely on a quickly steeped broth of kelp and dried fish.But that Japanese broth, dashi, is finding a place in the kitchens of many Western chefs.“It’s basically water, but fantastically perfumed water,” said Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin. He complements Kumamoto oysters with dashi gelée, finishes mushrooms with the stock, and brushes it on raw fish before layering on olive oil and citrus. “The dashi is invisible,” he said, “but it brings more depth.”At Per Se, its chef de cuisine, Jonathan Benno, weds the stock to preparations of Japanese fish, like a grilled hamachi belly canapé with dashi poured tableside. Jean-Georges Vongerichten adds dashi to a light mayonnaise at Perry St., and at Jean Georges he accents caramelized sirloin, grilled foie gras and slow-cooked snapper with it. “I realized its umami flavor can go anywhere,” Mr. Vongerichten said.Kelp and bonito are loaded with umami, the taste of mouthwatering savoriness.Dashi, which simply means “stock” in Japanese, is prepared from many ingredients. But dashi made from kelp and bonito holds pride of place. For much of Japan’s history, eating meat was taboo. So instead of animal fats and butter, which flavor Western cooking, dashi evolved to infuse umami-rich taste.Kelp, called kombu in Japan, grows for up to two years before being dried into cardboard-thick green-black ribbons. Japanese bonito (skipjack tuna) is filleted, boiled, smoked, covered in mold and sun-dried to the hardness of oak — a technique dating from the 1600s — then shaved into translucent flakes.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','If you hit Candle 79’s best dishes — which means bypassing that burger — it can. And it unfolds in a comfortable two-story town house on East 79th Street with many booths, a long banquette upstairs and a general air of relaxation that’s in sync with the low-impact cuisine.After a series of recent meals here, I’m not ready to relinquish my Roquefort or swear off sirloins: I’m just not that virtuous. But I’ll admit that I, like most of my restaurant-critic kin, haven’t given vegan cuisine its due. Candle 79, which has prospered for five years without benefit of major reviews, showed me the light, or maybe I should say lite.A vegan diet, for the less nutritionally erudite out there, bars not just flesh but the bequests of anything fleshy: eggs, dairy. It’s vegetarianism for real sticklers, a blessing to the colon but a hurdle for any hedonistic cook. Although tofu and coconut milk are lovely ingredients, they’re not about to usurp the traditional components of custard. Although a cashew cheese has its (modest) charms, it won’t have Brie running scared any time soon.But Candle 79 takes a limited larder and stages an impressive show, reminding the pork-stuffed, duck-spoiled diner how much else is out there, and how much of it has never relied on animals or fish in the first place.Hummus doesn’t, and Candle 79’s excellent recipe for it includes a generous measure of smoked paprika. The tawny, creamy (figuratively) spread comes with grilled paratha bread and olives, more than half a dozen of them, fat and green and irresistible.Candle 79’s guacamole timbale, a round mold supplemented with black beans, would do any Mexican place proud.The restaurant gets top-notch produce from top-tier farms, and it’s lavish with a laudable array of mushrooms used in a variety of ways. In one appealing appetizer there were grilled trumpet royale mushrooms, served with crispy onion rings. In another there were fried oyster mushrooms. Candle 79 leaves no part of the garden untouched, no patch of the forest unplumbed.As for that wheat gluten, it’s called seitan and it indeed does an honorable impersonation of meat when massaged into the form of a cutlet, as it was in an entree of seitan piccata, vibrant with lemon and salty with capers, which are what a piccata is really all about. Chicken and veal needn’t come to the party. It’s only slightly less festive without them.Spiced thoroughly enough, seitan can sub effectively for sausage, as it did in the paella, which traded shellfish for summer corn and found all the additional flavor it needed in a saffron and red pepper sauce.But seitan didn’t work as well as skewered kebabs with a chimichurri sauce. The kebabs weren’t thick enough to create as chewy a mass as they seemed meant to, and they lacked seasoning. Lamb would do better at this party, which is something of a bust without it.That’s the drawback of a vegan menu: for a meat eater, such comparisons are inevitable, and they’re encouraged by the meaty nomenclature.And across a meal at Candle 79, there can be considerable redundancy and some monotony. In late summer I had more corn and tomatoes coming at me than I had the appetite for. A chickpea cake entree represented a few chickpeas too many.Some ideas don’t pan out. The burger didn’t hold together — it was more a sloppy Joe, or messy Jim — though it had a clever touch. The bottom side of the top half of the bun had been partially hollowed out, so that the loose patty could rise into it rather than being squeezed out the sides when you grabbed hold of the sandwich.The cashew cheese and cashew sour cream with zucchini enchiladas didn’t banish longings for dairy, and the crust on a peach and apple pie was a bland, mushy disappointment.But cinnamon ice cream could have been the real thing, and a chocolate and peanut butter dessert — recently replaced by a chocolate, almond and coconut one — could have passed muster in a less restrictive restaurant.There are interesting wines and beers, priced reasonably, as is the food. Servers communicate genuine enthusiasm. I can’t speak to their diets away from Candle 79, but they seem sold on the regimen that it and a nearby sibling restaurant, Candle Cafe, adhere to. That regimen has its rigors, but it’s not without its rewards.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','PARIS — If there is a bright spot amid the chaos in the financial markets, it is that it helps to settle a debate among economists about the outlook for the European economy.Even before the credit crisis exploded back into the headlines last month with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, European economists were increasingly pessimistic about regional prospects. With the financial sector’s problems weighing directly on the broader economy, many economists say Europe is already in recession and will be lucky to get out of it by summer.There will be no official confirmation until Nov. 14, when Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, announces third-quarter growth figures, but the agency said Tuesday that industrial production in the euro zone fell 0.7 percent in August compared with output in the month a year earlier.Gross domestic product in France contracted by 0.1 percent in the third quarter, the French central bank said, reversing the previous estimate of an increase of 0.1 percent. That means France has joined Spain, Ireland and Denmark in posting two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, a widely accepted definition of recession.And the ZEW research institute said its economic sentiment indicator for Germany tumbled this month by 21.9 points, to minus 63.0, a number suggesting tough times ahead. The institute, based in Mannheim, Germany, did note, however, some indications that sentiment had improved somewhat after the announcement Monday of taxpayer bailouts for the global financial system.The German finance minister, Peer Steinbrück, acknowledged the danger that the country’s economy, which declined in the second quarter, might be heading into recession, saying such fears were not “mere pessimism.”'"
"'08-10-15,'0','Intel, the world’s largest producer of semiconductors, reported a strong third-quarter profit Tuesday but cautioned that the global economic downturn could hurt its business in the coming months.Intel executives noted weaker-than-expected sales of chips used in corporate computers. The company saw “softness” in September and continued to receive “mixed signals” from customers, said Intel’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, during a conference call with analysts.“It is clear that the financial crisis is creating some signs of stress that may impact our business,” Mr. Otellini said. “Some customers in the channel are seeing little to no impact. Some of them are worried.”Mr. Otellini’s caution is notable because he is usually more upbeat than his peers in the technology industry. Because Intel’s chips go into a wide range of business and personal computers, the company is seen as a technology bellwether. In recent weeks, major tech companies like I.B.M. and Oracle have been optimistic about their prospects despite the economic slump, while others, like SAP and Dell, have painted a gloomier picture.For the third quarter, which ended Sept. 27, Intel posted net income of $2.01 billion, up 12 percent from the $1.79 billion reported in the period last year. On a per-share basis, net income was 35 cents, up 17 percent from 30 cents a year ago. The results slightly exceeded the 34 cents a share expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','It is a story with victims but no clear villains.Investment advisers marketed certificates aggressively, luring people out of their safe but low-paying savings accounts. One selling point was the fact that rating agencies that rated Lehman highly until the moment it fell apart.And German small investors did exactly what thousands of investment bankers did with the credit derivatives that have laid global finance so low: they purchased something without fathoming the risk.But no government is likely to recapitalize Mr. Berkling or anyone else as officials have promised to do with banks. These small investors stand little chance of getting money out of Lehman’s bankruptcy proceedings, either.They face an uphill battle in suing the banks who sold the certificates, lawyers said.“This is the end,” Volker Pietsch, director of the Berlin Institute, said. “Certificate holders will get nothing.”Certificates emerged from the rubble of the technology bust as a means to lure loss-scarred Germans back into financial markets. In essence, they are structured financial products, scaled-down versions of the wholesale financial instruments that bankers use to manage risks.With their official-sounding name, certificates were built around a soothing marketing message that they were safer than stocks — a vital point for risk-averse Germans. They are traded on small German exchanges.The current outstanding volume of certificates is about 130 billion euros in Germany, by far the largest retail market in the world, according to the German Derivatives Association. There are 340,000 different types, issued by big European and American banks, but the current tough times may change that.“It’s like 2002 when people said ‘No more stocks,’ ” said Reinhard Bellet, managing director for derivatives markets at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. “New sales are way down.”Some types of certificates ensure that investors get back at least the amount they put in, in return for limiting their gains if the stock or index to which they were tied — known as the “underlyings” — went up. Others permit investors to buy the underlyings at a discount in return for agreeing to accept less than the full amount of any future gain.Still others let investors profit from falling prices, allowing them to “short sell” in the manner of a professional investor.Crucially, the retail investor does not own the underlying stock or index fund directly, which belongs to the issuing bank. Certificates take the form of a bearer bond — a slice of the instruments engineered by the bank — and depend on the creditworthiness of the issuer.Lehman Brothers did not sell directly to German customers. That was a task handled by big banks like Dresdner Bank or Citibank, and small trusted ones like the Frankfurter Sparkasse, known as Fraspa, where Mr. Berkling had done his banking for over 40 years.Fraspa is one of dozens of local, municipally owned savings banks that enjoy immense trust among ordinary Germans. Mr. Berkling, 66, had more than 35,000 euros in an account that paid a decent interest rate.But in February, Mr. Berkling agreed to purchase two separate certificates, both linked to the DAX, Germany’s benchmark stock index.One promised yearly payouts based on how high the DAX rose, while the other limited potential losses if the DAX fell. Both originated with Lehman.“That I would simply lose the money if the bank went under was not a topic,” Mr. Berkling said.Fraspa, in response, says that all its customers were advised of the “chances and risks” inherent in certificates. A spokesman noted that all major ratings agencies gave Lehman good marks until it collapsed.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','Using blocks of aluminum as the starting point for laptop cases resolved much of the speculation among Apple enthusiasts surrounding the term “brick.”Many of them had thought the term described an entirely new product.In July, the company’s chief financial officer said the company would shift its business model toward lower-profit-margin products in the future.Because Apple did not announce products with significantly lower prices, speculation is still centered on products in new categories. “This is only part of the story,” Mr. Jobs said in an interview after the news conference.Mr. Jobs deflected questions both on the company’s financial state, saying that it would report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings next week, and on his health. He displayed a slide showing that his blood pressure was 110 over 70, adding that questions about his health would cause his blood pressure to rise.Since appearing gaunt and pale at a previous Apple introduction earlier this year, Mr. Jobs’s health has been the subject of intense interest. The company and Mr. Jobs have responded by saying that he has not had a recurrence of pancreatic cancer, which he battled four years ago.Mr. Jobs looked thin Tuesday, but otherwise healthy and energetic.Apple’s challenge, industry analysts said, remains the company’s ability to defy gravity if consumers begin to spend less on electronics.Apple has usually been considered uniquely positioned to weather the impending crisis because its highly designed products appeal to an affluent consumer less likely to be affected by an economic downturn. But unintentionally, the company may have another advantage. A delay in refreshing its laptop product line created pent-up demand for its computers.Apple says its computers account for 17.6 percent of the American retail market by volume and 31.3 percent by revenue.A strong product introduction during the current quarter seems to be likely, according to a number of analysts.On Monday, A. M. Sacconaghi, a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, upgraded Apple’s stock and predicted it would outperform the market.“Apple’s short-term financials are likely to remain relatively healthy despite economic weakness,” he said.On Tuesday, shares of Apple rose more than $5 before falling, to end regular trading down $6.18 at $104.08. The shares were rising slightly in after-hours trading.Despite strong retail sales, the company’s stock had been hit hard by the broader market sell-off. Apple shares dropped to as low as $88.74 last week, from $189.96 in May.The company displayed an entry level $1,999 MacBook Pro model that comes with a glass touchpad to support a new set of finger gestures to control the computer, a 15.4-inch LED backlighted display and a range of other new features.Apple also plans to sell a 13-inch version based on its standard MacBook line, starting at $1,299.The new models are expected to go on sale in Apple’s retail stores on Wednesday.Apple said a new version of its thin MacBook Air with 50 percent more storage would start at $1,799. The company reduced the price of its white plastic MacBook portable by just $100, to $999.Mr. Jobs trumpeted Apple’s relationship with Nvidia, a maker of graphics processors. Several models of the new Macintosh computers will feature two graphics processors from Nvidia, which is also supplying the integrating chipset for the MacBook Pro and MacBook.A new Nvidia graphics processor offers five times the graphics power of the previous Intel graphics processors in the current MacBooks, he said.The shift is a significant one that raised questions about Apple’s relationship with Intel, which supplies the central processing unit for the Macintosh.Recently Nvidia has been under increasing pressure as Intel has moved to integrate graphics processing into its products.“This throws a lifeline to Nvidia,” said Nathan Brookwood, president of Insight 64, a consulting firm.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','The Bank of New York Mellon was named the master custodian firm overseeing the Treasury Department’s $700 billion bailout fund, the agency announced Tuesday.The master custodian bank will hold and track the distressed assets that the government will buy as well as run and report on the auctions used to buy the assets.Government officials called it the “prime contractor of the purchase program.”The announcement was the latest in a series of measures taken by the Treasury Department to try and unlock the frozen credit markets. On Monday, large American banks agreed to accept government investments totaling $125 billion. Another $125 billion will be invested in smaller banks.The Treasury also announced proposals to guarantee new debt issued by banks for three years, a move intended to encourage the banks to resume lending to one another and to customers.It also extended the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s coverage to fully guarantee deposits in accounts that do not bear interest, which are typically held by small and midsize businesses. Those moves bring the United States more closely in line with several European countries, which have adopted similar measures.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','As an example, Mr. Betheil said, students might tackle a project like building a wind turbine in New York by drawing on knowledge of social studies and architecture as well as physics and math. The new vision, however, does not require that such subjects be taught during distinct class periods — they might be part of hands-on workshops or field trips. As the city focuses on creating these career and technical schools of the future — education officials shun the term “vocational” — it must also tend to 26 existing schools in the old model, many of which continue to struggle in city and state assessments. In the last school year, 31,855 students were enrolled in 21 career and technical schools, which was 11 percent of high school students citywide; an additional 110,000 were in 285 part-time vocational programs housed within traditional high schools.While Mr. Betheil said the city would help the existing programs adapt to the new approach — one existing school will get a full makeover and be restarted as one of the four new schools next year — several principals of large career and technical schools said they felt left behind. They complained that the nearly $600 extra per student on average that they receive is not enough to buy equipment and address some of their students’ remedial learning needs, and that the city’s system of grading schools is insensitive to their challenges.Of the 18 technical schools that were graded in 2007, seven received C’s and three received F’s. Still, some, like Aviation High School in Long Island City, house highly successful academic programs and are considered model schools, and many have attendance rates above city averages.At Frances Perkins, which began this year with a ninth-grade class and is housed in Automotive High School in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, all 86 students come from low-income families and qualify for federally subsidized lunches. Javier Guzman, the school’s principal, estimated that a majority of the freshmen read below the fifth-grade level.Mr. Guzman, who previously taught creative writing at Automotive High School, made a special effort to recruit girls in the hope of getting a school that was evenly split by sex, in contrast to vocational schools’ typical population, which is predominantly male and minority. But he ended up with 23 girls and 63 boys, nearly all black and Hispanic, and many of the students of both sexes said they were there not because of a deep interest in carpentry but because they had not been accepted into their first-choice high schools.Mr. Guzman said that part of the challenge in attracting new groups of students was getting beyond the stigma associated with vocational education. He recalled meeting a carpenter who was considering sending his child to the school, but told Mr. Guzman: “I don’t want my son doing this.”In order for career and technical schools to draw a more diverse student body, Mr. Guzman said, the city will need to have models that are successful in traditional academic areas and in getting students jobs in trades. “The community needs to see these schools thrive,” he said. “Once they’re thriving not only in the technical world but academically as well, then that will be a viable option for families.”Merryl H. Tisch, vice chancellor of the state’s Board of Regents, said she would be tough in her evaluation of the city’s new career-oriented schools and was wary of handing out waivers to state graduation requirements. She said that in order for the new schools to gain exemptions, their proposals would have to demonstrate a commitment to building a diverse student body and strong ties to industrial groups.Ms. Tisch, who served on Mayor Bloomberg’s task force, said she was concerned about the perception of creating a different set of standards for different students.“Any youngster who is looking for an easy path to graduation, that’s not what this is,” she said. “These are not going to be the old vocational schools. These are not going to be lower paths to graduation.”Jeffrey Mirel, a professor of history and education at the University of Michigan who has studied the evolution of the American high school over the past century, said it would be difficult for New York’s new model to succeed.He said the underlying challenge in developing career and technical education was predicting future job markets and keeping equipment up to date.“Inherently, it is preparing kids for yesterday’s jobs because the market is changing,” he said. “Nobody can look into the future.”Still, proponents of the new emphasis on career and technical education note that some industries, including health care, have proved to be immune from market fluctuations.And even if they do not end up pursuing a trade, some students said they were happy to learn new tricks. At Frances Perkins, which is named for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s secretary of labor, the first female cabinet member, the carpentry classroom is so new that the first project for students was to construct a wood shop.“We’re learning a skill in class, about how to build things and make them look better,” said Christian A. Vargas, 15. “We can make pieces of wood into a table, a little block of wood we can sculpt into an art piece. That’ll always be useful.”'"
"'08-10-15,'0','Another medical products company, Abbott, is set to announce its earnings Wednesday morning. Many analysts predict those numbers will also be strong, largely because of the company’s Xience drug-coated heart stent, a device that has become popular among interventional cardiologists, Mr. Roman said.Xience’s success is coming in part at the expense of Johnson & Johnson’s Cypher stent, which is one of the rare devices in the company’s portfolio that did not show solid growth.In Johnson & Johnson’s earnings call with analysts on Tuesday, Dominic Caruso, the chief financial officer, said that the company’s access to commercial paper had been unfettered and available at what he called “very, very good” rates. That could bode well for other health products company.“That’s important,” said Ronny Gal, a pharmaceuticals analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “The markets are not frozen for health care companies.”Mr. Gal said the news could mean that Teva, the Israeli maker of generic drugs, would have no problem completing its pending $7.5 billion acquisition of Barr Laboratories, another generic maker. To finance that deal, Teva plans to raise more than $2 billion, Mr. Gal said.Johnson & Johnson announced sales of $15.9 billion for the third quarter, up 6.4 percent from a year earlier. Excluding special charges, the company said it earned $1.17 a share in the third quarter, versus 88 cents a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had been expecting earnings of $1.11 a share. Excluding special charges, the company’s net earnings for the quarter increased 7.6 percent compared with last year’s period.Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., also raised its guidance for the year.. The company increased its earnings guidance for full-year 2008 to $4.50 to $4.53 a share. Its previous forecast had ranged from $4.45 to $4.50 a share.Johnson & Johnson’s shares were up more than 2 percent Tuesday, closing at $64.The company said its results improved despite generic competition to its Duragesic painkiller patch and its schizophrenia medication Risperdal, as well as sales declines in Europe for its injectable anemia medication Epogen.The company’s acquisition in December 2006 of Pfizer’s consumer products division — which included the Listerine line of products — seems to be a successful move, with the company citing strength in that part of its business.Among strong sellers for Johnson & Johnson during the quarter was Zyrtec, an over-the-counter allergy treatment that the company introduced this year. Zyrtec was part of the Pfizer consumer products acquisition. Also in that acquisition was Listerine mouthwash, another strong seller.Consumer products generally are steadier and less risky than pharmaceuticals, with lower research and development costs, fewer regulatory demands, lower litigation costs and less impact from generic competition.Eli Lilly , for example, recently announced it would pay $70 a share, or $6.5 billion, for Imclone, the maker of the cancer drug Erbitux. The price was considered high, but the move was thought to be critical to Lilly, which faces the loss of patent exclusivity on its best-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug in 2011.Lilly “is between a rock and a hard place from the standpoint that it desperately needs to get new product into its portfolio,” Dr. Timothy Anderson, another pharmaceutical analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, in a note to clients. Lilly reports its earnings on Oct. 23.'"
"'08-10-15,'0','BLUE BELL, Pa.--Senator unveiled $52.5 billion in new economic proposals on Tuesday aimed at easing financial distress on the nation’s elderly, workers and the unemployed.In a plan in which most of the benefits would go to older voters, Mr. McCain proposed that people 59 and up who withdraw money from IRAs or 401(k) retirement plans in 2008 and 2009 pay a tax rate of 10 percent on the money rather than their higher normal rates. That part of the plan would cost $36 billion, based on the McCain campaign’s internal estimates.In addition, Mr. McCain proposed a reduction in the tax on long-term capital gains to 7.5 percent from 15 percent in 2009 and 2010 at an estimated cost of $10 billion; an acceleration in the tax write-off for stock losses, allowing Americans to deduct $15,000 in losses a year for the tax years 2008 and 2009 (current rules allow deductions up to $3,000 in losses); a suspension on the tax on unemployment insurance benefits in 2008 and 2009; and a government guarantee on 100 percent of all savings accounts for six months.“So much of this decline in our markets and value destruction was due to the failure of Congress and the Administration to come out with a timely rescue package,” Mr. McCain told a crowd at County Community College here. “Investors are always responsible for their investment decisions, but the hard-earned savings of Americans should not be penalized by the erratic behavior of politicians.”Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain’s chief economic policy adviser, said that Mr. McCain’s new steps were “targeted at people who have been hurt by the recent — seniors, savers, workers, people who are trying to get to college.”'"

He is also the chairman of the skin cancer advisory group for the American Cancer Society .Q: The incidence of melanoma appears to be increasing, especially among young women. What accounts for this rise?A: There are several trends, including greater sun exposure, going to sun-tanning booths and an emphasis in early detection that’s picking up more of the disease. Probably all three are playing a role.Q: Some doctors question whether sun exposure causes melanoma. Do we know how big of a risk it is for this type of skin cancer?A: There’s no real debate. Back in 1992 the World Health Organization convened an expert panel, and it concluded that ultraviolet light is a cause of melanoma. Now having said that, that doesn’t mean all melanomas are caused by ultraviolet rays. And indeed, we know some varieties of melanoma do not seem to be caused by it.There is controversy over what proportion of melanomas are caused by sun exposure. But there’s no question that ultraviolet light is a cause. It’s beyond dispute as far as I’m concerned. Sun exposure is the most important avoidable risk factor for melanoma.A: There’s good evidence that sunscreens may help prevent melanoma, but how effective they are is really poorly defined. In general, at least in the majority of melanomas, there seems to be a long lag period between ultraviolet exposure and the onset of the melanoma.So it’s hard to measure the effect of sunscreens, and there’s a lot we don’t know. I wouldn’t say that should you use sunscreen you will prevent melanoma, but you can reduce your risk.Q: What about other risk factors, like family history or having light skin? How important are these in causing melanoma?A: Family and personal history are both very important. Certain genes affect the susceptibility of developing melanoma and can be inherited. It’s not a strictly genetic disorder, meaning that if your father had it, you will have it. But people who have a family history of melanoma are at a markedly higher risk. In addition, if you had a melanoma before, you are at much higher risk of getting it again.The other major risk is irregular or larger moles. Having these, especially lots of large and irregular moles, can all increase your risk for melanoma.Q: If one of your family members has another type of skin cancer, like squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma, are you at higher risk for melanoma?A: They tend to go along separate lines to a large degree. But if you had a basal cell skin cancer before, for example, you have a higher risk for melanoma.Q: Many medical professionals recommend early detection of cancerous moles as the best way to catch melanoma in time. How good is your average person at spotting suspicious moles and then seeing a doctor?A: There are two things that are important for detecting melanoma. One is looking, and the other is seeing. Most people don’t even look. And in terms of looking, most don’t look at their skin in a thorough and systematic manner once a month, which is what’s recommended.We don’t expect people to look at a spot and say, “Oh, that’s a melanoma.” But if there’s a warning sign, then it makes sense to have a doctor check it out.Q: What are the main warnings signs?A: Spots that are new or changing in size, shape or color. Of if a mole looks different than the rest on your body.There are the classic warning signs, or ABCD: A for asymmetry; B for irregular borders; C for multiple colors; D for diameter being more than six millimeters, the size of a pencil eraser. Those signs aren’t used as much as before because they’re not really sensitive enough. They tend to pick up more advanced melanomas, and we’re trying to pick up earlier melanomas.The most important warning signs are newer, changing moles.Q: Where do cancerous moles mostly show up?A: They can be anywhere on your body. The back is a common place, but it can be anywhere. On the bottom of foot is not as common a spot, but it is the most common spot for brown skin colors.Q: Are there any downsides to screening, or is it better to be safe than sorry?A: Better to be safe than sorry. We recommend people self-screen and generally be aware of their own skin. It may result in a bunch of unnecessary trips to the doctor, and that’s a consequence.The actual definitive test to determine if a mole is a melanoma is to do a biopsy. That’s really good for accuracy, but obviously you don’t want to biopsy everything on your skin, because you would be one big scar.Q: Are there any high-tech devices that could help a person better track skin changes?A: There’s a lot on the market, but many of these devices are expensive and mainly for clinicians.Photography is helpful, and a camera is something you can obviously go and buy. Digital photos can be useful because if you’re looking for new lesions, having a picture of what your back used to look like, and then looking again later, can help you detect changes. You can put the photos on the Web, on Facebook or wherever.Q:. How long can you have melanoma before it’s no longer curable by surgery?A: Melanomas can grow in a month or two, or grow slowly over the years. We’re concerned if this is a melanoma lesion now, in which case it needs to be removed so you don’t suffer long-term consequences of an untreated cancer.Whenever a melanoma is diagnosed or suspected, it’s surgically removed, and that can be curative. Melanoma is dangerous once it spreads beyond that local area. Looking at the lesion we took out by surgery, we can try to determine the characteristics of the tumor.Q: If the cancer is caught late and cannot be cured by surgery, how effective are the current therapies at prolonging life?A: Whether or not the melanoma has spread to other parts of the body is very important. If it has spread to other distant sites, such as to the lung or the brain, then the prognosis is very poor. It’s very likely that the person will succumb to melanoma. It’s not 100 percent, but there’s less of a chance for survival at that point.Q: Is there any progress with new treatments, like vaccines or other therapies?A: There’s lots of active research. We hear from time to time of some promising possibilities. But at the moment, there’s no really good proven therapy for advanced disease.Q: So early detection is most important for finding melanomas in time and getting effective treatment?A: That’s the best way for sure.'"

"'08-10-16,'1','But for a punch to make a difference, the punch needs to do something to its target — to rattle, to wound, or (best of all) cause the opponent to counterpunch in a self-defeating way.If Mr. Obama, on the defensive, showed a bit more vim, vigor and vinegar than he had in the previous debates, he also remained calm, cool and collected for the most part — showing survival skills that he learned in his brutal 16-month battle for the nomination against a tough inside fighter, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. That is all Mr. Obama really needed to do to freeze the dynamics of the campaign in place during the debate — dynamics that by and large favor him.Mr. Obama had the easier task on Wednesday night: to keep the focus on the economy, to show that he could be trusted to change the direction of the country and to remain relaxed and steady. Indeed, perhaps his most crucial task was to appear bemused and unruffled in the face of Mr. McCain’s attacks, which the Obama campaign (and about everyone else who has seen the latest polls) predicted were coming.Mr. McCain, after starting off comfortably, seemed increasingly inconsistent and testy as the debate wore on. At one point he challenged Mr. Obama about whether he had ever stood up to leaders in his party — reflecting the concern among many voters that a President Obama and a Democratic-led Congress would impose one-party rule on the nation.Mr. Obama replied that he had supported tort reform, to the annoyance of many Democratic trial lawyers. But then Mr. McCain did himself little good by sounding churlish as he muttered “an overwhelming vote,” and then sounded like a schoolteacher as he added, “Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to leaders of your party isn’t very convincing.”There were several moments when Mr. McCain’s tactics and tone appeared not to help him. During a discussion of angry comments at rallies, Mr. McCain chose not to disavow such remarks, but rather to say “categorically, I’m proud of the people who come to our rallies.” He then noted that big rallies tended to attract “some fringe people.”And after Mr. Obama gave a long answer weaving together issues of climate change, foreign oil and trade, Mr. McCain opted at first to belittle him. “Well, you know, I — I — I admire so much Senator Obama’s eloquence, and you really have to pay attention to words.”Mr. McCain was more animated Wednesday night than he had been at the two other debates, though not always to his benefit in the split-screen presentation of television. His voice turned edgy at times, as when talking about Obama campaign attack advertisements, and his frozen smile and wide eyes — which blinked frequently and distractingly at times — seemed a little strange.By contrast, Mr. Obama responded to Mr. McCain’s lines of attacks by smiling and slightly shaking his head, but otherwise maintained a blank expression and an unfailing monotone. For those voters who like to fall in love with their politicians by finding a common humanity, Mr. Obama did not deliver at any of the three debates; he gave off very little heat, alluring or otherwise, and his composure had a certain flatness.At times even the debate moderator, Bob Schieffer of CBS, failed to tease out a reaction or reply from Mr. Obama that was anything less than controlled.Mr. Schieffer first asked a set of questions about the nasty tone of the campaign, and Mr. Obama noted that Mr. McCain’s running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, did not chastise the person at one of her rallies who yelled “kill him” in reference to Mr. Obama. Minutes later, talking about the vice-presidential candidates, Mr. Schieffer asked Mr. Obama whether Ms. Palin was qualified to be president.If Mr. Obama wanted to blow off steam, he did not show it, tweaking Ms. Palin instead by referring to her as a “capable politician” (as opposed to, say, a capable leader) and noted that “she has excited the base in the Republican Party” (a subtle to nod to her unpopularity with independent voters in some swing states).For some Republicans, the debate performance was Mr. McCain’s best, especially his moments of focus on the economy and taxes and Mr. Obama’s record. There was relief among Republicans, if not a declaration that Mr. McCain had turned his campaign in a winning direction.“Republicans want McCain to fight, but I think in this environment, McCain should almost ignore Obama and sell himself directly to America,” said Stuart Stevens, a Republican media consultant who had been an adviser on Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. “More Ali and less Joe Frazier.”Mr. McCain also seized on Mr. Obama’s recent conversation about taxes with an Ohio voter, who became known as Joe the Plumber during the debate. For all of Mr. McCain’s direct appeals to the Joes of America, and his direct slams on Mr. Ayers, it was the lack of direct damage to Mr. Obama that cheered Democrats after the debate. “It was a confused, ineffective, at times stumbling McCain who lost decisively to a presidential Obama,” said Robert Shrum, the veteran Democratic consultant. “Americans worry a lot more about paying their bills than about some guy named Bill Ayers. The burden was on McCain, and he couldn’t rise to the occasion.”'"
"'08-10-16,'1','Thai and Cambodian soldiers exchanged rocket and rifle fire for about an hour Wednesday in a confrontation at their border over claims to a 900-year-old mountaintop temple. At least two Cambodian soldiers were killed, the Cambodian foreign minister said. Several hundred soldiers from both sides have faced each other at the border since July, when Unesco approved Cambodia’s request to have the temple named a World Heritage site. Foreign Minister Hor Namhong of Cambodia said that two Cambodian soldiers were wounded, and a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Thailand said that seven Thai paramilitary soldiers were wounded. The nations have made claims for decades over the temple, which stands at the lip of an escarpment on the border looking out over the mountains of northern Cambodia.'"
"'08-10-16,'1','HONG KONG —Asian stock markets appeared to be headed for another rough session on Thursday, with the Nikkei 225 index dropping dramatically in early trading.The key Japanese index was down 9.6 percent, or 920 points, at 8,624 by mid-morning, echoing similar blood-letting last week, and erasing an extraordinary 14 percent rebound Tuesday on the back of the global efforts to stabilize the teetering financial system.The picture on Thursday was little better in South Korea, where the Kospi dropped 7 percent. Stocks in Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore were each down more than 6 percent, and Taiwan was 3.2 percent lower.The mass sell-off followed the biggest one-day percentage fall on Wall Street since 1987. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.9 percent on Wednesday, or 733.08 points, to 8,577.91 points, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 9 percent. Investors on Wall Street — frightened by the prospect of falling company earnings as U.S. retail statistics provided the latest evidence of economic slowdown — dumped shares..The latest U.S. retail data, released Wednesday, showed a 1.2 percent drop in sales in September — the sharpest decline in years.Slowing consumer and corporate spending in the United States is inevitably filtering through to Asian exporters, which are seeing demand for their products seize up.Adding to the woes in Japan was the strength of the yen, which has risen as investors pile into the perceived “safe haven” it represents.'"
"'08-10-16,'1','Two of the nation’s largest telephone companies, Verizon and AT&T, have installed temporary communications towers at the Arizona ranch of Senator John McCain to provide cellular telephone coverage there, the two companies said Wednesday. But both said they did so for business reasons and not at the request of Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, who is on the Senate Commerce Committee.“The Secret Service is a customer of ours,” said Jeff Nelson, a spokesman for Verizon. “Our contract with them specifically says that when they need service for any reason related to accomplishing their mission, we must do it, at no charge, and provide 24/7 human expertise.”The Web site of The Washington Post first reported Wednesday on the efforts to bring cellular service to the McCain ranch. It said those efforts began in early 2007 when Cindy McCain, the senator’s wife, asked Verizon to expand service to their residence in Sedona, which is in a sparsely populated valley.“Mrs. McCain and her staff went through the public Web site as any member of the public would,” said Brian Rogers, a spokesman for the McCain campaign. “No strings were pulled, and there was no involvement of Senate staff.”Verizon, however, declined that request, Mr. Nelson said, because “it didn’t make traditional business sense.” It was only after Mr. McCain wrapped up the presidential nomination and began receiving Secret Service protection in April that cellular service was installed, not in the ranch house itself, but at a trailer that was the work base for the Secret Service agents protecting Mr. McCain.“This was meant as a temporary fix,” said Eric Zahren, a spokesman for the Secret Service. “We never spoke on anyone else’s behalf, only in our own interests. At no time were we involved in discussions about a permanent tower to be put up.”In the case of AT&T, the circumstances were somewhat different because the company does not have a contract with the Secret Service. Claudia Jones, an AT&T spokeswoman, said that after it became clear that Mr. McCain would become the Republican nominee, the company “made a business decision” to install a temporary tower for only the duration of the campaign.'"
"'08-10-16,'1','The State Department has often been at odds with the Justice Department and the Pentagon over detainee issues, at times arguing that those agencies do not take sufficient account of Guantánamo’s impact on international relations.The Uighur detainees have been at the center of a contentious legal confrontation that drew wide attention with a ruling from Judge Ricardo M. Urbina, on Oct. 7, directing that they be freed in Washington, D.C. The ruling that the men were not a danger to the United States was a defeat for the White House and was the first to order the freeing of Guantánamo detainees.After an emergency filing by the Justice Department the next day, an appeals court temporarily stayed the ruling while it considered whether to grant a longer stay.Clint Williamson, the State Department’s ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues who conducts Guantánamo resettlement talks with other countries, confirmed that he had changed his plans.“I was scheduled to depart on another round of negotiations early this week,” Mr. Williamson said. “It was impossible to resolve some concerns we had about going forward at the time. As a result I canceled the trip.” He declined to say where he had planned to travel.A Justice Department spokesman, Dean Boyd, declined to discuss the dispute, saying, “We don’t comment on internal deliberations.”The temporary stay of Judge Urbina’s ruling had given provided time for renewed diplomatic efforts to resettle the men and to avoid a potential conflict between the judge and the administration.The appeals court could rule as soon as Friday about whether it will extend the stay on Judge Urbina’s ruling or return the case to him. The State Department had been under great pressure inside the administration to find a country willing to accept the Uighurs.Lawyers for the Uighurs, who were in Afghanistan in 2001, said the men would be persecuted if they were returned to China. The administration agreed that it would not send them there. But it said that since transferring 5 Uighur detainees to Albania in 2006, it had been unable to persuade governments to accept the other 17.Diplomats say that many governments fear reprisal by China, which considers Uighur separatist groups terrorists.Lawyers for the men have said that the Justice Department exaggerated its claims against the men in its legal arguments.The people who have been briefed on the dispute said that the State Department also regarded the language describing the men as inflammatory and impossible to prove.They said the department viewed efforts to find a country willing to accept the detainees as futile as long as the Justice Department argued that the men were too dangerous to be admitted into the United States.The Uighur case has become a focus of many critics of the Guantánamo detention center. Jennifer Daskal, a counterterrorism specialist at Human Rights Watch, said that some administration officials appeared determined to block their release.“The true fear,” Ms. Daskal said, “is not that they will pose a security threat, but that they will serve as living reminders of the administration’s mistakes in setting up Guantánamo.”'"
"'08-10-16,'1','Five months after the death of Eight Belles at the Kentucky Derby focused attention on horse racing’s safety and integrity problems, an industry organization announced a series of suggested reforms Wednesday and named Tommy Thompson, the former governor of Wisconsin, to monitor efforts to improve the troubled sport.Many of the recommendations issued by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, like a ban of steroids and a call for tracks to install safer rails, were not ground breaking; several racing jurisdictions have already taken steps in those areas. But the N.T.R.A. also called for the industry to increase efforts to deal with a number of other problems, like blood doping, the slaughter of retired racehorses and a lack of funding for drug-testing programs.“Our industry is taking strong, positive steps to ensure the safety and integrity of our sport,” said Alex Waldrop, the association’s president and chief executive. “Despite challenges and significant short-term and long-term costs, there is an unprecedented level of commitment among thoroughbred racing’s leadership to see these measures through.”The N.T.R.A. does not have the authority to enforce any of its recommendations, but Waldrop said any track that refuses to comply with its directives would not be certified. That would probably cause bettors to wager less on that track’s races, he added.“We will be rewarding tracks that comply and the fans will also be rewarding them,” Waldrop said. “This will be market driven. The market will reward those who step up and do the right thing. Lack of certification will mean you are lacking in some fundamental aspect of the business and you will lose your business as a consequence.”'"
"'08-10-16,'1','On Wednesday, the average rate for 30-year fixed rate mortgages was 6.75 percent, up from 6.06 percent last week. While banks are moving aggressively to sell foreclosed properties, the number of empty homes is hovering near its highest level in more than half a century.As of June, 2.8 percent of homes previously occupied by an owner were vacant. Nearly 1 in 10 rentals was without a tenant. Both numbers are near their highest levels since 1956, the earliest year for which the has such data.At the same time, the number of people who are losing jobs or seeing their incomes decline is rising. The unemployment rate has climbed to 6.1 percent, from 4.4 percent at the end of 2007, and wages for those who still have a job have barely kept up with inflation.In New York and other cities that rely heavily on the financial sector, economists expect that job losses will increase and that pay heavily tied to year-end bonuses will decline significantly.One reliable proxy of housing values — the ratio of home prices to rents — indicates that in many cities prices are still too high relative to historical norms.In , for instance, home prices are about 22 times annual rents, according to analysis by . The average figure for the last 20 years is just 15 times annual rents. The difference between those two numbers suggests that a home valued at $500,000 today might be worth only $341,000 based on the long-term relationship between prices and rents.The price-to-rent ratio, which provides one measure of how much of a premium home buyers place on owning rather than renting, spiked across the country earlier this decade.It increased the most on the coasts and somewhat less in the middle of the country. Economy.com’s calculations show that while it remains elevated in many places, the ratio has fallen sharply to more normal levels in places like , and Riverside, Calif.The current housing downturn is much more national in scope and severe than any other in the postwar period, partly because of the proliferation of risky lending practices. Today, foreclosures are running ahead of the downturn in the economy, a reversal of previous housing slumps.“We are in uncharted waters,” said Brian A. Bethune, an economist at Global Insight, a research firm.Colleen Pestana, a real estate agent in Orange County in California, said many people losing their homes in used to work at mortgage and real estate companies. Many of them bet heavily on real estate by upgrading to bigger houses every few years. Now, many are losing their homes.At the same time, Ms. Pestana said, her clients who are looking to buy are having a harder time lining up financing. One of her clients recently had to give up on a home after the lender that had offered a pre-approved loan changed its mind — a frequent occurrence, according to real estate agents and mortgage brokers.“I am working harder than I have ever had to work to get a deal together and keep it together,” said Ms. Pestana, who has been a real estate agent for seven years.To cushion themselves from potential losses if homes lose value, and , the mortgage finance companies that the government took over in September, have increased fees on loans made to borrowers who have good but not excellent credit records, even those who are making down payments as big as 30 percent.Those higher fees are generally invisible to borrowers because banks factor them into mortgage interest rates. While the national average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 6.75 percent, according to HSH Associates, mortgage brokers say the rates for many borrowers in the or Florida can be as high as 8 percent, especially for so-called jumbo loans that are too big to be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (Those loan limits vary by area from $417,000 to roughly $650,000.)Higher interest rates result in bigger monthly payments, pricing some potential buyers out of the market. For example, monthly payments are $2,700 on a 6 percent 30-year, fixed-rate loan of $450,000. If the interest rate rises to 7 percent, those monthly payments jump to $3,000. All things being equal, when rates rise prices generally fall.This month, Fannie and Freddie canceled a fee increase that would have applied to markets where home prices are falling, but the companies still have many other fees in place. In an effort to help drive down rates, the Treasury Department has announced plans to buy mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie and Freddie. The government also recently increased the amount of loans the companies can buy and hold.Still, those efforts will take time to have an impact and it is not clear whether they will be sufficient to get banks to lend more freely, especially in areas where jumbo loans make up a bigger percentage of lending, like New York and parts of California and Florida. Economists say that prices in those places will probably fall further.In some of those places, price declines are being driven by a sharp increase in sales of foreclosed homes.Hudson & Marshall, a Dallas-based auctioneer that holds sales for lenders, reports that banks are accepting prices that they refused to consider just 12 months earlier. In a recent auction of 110 foreclosed homes in the area, for instance, the auctioneer’s clients accepted 90 percent of the bids submitted by buyers, up from 60 percent a year earlier, said David T. Webb, a co-owner of the company.Single-family home prices in Las Vegas have already fallen 34 percent from their peak in the summer of 2006, according to the Standard & Poor’s . Prices in have fallen 31 percent since late 2005.While those declines have been painful to homeowners in those cities, economists said the quick decline might help the markets reach bottom faster than in previous housing cycles, said Edward E. Leamer, an economist at the University of California, . In a previous boom, home prices peaked in the Los Angeles area in 1990 but did not hit bottom until 1996. Prices remained near that low for more than a year before starting to climb again.“In some areas of California, we are really at appropriate levels,” Mr. Leamer said of current home prices. But he added: “The risk is that we are going to get some overshooting, meaning that prices will be lower than they ought to be.”In Florida, Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant, said that while some cities, like , are showing tentative signs of a rebound, others like Miami and are still under pressure. Two homes on his street in Fort Lauderdale that sold for about $730,000 apiece in 2005 recently sold for $400,000 — a 44 percent decline.“The rocket has run out of fuel, and now it’s plunged back down to earth,” he said.'"
"'08-10-16,'1','But cheap shares generally get cheaper when profits fall and growth prospects dim. That’s exactly what’s in the cards. A global slowdown is just beginning. Tight credit around the world is set to squeeze consumer spending, corporate profits and investor enthusiasm for risky assets.Even after the postfinancial crisis recession ends, central bankers may prove less stock market friendly in the next decade, keeping rates higher than during the last. They should be, since low rates spawn asset price bubbles like the one in the housing market that is still popping.That means, despite the recent market routs, true value opportunities in the stock market may remain scarce. And, if big investors do decide to take their money and retire to the sidelines, the recent punishing slides may not be the last.CIT Group is resorting to financial juggling. For the second time this year, the company — one of the nation’s largest commercial lenders — is issuing shares in part to finance the payment of dividends on its preferred stock, which indirectly allows it to make payments on its common stock. This makes little sense, other than as an optical trick to distract investors.For years, CIT raked in nice profits by lending to small businesses. But its expansion into mortgages and student loans at the top of the market ended in disaster. It raised $1.5 billion by selling common and preferred stock in April. It just announced plans to raise an additional $8 million.CIT cannot pay dividends on its preferred stock if its so-called fixed charge ratio, a measure of how comfortably operating profits cover fixed financing expenses, goes below a threshold that it is currently nearing. It barely exceeded that threshold as of June 30. And, if it skips paying dividends on its preferred stock, the company can’t pay any on its common stock either. So CIT is using the proceeds from its common stock sales to pay dividends on the preferred, which has the added benefit of allowing it to continue paying dividends on the ordinary shares.Suspending the common stock dividend would be smarter, though it might panic some investors. But asking them to buy new shares — and essentially finance the dividends they receive — is not exactly a calming prospect. A variant of this, more popular among European companies, is to pay dividends in the form of stock rather than cash. This involves fewer steps than issuing stock to pay dividends, but is equally illogical. Both dilute earnings per share. Cutting a slice of pizza in two doesn’t make it any more filling.In any event, this hasn’t blinded investors to CIT’s problems. The company has lost almost 90 percent of its market value in the last year. Shareholders would be better off in the long run if its chief executive, Jeffrey M. Peek, spent more time sorting out CIT’s core problems or finding a buyer than playing games with its dividends.'"
"'08-10-16,'1','Mr. Stoner, who is now 73, said he was “burned out” at the time, after a career spent building a single radio station in Des Moines into the Stoner Broadcasting System, which eventually became part of CBS.During a trip to London, he and his wife wandered into the Mount Street Gardens near Hyde Park, a little space surrounded on three sides by old town houses.Suddenly, they were aware of how peaceful they felt. “I said, I think it feels safe here,” Mr. Stoner recalled. Reading the simple inscriptions on plaques attached to benches placed here and there — “little commemorations of moments or a relationship, things like ‘To Suzy, with whom I shared three wonderful years’ ” — he said, “I felt a sense of community.”They sat on a bench and tried to figure out what made the garden so special. For one thing, it was passing through that portal, from one world to another. And then there were the paths, which led to quiet places where they could rest.Thinking that they might be able to create something similar at home — “something to do with nature, with healing,” Mr. Stoner said, they spent the next two years talking to landscape architects, psychologists, labyrinth builders and others about what it would take to create a healing landscape. They discovered that there were certain ingredients necessary to a meditative space, Mr. Stoner said. “A portal that transports you to another place, an enclosure to make you feel safe; a path and destination.”They realized that they wanted to “provide the opportunity for a deeper human experience,” he said, by working with community groups to create gardens that exhibited those characteristics. They decided that each space they helped finance should be an active part of the surrounding community, and open to anyone, without locked gates. Most would be in low-income neighborhoods, where peaceful open spaces are rare, and applicants would be asked to contribute matching funds or in-kind services.SINCE its founding, TKF has poured about $7 million into such open spaces, most of them in or around Baltimore, Washington and Annapolis.In east Baltimore, the Amazing Grace Lutheran Church has received $40,000 since 1998 to build and maintain the Amazing Port Street Sacred Commons, a labyrinth, garden and a grassy field across the street from the church, where abandoned houses once stood. Many of those who helped build the Commons are members of the congregation, but the space itself is free of any reference to religion, one of the Stoners’ requirements.That was fine with Jerry Waters, a longtime Baltimore resident and treasurer of the McElderry Park Community Association, which collaborated with the church on the project. But he initially balked at the open-space rule. The vacant lot where they were building the labyrinth had been full of old mattresses, toilets and discarded needles, and he wanted to put up a fence with a locked gate to protect it.“We had to clean up the needles every day before we started work,” Mr. Waters said. “All that time and effort, you didn’t want to see it destroyed.”Last week he stood in the labyrinth, recalling those labor-intensive days. “We’d see the drug dealers making their deals in the back of the lot,” Mr. Waters said. “But they seemed to respect what we were doing.”As more people began to use the Commons, the dealers went elsewhere and drug users started cleaning up after themselves. “One day, two of them were sitting on the bench, just drinking their beer,” he said. “When they left, one of them threw his bottle down, and the other guy said, No, we don’t do that here.”Another time, several youths arrived on bicycles, seeking solace after a shooting. They “dropped their bikes and just sat on the labyrinth,” said the Rev. Karen L. Brau, the pastor of the Lutheran church, who worked on the project with Mr. Waters. One of the neighbors was going to call the police, Pastor Brau said, but then realized that all they were doing was sitting quietly. The garden “has power because it’s open space,” she said, and that makes people feel welcome.Within the confines of a maximum-security prison, an open garden is even more appreciated.James Carter, a former inmate at the Western Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Md., recalled what the meditation garden he helped plant there in 2001 and 2002 meant to him and fellow inmates. The TKF Foundation spent about $50,000 on the garden, designed and built with Tony Lawlor, an architect. Mr. Carter said it provided a release not only from the physical walls of the prison, but from internal walls.“In a prison, you can’t show emotion — it’s weakness; it’s preyed upon,” said Mr. Carter, who ran his own landscaping business before serving 10 1/2 years for armed robbery related to drug use. “I could feel the change of atmosphere when I stepped into the garden. It was almost like you weren’t in prison.”That experience led Mr. Carter, who was released from prison in March, 2006, and his addiction counselor, Elaine Barclay, to envision a similar garden outside the county courthouse in Elkton, Md. Mr. Carter, who now owns a landscaping company in Phoenix, Md., helped design the garden in collaboration with Mr. Lawlor. TKF has provided $80,000 for design and construction; members of the community are raising funds locally and locating in-kind services.Mr. Carter hopes that the garden will be built and maintained by young offenders doing time in community service rather than behind bars.“Right now the judge only has two options, to let them go or give them time in a correctional facility,” he said. “There’s nothing in between.” Working in the garden instead might change a few lives, he added.“I’ve been there, I know what happens,” said Mr. Carter, who hopes to work alongside the young people. “If I can keep one or two out of there, then I’m successful.”'"
"'08-10-16,'1','With the SpinSpotter plug-in, anyone can call up a news article, insert red flags over offending passages and, in a pop-up box, explain the perceived problems and suggest edits. Another reader seeing the same article will also see those flags, can comment on them and, crucially, can vote on whether the offense is serious or not.In addition a panel of journalism graduate students at the University of Missouri picks through a random sampling of articles, and critiques the critiques. That is supposed to help guard against a group with a particular bias “gaming” the system, but it is not yet clear how well that will work.Each individual user earns a “trust rating,” based on other readers’ votes, the judgment of the graduate students and how often they agree with other users who are highly trusted. Users will not know their ratings, but comments posted by those with the highest scores will predominate.SpinSpotter has an advisory board of journalists and journalism professors who helped devise the company’s standards. They have varying political stripes, and include some well-known writers like Jonah Goldberg of the National Review and Brooke Allen of The Nation.The company has also devised algorithms that search for potential fudge phrases like “critics say,” and that learn from users which expressions are most often censured.“The algorithm approach also has serious limits, which is why the human element is essential,” Mr. Herman said. “There is no algorithm that can interpret language with anywhere near the sophistication of a reader.”One problem with the “wiki” approach, relying on the self-correcting wisdom of the crowd to reach a rough consensus, is that there needs to be a critical mass of people picking apart each article. And there needs to be some assurance that the crowd, through self-selection, does not have serious collective biases.SpinSpotter’s creators acknowledge that they are not there yet, though they say it is only a matter of time. (They will not say how many users the software has so far, or how many it needs to be effective.)In the last month, they say, it has become clear that their limited following is far too small to cover the vast array of online news sources. So starting this week SpinSpotter is focusing primarily on the Web sites of five major news outlets: CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, The New York Times and Yahoo! News.The software insists that reader objections fit into one of six broad categories: lack of balance, using the reporter’s point of view, using passive voice, using a biased source, disregarding context and selective disclosure. But for now those categories have their own limitations. Some journalistic misdemeanors — citing just one source, or failing to offer supporting evidence for an assertion — do not fit neatly into any of the categories.One category of complaint, use of passive voice, seems bound to flag phrases — “four people were killed in an accident,” for example — that are far from biased.“We’re constantly tweaking,” Mr. Herman said. “People are asking us, for example, about creating a category for things that are provably false.”SpinSpotter has financial backing from a number of venture capitalists, primarily the firm Epic Ventures, who are drawn more by the commercial possibilities than the implications for journalism.The SpinSpotter site plans to sell ads, but the main hope for revenue lies in selling services.“Anybody who deals in marketing and communications, a P.R. agency, a corporate marketing office, a political campaign, we can give them information on what phrases are being used out there as spin, or are being perceived as spin, where those phrases are showing up,” Mr. Atcheson said. Press releases, he said, can be scrubbed of phrases that sow doubt.Which might just point the way toward newer, subtler ways of spinning, not toward the transparency the company advocates. But Mr. Atcheson said he is hopeful about what SpinSpotter can do for news reporting.“We’ve even talked to some news organizations that are interested in having a version of our service behind the wall,” he said, “so they can prescreen their work.”'"
"'08-10-16,'1','In a rave review of the production, which stars Kristin Scott Thomas and Peter Sarsgaard, Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times that “Ms. Kazan, who just gets better with every performance, tastily brings out the self-lacerating perversity in Masha’s defeatism.”Ms. Kazan recalled her audition for the director Ian Rickson in a Los Angeles hotel room. When she walked in, two other actresses were already seated, dressed in miniskirts. She was wearing a long black dress and boots. “I thought, ‘I’m going to get this part,’ ” she said. As for Mr. Rickson, after meeting Ms. Kazan, he knew she was well suited to play Masha in the American production. “There can be a lot of pressure on young actresses in today’s culture to represent themselves in certain ways: manipulable, attractive, overeager,” he said recently by phone from London, recalling the audition. Ms. Kazan, by contrast, has “a fierceness of intelligence and independence that’s really important.”Ms. Kazan, who graduated from Yale in 2005, did not expect to begin auditioning right away. She had intended to continue at the university’s school of drama. Then she met an agent who persuaded her to try acting first.As it turned out, she never did go to drama school, and her success over the previous year is one that even experienced actresses would envy, appearing in three plays in addition to this Chekhov revival.In one of them, “Things We Want,” she met Paul Dano, who has been her boyfriend ever since (and with whom she shared some lingering kisses outside the coffee bar that afternoon). Having his support while performing such an emotionally draining role has been wonderful, she said, adding that you cannot play such an addictive depressive personality (Masha is constantly reaching for a glass of alcohol or a vial of snuff) without touching on similar sentiments in yourself.During that same period Ms. Kazan has also worked on four movies. A fifth, “Revolutionary Road,” which is due out in December, could be her breakout. This Sam Mendes film, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet as his wife, April, is a classic story of stifling suburban conformity during the 1950s. Ms. Kazan plays Maureen, a naïve secretary with whom Frank has an affair out of boredom and spite. In the Richard Yates book, Maureen is “a figure of ridicule,” she said, but she was determined not to play that “preconceived notion.” She watched Marilyn Monroe in “Some Like It Hot,” and Shirley MacLaine in “The Apartment,” to capture their sense of innocent vulnerability and loneliness.Yes, the name Kazan — the director Elia was her grandfather — has opened doors more quickly for her, she admits, but she maintains that her accomplishments are all her own. When an article about her in The Los Angeles Times provoked a letter writer to claim Ms. Kazan was only getting ahead because of her family relationship, she said: “I felt really hurt by it and bad for the person. It was self-defeating,” as if the letter writer had convinced her of her own inability to achieve without insider help.Ms. Kazan’s parents, Robin Swicord and Nicholas Kazan, are both screenwriters, but, she said, they tried to give her a normal non-Hollywood childhood. She had no idea her grandfather was famous until she was 13 and a new teacher asked if she was related to the director. “No,” she replied, “his name is Papou Elia,” Greek for Grandfather Elia.Only when she came home and related the conversation to her mother did she learn just who Papou Elia was. They watched some of his films, “Viva Zapata!,” “On the Waterfront” and “A Streetcar Named Desire.” (Tennessee Williams would become one of her favorite writers.)Self-reliance was the key word in her household. Her parents, did not permit her and her younger sister to watch television, saying the commercials would rot their brains. If she wanted to know something, she said, they took her to the library to look it up. If there was a problem at school, they would talk it over with her but would not traipse down to the principal’s office to fix it. And she and her sister could dress as they pleased, which resulted in her spending a year wearing a pioneer outfit with a bonnet. (She attended a “hippie dippy school,” she added.)On this afternoon she was wearing red-and-white checked overall shorts, a turquoise T-shirt and red moccasins. Her parents also believe in political engagement, Ms. Kazan said. Before she left for Yale, her father told her that if she got arrested or expelled for protesting, she shouldn’t worry, he would support her.She is still extraordinarily close to her family. She describes her sister, Maya, as her best friend. “I’m so homesick,” she said earnestly.The whole family is gathering in New York for Thanksgiving. Ms. Kazan, who loves to cook and often spends her Mondays off in the kitchen, making the recipes that her mother sends by mail, plans to help prepare the holiday feast. She’ll invite some of the play’s British cast members for the American ritual.When she was about 10, Ms. Kazan remembered, she saw the 1994 film “Heavenly Creatures,” in which an adolescent kills her mother with the help of a friend. She was horrified. Sometimes teenagers can be very mean to their parents, her mother explained.“I was so scared,” she said. So she wrote herself a note: “Dear Zoe, as a teenager, go and hug mommy and daddy. Tell them you love them, because you really do. Love, Zoe as a kid.” She wrapped it up in tape and stickers and gave it to her mother to hold and bring out if it was ever needed.'"
"'08-10-16,'1','The new research on the head skeleton of Tiktaalik (pronounced tic-TAH-lick) was conducted at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia and the University of Chicago.“The braincase, palate and gill arch skeleton of Tiktaalik have been revealed in great detail,” said Jason Downs, a research fellow at the academy and lead author of the report. “By revealing new details of the pattern of change in this part of the skeleton, we see that cranial features once associated with land-living animals were first adaptations for life in shallow water.”Several skeletons of the fish were excavated four years ago on Ellesmere Island, in the Nunavut Territory of Canada, 700 miles above the Arctic Circle, by a team led by Neil H. Shubin, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago and the Field Museum, and Ted Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences. The Devonian Age rocks containing the fossils indicated that the fishapod lived in shallow waters of a warm climate. It may have made brief forays on land.Since the discovery was reported in 2006, Dr. Downs and two specimen preparators, C. Frederick Mullison of the academy and Bob Masek at Chicago, spent more than a year prying deeply into the skulls of several fishapod skeletons. The results were also analyzed by Dr. Shubin and two other co-authors of the report, Dr. Daeschler and Farish Jenkins Jr., an evolutionary biologist at Harvard.“Our work demonstrates that the head of these animals was becoming more solidly constructed and, at the same time, more mobile with respect to the body across this transition,” Dr. Daeschler said.Dr. Shubin said Tiktaalik was “still on the fish end of things, but it neatly fills a morphological gap and helps to resolve the relative timing of this complex transition.”For example, fish have no neck but “we see a mobile neck developing for the first time in Tiktaalik,” Dr. Shubin said.“When feeding, fish orient themselves by swimming, which is fine in deep water, but not for an animal whose body is relatively fixed, as on the bottom of shallow water or on land,” he added. “Then a flexible neck is important.”One of the most intriguing findings, scientists said, was the reduction in size of a bony element that, in fish, links the braincase, palate and gills and is associated with underwater feeding and respiration. In more primitive fish, the bony part of what is called the hyomandibula is large and shaped like a boomerang. In this fossil species, the bone was greatly reduced, no bigger than a human thumb.“This could indicate that these animals, in shallow-water settings, were already beginning to rely less on gill respiration,” Dr. Downs said, noting the specimen’s loss of rigid gill-covering bones, which apparently allowed for increased neck mobility.In the transition from water to land, the researchers said, the hyomandibula gradually lost its original functions and, in time, gained a role in hearing. In humans, as in other mammals, the hyomandibula, or stapes, is one of the tiny bones in the middle ear.As Dr. Daeschler said, “The new study reminds us that the gradual transition from aquatic to terrestrial lifestyles required much more than the evolution of limbs.”'"
"'08-10-16,'1','Ms. Moskalenko complained of headaches and vomiting on Tuesday. Doctors examined her and her family on the same day.“People do not put mercury in your car to improve your health,” Ms. Moskalenko told Ekho Moskvy, a Russian radio station, later on Tuesday.A police officer said the presence of mercury might have been a result of an accident before the Moskalenko family bought the car, used, in August.Anna Stavitskaya, another lawyer representing the Politkovskaya family, said the mercury might have been part of an attempt to intimidate Ms. Moskalenko.In New York, the Committee to Protect Journalists said it was “deeply concerned” about her welfare, citing news reports saying Ms. Moskalenko “was the target of an apparent poisoning in Strasbourg” and “had felt weak for several days.”Ms. Moskalenko spends much of her time in Strasbourg, in eastern France, pursuing cases at the European Court of Human Rights, according to the radio station. Some of her cases have been on behalf of Chechens complaining of human rights abuses. She has represented Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the jailed oil tycoon. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Ms. Moskalenko’s clients included Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion who has become an opposition political leader in Russia, and Mr. Litvinenko, the former K.G.B. officer.At the hearing in Moscow, a judge refused a request by lawyers for Ms. Politkovskaya’s family that the session be delayed because of Ms. Moskalenko’s illness.Two Chechen brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov, are accused of conducting surveillance of Ms. Politkovskaya. A former police officer, Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, is accused of providing technical help. All three deny the charges.Ms. Politkovskaya’s supporters argue that a third Chechen, suspected of shooting her, is on the run.The court failed to decide whether to allow news media access to cover the trial, which is being held at a military court in Moscow, the authorities say, because of Mr. Khadzhikurbanov’s former ties to law enforcement.Ms. Stavitskaya said that while she would like the trial to be opened to journalists, she did not think the court would allow it.“They have no basis for closing the trial,” she said. “We want this to be accessible to the people, so that they can reach their own conclusions.”The next hearing is set for Nov. 17, with jury selection scheduled for the following day.'"
"'08-10-16,'1','“Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step, but even if they stabilize as we hope they will, broader economic recovery will not happen right away,” Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York. “Economic activity will fall short of potential for a time.”By day’s end, the Dow had surrendered most of Monday’s 936-point gain, dropping 7.87 percent. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 9 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq was down 8.47 percent. Expectations that a worldwide slowdown will reduce demand for oil pushed prices below $75 a barrel. Signs of improvement continued in the credit markets, making it somewhat easier for companies and states to secure financing, but interest rates remained elevated.Mr. Bernanke’s remarks — offered in the sober tones of a man cognizant that a stray syllable may prompt the loss of more billions on Wall Street — underscored the reality that the economy’s troubles go well beyond the financial crisis. The United States and many other major economies are almost certainly headed into a slog through economic purgatory, one that could last many months.“People have focused so much on the immediate financial crisis that they haven’t realized how much the real economy is going down, largely independently,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in . “I don’t think there’s a way we can get out of this without a full-fledged recession and a lot of people losing their jobs. All we can really talk about is ameliorating it, making sure the people who are hit have support.”On Monday, as the Dow posted its fifth-largest one-day percentage gain in history, some investors found quantifiable proof that the crisis was solved. Yet an unpalatable historical detail complicated that idea: The four previous largest percentage gains occurred from October 1929 to March 1933, in the early days of the .Then, it must be noted, the markets swung far more widely than they do in this era, and an epic collapse would still be required to bring the anywhere near a comparable depression.Mr. Bernanke, a leading academic expert on the Depression, offered pointed assurances that no repeat of that disaster would unfold on his watch. The Fed stands ready to use all its tools to battle the financial crisis, he said. He exuded confidence that the American economy “will emerge from this period with renewed vigor.”But when? Mr. Bernanke could not say. That uncertainty added to the gnawing worry gripping the economy.“Ultimately, the trajectory of economic activity beyond the next few quarters will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning,” he said.Strikingly, Mr. Bernanke expressed concern about how huge amounts of capital are increasingly concentrated in a handful of enormous financial institutions.“The real concern that we have is that we have got and developed, in this country, a very serious ‘too big to fail’ problem,” Mr. Bernanke said. “And that problem, we’ve just recognized now in the current situation, how severe it is.”It seemed a curious concern for a man whose central bank has worked with the Treasury to engineer a series of shotgun corporate weddings, such as ’s purchase of and ’s acquisition of — deals that have further concentrated money in fewer hands.Mr. Bernanke’s prognosis and the latest carnage on Wall Street lent urgency to the debate over what the government should do now to soften the blow to the economy.In Washington, and on the campaign trail, conversation centers on putting together a second round of so-called government stimulus spending, following the $152 billion unleashed this year via tax rebates to households and tax cuts for businesses.Democrats in the House are drafting a roughly $150 billion package of spending measures aimed at spurring the economy, according to senior aides, including aid for states, large-scale construction projects to generate jobs and the expansion of unemployment benefits. Senator of , the Democratic presidential nominee, is urging $175 billion worth of relief measures.The Republican nominee, Senator of , has declined to outline his own proposal, though his senior economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said he is “open to any measure that genuinely stimulates the economy.”Republicans on Capitol Hill have emphasized tax cuts for businesses in any , a stance that puts them at odds with Democrats, though recent signs suggest greater potential for a compromise.“We need fiscal stimulus,” said Douglas W. Elmendorf, a former Treasury and Federal Reserve Board economist, and now a fellow at the in Washington. “The outlook is much darker than it was even a few months ago.”The checks the government sent to households last summer appear to have kept the economy growing, but economists are skeptical such a course could work again.“The spend rate will be really low because people are scared to death,” Mr. Baker said.When economists met with House leaders on Monday to suggest a course, the favored means appeared to be aiding state and local governments, whose property tax revenues are diminishing as home values fall. Local governments are a crucial source of employment and social services relied upon by the poor.“The states are taking steps right now that are deepening the recession, through no fault of their own,” said , senior economist at the in Washington. “They’re forced to either raise taxes or cut services. Neither of those are where we need to be right now.”The crisis on Wall Street has sown fears that banks would hold tight to their dollars and starve the economy of capital, preventing businesses from securing finances to hire people and expand. If the bailout succeeds in restoring confidence, that should eventually get money flowing and lift economic activity.But regardless of Wall Street’s travails, a broader set of difficulties has been taking money out of the economy, putting the squeeze on American households and businesses.The economy has lost 760,000 jobs since the beginning of the year, and millions of workers have seen their hours cut, shrinking paychecks just as plunging real estate prices prevent households from borrowing against the value of their homes.In short, American spending power is declining, and this has become a downward spiral: As wages shrink, workers spend less, and that limits demand for workers at the businesses that once captured their dollars.Many economists now assume that unemployment, currently at 6.1 percent, will climb to 9 percent by the end of next year. Some now envision it could reach 10 percent — a level not seen in 25 years.“At this point, the thing has probably just got to play out,” said Martin N. Baily, a chairman of the under President and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “I don’t know that there’s anything that we can do to avoid a mild recession. The question is what can we do to avoid a very severe recession.”'"

"'08-10-16,'1','As a result of the rising tensions, Thai officials said they had prepared aircraft to evacuate some 1,500 citizens living in Cambodia. Thai authorities ordered a similar evacuation in 2003 when Cambodians rioted in the capital in protest against Thailand, setting fire to Thai businesses and to the Thai Embassy.That earlier violence also involved claims to a temple, in that case the crown jewel, Angkor Wat, which is well within the borders of Cambodia.“Thai businessmen who have no need to be in Cambodia now, please rush back to Thailand,” Foreign Minister Sompong Amornwiwat said Wednesday.Thai nationals were reported to have huddled in a hotel in Phnom Penh for safety, uncertain if they should evacuate. Riot police were deployed outside the Thai Embassy.Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia on Tuesday issued an ultimatum to about 80 Thai soldiers to withdraw from a portion of the temple area. His noon deadline passed, with the Cambodian side saying the Thais had retreated and the Thais saying there had been no troop movements.“At any cost we will not allow Thai troops to invade this area,” Mr. Hun Sen said Tuesday. “I would like to be clear about this. It is a life-and-death battle zone.”In an effort to ease tensions, the Thai and Cambodian regional military commanders were scheduled to hold talks Thursday. The fighting on Wednesday was not the first since the two sides have deployed soldiers at the temple. Early this month, one Cambodian and two Thais were reported wounded in an exchange of gunfire.Three days later, two Thai soldiers lost legs when they stepped on some of the many thousands of land mines strewn through the area.Thailand’s 300,000-strong military is far better equipped and trained than the Cambodian army, with F-16 fighter jets and Blackhawk helicopters. But Cambodian soldiers have been fighting in the area for decades and are hardened by guerrilla warfare.The disputed temple was in the hands of Khmer Rouge guerrillas until a decade ago, when the movement collapsed, 19 years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime in Phnom Penh. Many soldiers and commanders in the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces are former members of the Khmer Rouge.'"

"'08-10-17,'0','Mr. McCain also tailored some of his message to Cuban-Americans, criticizing Mr. Obama’s call for more diplomacy by saying that if he were elected president, “I won’t meet unconditionally with the Castro brothers.”His main thrust, however, was directed at Mr. Obama’s remarks to Mr. Wurzelbacher that he hoped to spread the wealth around — but he used tougher language, suggesting that Mr. Obama was planning a new form of “welfare.”“Senator Obama says that he wanted to spread your wealth around,” he said. “When politicians talk about taking your money and spreading it around, you’d better hold onto your wallet. Senator Obama claims that he wants to give a tax break to the middle class, but not only did he vote for higher taxes on the middle class in the Senate, his plan gives away your tax dollars to those who don’t pay taxes. That’s not a tax cut, that’s welfare.”Hari Sevugan, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said in an e-mailed statement that “John McCain again distorted Senator Obama’s tax proposal today, labeling as ‘welfare’ the tax relief Barack Obama wants to give millions of line workers, teachers, plumbers and other middle-class Americans who pay payroll taxes on every dollar they earn.”And he noted that Mr. McCain was also proposing a refundable tax credit — $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families — for health care that would be sent as a check to people, even those that do not pay income taxes.Mr. Obama also entered the in-your-face portion of his election-year bell lap. He took his campaign into Virginia, a state the Democrats have not won since 1964, but which polls suggest could be within the grasp of the Democrats.He gave a speech before about 8000 people at the Roanoke Civic Center, and thumped loudly on the bass drum of the nation’s dismal economy.“Roanoke, I know these are difficult times,” he said, citing a litany of declining wages, jobs pared, stock prices falling.Then he launched a frontal assault on Mr. McCain, with little of the complimentary throat clearing he used a few months ago. He yoked his opponent to President George Bush — “I’m not running against President Bush but I am running against his policies” — and then turned on Mr. McCain.“A few weeks back, John McCain said the fundamentals are strong,” he said. “Well, where I come from, a job is pretty fundamental.”That Mr. Obama is competitive in Virginia is a surprise, even to some on his own campaign staff. He has done very well in polls in the northern suburbs and exurbs radiating from Washington, and he seems to have connected further south with black and student voters, and middle-class voters who have seen unemployment rise in this state.And in Virginia, as in other states, he has made in-roads into the female vote that seemed improbable after the bitterness of his primary fight with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York.“I was a Hillary supporter but I’m all his now,” said Amy Carter of Bedford, Va., who runs a daycare center. “We can feel him on the verge here in Virginia.”Perhaps, but on Friday afternoon Mr. Obama did not fill the arena. Before he started speaking, campaign workers climbed into the top of the bleachers behind the stage and covered the top rows in black sheets.Mr. Obama offered relatively little poetry in this speech, concentrating more on the sweaty urgency of a campaign’s final days, as he tried to inoculate his supporters—and perhaps himself—against over-confidence.“For those people who are getting a little cocky and who are reading the polls, I got just two words for you: New Hampshire,” he said. “We were up in Texas and in Ohio in the polls—we ended up losing. You can’t pay attention to the polls.”'"

"'08-10-17,'0','Still, the credit market for state and local governments remained largely sluggish, a possible bad sign for the kind of long-term lending that finances roads, bridges and other large projects.“There is no real sense the market is dramatically better,” said Matt Fabian, managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, an independent consulting firm, who saw the California sale as something of an anomaly. “It may get a little better, but this is a long-term condition.”Because of the economic downturn, moreover, California must still contend with a shortfall of about $1 billion it expected in revenue from sales, real estate and corporate taxes. Analysts project that the hole could reach more than $3 billion.California is not alone. South Carolina legislators on Thursday were planning to use grant and Medicaid money and spending cuts of up to 15 percent among state agencies to fill a half-billion dollar hole in the state budget. Cities, too, are rebalancing the ledger. The Dallas school district on Thursday laid off 375 teachers, 3 percent of its work force, to help patch a $84 million deficit.Nonetheless, California and its finances are always watched closely as a barometer of the nation’s economic health.Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and legislative leaders have said they will work together to resolve the budget problems, though they have a history of contentious negotiations. The $103.4 billion budget was adopted 85 days overdue because of disagreements over closing a $15 billion deficit.They are likely to battle anew over raising taxes, cutting spending or both, and in interviews Thursday Democrats and Republicans were staking their turf. Mr. Schwarzenegger, who plans to meet again with legislative leaders next week, is widely expected to call a special session of the Legislature, most likely some time after the presidential election.The Assembly speaker, Karen Bass, and the Senate president pro tem, Don Perata, both Democrats, said they did not see how the state could resolve its problems without considering at least a temporary expansion of taxes.Mr. Perata said he would push for expanding the sales tax to goods and services that are not taxed, like health club membership fees. Republicans who oppose new taxes, he said, will have to identify which services to cut, since several billion was already cleaved in the last budget.“They are going to have to put on the table what programs they want to cut,” Mr. Perata said, pointing to prisons and education as two expenditures most politicians would be loath to cut. “Those are the two services we spend the most money on. They can no longer have it both ways.”Republicans were just as defiant, saying that it was time to make hard choices but that tax increases would only harm the wobbly economy.Dave Cogdill Sr., a Republican who is the Senate minority leader, said, “I think we have a huge challenge ahead of us.”“We definitely have to go back to the budget,” Mr. Cogdill said, “and see where we can achieve the greatest savings and look for ways to get there outside of tax increases.”He suggested that the sale of underused state land could help raise revenue, and did not rule out cuts to prisons or education, something powerful unions have often defeated. “I think they have to be looked at,” Mr. Cogdill said.'"
"'08-10-17,'0','At this week’s two-day meeting, which ended Thursday, the countries that were questioning the plan won the right for any of the 27 members of the bloc to veto it. They also refused to set December as a goal for completing negotiations, though they said they would try.Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, who led the assault on the package, said: “We don’t think this is the moment to push forward on our own like Don Quixote. We have time.”Mr. Berlusconi and others worried, in part, that taking action now would put European countries at a disadvantage at a time when nations worldwide were scrambling to secure their economies. They fear that strict pollution rules in Europe will drive more companies to parts of Asia and elsewhere where environmental standards are lower.Beyond that, individual European Union members were concerned about whether they were being asked to shoulder too much of the burden compared with other members.Some Eastern European members, including Poland and Bulgaria, argued that Western Europe’s more advanced economies ought to do more to achieve the union’s goals, thereby lessening the burden on poorer countries.Poland, for instance, which is hosting the next round of global climate treaty talks in December, is worried that it will suffer because it is heavily reliant on coal. The proposals under discussion might force it to shut some power plants, driving up the cost of energy production. Leaders of countries that want concessions say that nations like Denmark have a built-in advantage because they already depend more heavily on renewable energy.Officials who generally support the proposals worked out since last year say that a failure to reach a deal in December would be particularly damaging because it would undermine Europe’s ability to negotiate with a new administration in the United States. They expect it to be more open to efforts to tackle global warming whether led by Senator John McCain or Senator Barack Obama.Moreover, a failure in December would hand the task of clinching an agreement to the Czech Republic, which takes over the European Union presidency in January and whose governing coalition is divided over climate change.“We have to find a solution before January,” said President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, the chairman of the summit meeting. “We are not going to hide behind the crisis. Europe must set an example.”To meet the reduction target set in 2007, the plan would tighten European Union emission ceilings on energy and manufacturing companies beginning in 2013. The package would also set targets for renewable-energy sources like windmills and separate goals for biofuels.Poland was among the countries most concerned that December might be too ambitious a deadline. Like Mr. Berlusconi, Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland was not in power when last year’s agreement was reached.Mr. Tusk underlined the problems confronted by Poland’s reliance on coal-fired power plants, compared with countries like France that get more energy from nuclear power. “We don’t say to the French that they have to close down their nuclear power industry and build windmills,” he said. “Nobody can tell us the equivalent.”He added that it was important to maintain the right to veto in case the countries could not reach an agreement that he and others could tolerate.Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis of Latvia said his country would veto the package unless it contained more concessions for countries like his that joined the European Union in 2004. Eight Eastern European countries were admitted that year.Even the leaders of Germany, which steered last year’s reduction plan to an agreement, said the world’s faltering economies had given them pause about whether their industries would be sufficiently protected if countries outside the union did not also set stricter goals.But David Miliband, the British foreign secretary, accused other countries of trying to wiggle out of commitments they made just last year. “There is no setback,” Mr. Miliband said, emphasizing that he expected an agreement on the current timetable.“A number of countries have shown buyer’s remorse for the agreement in 2007,” he said. “There is no going back. No going back on determination to have agreement by the end of the year.”'"
"'08-10-17,'0','His findings, along with other assessments from the Pentagon and the State Department, will be combined into a comprehensive White House review of Afghanistan policy that is to be completed next month after the presidential election, administration officials said Thursday.Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon spokesman, said officials from across the government, including the intelligence agencies, were working to ensure that “we are on the proper footing as we hand off the baton to the next administration.”The participants in the White House review, which began on Sept. 22 and is led by Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, the senior coordinator for Iraq and Afghanistan, completed their formal meetings last week. Officials at the National Security Council are wrapping up their consultations and preparing to write their recommendations, an administration official said.One set of findings and recommendations will address what the Bush administration can do in its waning months, an administration official said. Another set will highlight issues and possible actions for the next administration, specifically during the period between the American presidential election and the Afghan presidential election, scheduled for next September.Admiral Olson, General McKiernan and another senior commander, Gen. David H. Petraeus, the former top officer in Iraq who takes charge of the Central Command on Oct. 31, are reviewing the Afghanistan mission.This summer, General McKiernan, a four-star Army officer who leads the NATO force in Afghanistan, was given command of most of the 19,000 American troops who have operated separately. The NATO force had already included about 15,000 other Americans.American officials say they hope that the creation of a more unified command structure under General McKiernan will improve the coordination of all forces in Afghanistan — most notably American units near the Pakistani border in eastern Afghanistan, which have been independent of the NATO-led force in southern Afghanistan.Admiral Olson was expected to meet with Special Operations officers this week at Bagram air base in Afghanistan to discuss details of how many of the Special Operations forces could improve coordination with General McKiernan’s command.KABUL, Afghanistan — An Afghan police officer in an observation tower in the Bermel district in the southeastern province of Paktia fired on an American patrol on Thursday, killing one of the soldiers, the United States military command said.The Americans returned fire, killing the police officer, the military said.Last month, another Afghan police officer in Paktia fired on American troops at a police station, killing one and wounding three before he was killed.'"

"'08-10-17,'0','“Azur & Asmar,” an animated fable by the French filmmaker Michel Ocelot, unfolds in a flat, storybook style worlds away from the sculptured digital aesthetic pioneered by Pixar and emulated by everyone else. But flat in this case is beautiful. Despite a stiffness of movement that suggests an upscale take on the cutout animation of “South Park,” the movie has a terrific flair for arabesque patterning, a gemlike luminosity of surface and a handsome, classical cast of mind.Set in a mythic Middle Eastern landscape, the story opens in the childhood of two young boys whose fates will diverge and then reunite in the realms of magic and adventure. Asmar, an impetuous, dark-featured youth, sits with his best friend, Azur, a blue-eyed prince, as they marvel at songs of the Djinn Fairy, a legendary creature locked away in sadness beyond enchanted doors and guardian monsters.As Azur comes of age, he is separated from his lowborn companion to be groomed for princely affairs, but the memories of the Djinn Fairy never go away. And so begins a quest for magic keys, spells of safety and a route to the mystic mountain where lies a spirit to be released and a friendship to be reconciled.“Azur & Asmar” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for bare breasts and mild fantasy adventure.Directed by Michel Ocelot; English version written by Mr. Ocelot and George Roubicek; drawn by Mr. Ocelot; music by Gabriel Yared; produced by Christophe Rossignon; released by GKids. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village.

"'08-10-17,'0','It will take weeks, if not months, for the government to prove that it will invest the money wisely. But so far, it has not even made clear that it is determined to leave out the bad banks.Treasury officials say they have not made any decisions on what criteria will be used to decide which banks are allowed into the program, other than to consult with regulators. That is probably true; the government’s frantic efforts to halt the slide in recent weeks have had a “ready, fire, aim” feel to them.Or, in the gentler words of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, “Our strategy will continue to evolve and be refined as we adapt to new developments and the inevitable setbacks.”When a government official talks about “inevitable setbacks,” you know he is nervous.What the government should do is look over bank assets with a jaundiced eye. It now has Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nationalized agencies, buying toxic mortgage securities, and should take advantage of that by drafting experts there to weigh in on security valuation.Banks that are loudly demanding that mark-to-market rules be suspended should receive special attention, for the same reason that the police are suspicious of people who hurriedly hide something as a cop approaches. Banks that want government cash should have to prove they are providing accurate market values of the assets they own.If the government does that — and everyone knows it did that — then the Good Bookkeeping seal of approval could become a valuable thing. Bank failures among institutions not in the program could even be a confidence booster, providing evidence that membership in the bailout club is a mark of quality.But if it appears that most any bank can qualify, if well-known walking corpses are allowed in to delay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation having to produce the cash from its depleted insurance fund, then the opposite could happen.The bailout club needs to be a group that banks wish they were in, not one they fear to be in.There was a rush of banks this week proclaiming that they did not want to be in the club. Some of that may be reminiscent of the Groucho Marx line that he would not want to belong to any club that would have him as a member. It is certainly better public relations for a bank to be thought to have scorned the money than it is to be known as one that was denied the cash.Last weekend’s international agreement to save the financial system — by means that were up to each government — provided temporary reassurance to investors. But the banks still are worried.The Libor rate — the rate at which banks lend to each other — slipped this week, but remained far above where it was before Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. Even government guarantees on new bank borrowings have not restored the banks’ confidence. And if they don’t trust themselves, why should we trust them?There is a growing realization that the American recession has spread to Europe and Japan, and is threatening the emerging markets that are going to export less to countries that are buying less. The American economy is in for a rough stretch and a deep recession even if the financial system gets going again. If it doesn’t, the downturn will be deeper and longer.It will help if the government can persuade us that the banks in which it is investing are the good ones, and that it knew enough to avoid the banks that are doomed to fail.On the other hand, it will not help if the government responds to the pressure being applied by banks and some politicians to let the banks go on making up values for their weakened assets — values that will be justified by estimates of future cash flows coming from the very same people who created this junk, but now refuse to buy it for what they claim it is worth.The Securities and Exchange Commission caved in to the banks on one fairly technical accounting issue this week, in the process saying that the opinions of the major auditing firms could be sidestepped. If it does the same on the far more important issue of mark-to-market accounting, don’t be surprised to see this bailout fail.If the regulators think the truth is too scary for the public to see, then perhaps it is.'"
"'08-10-17,'0','While Google is the largest seller of online ads, its relatively strong results are not indicative of the overall health of the Internet advertising business. Google relies primarily on search ads, the fastest-growing segment of the market. Since marketers use such ads to lure people to their Web sites, analysts say they believe they are among the last thing advertisers would cut during a recession.“This is the first quarter when the wheels are coming off the wagon on the economy and they’ve been able to have a decent quarter,” said Youssef H. Squali, an analyst with Jefferies & Company. “Google’s business model has proven to be better than that of your typical Internet company because of its focus on performance.”Google said revenue for the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, grew 31 percent, to $5.54 billion, up from $4.23 billion a year earlier. The growth rate is a further indication that Google’s business is maturing. The company’s revenue grew 56 percent in 2007 and 73 percent in 2006.Google’s net revenue, which excludes commissions paid to advertising partners, rose to $4.04 billion, roughly in line with the $4.05 billion that analysts expected. The company beat Wall Street’s profit expectations. Excluding the cost of stock options and other items, Google’s income was $4.92 a share, higher than the $4.79 a share forecast by analysts.The company also said that the number of times users clicked on its ads grew 18 percent from a year earlier, roughly the same rate as in the previous quarter.In the conference call, Hal Varian, Google’s chief economist, said advertisers appeared to be willing to keep buying search ads because they were effective.“Our experience is that advertisers are willing to take all the clicks they can get,” said Mr. Varian. “Even in tough times that continues to be true. No one wants to turn away a customer.”Ahead of Google’s report, several companies that sell services and tools to search marketers said that they had seen little evidence of a slowdown. “We are not seeing any weakness in our business,” said Christopher Lien, the chief executive of Marin Software, whose technology helps marketers manage search advertising campaigns. For example, Mr. Lien said, a large apparel retailer had recently promised to double the amount of money it would spend on search ads.Still, many analysts cut their revenue and profit expectations for Google in recent weeks, amid signs that the slowing economy would affect advertising budgets both online and offline. And some analysts say they believe that Google’s strong results in the third quarter are not necessarily indicative of future performance.“Everything is getting worse in real time,” said Ross Sandler, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. Because Google provides no financial forecasts, its results are “like looking in the rearview mirror,” he said.But investors appeared heartened by Google’s focus on the bottom line. The company added approximately 500 employees in the quarter and reined in expenses across the board. In the year-ago quarter, it added 2,100 employees. “They are operating well in a tough environment,” said Douglas Anmuth, an analyst with Barclays Capital. “The key to the quarter is that they showed a real focus on cost controls and that’s what Wall Street needed to see.”On Thursday, Google said that David Rosenblatt, the former chief executive of DoubleClick, was named president of global display advertising, a new position. Google bought DoubleClick last year for $3.1 billion in an effort to quickly expand its fledgling display advertising business. The appointment suggests that Google is getting ready to accelerate its push into that market.In an interview, Mr. Schmidt said that he expected the display advertising business on YouTube and on partner sites to become the first sizable new business for Google beyond its traditional text ads.“It looks to us that the sum of YouTube plus display is going to get there in terms of scale,” Mr. Schmidt said.'"
"'08-10-17,'0','I recently asked Ms. Smith about listening, about what all of us, as patients and doctors, might learn from her experiences interviewing and listening over the last 30 years.“When you first start to decide to listen in a way that is more than just listening in a conversation, it’s probably a good idea not to expect yourself to listen for very long,” Ms. Smith said to me. “Practice keeping your own inner monologue out of the way of what is being said to you, so that you can hear not just what somebody is saying to you, but also what they’re trying to say.”Ms. Smith continued: “I would say that listening actually takes practice because you have to get out of the way of what it is that you’re hearing.”Sitting in the audience that night, I had thought I was listening. But I wasn’t getting out of the way of what I was hearing. I couldn’t help but hear my own internal voice, sifting the stories Ms. Smith told: Do I agree with what that character is saying? Do I know this character? What’s up with that character’s hands?But then Ms. Smith became Ingrid Inema, a Stanford pre-med student from Rwanda. The character, a young woman, looked lost on stage, sitting next to a great pile of books, her face partly obscured by a baseball cap. But her voice was clear. She talked about living through the genocide in her country, about not being able to forgive because the perpetrators have never come to ask for forgiveness. And about how she decided to let go.“I release you,” I can still hear Ingrid saying, her voice resonating out from the darkness of the stage. “I am not holding you in my heart anymore.”I thought about these words as I exited the theatre that night. In the lobby were two bulletin boards covered with scribbled notes, and across the top of each was a sign that read, “What Does Grace Mean to You?”These were the audience members’ spontaneous responses to the show. A few were single sentences, others several paragraphs. All were filled with the kind of stories that make your heart swell, many of them about how friends, family members, politicians, teachers and even doctors dealt with illness or human frailty.That night in the theatre, I realized, grace had emerged for me in the words of Ingrid Inema. She was able to release a part of her self, a horrible atrocious part of her past, and thus free herself to live in the present.Until I heard her words, I had not acknowledged the inner voice that carried on in my own head in the theater that night, despite my belief that I was really listening to the narratives that unfurled on stage. I did not acknowledge that listening to others, particularly to patients, requires letting go of a part of yourself, as Ms. Inema did, and as Ms. Smith does.I never did post my own note on the theater bulletin board that evening, but I have started a board of my own, a list in my mind of examples of, and opportunities for, grace in my own life.* The surgeon who stayed in the room as his patient died, standing silently and comforting the grieving wife.* The young woman with metastatic melanoma who, as the doctor apologized for a particularly painful procedure, smiled and then said, “I can take anything for my two children. I’m willing to do anything for even a little bit of time.”* The attending physician who told his intern who was trying desperately to hide her tears over a recent patient death, “It’s okay to cry. When you stop caring is when you should get out of this business.”What does grace mean to you?Post your comments on the Well blog, “Doctors and Patients, On Stage.” And listen to my conversation with Anna Deavere Smith by clicking on the podcast link above.'"

"'08-10-17,'0','The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday set stringent new standards for airborne lead particles, following the recommendations of its science advisers and cutting the maximum allowable concentrations to a tenth of the previous standard. It was the first change in federal lead standards in three decades.But the cleanup of areas with excessive lead levels is not required for more than eight years, and the system of monitors that detect the toxic contaminant is frayed. Currently, 133 monitors are in operation nationwide, down from about 800 in 1980, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, Cathy Milbourn, said. The agency is working on rebuilding this network, to include more than 300 monitors, Ms. Milbourn said.The new standards set the limits for exposure at 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter of air, down from 1.5 micrograms, and well within the outer limit of 0.2 micrograms recommended by the advisers.The agency’s administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, said in a statement, “With these stronger standards, a new generation of Americans are being protected from harmful lead emissions.”Mr. Johnson’s usual critics in environmental groups offered uncharacteristic words of praise. “This is a great step in the right direction,” said Gina Solomon, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council.'"

He is being squeezed by rising energy, transportation and food costs (he also took on two new employees this year) and declining demand: He estimates that business is down 20 percent this year.“You see customers buying less. They are just buying what they need. Maybe one pound of chicken cutlets. They are buying much less in bulk. People are also using credit cards more. No one has cash anymore.“I condensed all my freezers downstairs. From two chest freezers to one chest freezer. From three walk-in boxes to two walk-in boxes. These lights, they have four bulbs in each, we cut them down to two in each. Con Ed. That’s the real killer for me. Close to $4,000 a month. It’s come down about $600.“I noticed they are staying away from the good steaks, like a rib-eye that is higher, like $11.99. They’ll buy something that is cheaper, a sirloin or the boneless club steaks for $5.99. Everyone loves the rib-eye, my favorite as well, but you buy four of them for a family of four, it could be expensive.“Sometimes if somebody doesn’t pay, you lose the customer and you lose the money.

He has been in business for 17 years, running a small contracting firm that specializes in painting and home renovations in a mainly upper-middle-class section of Brooklyn. He typically employs nine workers during the busy months. But with half as many jobs as he had last year, he has been operating with only his four regular workers.“It’s down. The economy is bad and people don’t have the money, though I work in a neighborhood that is middle-class.“In my kind of work, it’s the first kind of thing you see, because when people cut down on expenses, they put money where they really need it, like schools and colleges, and wait for the new bathroom a year.

This summer, we haven’t been working on the weekends because there is no rush.“Last year, you could see two, three guys doing the same work when you drive around.

Now, with Europe’s economy in trouble and the dollar rising, she is worried that international travel will also fall sharply.“Travel’s a luxury, so they’re not going to come to New York. They’re going to pay their gas bill first. We were pretty strong through the end of August. There’s a natural drop in September, but we had more of a drop than normal.“In the past week alone, we’ve seen five U.K. tour companies go out of business. We’ve seen people from about 10 countries, mainly, so I think we’ll be O.K. because a lot of the U.K. will be absorbed by another country.“We’re also hoping that rather than hiring more employees, we might also be able to do things with interns and move forward like that. A lot of our work can be done by interns who are going to school. But I’m thinking, just a really rough guess, it could be down 20 percent in 2009.“We recently launched a movie tour in Washington, D.C., but we’re prepared to start that slowly. A lot of Washington is also dependent on international visitors, so we’ll see where that goes. We went through 9/11.

The dealership, with six salesmen, had done a booming business in lease-sales deals, but business has been off mainly because of high gasoline prices, tightening credit and financial industry layoffs. Now Saab’s parent company, General Motors, is reported to be dangerously low on cash and in merger talks with Chrysler.“My best estimate is we are three years out from having it all wash out. Apparently, the entire automobile landscape has been impacted. Sales are down across the board. Several years ago, they were talking about 16 million cars sold a year. Now they are down 20 percent from what they predicted.“It used to be if you were creditworthy, the banks would finance the entire amount. But now they want 10 to 20 percent down. It’s a concern for consumers. It’s a new reality. Lessees were unaccustomed to mobilizing large amounts of capital. They wanted to drive around in a nice vehicle without having to put large amounts of money down.“This is the worst I’ve seen it. The possibility of a merger is indeed in my mind. I worry that if G.M. and Chrysler merge, I don’t know their motives. It’s always a cause for concern. Saab is unique, but it’s wholly owned by G.M.

But the company, with 60 employees, is limiting overtime and cutting overhead by means including the installation of solar panels.“Everything that we purchase has gone up in price over the last year. We used to change our pricing moderately every three years. We’ve had to change pricing three times this year already, which we’ve never had to do before. If we got a 3 percent price increase from a supplier, that’s understandable.

When times are bad, people drink.“We’re busier than we’ve ever been because of high gas prices. This is one of the highest years we’ve ever had, but the profits get chipped away because the costs have gone up so much.“The economy can’t stay like this. We’re just going through a slump.

"'08-10-17,'0','Oil settled down $4.69 a barrel, at $69.85. The drop, along with other promising signs on the inflation front, was among the reasons investors bid stocks higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up 401.35 points at 8,979.26.Natural gas prices have also tumbled since their summer peak of $13.58 per thousand cubic feet. On Thursday, natural gas futures rose 19 cents, to $6.81, after a report showed that stockpiles rose less than expected.While consumers may have reason to cheer the falling oil prices after such a sharp run-up, the wild roller coaster of volatility is a nightmare for oil producers and petroleum executives who say they need more stability to plan long-term projects to develop new sources of oil.If they cannot be confident that they will get a stable return on their investment, they may hold back. That in turn could set the stage for possible shortages of oil and higher prices when global demand picks up again.The sharp drop-off has forced OPEC’s hand. The cartel said just last week that it would meet in mid-November, after the United States elections. But on Thursday, it rescheduled its emergency session for next Friday, Oct. 24.The cartel’s producers, which control 40 percent of global exports, could curb their output by about a million barrels a day to try to stem the drop in prices, according to analysts.It is unclear what price range for oil the cartel wants to establish. But the meeting “sends a clear signal that OPEC is concerned about the speed with which oil prices are slipping away from a preferred price of around $80 a barrel,” said Lawrence Eagles, an oil analyst at JPMorgan.Iran’s oil minister, Gholamhossein Nozari, told reporters in Tehran on Tuesday, “I think the low price is a real damage to the future of production.”From its inception, the oil industry has gone through countless cycles, with oil companies cutting investments when prices fell. The price collapse of the 1980s forced companies to slash investments and prompted a wave of large mergers through the industry. But this retrenchment left the world scrambling for oil when demand from Asian and Latin American economies soared.Concerns that this pattern might be repeated were mentioned frequently during an industry conference in Venice last weekend, where oil executives said they worried that a prolonged recession, tighter credit and lower energy consumption would mean slower growth in energy supplies in coming years.The credit freeze has already forced some projects to be scaled back, some energy analysts and executives said. “This is a real test,” said Jeroen van der Veer, the chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, in an interview at the conference. “Some people will be overstretched, and there will be some delays in some projects.”Over the last decade, growth in oil consumption has outpaced the ability of producers to meet that demand with more production. Many experts have predicted a new squeeze within the next five years that could once again propel oil prices over $100 a barrel.The drop in prices has already created problems for oil producers. Iran and Venezuela both need oil prices at $95 a barrel to balance their national budgets, Russia needs $70 and Saudi Arabia needs $55 a barrel, according to Deutsche Bank estimates. Algeria’s oil minister, Chakib Khelil, said on Thursday that the “ideal” price for crude oil was $70 to $90 a barrel.In Russia, which is not part of OPEC, the drop in prices is threatening the country’s ability to increase production. The Russian government has reportedly agreed to allocate $9 billion to its four major producers — Lukoil, Gazprom, Rosneft and TNK-BP — to help them cope with investment needs amid the credit crisis.In the United States, Chesapeake Energy, a gas producer, has recently indicated it will reduce its capital investments over the next few years in response to falling prices.Global oil demand is undeniably slowing down, particularly in developed nations. Japanese oil consumption tumbled by 12 percent in August over the same month a year ago, while in the United States, demand fell by 8 percent in September.Consumption is still growing in developing nations, but at a slower pace than in recent years. The International Energy Agency expects global oil demand to grow by just 400,000 barrels a day this year, to 86.5 million barrels a day. The agency, which had been revising downward its predictions all year, forecast growth of 2 million barrels a day for 2008 when the year started.The two-day energy meetings last week were held in private in the baroque setting of the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, home to a 10th-century Benedictine monastery. In many conversations with senior executives outside of the conference meetings, they voiced concerns about their industry becoming increasingly vulnerable to a slowing economy.“We pretty much know where supplies are going to come from in future years, but today the biggest uncertainty is demand,” said Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of Total, the French oil company.Some executives, though, are still holding out hope that Asian economies may weather the economic storm and help the global economy recover faster. Lower oil prices could also make it harder for some companies to survive on their own, leading to a new wave of mergers and acquisitions.“This new environment is not all doom and gloom,” said Mr. van der Veer, of Shell. “It can also provide some opportunities. Certain assets may become available.”'"
"'08-10-17,'0','The economy may be sputtering, but the threat of stagflation — a concern among some economists just weeks ago — appears to have receded somewhat.Prices paid for common consumer products did not budge in September, the Labor Department said on Thursday, keeping in line with a similar slowdown in August.The Consumer Price Index, considered an important gauge of inflation, was unchanged last month, driven down by cheaper gasoline, heating oil and clothing.The sharp decline in oil prices, which began in July, has led to lower prices for many Americans at the shopping mall. Outside of energy and food products, the core index rose 0.1 percent.In the last 12 months, consumer prices grew 4.9 percent, less than the 5.4 percent annual rate recorded in August. The core index rose 2.5 percent in the last year.Stock index futures jumped after the report, as investors bet that the more optimistic economic data would bring buyers back into the stock market.'"
"'08-10-17,'0','Granted, the banks are in a deep hole. For every dollar the banks earned during the industry’s most prosperous years, they have now wiped out $1.06.Even with the capital from the government, analysts say, the banking industry still needs to raise around $275 billion in light of the looming losses.But Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. is urging them to use their new capital soon. On Monday, Mr. Paulson unveiled plans to provide $125 billion to nine banks on terms that were more favorable than they would have received in the marketplace. The government, however, has offered no written requirements about how or when the banks must use the money.“There is no express statutory requirement that says you must make this amount of loans,” said John C. Dugan, the comptroller of the currency. “But the economics work so that it is in their interest to do so.”Mr. Dugan added that he would not examine how the banks used the money, but he said their actions would “be open to the court of public opinion.”The banks could use the money from the government for any number of things. Some analysts say the banks may use it to acquire weaker competitors. Others say they might use it to avoid painful cost-cutting. And still others say the banks may sit on the capital.Lenders have been pulling back on credit lines for businesses, mortgages, home equity loans and credit card offers, and analysts said that trend was unlikely to be reversed by the government’s money.“I don’t think that the market wants to see that capital being put to work to leverage the business up again,” said Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Capital, which acquired parts of the now-bankrupt Lehman Brothers last month. “My expectation is it’s quarters off, not months off, before you see that capital being put to work.”Many banks are still plagued by past excesses. Losses on a variety of different types of loans of all sorts are growing and spreading beyond the country’s borders. Citigroup and Merrill Lynch have each lost money every quarter in the last year, as deteriorating assets wiped out revenue.Merrill, which is in the process of merging with Bank of America, reported a $5.15 billion loss, dragged down by about $12 billion in write-downs.Citigroup lost $2.82 billion, as its $13.2 billion in charges related to credit losses more than overwhelmed every bit of revenue that the bank generated. And analysts say Citigroup is likely to face several more quarters of loan losses as the global economy slows.Every corner of the economy goes through cyclical ups and downs. But the banking downturn has acted with ferocious speed to erase past profits.In the case of the nine-largest commercial banks — Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual and Wachovia — profits from early 2004 until the middle of 2007 were a combined $305 billion. But since July 2007, those banks have marked down their valuations on loans and other assets by just over that amount.“The losses now are showing that in some sense the profits reported in earlier years were not real, because they were taking too much risk then,” said Richard Sylla, an economist and financial historian at the Stern School of Business at New York University.Mr. Sylla said that the average profit of the financial industry in the first decade of this century will be abysmal, despite the fact that there were a handful of record years in the middle.The ways banks value their investments has already come under scrutiny. Bankers are supposed to be skilled at valuing assets, and many of their sky-high bonuses before the credit crisis were based on the lofty values attached to mortgage securities.In the future, when Wall Street finds a new profit center, as it surely will, analysts may look back at the losses in this downturn as they question new earnings.At Citigroup, for instance, the write-downs on mortgages and other loans have eaten away 60 percent of all the profits made by the bank during the boom years. At Morgan Stanley, the cost has reached 70 percent of those profits, and at Merrill Lynch, the tally is 250 percent of the investment bank’s record earnings over those three and half years.It is those same banks that are in some shape benefiting from the government’s recent capital infusion. Three of the nine — Merrill Lynch, Washington Mutual and Wachovia — are in the process of mergers with others in the group. Two other banks — State Street and Bank of New York Mellon — also received capital from the government this week.Several of the banks, including Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on how they will spend the government funds once they arrive.Bank of America said in a statement that the money “will add to our capital, which will increase our capacity to expand our balance sheet and make more loans.” It did not say if it was willing to increase its lending.Indeed, observers point to the growing well of bank losses, deeper by the quarter, as reason to question whether the government funding will be used as a financial Band-Aid, instead of an engine to move forward.“It is the government’s responsibility to set the terms and conditions on this money,” said David M. Walker, the former federal comptroller general and now president of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. “This is the people’s money. They’re giving it out with no rules.”Bank executives, meanwhile, said on conference calls this week that it was premature to discuss their plans.Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan, said his bank was in a stronger position to use the money than some of its competitors.“It’s clear that the government would like us to use the capital,” Mr. Dimon said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. “If you are a bank that is filling a hole, you obviously can’t do that.”And Gary L. Crittenden, Citigroup’s chief financial officer, on Thursday called the government’s $25 billion investment in Citigroup “incremental to our thinking.”“We now have more capital than we anticipated,” he said in an interview. It will “allow us to opportunistically build what we have not been able to do.”'"
"'08-10-17,'0','HONG KONG — The volatility and risk aversion in global stock markets continued in Asia on Thursday, where sharp falls in the Nikkei 225 and other key indexes all but wiped out the extraordinary relief rally that had swept across the region earlier in the week.The global efforts to revitalize the credit markets and stabilize the world financial system seemed a dim memory by Thursday, as stock markets focused on economic woes and the fact that interbank lending, all but frozen for weeks, has yet to show signs of thawing.In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 11.41 percent, or 1,089.02 points, to close at 8,458.45, echoing a similar bludgeoning last week and erasing most of the massive rebound it staged after U.S. and European efforts to shore up banks and guarantee lending.The picture was little better in Australia (down 7 percent) and Hong Kong (down about 8.5 percent), or India and Indonesia, which dropped 6 percent.The Shanghai Composite Index and the Taiex in Taiwan were both down around 3 percent, while the Kospi in South Korea was 8.25 percent lower, led by the banking sector, which is more exposed to the international financial crisis than most banks elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.'"
"'08-10-17,'0','Selling picked up momentum in the afternoon as the Federal Reserve’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, cautioned Americans that the bailout would not swiftly lift the economy and that continued weakness was certain.“Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step, but even if they stabilize as we hope they will, broader economic recovery will not happen right away,” Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York. “Economic activity will fall short of potential for a time.”By day’s end, the Dow had surrendered most of Monday’s 936-point gain, dropping 7.87 percent. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 9 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq was down 8.47 percent. Expectations that a worldwide slowdown will reduce demand for oil pushed prices below $75 a barrel. Signs of improvement continued in the credit markets, making it somewhat easier for companies and states to secure financing, but interest rates remained elevated.Mr. Bernanke’s remarks — offered in the sober tones of a man cognizant that a stray syllable may prompt the loss of more billions on Wall Street — underscored the reality that the economy’s troubles go well beyond the financial crisis. The United States and many other major economies are almost certainly headed into a slog through economic purgatory, one that could last many months.“People have focused so much on the immediate financial crisis that they haven’t realized how much the real economy is going down, largely independently,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. “I don’t think there’s a way we can get out of this without a full-fledged recession and a lot of people losing their jobs. All we can really talk about is ameliorating it, making sure the people who are hit have support.”On Monday, as the Dow posted its fifth-largest one-day percentage gain in history, some investors found quantifiable proof that the crisis was solved. Yet an unpalatable historical detail complicated that idea: The four previous largest percentage gains occurred from October 1929 to March 1933, in the early days of the Depression.Then, it must be noted, the markets swung far more widely than they do in this era, and an epic collapse would still be required to bring the United States anywhere near a comparable depression.Mr. Bernanke, a leading academic expert on the Depression, offered pointed assurances that no repeat of that disaster would unfold on his watch. The Fed stands ready to use all its tools to battle the financial crisis, he said. He exuded confidence that the American economy “will emerge from this period with renewed vigor.”But when? Mr. Bernanke could not say. That uncertainty added to the gnawing worry gripping the economy.“Ultimately, the trajectory of economic activity beyond the next few quarters will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning,” he said.Strikingly, Mr. Bernanke expressed concern about how huge amounts of capital are increasingly concentrated in a handful of enormous financial institutions.“The real concern that we have is that we have got and developed, in this country, a very serious ‘too big to fail’ problem,” Mr. Bernanke said. “And that problem, we’ve just recognized now in the current situation, how severe it is.”It seemed a curious concern for a man whose central bank has worked with the Treasury to engineer a series of shotgun corporate weddings, such as Bank of America’s purchase of Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase’s acquisition of Bear Stearns — deals that have further concentrated money in fewer hands.Mr. Bernanke’s prognosis and the latest carnage on Wall Street lent urgency to the debate over what the government should do now to soften the blow to the economy.In Washington, and on the campaign trail, conversation centers on putting together a second round of so-called government stimulus spending, following the $152 billion unleashed this year via tax rebates to households and tax cuts for businesses.Democrats in the House are drafting a roughly $150 billion package of spending measures aimed at spurring the economy, according to senior aides, including aid for states, large-scale construction projects to generate jobs and the expansion of unemployment benefits. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic presidential nominee, is urging $175 billion worth of relief measures.The Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, has declined to outline his own proposal, though his senior economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said he is “open to any measure that genuinely stimulates the economy.”Republicans on Capitol Hill have emphasized tax cuts for businesses in any stimulus package, a stance that puts them at odds with Democrats, though recent signs suggest greater potential for a compromise.“We need fiscal stimulus,” said Douglas W. Elmendorf, a former Treasury and Federal Reserve Board economist, and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “The outlook is much darker than it was even a few months ago.”The checks the government sent to households last summer appear to have kept the economy growing, but economists are skeptical such a course could work again.“The spend rate will be really low because people are scared to death,” Mr. Baker said.When economists met with House leaders on Monday to suggest a course, the favored means appeared to be aiding state and local governments, whose property tax revenues are diminishing as home values fall. Local governments are a crucial source of employment and social services relied upon by the poor.“The states are taking steps right now that are deepening the recession, through no fault of their own,” said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. “They’re forced to either raise taxes or cut services. Neither of those are where we need to be right now.”The crisis on Wall Street has sown fears that banks would hold tight to their dollars and starve the economy of capital, preventing businesses from securing finances to hire people and expand. If the bailout succeeds in restoring confidence, that should eventually get money flowing and lift economic activity.But regardless of Wall Street’s travails, a broader set of difficulties has been taking money out of the economy, putting the squeeze on American households and businesses.The economy has lost 760,000 jobs since the beginning of the year, and millions of workers have seen their hours cut, shrinking paychecks just as plunging real estate prices prevent households from borrowing against the value of their homes.In short, American spending power is declining, and this has become a downward spiral: As wages shrink, workers spend less, and that limits demand for workers at the businesses that once captured their dollars.Many economists now assume that unemployment, currently at 6.1 percent, will climb to 9 percent by the end of next year. Some now envision it could reach 10 percent — a level not seen in 25 years.“At this point, the thing has probably just got to play out,” said Martin N. Baily, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “I don’t know that there’s anything that we can do to avoid a mild recession. The question is what can we do to avoid a very severe recession.”'"

"'08-10-18,'0','Beautifully shot and awkwardly acted, “The Princess of Nebraska” follows a young Chinese woman who calls herself Sasha through an intense few days in San Francisco. To anyone who asks, Sasha, played by Ling Li, says she wants “to see the city,” and Wayne Wang’s camera takes in its neighborhoods with unshowy affection. But there is a lot more going on than tourism.Sasha, who has spent the previous months as an exchange student in Omaha, is pregnant from an encounter back home in Beijing. She has come to California to figure out what to do and to find Boshen (Brian Danforth), an American activist who had also, in China, been in love with Yang, the mysterious opera student who is the father of Sasha’s child.This, along with Sasha’s night tour of the immigrant demimonde in the Bay Area, where she befriends prostitutes and thinks about joining their ranks, is the stuff of Dreiserian melodrama. Mr. Wang, a highly adaptable filmmaker whose movies swerve from the low-budget “Chan Is Missing” to the Jennifer Lopez vehicle “Maid in Manhattan,” prefers the stripped-down naturalism that has become a kind of default style for socially conscious international art cinema. Themes of globalization and political transformation are embedded in this anecdotal, individual story, occasionally popping to the surface in stilted, unconvincing conversations. These moments of obviousness are balanced with an overall feeling of gritty lyricism, and the result — interesting if not especially revelatory — is a film that would not seem out of place at a festival somewhere.But it is showing on YouTube (youtube.com/watch?v=rKgbIz6CM_E), having had its premiere there on Friday night. It may seem, at first glance, that bypassing theaters shows a lack of faith in the quality of the movie. But as of Sunday afternoon, the film had attracted more than 140,000 views, which is a larger audience than it would have found in a limited art-house release in New York and Los Angeles. (And the film is not notably worse than what you might see in those theaters.) Whether all those views reflect people watching until the end is hard to know, but some of their reactions are collected in comments on the site, ranging from thoughtful analyses to “THIS HAS NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH NEBRASKA.”Is the YouTube release of a feature film by a well-known director a gimmick or a harbinger of things to come? A little of both, probably. It’s not clear how a film given away free can make money, but for viewers, the experience is not bad. Mr. Wang employed a wide-aspect ratio, and if you blow the image up to full screen and select the high-quality-video option, you can appreciate the cinematic qualities of his work, which are emphasized by his incorporation of images captured on Sasha’s cellphone. Even with a big desktop monitor and a good pair of speakers or earphones, it isn’t quite like going to the movies, but the movie itself may benefit from the comparison since it would be easier to skip if you had to buy a ticket.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','Today, Americans save less and earn a lower minimum wage — in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms — than at nearly any other time since 1950. Can voters reasonably expect these and other indicators to change significantly after a new president takes office in January?As important as the economy may be for voters when they go to the polls, many economists contend that presidents have little power over general economic performance during their terms of office, even though some things, like the minimum wage, are set by the government.David Backus, an economist at New York University, recently wrote on the blog of the economist N. Gregory Mankiw that while presidents might contribute to long-term performance, the normal ups and downs of the business cycle had more of an effect on the economy in the short term.""There's some debate about where business cycles come from, but the president's actions are rarely on the list,"" he wrote. Changes in incomes, jobs and home prices reflect this cyclical behavior, while other indicators, like personal savings as a percentage of disposable income, have shown a gradual decline over decades. If there is a president to praise — or blame — for longer-term trends, he is probably not in office now.Kevin Feltes, associate director of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said that the next president would most likely be reacting to the economy — not the other way around.""Given the current condition of the economy, the next president could very well end up running trillions of dollars in federal deficits over the next several years,"" he said, ""whether he likes it or not.""'"

"'08-10-18,'0','Late last month, the Museum of Arts and Design reopened in its new home at 2 Columbus Circle. That home is the controversial reworking of Edward Durell Stone’s eccentric building — much loved and much hated by New Yorkers ever since it was finished in 1964.The Times’s architecture critic, Ada Louise Huxtable, dubbed Stone’s original building “a die-cut Venetian palazzo on lollipops.” To us, it looked almost Moroccan, as if the casbah had gone high-rise.Brad Cloepfil’s bland redesign — which somehow suggests the technological polish of a desktop computer — will stir no such emotions, except as a potent symbol of the failure of the preservation process in this city.Despite a public debate over the fate of Stone’s building, the Landmarks Preservation Commission never held a public hearing. The commission’s chair — with the encouragement of the Bloomberg administration — had the matter shelved. In June 2005, the city issued a permit to destroy the old facade and rework the building.The Landmarks Preservation Commission should be a vital part of the planning process in New York City. Instead, it has become a bureaucratic black hole, the place where requests for evaluation — the formal nominations of buildings or districts to be landmarked — go to get filed and forgotten.There are hundreds of requests from all across the city waiting to be acted upon. Some have been held up for years. Moving as slowly as it does — and nearly always without public hearings — the landmarking process is routinely outflanked by developers. What is clearly missing is the political will needed for the landmarks commission to do its job. For that, it must have the full backing of the mayor, who appoints the commissioners.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','Mr. Habib had relocated to Taparghai expressly to avoid missile strikes, the former militant said. The area around Taparghai is near Makin, a base of Baitullah Mehsud, the chief of the Pakistani Taliban.Mr. Habib was in a parked Toyota station wagon, a favored vehicle of the militants in the tribal area, when he was hit by the missile, the former member of the militant group said.A resident of the village said in a telephone interview that the man killed in the attack seemed to be “important.” He was known in the village as Zalfay, the resident said. The name means “long hair” in Pashto, the language spoken in the area.The number of American missile strikes aimed at Qaeda operatives in North Waziristan and South Waziristan has risen sharply in the last six weeks — there have been 11 since early September, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.The Bush administration is trying to stop the militants from crossing the border and carrying out raids against American soldiers in southern Afghanistan. Officials in Washington have also said they are concerned that Taliban and Qaeda operatives are plotting new attacks against the United States and Europe from their sanctuaries in Pakistan’s tribal areas.The missile strikes are conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency but are for the most part coordinated with Pakistan’s government, according to American officials. But that cooperation does not extend to ground operations.In September, a raid by American Special Forces in South Waziristan against what the Americans said were Qaeda forces set off a storm of protest. After that raid, Pakistan’s military threatened to resist any such incursions by force.There have been few protests by people in the tribal region against the airstrikes, apparently because those killed have mostly been Arab and Uzbek members of Al Qaeda, not Pakistanis.It had been nearly two years since the last missile attack in the area where Mr. Habib was killed. That attack, on Jan. 16, 2007, killed about 10 militants, most of them Arabs, in a Qaeda training camp in Zamazola. Mr. Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban chief, vowed to avenge the death by directing a number of suicide bomb attacks against Pakistani military installations.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','“This story is not just about Kundera, it is about the history of the Czech Republic,” said Petr Tresnak, one of the authors of the Respekt article. “People in this country are overwhelmed and disgusted by the number of people who collaborated with the regime, and this is a very concrete example of what happened.”At the same time, the revelations have given the country a chance to vent its decidedly Central European distaste for others’ success, and particularly for that of Mr. Kundera, who has long held himself aloof from the nation of his birth.While Mr. Kundera is a cult writer for undergraduates the world over — his novels are praised for their metaphysical ponderings and eroticism — many Czechs have never forgiven him for going into exile, in France in 1975, and gaining fame abroad. And some simply don’t like his books.“The revelation that Kundera denounced someone is seen by Czechs as a vindication of their belief that he has been betraying them for years,” said Petr A. Bilek, a professor of comparative literature at Charles University here. “His fellow dissident writers have long tried to dismiss him as someone who writes intellectual pornography for mediocre Western readers.”Mr. Bilek said the ambivalence here about Mr. Kundera was such that many in the dissident community still considered his most famous book, “The Unbearable Lightness of Being,” a “mocking betrayal” because of its depiction of a dissident surgeon who embraces his new life as a lecherous window cleaner. The novel was only officially published here in Czech a few years ago, more than 25 years after it first appeared in France. It sold a mere 10,000 copies.When the article appeared, Mr. Kundera, now a French citizen who only visits the Czech Republic incognito, denounced the story as the “assassination of an author.”For all the excoriation of Mr. Kundera, many academics and critics have also heaped scorn on the Respekt article, a sign of the schizophrenia that arises whenever relations with the widely despised Communists are examined.They have challenged the veracity of the police report purporting to reveal Mr. Kundera as an informer and accused the authors, who worked closely with the government-backed Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, of exaggerating the evidence.Jiri Pehe, a prominent Czech sociologist and director of New York University in Prague, said the accusations had polarized Czech society into two camps: those who believe that Mr. Kundera may have been guilty, but also see him as a moral scapegoat for their own collaboration; and those who view the article as an act of Czech treachery motivated by petty jealousy.He said Czechs had a long history of debunking heroes, including former President Vaclav Havel, who led the Velvet Revolution that overthrew Communism here in 1989 but is still resented by many of his countrymen.In 1991, the Czechs were among the first Eastern-bloc countries to introduce a law banning from public life those listed as agents or informers in secret police reports. The law, Mr. Pehe contended, had ensnared tens of thousands of people who may have been unwilling collaborators.“The reality is that the totalitarian regime was constructed in such a way that 99 percent of people cooperated in one way or another, and the Kundera case helps them to feel morally absolved, like they are the good guys and he was one of the baddies,” Mr. Pehe said.Many historians have found the evidence wanting. The policeman quoted in the secret police report naming Mr. Kundera is dead, and Mr. Kundera’s signature is nowhere on the document.The institute, created this year by the center-right Czech government to collect and publish Communist-era files, stood by the report.“No reasonable doubts have been raised about the accuracy or authenticity of the documents,” said Vojtech Ripka, the head of the institute’s documentation department. “We are not engaged in witch hunts and we are not going after public figures, and that includes Kundera, whose file was discovered by accident.” He said Mr. Kundera had been contacted to comment and had declined to respond.Mr. Ripka said the revelation came to light when Adam Hradilek, who works for the institute, was researching so-called “agent walkers” of the 1950s — defectors who returned as undercover agents for Western spy agencies. He said Mr. Hradilek stumbled on the Kundera file while researching the story of Iva Militka, a distant relative of Mr. Hradilek’s, who had long blamed herself for the imprisonment of Mr. Dvoracek.According to the police file published on the Institute’s Web site, on March 14, 1950, Mr. Kundera informed the police of Mr. Dvoracek’s presence in Prague. Mr. Dvoracek had deserted the Czechoslovak Army and, after the 1948 Communist coup, fled to Germany, where he was recruited by American intelligence.Mr. Ripka said Mr. Hradilek’s research showed that Mr. Dvoracek had visited Ms. Militka, who was an old school friend, and left a suitcase in her apartment. She told her boyfriend and future husband, Miroslav Dlask, who in turn told Mr. Kundera. Mr. Dvoracek was arrested when he came to collect the suitcase. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison and served 14, working in uranium mines.The mystery became even murkier this week when Zdenek Pesat, a literary historian and former member of the Communist Party, told the Czech news agency CTK that Mr. Dlask had told him years before that he had reported Mr. Dvoracek to the secret police, most likely because he wanted to prevent his girlfriend from being punished.Mr. Tresnak, 32, one of the writers of the Respekt article, insisted that the allegation against Mr. Kundera, if true, was morally unambiguous because Mr. Kundera had informed on someone during the 1950s, a period of Stalinist repression when the Communists were executing opponents.He added that he had been shocked by Mr. Kundera’s vociferous response. “I have no serious doubts about Kundera’s guilt,” he said. “But his reaction was so strong, and I have asked myself, ‘Did we finger an innocent man?’ ”Ivo Pondelicek, a leading sexologist who has known Mr. Kundera for 50 years, said his friend could not have denounced someone. He said that in the 1950s, Mr. Kundera had been an ideological Communist, but not a fanatic. The article, he said, reflected resentment of Mr. Kundera’s charisma and success.“Milan was always introspective — he was not a fanatical Communist, and I completely exclude that he could have denounced someone in this way,” Mr. Pondelicek said. “It just does not match his pattern of behavior.”Some weeks ago, Mr. Pondelicek said, Mr. Kundera had left a message on his answering machine, saying, “They are pigs!” At the time he thought Mr. Kundera was referring to critical reviews of one of his plays. In retrospect, he said he believes Mr. Kundera may have realized that his well-guarded privacy was about to disappear.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','The Obama campaign’s advertising approach — which has included advertisements up to two minutes long in which Mr. Obama lays out his agenda and even advertisements in video games like “Guitar Hero” — has helped mask some of Mr. Obama’s rougher attacks on his rival.“What Obama is doing is being his own good cop and bad cop,” said Evan Tracey, the chief operating officer of CMAG, who called the advertising war “a blowout” in Mr. Obama’s favor.Based on his current spending, CMAG predicts Mr. Obama’s general election advertising campaign will surpass the $188 million Mr. Bush spent in his 2004 campaign by early next week. Mr. McCain has spent $91 million on advertising since he clinched his party’s nomination, several months before Mr. Obama clinched his.The size of the disparity has even surprised aides to Mr. McCain, who traded accusations with Mr. Obama over the advertising battle in this week’s debate, with Mr. Obama telling Mr. McCain that “your ads, 100 percent of them have been negative” and Mr. McCain saying that “Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.”The most recent analysis of the presidential advertisements by the University of Wisconsin, based on the period from Sept. 28 through Oct. 4, found that nearly 100 percent of Mr. McCain’s commercials included an attack on Mr. Obama and that 34 percent of Mr. Obama’s advertisements, which were more focused that week on promoting his agenda, included an attack on Mr. McCain.That finding reflected the McCain campaign’s strategy of trying to make Mr. Obama an unacceptable choice in the eyes of undecided voters and Mr. Obama’s goal of making undecided voters comfortable with him.But the Wisconsin Advertising Project says that since Mr. Obama wrapped up the Democratic nomination in June, 54 percent of Mr. McCain’s advertisements have been completely focused on attacking him, roughly a quarter have mixed criticism of Mr. Obama with a positive message about Mr. McCain, and 20 percent have been devoted solely to promoting Mr. McCain.In the same period, the study found that 41 percent of Mr. Obama’s advertisements had been devoted solely to attacking Mr. McCain, one-fifth mixed criticism of Mr. McCain with a positive message about Mr. Obama, and 38 percent were solely devoted to promoting Mr. Obama.The group reported that Mr. Obama has also had several weeks in which his advertising was nearly 100 percent negative or contrast advertisements, though considerably fewer such weeks than Mr. McCain has had.The percentages do not reflect the vastly greater number of spots run by Mr. Obama. But Mr. Goldstein said Mr. McCain had shown more purely negative advertisements than Mr. Obama had, in spite of Mr. Obama’s spending advantage.Here in Philadelphia, the biggest media market in a critical state, both candidates showed a mix of positive and negative advertisements on Friday. The spots seemed to show up across the dial as regularly as the affable Geico gecko or the ambling ne’er-do-wells of FreeCreditReport.com.During “Dr. Phil” on the CBS affiliate here, Mr. Obama showed a minute-long positive commercial recounting “one of my earliest memories: going with Grandfather to see some of the astronauts, being brought back after a splashdown, sitting on his shoulders and waving a little American flag.”But minutes earlier during the late afternoon news on the NBC station, Mr. Obama had criticized Mr. McCain over a health care plan that an announcer alleges “could leave you hanging by a thread.”Toward the end of the 4 p.m. newscast on the CBS station, Mr. McCain ran one of his rare purely positive spots, speaking directly into the camera and telling viewers, “The last eight years haven’t worked very well, have they?” He promises, “I have a plan for a new direction for the economy.”But on the NBC affiliate an advertisement approved by Mr. McCain was tying Mr. Obama to Antoin Rezko, a Chicago real estate developer convicted of fraud who is listed as among the friends Mr. Obama is said to reward “with your tax dollars.”That spot was co-sponsored by the Republican National Committee, which is allowed to split the costs with Mr. McCain on an unlimited number of advertisements, helping him to double the number of advertisements he can buy.Mr. McCain has used such advertisements to keep up with Mr. Obama’s advertising in vital cities like this one, where the campaigns have combined to spend the most in the general election but where Mr. Obama has recently outpaced Mr. McCain by nearly two to one. But such advertisements come with a caveat: they must include a reference to Congressional issues and leaders, making the message generally less direct.The spot with Mr. Rezko also shows the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts.But for every city like Philadelphia, in a state Mr. McCain views as important to his chances for victory, there are those like Miami, Washington and Chicago, where Mr. Obama has often been able to run advertisements nearly unopposed. Washington and Chicago are particularly expensive, and Mr. Obama will easily win both. But their stations reach parts of the contested states of Indiana and Virginia.Mr. McCain is also getting help from the Republican Party’s independent advertising unit, but it cannot coordinate with the party leadership or Mr. McCain’s campaign, meaning it is not always in line with Mr. McCain’s campaign message. And a smattering of outside groups are running hard-charging advertisements against Mr. Obama, but he has the money to immediately meet those attacks with spots directly addressing their charges.Now spending almost as much as he can in local television markets, Mr. Obama has increased his advertising on the broadcast television networks, including on National Football League games and soap operas.“They’re doing the networks” said Mr. Tracey, of CMAG, “because they’ve saturated these markets and they’re looking for more time.”Last Sunday, Mr. Obama bought so heavily on football games and other nationally televised programs that, according to CMAG, he spent $6.5 million on a day when Mr. McCain spent less than $1 million.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','Ms. Tymoshenko, who met with the delegation on Friday, expressed support for the loan. But if the president’s order to dissolve Parliament is upheld, she said, the cabinet will lack the authority to negotiate with the fund.In that case, negotiations will be delayed until a new Parliament is formed after the elections. After previous elections, coalition-building in Ukraine has taken months.“Alarm bells aren’t ringing yet,” Sergei Teriokhin, a former minister of the economy and member of Parliament in Ms. Tymoshenko’s bloc, said in a telephone interview. But if the contested status of the cabinet is not resolved, he said, the monetary fund will not know whom to meet with. “It is necessary that somebody in the country make guarantees on the budget policy of next year.”Mr. Yushchenko and Ms. Tymoshenko have alternately collaborated and competed since they rallied crowds together on Independence Square in Kiev during the protests known as the Orange Revolution in 2004. Most recently, his Our Ukraine bloc was in a coalition with Ms. Tymoshenko’s, an arrangement that gave her the prime minister’s post. But the two split after the Russian invasion of Georgia in August. Mr. Yushchenko accused Ms. Tymoshenko of muting her criticism of the Russian military action to please the Kremlin.The political turmoil has coincided with a steep economic decline. On Friday, the international agency Fitch Ratings downgraded Ukraine’s sovereign debt rating and issued a negative outlook for the country. A Ukrainian shipping company, Industrial Carriers, has gone bankrupt. The government has frozen rail tariffs for steel companies, and as foreign investment dries up, speculators are betting on a decline in the national currency.In response, Ukraine plans to nationalize some commercial banks, which have liquidity problems, a member of Parliament told the monetary fund’s delegation on Friday.Hungary, which has struggled to cope with the effects of the financial crisis, also received a vote of no confidence on Friday when Fitch cut its rating to negative from stable. Hungary’s large debt, much of it in foreign currencies, has made the country particularly vulnerable to the current external shocks.The government scaled back its growth estimates for 2009 to just 1.2 percent from 3 percent. Hungary has lined up support from the European Central Bank and the monetary fund in an effort to reassure credit and currency markets.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','General Motors, looking to raise cash as sales slump in the United States, said it had started distributing financial information to potential buyers of its Hummer Sport Utility Vehicle Unit. The automaker “has had interest from a few parties,” said Joanne Krell, a spokeswoman for G.M.,. in an interview. She declined to name them. G.M. has not set a date for a possible sale of Hummer and is still considering other options for the division, Ms. Krell said. Selling Hummer would help G.M. meet its goal of increasing its cash by $15 billion by the end of 2009. Hummer’s domestic sales this year through September declined 47 percent, more than double G.M.’S. 18 percent drop, as high gasoline prices curbed demand. G.M.,. which is based in Detroit, hired Citigroup for a review of the unit, which began in June. Hummer sales peaked in 2006 at 71,524 vehicles before dropping 22 percent last year, according to Autodata.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','But the Democrats’ grass-roots effort, along with the bad economic news, may be paying off. Mr. Obama has pulled even with Mr. McCain in the latest CNN/Time/Opinion Research poll, released on Tuesday. David Robertson, a political scientist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said he believed that the state was now leaning toward Mr. Obama, and that support for Mr. Obama “could be changing before our eyes.”“It could be increasing,” Mr. Robertson said.That represents a sharp reversal from this summer, when whites in the state’s conservative rural and exurban areas put Mr. McCain squarely in the lead. With a hybrid of Midwestern and Southern attitudes, such voters helped President Bush win the state in 2000 and 2004, the last time by nearly three percentage points above his national average.Now Mr. McCain has been forced to redouble his efforts, expanding the number of offices here over the last month to 16, from 10, party officials said.“Every day, the level of commitment from the McCain campaign increases,” said Jared Craighead, executive director of the state Republican Party, conceding that “it’s very difficult to put together a map for Senator McCain where he doesn’t get Missouri.”The candidates and their surrogates have visited the state repeatedly. Mr. Obama will give a speech Saturday at the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Mr. McCain is scheduled to visit the state on Monday, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, was here last week, and Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill, will be here this weekend.Registration on the Republican side appears to be down in traditionally conservative bastions in the southeastern part of the state, Mr. Robertson said. “The Republicans seem to be discouraged,” he said.Still, they are far from giving up. Mr. Obama’s momentum notwithstanding, the prevailing mood is one of uncertainty, from coffee houses to the suites of political professionals in the suburbs to main street offices like that of Dan Hale, a lawyer here in the east-central country town of Steelville.“I’m not convinced my prediction is correct,” Mr. Hale said, having cautiously just forecast that Mr. Obama would win the state in a squeaker.Nobody is willing to place a no-fail bet on the outcome, largely because of exurban and rural spots like this one.There are still substantial hurdles for Mr. Obama. Evangelicals, at 37 percent of the population, are a solid base for the Republicans, and in the Democratic primary, Mr. Obama lost all but five counties, two of which contained the state's biggest cities, St. Louis and Kansas City.He still narrowly won the primary, but general election winners are rarely decided in Missouri’s cities. Rural Missouri, where at least 30 percent of the population lives, and the towns between Kansas City and St. Louis pose a challenge to Mr. Obama. Bill Clinton won Crawford County, whose county seat is Steelville, in 1996, but the county has gone Republican, like the state, ever since.“It won’t be easy for people to vote for Obama,” Mr. Hale said, looking out over the modest brick courthouse in this old mining town, population 1,445, about 75 miles southwest of St. Louis. “There’s concern that Obama is associated with people that don’t like us, and don’t look like us.”The deal is not closed in a state that deserves its reputation for cautious deliberation.“I have mixed emotions about it; I haven’t made up my mind,” said Jack Billingsley, a car salesman up the street from Mr. Hale who usually votes Republican. Crawford County was strictly Republican a few years ago, Mr. Billingsley said. “But it’s not like that this year.”Mr. Obama has clung tenaciously to his goal of capturing votes in these rolling hills and tenuous downtowns. His field director in nearby Rolla, population 17,000, works out of a storefront where the window’s unassuming Obama sign shares inconspicuous billing with local candidates. Mr. Obama made a campaign stop in Rolla this summer. Two years ago, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, made inroads by campaigning relentlessly in country areas that had been all but conceded for good to the Republicans. She narrowed margins in solid Republican counties in conservative southwestern Missouri, and even picked up a few elsewhere.“It is a very, very competitive state,” said David Webber, a political science professor at the University of Missouri.The state’s economy is fraying. The unemployment rate in July was Missouri’s highest in 17 years, and a small-machines factory in Rolla that employed 800 closed last year.These developments suggest why Mr. Obama’s television spending in Missouri over several weeks in September outpaced Mr. McCain’s by about a third — Mr. Kerry was pulling advertisements off the air in the state at this point four years ago — and why even some Republican experts can construct scenarios in which McCain loses the state.Officially, Republicans say Mr. Obama’s “liberal message,” as Mr. Craighead, the state party director, put it, rules him out in Missouri.Unofficially, other factors are in play.“It’s all going to turn on, will the same young voters who put Obama over the top in the primary turn out again?” said Paul Zemitzsch, a veteran Republican consultant in the state.Meanwhile, older voters, more resistant to the Democratic nominee, are being softened up by the fragile economic climate. “The banking crisis has shaken up people in the rural area,” said Joe Maxwell, a former Democratic lieutenant governor and now a lawyer in Mexico, Mo., who has been stumping the country roads for Mr. Obama.To win the state, Mr. Obama must capture swing exurban counties, like Jefferson and Washington in the east, and blue-collar, union-heavy areas south of St. Louis that were taken by Mr. Clinton, Al Gore and Mrs. McCaskill, but lost by Mr. Kerry. The state of the economy is giving Mr. Obama an audience.“Nobody around here likes the Republicans,” said John Burt, a union carpenter, in the parking lot of a Country Mart store in De Soto, south of St. Louis. Mr. Bush “didn’t do nothing right,” Mr. Burt said. “He’s for the rich person.”Up the road at a Wal-Mart, Mike Bosler, a beer truck driver, said he thought Mr. Obama had “a better feel for what it’s like to be from the predominant class of Americans.”“McCain just seems like he was born and raised a rich kid,” Mr. Bosler said.Deeper into rural Washington County, “people don’t know what to do” about the election, said Tim Gillam, a mail carrier filling his car with gas in Old Mines. “They’re undecided.”The cultural barriers for a Democrat, though, are real. “I’m still not sure they’re going to overcome past Republican rhetoric, particularly around the gun and abortion issue,” said State Senator Frank A. Barnitz, a Democrat from the rural Ozarks. “In this region, it is a very, very big hurdle.Warren Nelson, a trucker in De Soto, described himself as “a little bit prejudiced” in explaining his opposition to Mr. Obama, adding that Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska made Mr. McCain’s ticket a powerful draw.Ms. Palin has added to the state’s indecision by attracting some conservative Democrats who had been drawn to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the primary.“There’s a lot of women that maybe have different beliefs than Sarah, but they’re pretty fascinated that, ‘Oh my gosh, we have a woman who could be No. 2,’ ” said State Representative Belinda Harris, a Democratic from the rural end of Jefferson County, south of St. Louis.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','An appearance by Senator John McCain on Thursday night boosted David Letterman to his best ratings in almost three years. Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, returned to Mr. Letterman’s CBS show after several weeks of battering from the host for his abrupt decision to cancel an earlier appearance. According to initial overnight ratings, the Letterman show attracted 6.53 million viewers, well above Mr. Letterman’s usual total of about 3.5 million viewers and the best he has scored since Dec. 1, 2005. (That night’s guest was another noteworthy figure with whom the host had had an on-and-off comic feud: Oprah Winfrey.) Mr. Letterman, who usually trails Jay Leno’s “Tonight Show” by a significant margin, easily eclipsed that NBC star; Mr. Leno had 4.57 million viewers Thursday night for a show whose guests included Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic vice presidential nominee.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','In an effort to reassure Wall Street that Sumner M. Redstone does not need to sell more shares in Viacom and CBS to address debt problems at his privately held company, Viacom said on Friday that it would end its program to buy his shares at the same rate that it repurchased from public shareholders.Viacom has had a public stock buyback program in place for several years that acquired shares from National Amusements, Mr. Redstone’s privately held company, at the same time to keep his controlling economic interest constant.On Oct. 10, National Amusements, which is run by Mr. Redstone’s daughter, Shari, sold $233 million worth of stock in Viacom and CBS. On Tuesday, the company issued a statement saying that the sale was prompted by market conditions and not by the operation and expansion of the company’s theater business.National Amusements said that it had no intention of selling additional shares in either Viacom or CBS. Because the sale of stock reduced Mr. Redstone’s holdings, further buybacks from the public would keep his relative stake intact.The stock sale, which sent Viacom’s shares down $3.58, to $16.50, and CBS down $2.04, to $8.10, on Oct. 10, unnerved investors, raising questions about whether Mr. Redstone would have to sell additional shares, which have recovered somewhat. Shares of Viacom closed on Friday at $18.21, while CBS finished at $9.41. The sale also raised the question of whether Mr. Redstone, his daughter and Viacom’s chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, had any conflicts of interest. All three serve on the boards of Viacom and National Amusements; Mr. Redstone and his daughter are also CBS directors.In announcing the sale, the company said it had been prompted by the violation of debt covenants. But the size of its debt load, $1.6 billion in bank loans and bonds, also surprised investors. The sources of that debt go back to National Amusements’ original purchase of Viacom stock; the cost of building movie theaters; a $240 million settlement with Mr. Redstone’s son, Brent; and Mr. Redstone’s purchase of more than 85 percent of the stock in Midway Games as well as loans to Midway, according to a person briefed on the matter.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','Cindy McCain took less money out of her family beer business in 2007 than in the previous year, documents released late Friday suggested.Ms. McCain released the first two pages of her newly filed 2007 federal tax return, revealing little new information about the finances of the potential First Family, who file separately.Ms. McCain had obtained an extension “because she had not received all information necessary to complete the returns,” according to Senator John McCain’s campaign. She reported total income for 2007 of $4.2 million, including about $2.9 million in proceeds from a category of investments that includes profit-taking from Hensley & Company, the dominant Budweiser dealership in Arizona that her father, James Hensley, founded in the 1950s and which is the main source of her wealth.In 2006 Ms. McCain reported more than $6 million in income, of which the profits from Hensley accounted for more than $4.5 million. She took a salary of $432,991 from Hensley last year, according to earlier disclosures.According to the 2007 return, Ms. McCain paid total taxes of $1,138,189 and reported an overpayment of $954,112, which she asked to have applied to her 2008 estimated tax. (In 2006, her overpayment was just under $300,000.) She claimed itemized deductions of $527,666, but did not disclose the details.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','“The more you think about it, there’re so many different ways that so many different people could be responsible for this,” said H. Adam Prussin, a partner at Pomerantz Haudek Block Grossman & Gross, referring to losses suffered in this financial crisis. His firm is representing Fannie Mae investors. “There are the lenders who screwed up in the first place, there are the people who bought these things from the lenders and then didn’t account correctly for them.”A recent report by the law firm Fulbright & Jaworski found that more than one-third of lawyers working internally for companies expected to see more litigation in 2009. Lawyers at the biggest companies were more likely to expect a boom in lawsuits, according to the study.One factor contributing to litigation is the rapid availability of information about corporate mistakes and losses, which in the past might have taken longer to circulate among investors, said Michael Young, a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher in New York.“What’s really going on here is a type of accounting that is capturing changes in value and making them public much faster than anything we’ve seen before,” Mr. Young said.Armed with such data, shareholders have charged the courthouse steps, claiming that companies failed to disclose their vulnerability to declines in the real estate market, often through holdings of securities backed by home loans. Even companies that have suffered huge losses may still be worth pursuing because of their liability insurance.“You can’t get blood from a stone,” said Joseph A. Grundfest, a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission who now teaches at Stanford Law School. “But you sure can get money from the insurance company that covered the stone.”There are other deep pockets, even in the current economic climate. When confronted by bankruptcy filings or government takeovers, the lawsuits name every possible defendant involved in a stock offering — the underwriters, the rating agencies and individual executives — but not the issuing company itself. That way, they avoid the problem of fighting with other creditors in bankruptcy or the question of whether they can sue the government.In the case brought by Fannie shareholders, for example, Fannie itself is not a defendant. A suit filed last month by investors who bought Freddie Mac shares names only Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. The suit claims that the investment firms, which underwrote a Freddie Mac stock offering, did not disclose the company’s “massive exposure to mortgage-related losses.” (JPMorgan Chase did not underwrite the offering itself but it acquired Bear Sterns, which did).Events have moved quickly enough that some lawyers have found that their lawsuits may have been filed too early, before the biggest losses and consequently before the biggest damage claims were possible.“The plaintiffs’ firm will try to amend the existing complaint in order to allege subprime losses,” said Stephen Froot, a partner at Boies Schiller & Flexner. So lawyers might argue, for example, that falling stock prices over the last few months are related to a claim made much earlier.It remains to be seen how receptive judges will be to efforts to add to complaints. Judge John E. Sprizzo of Federal District Court in Manhattan in July rejected an attempt to add new claims to a complaint filed by shareholders of the American International Group in 2004.“The proposed amendments concern different time periods, different divisions of the company, different management, different alleged objectives, different disclosures and different shareholders,” Judge Sprizzo wrote.One difference between this and previous waves of litigation is the greater number of companies that have been hurt by the continuing credit squeeze and subprime mortgage collapse and that are willing to sue individually, not as part of a shareholder class action and often not under securities laws. These cases may be the most significant, lawyers said, because they could force courts to decide what a big, sophisticated investor must show to support a claim that it was duped.Almost three weeks ago, MBIA filed a lawsuit against Countrywide Financial, accusing the company of lying about the quality of mortgage-backed securities that MBIA essentially guaranteed. MBIA has paid more than $459 million on those guarantees as mortgage defaults become more frequent and the value of the securities fall.“Although there were supposed to have been prudent underwriting standards, it turned out that all the borrower needed was a heartbeat to get a loan,” said Michael B. Carlinsky, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver & Hedges, which is representing MBIA.His firm also represents two units of Fifth Third Bancorp that sued the Transamerica Insurance Company and Clark Consulting after losing $323 million on complex investments the insurer oversaw. Fifth Third had invested more than $600 million indirectly in a hedge fund that turned out to be heavily exposed to fluctuations in the residential real estate market.Such potential litigation on behalf of big companies is so attractive that lawyers at even a few white-shoe law firms, which hardly ever sue a financial firm out of fear of alienating a potential client, now say they may change that policy on behalf of clients that have lost hundreds of millions of dollars. (Of course, none of these lawyers would say this on the record.)One major reason that more lawsuits have not yet been filed is the difficulty some of these companies face in figuring out how much money they have lost in markets that have yet to settle.“Until the market determines what these instruments are worth, no one knows what claims they have,” said Stephen P. Younger, a partner at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler in New York.There is another reason some public companies may be waiting to go to court. They may not want to disclose just how big their losses are or reveal something else in a court document that could, in turn, attract a shareholder suit.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','In reading Thomas L. Friedman’s column describing the moral hazard of easy credit, I saw a parallel in the federal government’s fiscal policy.In reducing taxes while increasing spending and driving up the deficit and national debt to record levels, the administration believed that the increased availability of capital from low taxes and high spending levels would generate G.D.P. growth to more than offset any shortfall. Is this really any different from a homeowner’s overleveraging on cheap debt in the belief that increases in home values would cover the risk?With this kind of fiscal leadership providing the example, is it any wonder the country followed suit in piling on debt and counting on growth to pull it through?Thomas L. Friedman writes, “The Puritan ethic of hard work and saving ... is more alive today in China than in America.” He warns that we have to return to the basics in mortgage lending to where the person receiving the loan can actually pay it back.There are a few sub-subprime lenders in some of the poorest places in the world who are actually getting mortgage lending right. Jamii Bora, a microfinance group started in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, is building a new town of 2,000 houses and 3,000 business spaces. The houses each have two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and bathroom and cost the same as a one-room shack in the slums. What is required to qualify for a home loan is having successfully repaid three self-employment loans.Grameen Bank’s home loans to more than 600,000 Bangladeshis also require successfully repaying three self-employment loans.Yes, “how” really does matter.Thomas L. Friedman wrote: “You cannot tell tens of thousands of people that they can have the American dream — a home, for no money down and nothing to pay for two years — without that eventually catching up to you.”We Americans inbreed this mentality, this delaying of payment due, across the marketplace, not only with reckless home-buying commitments. Need I remind everyone about the enticements of zero down, a year before your first payment (in some cases, two years or three) of our leading home appliance giants? Rich or poor, we have all had those pitches drilled into our consumer-driven heads.A $600 deferred payment on a stove and a $250,000 deferred payment on a home produce a related, pervasive mentality — and it is poisonous.Why is the American dream defined solely in terms of owning one’s own home? Why is this particularly American?Why isn’t the American dream ever spoken of in terms of justice, equality, freedom and responsibility? Does the very definition of who we are as a people and nation have to boil down to things and owning them — however necessary and desirable?'"
"'08-10-18,'0','In the months since, two Palestinians driving large construction vehicles and a third behind the wheel of a BMW have rammed vehicles and pedestrians in West Jerusalem, killing three Israelis and wounding scores, deliberately, according to the police. All the drivers, who were killed on the spot, were residents of East Jerusalem, including Jebel Mukaber. None were known to have had any strong political affiliations.“We live in fear,” said an Israeli woman, Mazal Tzabah, 64, at a bus stop in Armon Hanatziv, the Jewish neighborhood bordering Jebel Mukaber. “We don’t know who is good from bad.”About a quarter of a million Palestinians, mostly Muslim, live in the generally poorer and less developed Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, making up a third of the city’s population. Almost 200,000 Jews live alongside them in a patchwork of new neighborhoods, like Armon Hanatziv, that have been built over the 1967 boundaries on territory the Palestinians demand as the capital of their future state.Adding to the mélange, a number of Jewish housing projects have sprung up like minisettlements in existing Arab neighborhoods, including Nof Zion, a luxury apartment complex that is being marketed to religious Jews and that sits at the entrance of Jebel Mukaber. Meanwhile, an increasing number of Arab families are quietly moving into Jewish areas on both sides of the 1967 line.The police report a sharp increase in the number of East Jerusalem residents arrested for involvement in violence or the planning of attacks in the past year. While the city has experienced worse violence, like the deadly bus and cafe bombings of previous years, most of those were carried out by Palestinians who came in from the West Bank.Since Israel considers all of Jerusalem as its united, sovereign capital, there are no permanent barriers in the heart of the city; its Palestinian residents, unlike West Bankers, have free access to all parts.In this tense arrangement, tolerance is often tested. When sectarian rioting broke out on Oct. 8 between Jews and Arabs in the mixed city of Acre in northern Israel, the police immediately went on high alert in East Jerusalem for fear the violence could spread.Many Jewish residents say they live in trepidation. Arab residents charge that rather than trying to find a political solution for the city, Israel is trying to Judaize the eastern part and squeeze the Palestinians out.Meaningful social interaction is rare. But even amid the rising antagonism, some are trying to reach across the psychological divide.On Sept. 21, young Jewish and Palestinian musicians came together for a joint rock concert sponsored by the United States Consulate at the historic Y.M.C.A. building on King David Street — the site of one of the construction vehicle attacks in July — under the slogan “the mic is more powerful than the gun.”One of the performers, Muhammad Mughrabi, 21, a rapper from the Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem, says his friends there think it strange that he appears with Israelis.“Until I was 15, all the Israelis I met were soldiers, and I was very afraid,” he said.There are other examples of coexistence. Groups of Israeli and Palestinian women meet to discuss weight issues, brought together by an American-Israeli filmmaker who founded the project in 2006, making a documentary called “A Slim Peace.”Ir Amim, an Israeli group that advocates an equitable political solution for Jerusalem, is offering tours of East Jerusalem to show Israelis what life looks like on the other side.Beyond that, the Interreligious Coordinating Council in Israel has been organizing modest people-to-people exchanges between East and West Jerusalem for years.Jerusalem is “a very weird city,” said Ron Kronish, the council’s director. “Life goes on, but the amount of separate living is staggering.”He added, “The question is how do real people live amidst conflict, and how can you best mitigate it, meaning having a little less hatred.”Yet the tensions persist. The night after the Y.M.C.A. concert, which ended with a warm if chaotic improvisation of Bob Marley’s “No More Trouble,” a 19-year-old from Jebel Mukaber took his brother’s BMW and rammed it into a group of off-duty soldiers and civilians, wounding several, outside the Old City at a point where the East meets West.Mourners who gathered at his spacious family home were convinced that the youth, an inexperienced driver with no license, was involved in a simple traffic accident and was needlessly killed by one of the soldiers.“All he cared about, as far as I know, was to have a nice car and listen to music,” said Omar Baidun, 45, a businessman and family friend.Yet there were no doubts about the driver’s intentions in the Jewish neighborhood of Armon Hanatziv.Dalia Ben Shitreet, 47, an Israeli hairdresser who lives on the outer rim of the neighborhood, only a street away from Jebel Mukaber, said that she was “for coexistence” and that some of her clients and occupants of her own apartment building were Muslim Arabs.But she added that she was afraid to walk out at night; that Jebel Mukaber was “hostile” and should be “razed to its foundations — though I am sorry and ashamed to say it.”'"
"'08-10-18,'0','From the start, Mrs. McCain’s marriage has been defined by her husband’s ambitions, and despite her sometimes punishing ride in political life, she does whatever she must to help fulfill them. As his poll numbers have slid recently, her devotion has seemed only to grow. When the McCain campaign recently stepped up attacks on Senator Barack Obama, Mrs. McCain joined in with startling intensity. The day after the second presidential debate, which did not turn around Mr. McCain’s standing in the polls, she interrupted a Fox News interview he was doing to testify to his virtues. At this late date, Mrs. McCain is starting to headline her own rallies, starting in Pennsylvania on Saturday.“She would walk on broken glass barefoot if it required her to do so in this campaign,” said Matt Salmon, a former Arizona congressman who knows the couple.Mrs. McCain, 54, describes herself as her husband’s best friend, though for the last two decades they have mostly lived apart, she in Arizona, he in Washington. She initially seemed like an ideal political partner, giving Mr. McCain a home state, money and contacts that jump-started his career. But as the years passed, she also became a liability at times. She played a role in the Keating Five savings-and-loan scandal, and just as her husband was rehabilitating his reputation, she was caught stealing drugs from her nonprofit organization to feed her addiction to painkillers. She has a fortune that sets the McCains apart from most other Americans, a problem in a presidential race that hinges on economic anxieties. She can be imprecise: she has repeatedly called herself an only child, for instance, even though she has two half-siblings, and has provided varying details about a 1994 mercy mission to Rwanda.Those close to Mrs. McCain say she aspires to be like another blonde, glamorous figure married to an older man: Diana, the Princess of Wales. Mrs. McCain sought out the same mine-clearing organization that the princess supported, joining its board and traveling to minefields, just as her role model had. Mrs. McCain recently told British reporters that as first lady, she would take her cues from Diana, throwing herself into international philanthropy.First, though, the McCains must win. Mrs. McCain has traveled by her husband’s side on the campaign trail and helped reorganize the campaign after it floundered in 2007. When The New York Times reported last winter that Mr. McCain’s staffers had urged him to stay away from a female lobbyist during his first presidential run, Mrs. McCain stood by her husband at a news conference and defended his honor.Politics have always brought the McCains together: as she remarked during his failed 2000 presidential run, campaigns are when the two spend the most time with each other.“Just when I think we’re complete opposites, it turns out we’re not, that we’ve had a common goal — first the children and now this,” she told Harper’s Bazaar last year.Some of Mr. McCain’s Washington friends say they have barely met Mrs. McCain, while fellow mothers at their children’s schools say they have little sense of her husband. The two often relax in separate places: Mr. McCain prefers the family’s ranch in the Arizona desert, while Mrs. McCain’s refuge is a high-rise condominium on the Pacific. (Her husband is “not a beach person,” she recently told Vogue.)From the beginning, John and Cindy McCain had two entirely different experiences of Washington. He was the most popular member of the freshman Congressional class of 1983, with the most heroic background, the most uproarious jokes and, from his days as the Senate’s Navy liaison, the highest-level contacts. “John was clearly the star from the first day,” said Steve Bartlett, a former congressman from Texas.Mrs. McCain was 28, nearly two decades younger than her husband and just five years older than his eldest-son. “Cindy was a little bit star struck by John’s fame and the strength of his personality,” said Diana Dunn, who socialized with the couple. Ms. Dunn, the former wife of William S. Cohen, the former Maine senator and defense secretary, recalls the new Mrs. McCain as gracious but timid, unschooled in Washington conversation, and worried about fitting in.Carol McCain was still a presence on the social scene, working in the Reagan White House and as an events planner. Everyone knew her story: she had stood by her husband during his captivity in North Vietnam, never passing word of a debilitating car accident, only to discover, a few years after their reunion, that he was leaving her for a younger, richer woman.Rejected by the clubby Congressional wives, Cindy McCain tried to befriend her husband’s aides.“She seemed lonely,” said Lisa Boepple, a former chief of staff. But “she was John’s wife, so we didn’t really want to hang around with her.”Mrs. McCain announced she was returning to Phoenix to start a family, but friends detected other reasons. “I think Cindy made an intellectual decision: I could stay here and fight this, or I could go and do more productive things,” said Ms. Ross, the friend from back home.Ever since, the McCains have led only partly overlapping lives, with Mr. McCain — who was first elected to the Senate in 1986 — spending the week in Washington. The separation had a political upside: Mr. McCain, initially considered something of a carpetbagger, boasted that his family lived in Arizona. He flew home on weekends, but spent part of them campaigning.In his absence, Mrs. McCain organized elaborate fund-raisers, like a “South Pacific” affair to complement his naval background, complete with Polynesian dancers. She shopped for thoughtful gifts: engraved silver platters to give to staff members on primary night, gold elephant lapel pins, and gag presents, like a cowboy outfit for Victoria Clarke, then an aide who knew little about the West. For his district offices, she ordered native Arizonan plants — which all promptly died, according to Peggy Rubach, a former aide.Mrs. McCain expanded her childhood home, turning it into a 10,000-square-foot mansion that struck more than one visitor as a shrine to her husband. On the walls, she hung photos of the storied McCain military clan and her husband clasping hands with Republican presidents. Elephants adorned the wallpaper in one bathroom and a pot rack in the kitchen. In the master suite, she installed a fireplace carved with “MC,” for McCain.When he was home, the two were “as affectionate as you can be with John McCain,” said Wes Gullet, a former aide, explaining that his old boss, with his military training, restless energy and sarcastic humor, is not the cuddly type. “He’s a funny and vivacious guy, but he is not someone who spends his weekend watching ‘The Way We Were,’ ” Mr. Gullet said.Recently, Mrs. McCain has called the separations painful, volunteering that she endured several miscarriages alone. She spent subsequent pregnancies mostly confined to home, Ms. Ross said, sitting in a favorite stuffed chair, watching videos. But she rarely complained. “Her attitude was as a good soldier,” Mr. Gullet said.As her family grew, her parents moved across the street to help out, even ordering birthday gifts to be given in her husband’s name. “I’m sure John hasn’t been able to get anything done, so send something Cindy would enjoy,” Marguerite Hensley, Mrs. McCain’s mother, would tell G. Darrell Olson, a local jeweler. “John doesn’t have a lot of money, so find something in the $5,000 area,” she added, according to Mr. Olson. (One year, Mr. McCain chose his own gift for his wife: a ring with her children’s birthstones.)Mr. McCain regretted his absences, but he saw himself as an improvement on his own father and grandfather. “John’s dad had gone to war on Dec. 7” — the day Pearl Harbor was attacked — “and didn’t come home for years at a time,” Mr. Gullet said.Whatever humiliation Mrs. McCain suffered in her first Washington foray, her trips there in 1989, for weeks of Senate hearings on the savings-and-loan scandal, were worse.“I can remember once during that time, Cindy saying she didn’t know how she was going to get up in the morning,” Ms. Ross said. For the ever-present news cameras, Mrs. McCain developed what Ms. Ross called “that stone face” — an impassive mask.Her husband was accused of improperly intervening on behalf of a donor, Charles Keating, whose failed savings and loan had cost taxpayers billions. Four other senators were implicated, and one Senate spouse: Mrs. McCain. She and her father had invested in a shopping center with Mr. Keating, and while Mr. McCain insisted that he had reimbursed Mr. Keating for vacations their families had taken together in the Bahamas, he said his wife, the family bookkeeper, could not find the receipts.Mrs. McCain busied herself with the American Voluntary Medical Team, a charity she founded to supply medical equipment and expertise to some of the neediest places on earth, like Micronesia, Vietnam and Kuwait in the weeks after the Persian Gulf war.When Mrs. McCain visited Bangladesh after a cyclone, she stopped at an orphanage founded by Mother Teresa, who was not, as the campaign has said, present for the visit. Mrs. McCain returned with two baby girls; Mr. Gullet later adopted one, and Mrs. McCain informed her husband on landing that they would adopt the other.In 1994, Mrs. McCain dissolved the charity after admitting that she had been addicted to painkillers for years and had stolen prescription drugs from it. She had used the drugs, first given for back pain, to numb herself during the Keating Five investigation, she confessed to Newsweek magazine. “The newspaper articles didn’t hurt as much, and I didn’t hurt as much,“ she wrote in an essay. “The pills made me feel euphoric and free.”The scandal broke just as her husband had been trying to rehabilitate his reputation. He had no idea his wife had been an addict, he told the press.Mrs. McCain has said that the smears during her husband’s 2000 presidential bid — he was accused of fathering a black child, a twisted reference to their daughter from Bangladesh — left her skittish about presidential politics.Observers of that campaign and the current one say she seems different this time — more guarded, more tense, superthin. She rarely campaigns away from her husband’s side, and yet their interactions on the trail often appear brief and formal. During the rolling primary-season seminars that Mr. McCain held in the back of his bus, Mrs. McCain sat up front. Once in a while, she joined him, sitting very straight, smiling and saying little. Physically, she seems fragile: she suffers from migraines, hobbled around on crutches last year after a knee injury and recently wore a wrist brace because of a handshaking injury.In speaking about each other, the McCains use standard lines: she praises his experience, he tells the crowd that she should really be the candidate. Meghan McCain, their daughter, performs the image-softening role spouses usually perform for each other: on her blog, she depicts her father joking around on campaign planes and her mother in polka-dot pajamas. On Friday, Mrs. McCain made rare contact with the reporters covering her husband, distributing Halloween candy and gaily advising, “Make your dentist happy!”In interviews, some of Mrs. McCain’s statements seem questionable. She often tells of how she moved to California, leaving her children behind, for four months in 2004 to recover from a stroke that left her unable to walk or speak. But news reports from the time indicate she had few discernible impediments. She gave interviews four days afterward, attended a baseball game with her husband and a reporter several weeks later, and spoke at a Tempe, Ariz., Chamber of Commerce event. “One month out, I feel wonderful,” she told the audience. The McCain campaign declined to resolve the discrepancy.Similarly, Mrs. McCain often mentions her travels to Rwanda at the height of the 1994 genocide — she wrote about it in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece and has been praised by politicians and newspaper columnists for jetting into the heart of a massacre. As with her other charity trips, participants praised her eagerness to help victims of tragedy. But news accounts and interviews indicate, and a campaign spokesman confirmed, that Mrs. McCain traveled after the genocide had ended, spending time with refugees in neighboring Zaire, now Congo. Asked if she was ever in Rwanda, as Mrs. McCain has stated many times, a campaign spokesman, Jill Hazelbaker, said “she was driven to the Zaire/Rwanda border in order to assess the conditions of the refugees entering the country.”Whatever stumbles she may have made in telling her story, Mrs. McCain has exhibited the signal trait of the political spouse: a burning desire to win. In summer 2007, she helped reorganize her husband’s campaign after it almost fell apart, sitting down with the books to review the cash-flow. Rick Davis, a contentious figure in the McCain camp because of his lobbying ties, emerged as campaign manager, in part because Mrs. McCain, with whom he spent months traveling and fund-raising, backed him.“It was at a time when most people had given up on John,” said Mr. Salmon, the former Arizona congressman. “When he was down, Cindy was extremely positive.”Asked to explain how Mrs. McCain can seem so uncomfortable on the trail and yet so intent on victory, friends say she truly believes that her husband is the best man for the job. Some note she has invested for decades in his career and now sees the ultimate prize in reach; others say she wants approval, from either her husband or the public. At a Florida rally on Thursday, the crowd greeted her with chants of “Cin-dy! Cin-dy!”If Mr. McCain wins, she would have to return to the town she says she dislikes, attending the same sorts of luncheons she once fled from. But this time — maybe at the annual event that Congressional wives have for the first lady — the women of Washington, including a few who shunned her the first time around, would have to applaud in Mrs. McCain’s honor.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','That raises the question of what might have happened if one major candidate had risked going against the unified political establishment in Washington and had voted against the bill. Would that move have appealed to the majority of Americans who say they dislike the bailout, or would it have backfired by making that candidate seem irresponsible?The debate on Wednesday might have been more entertaining — and perhaps more illuminating — if the two most prominent third-party candidates, the independent, Ralph Nader, and Bob Barr, a Libertarian, had been included. They represent the two major strains of opposition: Mr. Nader thinks it is homeowners, not banks, who deserve help, while Mr. Barr sees the bailout as a violation of free enterprise principles.If the split between the Republicans and Democrats cannot be seen in the overall support for the bailout, it can be seen in expectations of what will happen now.One question in the poll asked if the beneficiaries would be “mostly just a few big investors and people who work on Wall Street” or whether it would help “homeowners and people throughout the country as well.”A large majority of those polled — 63 percent — thought the bailout would benefit only Wall Street, and those voters were overwhelmingly for Senator Obama, by a 59 percent to 31 percent margin.If there were more people who thought the bailout would help everyone, perhaps Mr. McCain would be doing better in the polls. Among the 28 percent of Americans who thought everyone would benefit, the Obama lead is a statistically insignificant one point, 44 to 43.Among the Senate races that could be affected are two seats held by Republicans, in Minnesota and Georgia. The incumbents, Norm Coleman and Saxby Chambliss, were ahead in the polls before their vote for the bailout, but the latest polls give Mr. Coleman’s opponent, the former comedian Al Franken, a narrow lead. In Georgia, Mr. Chambliss has seen his substantial lead narrow, although he is still ahead of Jim Martin, a former state legislator. Both Democrats have made the votes a central issue in their campaigns.In the House, Jim Marshall, Democrat of Georgia, and Paul Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, are fighting tough races in which their Republican opponents are criticizing them for backing the bailout.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','“I feel unnerved,” said Robin Bruck-Tanner, a former assistant principal with the New York City Department of Education. Ms. Bruck-Tanner, who is 55, was planning to draw upon her pension next year, but now she questions whether that is the right move.She and her husband took an early retirement to move upstate. They started a pottery business, Loving Earth Studio in Arkville. Their investments were such that the move seemed viable, as long as they lived modestly.“Now we’re wondering, were we stupid to have left our jobs so early?” Ms. Bruck-Tanner said.She said that they were trying to restore their previous financial stability, but she was not sure it was worthwhile to build up a bigger savings cushion — a personal finance standby. “I’m stocking up on food and other things,” she said. “I feel like cash is losing its value. I’d rather use our money to buy things we need.”IT’S strange that during a time of such emotional and fiscal chaos, some of the golden rules of personal finance — save more, spend less, invest for the long haul — may seem undervalued.John Hoina, a podiatrist in Bethpage, N.Y., said he couldn’t see any reason to save. “You wish you had more in reserves. But I look at my investments and think, my God, all that savings — lost.”Although he would like to take his money out of the market, that seems even more pointless. “If I take it out, I get hit with a loss and I’m penalized on top of it. So you have to sit with it.”I sympathize. I feel as frozen (and cynical) as anyone else right now — and I’ve battled some unholy impulses to cash out my Roth I.R.A. and open a line of credit on my house while I can still get one. But I’m worried about the apparent decline of those basic guidelines.If there is one thing I have learned, it is that when any sort of fiscal-emotional fog descends, you may be your own worst enemy.There is far too much evidence, behaviorally and even neurologically, that we humans are the most irrational of economic agents, a fact that is not helping anyone right now.So if you’re sitting on the sidelines enduring the Big Wait, as a friend calls this market limbo, do yourself and your money a favor. Ignore fear; it doesn’t help. Re-examine the financial basics; there’s a reason “Live within your means” has lasted.Become a better steward of your money. It is still yours, isn’t it?'"
"'08-10-18,'0','Nebraska apportions some of its five Electoral College votes by Congressional district, and in Omaha and the surrounding areas there is a fierce battle being waged by the Obama and McCain campaigns for just one of those votes.There were, of course, pressing issues many voters wanted to discuss. Over the course of two weeks, a majority of those interviewed cited the economy as the crucial issue that would influence their vote next month. Grace notes were health care, national security and occasionally very place-specific concerns, like urban crime, factory job losses and underperforming schools.But the backdrop to all of that was something far more personal, as voters reacted openly and viscerally to Mr. McCain, the 72-year-old Republican war hero, yoked to one of the least popular presidents in modern times, and Mr. Obama, the unflappable and somewhat inscrutable Democrat from Chicago who would be the country’s first black president.Among the voters who had made up their minds, most expressed an almost frantic dislike for the other candidate — a dislike that was sometimes far greater than their zeal for their own man.“With Barack Obama,” said Cheryl Oddo, a Republican in Strongsville, Ohio, who intends to vote for Mr. McCain, “I don’t even feel like his policies are even a different way of what’s right for America. I think his policies are the way of losing America the way we know it now.”Ditto from the other side.“I’m voting for Obama because hopefully he’ll make a change in the jobs market and with gas prices,” said Alicia Egas, one of the thousands of unemployed voters in Elkhart, Ind., a hard-hit industrial town. With Mr. McCain in office, she said, she feared “everything would go downhill from here.”With Election Day less than three weeks away, the Americans encountered on this road trip held strong opinions but were far less defined by their region than they might have been the last time they voted in a presidential election. Some previously reliable Republican states like Nevada are in play, and there are generally more states not locked into the red-blue grid of the past.Superficial semiotics offered by pundits rarely proved true. In short, there was an awful lot of latte and Chablis sipping in the red states, and a whole bunch of strict parenting and duck hunting in the blue states.“Obviously we are conservative here,” said Cassi Warren, 36, a Republican in Omaha who stared at the protesters against Ms. Palin with a mix of contempt and amusement. “Fiscally, socially, in every way.”But she added, “I don’t think there would have been Kerry supporters here four years ago,” a reference to Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004.There was a young McCain supporter at the Palin rally with a bright red punk-rock haircut. The next day in nearby Bellevue, Neb., a conservatively dressed retired Air Force X-ray technician ripped into Mr. McCain over, among other things, her perception of his treatment of veterans.In Omaha, awash in McCain signs and its local paper celebrating Ms. Palin with bold headlines, it was hard to sense any dissent. But at the airport, a rental car saleswoman, who looked as though she was probably young enough to be voting in her first election, had a tiny Obama pin affixed to her Hertz shirt, and a random cafe dweller wore a blue Obama logo shirt.Ohio was a study in contrasts. In Toledo, the expansive Obama office was buzzing with volunteers, while the McCain office had a lone worker sitting on the same afternoon, staring into a computer.A walk around Greeley, Colo., revealed several streets with McCain and Obama signs alternating on every other yard. Empty lots by and large featured giant McCain signs, most likely left over from a recent rally there.Affixed in front of a sad little house on a tiny barren lot was a sign almost bigger than the porch: “HOPE.” In many cases, the candidates were more symbols than politicians to so many voters, and they saw no common ground with their neighbors leaning another way. The economy and race were the two great spoons that stirred that political pot.“I think everyone knows someone who has been out of a job, and that has to change,” said Susie Velasquez, a voter in Greeley. “And I don’t think that’s going to change unless we get Barack Obama in the White House.”Vernon Cecil, a Republican voter there, said Mr. Obama’s economic plan would do just the opposite.But the economy also has eroded away partisanship, and disgust among even hard-core Republicans toward their party was evident in unlikely corners.“The concept of nonregulation means don’t mess with business and business will take care of us,” said Mike Jones 63, a geologist in Elko, Nev., who is considering voting for a Democrat for the first time in his life. “But I was looking to retire, and now what do I retire on?”Twenty miles away in Lamoille, Nev., Lisa Lafferty, a bartender, summed up her perception of her hometown’s view of Mr. Obama in racial, not partisan, terms. She was among the countless people over the two weeks who spoke easily about their distrust of a black candidate to a reporter with a notebook in her hand.And it caused this reporter to wonder what it was about me. Was it the white color of my skin? My gender? My slight Midwestern accent, all the more pronounced as I moved east of the Missouri River — that gave people comfort in sharing their ugliest thoughts?“A lot of people here don’t think he’s believable,” said Ms. Lafferty, 26. “Race background, that’s a huge factor out here. If he were another white guy, people probably wouldn’t feel that. Most people are saying he won’t say the Pledge of Allegiance.”In Bellevue, Neb., Jessie Puglisi, 22, said, “Obama is the anti-Christ,” adding: “My husband feels the same way. He won’t even buy a magazine if Obama’s face is on it.”No matter the place, whether swathed in red or blue, there were voters marooned on their own little political islands.Dave and Anne Patton, Democrats, sat in the back of the bar in Lamoille, saying nothing as the bartenders and a few customers derided Mr. Obama.“We don’t discuss it much,” Mrs. Patton said. “There’s no point.”'"
"'08-10-18,'0','On Board 95, Eisenberg, winner of five world team titles, picked up this hand as dealer, vulnerable against nonvulnerable opponents:At the other seven tables in play, the player with this hand opened three diamonds. After two passes, the fourth player overcalled three no-trump, which ended the auction.Eisenberg passed. There were two more passes, then his right-hand opponent opened one no-trump, promising 15 to 17 points. Now Eisenberg bid three diamonds. The next player doubled, and it was passed out. The contract went down three, minus 800. (It is usually more dangerous to overcall than to open.)At the other table, Ekeblad made three no-trump, but Japan gained 9 imps to be down by 1 with one board to play: the diagramed deal.At both tables, North opened three diamonds, and South played in four spades. Each West led the club five. The declarers won with the jack and played the heart queen, taken by East’s ace.Ekeblad returned a club. Declarer won with his ace, ruffed his second heart in the dummy and ran the spade nine. Granovetter (West) won with his king and played another club to South’s king. Declarer cashed his spade ace and played another spade to go down one, losing three spades and one heart.So if Eisenberg went down one in four spades, the United States would win by 1 imp, but if he went down more, Japan would win.At Trick 3 the Japanese East shifted to a low trump.If Eisenberg had played low from his hand, West would have won with his king and probably would have returned his last spade to stop the heart ruff in the dummy. But then declarer could have made his contract. He could have taken that trick, played a club to his ace, cashed the spade ace and club king, led a diamond to dummy and discarded his last heart on the 13th club. He would have lost only two spades and one heart.However, South put up his spade ace and ruffed his heart in the dummy. He returned to his hand with a club and led a trump. West won with his king and played the heart king, which declarer ruffed.If only Eisenberg had known, he would have abandoned trumps, settled for one down and won the world title. But trying to make his contract, he played another trump. Disaster. East drew trumps, and the defense cashed two heart tricks for down three.Japan had won by 202 imps to 200. (The bronze medal went to Indonesia.)The Transnational World Mixed Teams was won by the Yeh Bros team of Gloria Meng, Chen Yeh, Gong Fang-Wen, Shen Chih-Kuo, Hu Sheau-Fong and Shih Juei-Yu. In the final, they defeated Russia by 101 imps to 69.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','I was reminded of this about a month ago, when I got a note from a man in , Mich., named Ron Stefanski. At the time, I was writing about reducing financial risk, and he and his family had recently splurged on a 38-foot sailboat and lowered the 20-year-old vessel into the waters of Lake Charlevoix. The question his message raised was whether spending money on a boat was actually wise, and if so, why?Money was part of what kept the family from buying a boat for years, even though Ron had long wanted one. Until four years ago, Ron’s wife, Kay, had been home raising their two boys, Dan, now 15 and Will, 17. Ron, who is 48 years old, is a vice president at Gale, a reference publisher.“We don’t have trust funds for our kids or oodles of discretionary income,” Ron said. “So I was the one who kept saying, ‘Do we really need to be spending money like this when we need to get money in the bank for college?’ ”But trying to do the math on buying a boat will often end badly, as it will with many large discretionary purchases. Boats depreciate, vacations are over in a week or two, and you probably won’t recoup the entire cost of your remodeled patio.Instead, the Stefanskis came to realize, the boat was an investment in something much more valuable than money. Ron’s mother died when he was 16, and his grandmother helped raise him. Three months before his first son was born, his grandmother was murdered in her home by her newspaper delivery boy.“When you look at life from that perspective, it’s about creating memories,” he said. “Because the good moments can be fleeting and they can be peppered with other experiences that you don’t want to be as memorable.”A boat is also an investment in relationships, something that isn’t readily apparent until you’re on one a lot. Kay, who is 46 and works in textbook sales, helped talked Ron into buying the boat.“We’re getting ready to be empty-nesters, learning how to navigate the space of being alone together, and that’s something that’s been a little bit sobering,” Ron said. “What she helped me to see is that having the boat is an opportunity to connect, to spend time together when the boys are off doing their own thing.”In fact, Dan and Will have been on the boat a fair bit, too.“As a teenager, I look forward to doing things that teenagers do, going to parties and hanging out with my friends,” Dan said. “But the boat was something I really learned to love.”That has been an added bonus, given that the boys will soon be in college or away for the summers.“This was a window of opportunity,” Ron said. “And the fact that we have to put the effort into driving up to the lake, it marks the time as untouchable.”The Stefanskis paid $55,000 for their boat and financed the purchase with a $30,000 home equity line of credit. They earn more than $250,000 each year, though that is a relatively recent development in their lives.If you make much less and have much less, you may be wondering what all this has to do with you. But not every investment of this sort needs to have a four- or five-figure price tag to be significant.Perhaps it’s buying a better bicycle and taking daylong rides with others (or commuting to work to get in shape and save money on gas). Or it’s the fanciest paella pan or stone you can find, which keeps you out of expensive restaurants and at home with friends and family who will appreciate your new skills, the free meal and the conversation.A sports car probably doesn’t qualify here. Nor does a . Instead, it’s about investing money tactically in our relationships with one another, building bonds that last beyond ones to any particular employer or a house that we may no longer be able to afford.For people who find themselves frightened by the possibility of a long, deep recession, well, the Stefanskis know how you feel. Since they bought the boat, the balance in their retirement accounts has fallen by about a quarter. The investments in the college savings accounts for the two teenage boys have hit the skids, and the troubled regional economy means their house in Ann Arbor is worth a lot less as well.In the last downturn, Ron lost his job two weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks, and it wasn’t a great time to be looking for work.What the family learned then, however, leaves them with no regrets now that they are boat owners, even though their jobs are potentially vulnerable once again.“If you value family and friendships and experiences, the things that you might lose don’t mean quite as much,” Kay said. “It puts it all in perspective.”Ron added, “Your job as a parent, a friend or life partner is to create memories with each other. That’s what we’re here for. And I think in that respect, the decision to purchase the boat was a good decision.”'"
"'08-10-18,'0','UniCredit of Italy seized the moment to improve its balance sheet by letting Libyan state investors increase their stake to 4.2 percent, or $1.6 billion.Perhaps most surprising to some, particularly after the British and American actions, there appeared to be no European rush to nationalize this week.Peer Steinbrück, the German finance minister, hinted strongly Friday that he would focus first on interbank lending guarantees, which take up 80 percent of the 500-billion-euro ($670 billion) German package. The plan also provides money for the government to take direct stakes, but limits the pay of top executives at banks that take cash to 500,000 euros.The crisis is “above all a liquidity crunch,” Mr. Steinbrück said, explaining why recapitalization would be “a second pillar” of Berlin’s strategy.The French plan calls for up to 320 billion euros ($429 billion) in lending to banks, with 40 billion euros set aside to take stakes in French financial institutions. Michel Camdessus, who led the International Monetary Fund during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, will run the program.No German bank has asked for cash in any form under Berlin’s plan, the details of which will be hammered out over the weekend. Nor has Mr. Steinbrück, whose ministry will run the plan, insisted they take it, said one bank lobbyist, who requested anonymity because the details were not final.But the plan has clearly led German banks to consider all their options, because their British and American counterparts are getting state money to improve their capital positions. Investors and customers around the world are now eager to see that banks have capital ratios well above regulatory minimums, German executives said.“We need to see how things develop, and what happens in other countries,” said Reiner Rossmann, a spokesman for Commerzbank, a major German lender. “It’s also a competitiveness issue at the end of the day.”Analysts said that it could be a short hop from looking at the plan to taking money, especially with governments wanting to make good on their promises to prevent any major bank from failing.“It has become a political matter to make banks overcapitalized so that there is no doubt they can survive a recessionary environment,” said Simon Adamson, a banking analyst at CreditSights in London. “And the banks are not in a position to resist.”Other European banks were adjusting to the new realities of finance in different ways.European cooperative banks said Wednesday they would open a 15-billion-euro credit line to one another for unsecured interbank lending, precisely the market that has dried up during the crisis. Owned by their members and not listed on exchanges, they control about a fifth of the European retail market and want to highlight their private sector solution.UniCredit, whose stock was pummeled in recent weeks, turned to three Libyan state banks to increase their stake. In addition to raising their stake to about 1.2 billion euros, the Libyans will buy 500 million euros worth of shares in UniCredit’s future offer.The Libyan purchase is not the first sovereign wealth to flow into western banks since the financial crisis began, with funds from Singapore, Abu Dhabi and China all having pitched in cash. But it has a particular poignancy — and circularity — since Italy agreed in August to pay Libya, a former colony, $5 billion in reparations to compensate for its occupation.Shares in ING, the Netherland’s biggest financial services firm, lost 27 percent Friday in Amsterdam as investors became increasingly concerned about the company’s financial strength. The bank said on Friday that it would post a loss of 500 million euros in the third quarter because of market-driven write-downs.The Netherlands has earmarked 20 billion euros to strengthen financial institutions, but Dutch banks so far have shunned their government’s bailout fund, according to the financial ministry.Goldman Sachs, which rates ING a “conviction sell,” said in a note that ING needed to raise more capital, and warned that would be difficult.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','Three years later, Mr. Keller told Fortune that the takeover had succeeded because it doubled Chevron’s oil reserves, with much of the bill being paid by selling some Gulf assets. Industry analysts agreed, although some pointed out that the company had to wrestle with a tremendous debt load for several years.Gregarious but also studious, Mr. Keller was known as a deft juggler of often conflicting constituencies, including shareholders, public interest groups, investment bankers and journalists.Strongly opinionated, he was also willing to buck his own industry. In the mid-1980s, he recommended, unsuccessfully, that the federal government set a price for oil high enough to jump-start a stagnant drilling industry, a position that defied long-held oil patch sentiment against any government intervention in pricing.And unlike many oil chieftains, Mr. Keller was unusually accessible to journalists. “If you wanted to get him on the phone, all you had to do was call him,” said Roz Liston, who covered energy for United Press International.George Matthew Keller was born in Kansas City, Mo., on Dec. 3, 1923. His mother died when he was in the first grade, and an aunt nurtured his passion for science. At age 10, at the DuPont exhibit at the Chicago World’s Fair of 1933, he became mesmerized by chemistry.He enrolled in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then joined the military as a sophomore, serving as an Army Air Forces meteorologist in Labrador. He returned to M.I.T., and, after marrying in 1946 and graduating in 1948, received four oil-company job offers. He asked his wife, the former Adelaide McCague, to choose among them. She chose Standard Oil, based in San Francisco. She died last year.Mr. Keller is survived by three sons, Bill, of Manhattan, who is the executive editor of The New York Times; Bob, of Denver; and Barry, of Granite Bay, Calif.; and six grandchildren.Mr. Keller began at Standard Oil by designing refineries, and though he had initially hoped to be assigned to research, he climbed steadily through the corporate ranks. One job was overseeing operations in Saudi Arabia, where in 1938 the company had discovered the first oil there. A replica of Mohammed’s sword, a Saudi gift, hung on his wall.After becoming chairman in 1981, Mr. Keller quickly demonstrated both an informal management style — preferring to gather information in hallway conversations rather than in formal meetings — and a risk-taking executive approach. At his first board meeting, he approved a $600 million bid for offshore leases that led to the discovery of an oil field containing an estimated 300 million barrels.Chevron, as the company was named after the merger, was criticized in the 1980s for doing business with Angola’s Marxist government. Mr. Keller answered that if Chevron left the country, other companies would gladly fill the vacuum. Protesters nonetheless distributed “wanted” posters of Mr. Keller.In an interview with U.P.I., Mr. Keller at one point expressed regret at “the remoteness” of the chairman’s job. And his wife, who was known as Addie, was unimpressed with the corporate stratosphere. After dining with Queen Elizabeth II on the Royal Yacht Britannia in 1983, she was heard to say, “You know, that’s the first time I’ve been glad George was chairman.”Mr. Keller, a rabid fan of the San Francisco 49ers, said the royal dinner party was the best thing since the 1982 Super Bowl.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','The odds for a Democratic pickup, however, out of all the states in play, may be longest in Mississippi.The numbers in this state — which has perhaps the most racially polarized electorate in the nation — do not favor the Democrat: whites, the majority, overwhelmingly vote Republican, and 85 percent of them voted for President Bush in 2004. Even if there is a record black turnout, Mr. Musgrove would have to get about 30 percent of the white vote to win. Nonetheless, analysts give Mr. Musgrove, a hill-country populist who championed education during his terms as governor and lieutenant governor, a better-than-passing chance, particularly as the credit squeeze penetrates even here.“He’s got a shot,” said W. Martin Wiseman, a political scientist at the Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University, noting a surge in voter registration in the state that now tops 170,000 since Jan. 1. “There’s an unknown out there, and it’s going to work in Obama’s behalf.”In mostly black Hinds County, which includes Jackson, there are now more than 20,000 new voters on the rolls since 2004, a plus for a Democrat who has also managed to attract enough white support in the past to be elected twice to statewide office.“His dilemma is how to keep every one of those conservative whites and get all the Obama vote,” Dr. Wiseman said. “It’s not easy to do in a conservative state like Mississippi. He wouldn’t have a shot if it weren’t for Obama.”If Mr. Musgrove wins it would be an even bigger coup for Democrats than the House seat the party scored in Mississippi last spring. But the hostility of the political environment is palpable.“It won’t be Muskrat,” said Steve Covington, the patriarch of a family tent-rental business at the Mississippi State Fair here, employing a common term of derision for the former governor, when asked whom he was voting for. “Both of them are crooks,” Mr. Covington said, chuckling. “One of them’s just a little bit less.” Out of 20-odd white voters interviewed at random here this week, only four said they would vote for Mr. Musgrove.Mr. Wicker and Mr. Musgrove roomed together as state senators in Jackson in the early 1990s and are similar in appearance — narrow, white-haired and in their 50s. Mr. Wicker, 57, a reserved, somewhat taciturn Air Force veteran, was known as an ally of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in his early years in Congress, where he was president of the freshman class in 1994. Anti-abortion and pro-school prayer, he nonetheless bucked his state’s conservative former governor, Kirk Fordice, as a state senator in voting for a tax increase in support of education.The intensity of their battle has only increased as Mr. Musgrove continued his unexpected climb in the polls.“It’s really no longer about Ronnie Musgrove and Roger Wicker, it’s about the direction our country takes,” Mr. Wicker told a partisan crowd at a fish fry in rural Scott County this week, linking his opponent to Mr. Obama, whom he called, to murmurs of assent, “the most liberal person ever to run for the president of the United States.”Mr. Musgrove — 52, conservative, anti-abortion, pro-gun, the son of a road-crew worker who died of pneumonia when the candidate was 7 — calls himself a “Mississippi Democrat” to separate himself from the national party. But he carries the albatross that led to his failure to win re-election as governor in 2003: he supported ridding the Mississippi flag of its Confederate emblem.Many Mississippi white voters hated the idea and turned out in force to defeat it in a referendum, and they have not forgotten.“I ain’t voting for him,” said Kerry Epperson, a supervisor at U.P.S. who was having lunch at a fried-fish restaurant as Mr. Musgrove went table-to-table nearby. “I didn’t like the way he run as governor. I didn’t like the way he handled the flag issue.”Mr. Wicker is making sure the flag issue stays on voters’ minds, running a ubiquitous television advertisement this week saying Mr. Musgrove “tried to kill our state flag.” At the fish-fry rally for the Republican, an outsized flag, Confederate heraldry intact, presided over the room. On the highway into Jackson, billowing, gargantuan Mississippi and American flags fly over a giant banner promoting the McCain-Palin ticket.Mr. Wicker is identifying himself with all three banners, a strategy to compensate for his unknown status outside his home precincts in the northern part of Mississippi, though he represented it over seven terms in Congress. “I’m also a conservative,” he began at a debate with Mr. Musgrove here last week, before going on to associate himself with the word “conservative” four times in rapid succession.There are also reminders along the way of Mr. Musgrove’s divorce while in office — Mr. Wicker frequently cites the stability of his own marriage — and frequent mentions of the Democrat’s contributions from executives of a failed, state-backed beef-processing plant that cost Mississippi some $55 million. Two of those executives have pleaded guilty to giving an illegal “gratuity” to Mr. Musgrove.Mr. Musgrove, for his part, avoids mentioning Mr. Obama, but does connect his Republican opponent at every opportunity with hated “Washington” — his own term of derision, and one he is betting has potency in a climate of fear that has penetrated even in an insular state that for generations has considered itself immune to national trends.“Washington told Wall Street, ‘We’re going to let y’all regulate yourselves,’ ” Mr. Musgrove told bleary-eyed students at Millsaps College here one morning this week. “The Republicans were in charge. They never said a word.”Privately some Democratic insiders still give the edge to Mr. Wicker, in a state where the word “liberal” is still the most potent scarecrow of all. Still, the new voters make the equation an uncertain one.“You’ve got a lot of folks who have never voted, or were dormant, who are likely to vote in greater numbers than ever before, and they’re breaking for Obama,” said Dr. Wiseman, the political scientist.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','President Bush warned on Friday that paralyzed credit markets would “take a while” to return to normal, but he again tried to reassure Americans that the federal government’s $700 billion bailout was “big enough and bold enough to work,” and would accelerate a recovery.Speaking before business leaders at the United States Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Bush pushed back against critics who have called the bailout an expansion of government power tantamount to socialism. He insisted that the emergency measures, which include the government taking ownership stakes in some banks, were only undertaken as a “last resort.”“The government intervention is not a government takeover,” Mr. Bush said. “Its purpose is not to weaken the free market. It is to preserve the free market.”President Bush’s message was similar to those throughout the week by other Washington officials, including Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.The theme of all of the comments is one of patience — that the economy has some difficult times ahead but that the package in place will eventually help lead to a recover.'"
"'08-10-18,'0','In addition to cardiovascular risks associated with Bextra, it was linked to serious cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a debilitating and sometimes fatal disorder that causes sloughing of the skin. Cases involving the rare disorder, known as SJS, were not covered in the settlement agreements announced Friday; these cases have generally already been settled.The settlement Pfizer announced Friday follows two key court rulings in the last year that were favorable to the company, which is based in New York.In November 2007, United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer, in San Francisco, ruled that the plaintiffs had not offered adequate scientific proof that the 200-milligram dose of Celebrex — the most commonly prescribed dose — had caused heart attacks and strokes.As a result of that ruling and a similar state-level decision by New York Supreme Court Judge Shirley Kornreich, many lawyers dropped clients who claimed they suffered heart attacks or strokes after taking the 200-milligram dose.That meant that Pfizer’s Celebrex liability was limited, although some patients — those who had taken the 400-milligram dose — still had claims.Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra all belong to a category of drugs known as Cox-2 inhibitors.A large study led by doctors at the Cleveland Clinic and paid for by Pfizer is under way to determine whether Celebrex, the only drug in the Cox-2 inhibitor class that remains on the market, carries any more cardiovascular risk than other widely used painkillers.The drug’s labeling information currently includes a boxed warning of possible cardiovascular risks, but similar warnings are also required on two over-the-counter painkillers: ibuprofen, sold as Advil and other brands, and naproxen, of which Aleve is perhaps the best-known brand.Daniel Becnel, a plaintiff’s lawyer in Reserve, La., who represents more than 150 patients, said he was pleased with the Pfizer settlement.Pfizer had discussed settling many of the cases over the last two years, but Mr. Becnel said it was not until the Feinberg Group law firm got involved that settlement discussions began in earnest. The firm, based in Washington and New York, is known for its volunteer work assigning payments from the September 11 Victims Compensation Fund.Mr. Becnel said the Feinberg Group negotiated settlements with each lawyer involved in the case after reviewing medical records of their clients.“The Becnel group of settlements involves 150 people and each of those were negotiated individually,” he said. “After all the records were reviewed by their team of expert lawyers, we agreed to a settlement.”Perry Weitz, a Manhattan lawyer representing 1,700 clients, said the settlement was good for the claimants. “It means they’ll get their money sooner rather than later.”Pfizer said the $894 million charge, to be counted against third-quarter results, which are scheduled to be announced next week, would amount to $640 million after taxes. Some of that — the company did not disclose how much — will be recouped from insurance companies. The $894 million consists of $745 million to settle personal injury claims, $89 million related to consumer fraud claims, and $60 million to settle lawsuits brought by state attorneys general.As of the second quarter, the company had $26.3 billion in cash and short-term securities.When Merck last year agreed to settle the Vioxx claims, it reversed the company’s long-stated position that it would litigate every one of those cases. Approximately 57,000 people have filed claims that they were injured by Vioxx. About $100 million has been paid from that Merck fund so far.'"

"'08-10-19,'0','“Twenty years ago, nobody was going to monasteries unless they were into religious tourism,” said Andrea Moretti, a travel consultant at the Italian Government Tourist Board, who estimates that between 1 and 5 percent of Italy’s 93 million annual visitors stay in religious lodgings, with Americans particularly attracted to them. “Now even if they’re not interested in religion, people consider a monastery because they like the pace and feeling.”Not to mention the price. While peaceful interior courtyards and the chance to hear nuns singing Vespers are certainly part of the allure, religious lodgings are almost always cheaper than hotels — often considerably cheaper. And with the dollar remaining weak, more and more travelers are looking at convents and monasteries as a way to beat the euro. So what if they don’t have mini bars and room service?“We spent less than half what we would have in a comparable hotel,” said Marilyn Henderson, a retired accountant from Lakewood, Wash., of the Opera della Divina Provvidenza, in Venice, where she and her husband stayed in July. The Hendersons paid 136 euros a night ($189 at $1.39 to the euro) for a double room with a private bath in the church-owned guesthouse, which has ceiling frescoes by Tintoretto and Tiepolo and is a 15-minute walk from San Marco. “It was easily equivalent to a three-star accommodation,” she said.More spartan convents and monasteries, or places in less central spots, can cost less than hostels. “You CAN Afford Europe This Year!” shouted the headline of a recent article on the Web site Slowtrav.com, which cites convents and monasteries as “a great value.”And if it’s disconcerting to think of men and women of the cloth chasing after tourist dollars, for some orders it’s a matter of economic survival, according to the Association of Superiors of German Orders, whose German-language site, www.orden.de, lists 311 cloisters in Germany that offer room and board (and, in some cases, housemade beer and marzipan). “The income from overnight guests is a necessity,” Arnulf Salmen, a spokesman for the organization, wrote in an e-mail message.The tradition of religious houses offering lodging dates back to the sixth-century Rule of St. Benedict, the document laying out the ways of monastic life, which includes a chapter on extending hospitality. Over the ages monasteries have sheltered individual travelers and those seeking solace, as well as church groups on organized retreats.But in recent decades, as farming and other sources of income have fallen off, religious orders have embraced the role of innkeeper.The Bridgettine Sisters — named for the 14th-century St. Bridget of Sweden — operate guesthouses in 11 European countries (Italy, Britain, Sweden, Poland, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Estonia, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Norway), not to mention Mexico and India and in Darien, Conn. (A full list can be found at www.brigidine.org.) At Casa di Santa Brigida, in Rome, on lovely Piazza Farnese, prettily decorated rooms off marble halls have private baths, plus needle-pointed Madonnas over the single beds, and there’s a common room with a flat-screen TV and a roof terrace. In between prayers, the nuns, whose black habits are topped by little crowns of crossed white bands, cheerfully issue room keys at the front desk and wait on tables at breakfast.Other religious communities operate in a more informal way, offering only two or three guest rooms and relying on donations rather than a set daily rate. “They might give you an envelope and ask you to put in it whatever you’d like,” said Kevin J. Wright, author of “Europe’s Monastery and Convent Guesthouses,” which is geared to the Christian traveler.Certain restrictions may apply. Although religious houses generally welcome visitors of all faiths, some monasteries allow only men on the premises (Monasterio de Santo Domingo de Silos in Burgos, Spain; 35 euros)), and some convents only women (Monasterio de San Benito, in Navarra; 30 euros including meals).Some enforce curfews or have daytime lockouts so that the sisters can make the beds. Silence may be required after a certain hour.And although abbeys that allow visitors to sleep inside their walls might expect guests to fall in with prayers four times a day, the more tourist-oriented facilities let guests come and go as they please. None of the travelers interviewed for this story reported any pressure to attend Mass, let alone convert, though some were expected to bow their heads before meals.“Normally we wouldn’t say a prayer before eating, but that’s just part of the deal,” said Ruth Lake, a Milan-based American corporate-communications consultant who stayed at Monastero S. Croce with her daughter last summer.For those who bristle at rules, or crucifixes on prominent display, there are hotels occupying deconsecrated religious quarters — guests can have their Gothic arches and 400-thread-count linens, too. At the Hotel Monasterium Poortackere in Ghent, Belgium, housed in a convent that the church sold in 1998, guests can choose between three-star hotel rooms starting at 115 euros a night or convent cells (no phone or TV, use of communal showers and a bathroom down the hall) from 46 euros.Among the 300 formerly religious properties represented on the ZefiroWorld Tour Operator Web site, www.go-to-Italy.com, there are small luxury hotels in former convents, and fabulously appointed villas once owned by the nobility and given to the church “so the owners could get into paradise,” said Claudia Sardo Bollweg, a partner in the agency.But for Mary-Rose Leversedge, a freelance copy editor from Christchurch, New Zealand, such dolled-up places are not authentic. On a five-month tour of France and Spain ending in March, she stayed at three convents including Notre-Dame-de-l’Abbaye in Carcassonne, France, where her room was plain but had gorgeous old French shutters. “It was not materially rich, but it was historically rich,” said Ms. Leversedge, who is a convert to convents when traveling solo. “I had not gone to France ‘on the prowl,’ so it was great to feel safe and not have to worry that anyone would bother me.”For years, it was specialized guidebooks that led people to such places. One of the first was “Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging,” published in 1999 and now out of print. But the queen of guidebooks on European convent and monastery stays is Eileen Barish, the Santa Barbara, Calif., author of “Lodging in Italy’s Monasteries” and similar books for Spain and France. Ms. Barish, whose book on Britain’s offerings is due out in February, said she visited a third to a half of the places she covers in each of her first three books, which also include information on nearby sites. “All of them are personally contacted,” said Ms. Barish, who works with a researcher. In a news release, her publisher, Anacapa Press, calls convents “the secret of affordable European travel.”But with information about many such lodgings now on the Internet, the secret is out. Monasterystays.com, a booking service that began in 2006 with a roster of 100 Italian properties, currently lists 320 and expects to have 400 by the end of the year. The Web site secures reservations for a fee that’s included in the room rate. “We’re making a profit,” said John Clayton, one of the site’s partners. In Spain, the travel agency Guia Monasterios offers bookings at 210 religious houses; the agency’s Web site (www.guiasmonasterios.com) will provide an English translation starting this fall, said Liz Salcedo, director, through the Tourist Office of Spain.But with the opportunity to share their way of life — and remain solvent — on the line, many religious communities themselves are making the pitch.The monks at the Orthodox Monastery of New Valamo, in Heinavesi in Finland’s eastern lake district, depend on tourism for their livelihood. The monastery, part of the Orthodox Church of Finland, admits 160,000 visitors a year, of which 25,000 stay overnight in its hotel, student rooms and guesthouses (200 beds in all).The Web site (www.valamo.fi) provides, in four different languages, instructions on asking for a blessing (“hold your hands out in front of you, palms upwards, the right hand on top of the left”) and dress (anything “open or revealing” is “not suitable for a monastery”). Overnights at the monastery have steadily increased every year, and in the peak of July, “we have nights when we are sold out,” wrote the monastery’s marketing manager, Jaana Nykanen, in an e-mail message.The Kloster Arenberg, in the German town of Koblenz, had an occupancy of only 35 percent in 2000; after the construction of a new 99-bed guesthouse and Wellness Center with a sauna, fitness studio and spa menu that includes massage and hydrotherapy, it jumped to almost 80 percent last year.In a recent survey of the German cloisters that offer overnight accommodations, 90 percent of the respondents indicated that the number of guests in the last five years has been consistently high or increasing, according to Mr. Salmen of the Association of Superiors of German Orders.Ellen Singer of Mahwah, N.J., almost didn’t get a room at a convent for a trip that she’ll be taking to Rome this month. She contacted every convent listed on the Santa Susanna Web site, www.santasusanna.org, run by the American Catholic Church in Rome. “They were all sold out,” Ms. Singer said. Week after week, she filled out the online reservation form for Casa di Santa Francesca Romana a Ponte Rotto — where she’d stayed in February and liked for its price (80 euros a night) and location (in Trastevere) — hoping for a cancellation. “Finally,” she said, “I got lucky.”Ms. Mazzocco, for one, wonders if the desirability of convents will present a new wrinkle. “Now that they’ve gotten so popular,” she said, “maybe their prices will go up.”'"
"'08-10-19,'0','But in recent weeks he has taken heat from some environmental activists for statements on the stump implying that he might not seek mandatory emission cuts. His campaign has not said how the ailing economy would affect his climate agenda.A high priority is helping revive the nuclear-power industry because nuclear plants produce no greenhouse gases, once built. Mr. McCain claims a byproduct of his nuclear push would be the creation of thousands of new jobs.Mr. Obama, of Illinois, insists that his energy plan, which is largely framed around measures that could have climate benefits, would remain a top priority even in the face of economic troubles.Rather than increasing joblessness, he says, his proposals to create federal programs to cut energy waste and to help Detroit retool and retrain to make fuel-sipping hybrids would create jobs.A top environmental goal of both candidates is enactment of climate-change legislation centered on a “cap and trade” mechanism that sets a ceiling on emissions that declines over time. Businesses and institutions that cannot hit the targets must buy permits from those that achieve bigger cuts than required.But the devil on such bills is in the many details. (A fight over such details also contributed to the death of a climate bill that the Senate debated earlier this year.)The permits issued under Mr. Obama’s bill would be bought by businesses through an auction before they were traded. Mr. Obama says he would use $150 billion of the auction revenue over 10 years — a small amount of the total flow — to help improve nonpolluting vehicles, wind and solar power, technology for capturing emissions from power plants, and other energy technologies. The brunt of the funds, he says, would help reduce costs faced by industries and citizens affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy. Mr. McCain’s approach, according to his Web site, would distribute the permits initially at no cost, and move to auctioning “eventually.”Some economists and environmentalists have criticized the distribution of free permits as a handout to industry, noting that the European Union — which initially set up its trading system that way — saw the prices for pollution permits collapse. At the same time, some European power companies made windfall profits from their permits and ultimately heat-trapping gas emissions increased.Mr. McCain would also initially allow businesses to meet all their emission targets either directly or by buying a kind of credit, called an offset, generated by, say, a landowner who can prove fields or trees are sopping up a certain tonnage of carbon dioxide or a business that can prove an investment avoided emissions that would otherwise have happened. His Web site says the fraction of emission reductions allowed through offsets “would decline over time,” but offers no specifics. Calls and e-mail messages to the McCain campaign were not answered.Environmentalists tend to prefer Mr. Obama’s approach, which many analysts say has less wiggle room and, in theory, sends a stronger message to companies that rely on fossil fuels to seek nonpolluting sources or reduce energy use.Several representatives of industries said that, if forced, they would prefer the less aggressive targets and looser terms of Mr. McCain’s plan. But some appear to think they will not need to choose for a long while in any case, given the state of the global economy.“Most industries are sort of keeping their powder dry at this point,” said Scott H. Segal, a lawyer and lobbyist at Bracewell & Giuliani who represents energy companies.Without more details, it is not possible to estimate the costs of either candidate’s cap-and-trade plan, but economists generally agree that Mr. McCain’s would be less costly because of the offsets. But such offsets may also delay real decreases in greenhouse gas emissions.Despite Mr. McCain’s early focus on climate change and the need for legislation, some environmental groups have sharply chided him lately, pointing to campaign statements seemingly softening his stance on firm caps on heat-trapping gases.The League of Conservation Voters gave him the lowest possible score for his voting record in 2007 on subsidies or spending for renewable energy. Environmental bloggers derided his choice of running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, who has questioned whether global warming is caused by human activity and who elicits chants of “drill, baby, drill” on the stump for her support of oil drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama also support ocean drilling and oppose drilling in the Arctic refuge.Joseph Romm, a physicist who writes the ClimateProgress.org blog and is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a nonprofit research group generally aligned with Democrats, said that Mr. McCain “has provided ample evidence in the last year or so that he is not serious about clean energy and he has increasingly walked away from the climate issue.”Mr. Obama, after taking heat from some environmentalists for championing coal use as an Illinois state senator, has been hailed by environmental groups for sticking with a mandatory cap on emissions with steadily rising costs for permits bought by polluters.Still, his advisers lately have emphasized that he might have to compromise to get bipartisan support for a climate bill, something he has said he wants. Strident opponents of climate legislation, echoing the views of industry figures, do not appear worried that a bill will come together any time soon, no matter who is in the White House.“I believe the current financial difficulties,” said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, “will only reinforce the public’s concerns about any climate bill that attempts to increase the costs of energy and jeopardizes jobs in the near term.”Van Jones, an environmental activist from Oakland, Calif., and the author of “The Green Collar Economy,” has criticized Mr. McCain as the vanguard of a new movement with an environmental veneer but bad intentions.“The climate deniers got chased out of town, but in their place you’ve got the rise of the Dirty Greens,” he said in a recent interview. These are “people saying ‘I’m for solar, wind, geothermal, but I’m also for tar sands, coastal drilling.’ ”Over all, the hurdles facing legislation restricting gases released by burning coal and oil, which still underpin the economy, remain so daunting that many experts who favor capping emissions appear to be focusing on actions a president could take with a pen stroke.Both candidates have said they would grant California a long-sought waiver under the Clean Air Act allowing that state to set its own limits on automobile emissions of carbon dioxide, the main human-generated greenhouse gas. The Bush administration turned down California’s request in January.David D. Doniger, who directs climate policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council and worked in the Clinton administration on the issue, said this move would set in motion a wave of pent-up state actions following California’s lead, and the resulting bottom-up pressure could force Congress to pursue a climate bill.The same upward push could result, he said, if the next president orders the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon dioxide.The Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 ruling in 2007, rebuffed the Bush administration and said the Clean Air Act gave the agency the authority to restrict the gas.If Mr. Obama is elected, such a move appears likely. Heather Zichal, policy director for energy, environment and agriculture for the Obama campaign, said he would reduce emissions through actions at the E.P.A. and other government agencies.“While he strongly believes that Congressional action is needed,” Ms. Zichal said, “he is also committed to employing the considerable powers Congress has granted to the executive branch.”Mr. McCain has not specified whether he would seek to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant.Some environmental groups say the next president could attack the energy, economic and climate problems at once with a grand program to remake the electrical grid, greatly expand sources of nonpolluting power like wind turbines and solar arrays, and boost energy efficiency.Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain have both picked up on that theme.When addressing energy on the campaign trail, Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin have tended to focus on expanding supplies of fossil fuels even as they mention the need for solar panels, tapping geothermal energy and the like. They call this an “all of the above” strategy.One of Mr. McCain’s main talking points on nonpolluting energy sources is a promise to build 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030.Energy specialists say that is a difficult goal because of the high cost — one estimate is that each plant would cost $10 billion — and unresolved questions about where to store nuclear waste. Another issue is the lack of American expertise in building such plants after decades of opposition.Mr. Obama has given muted support to nuclear power but has repeatedly said his prime goal is an ambitious, sustained push for efficiency and new climate-friendly technologies, like plug-in hybrid cars and improved solar panels. Among other steps, he would create a national project to cut energy waste with federal subsidies to insulate one million low-income homes a year.He and Mr. McCain continue to mention “clean coal” in the context of climate change, even though teams of researchers have concluded that investments in large-scale tests of ways to capture and bury carbon dioxide from coal combustion would be required on a scale far beyond the federal spending either candidate is calling for.'"
"'08-10-19,'0','All investors — from individuals through their 401(k) plans to pension funds and asset managers — are paying a price today for the lack of oversight. We must urgently address the problems created by this unregulated environment.Credit-default swaps are not inherently good or evil. They play an important role in the smooth functioning of capital markets by allowing a broad range of institutional investors to manage the credit risks to which they are exposed. They are also a useful means for investors to signal their view of an entity’s business prospects and creditworthiness.But our markets function best when they are highly transparent, when everyone can see exactly which transactions are occurring and what the instruments being traded are worth. This gives investors confidence that they can accurately assess risk.Back in 2000, Congress specifically decided not to regulate credit-default swaps. At that time, this market was just a few years old and still very small. For example, in 1999 a report by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets envisioned no systemic risk from such derivatives since “private counterparty discipline” — investors’ natural desire to keep their own risks to a minimum — would work to protect the broader financial system.But the market for credit-default swaps has recently mushroomed. In just the past two years, it has doubled in size. And as the market has grown, private counterparty discipline has proven inadequate. As we have seen, individual market participants did not pay enough attention until it was too late.To place a value on credit-default swaps and the mortgage-related securities they insure, buyers and sellers of swaps relied too heavily on financial models that couldn’t predict the mortgage market meltdown. They also trusted too much in the credit ratings of the securities and of the firms selling the credit-default swaps, and these ratings underestimated the risk.Congress needs to fill this regulatory hole by passing legislation that would not only make credit-default swaps more transparent but also give regulators the power to rein in fraudulent or manipulative trading practices and help everyone better assess the risks involved.Congress could require that dealers in over-the-counter credit-default swaps publicly report both their trades and the value of those trades. This would make the market more transparent, and make it easier for everyone engaged in credit-default swaps to assess their value. It would also provide regulators with the information they need to uncover unfair or fraudulent practices and to monitor risk.Then, the Securities and Exchange Commission should be given explicit authority to issue rules against fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative acts and practices in credit-default swaps.Finally, Congress could provide support for federal regulators to mandate the use of one or more central counterparties — financially stable clearance and settlement organizations — and exchange-like trading platforms for the credit-default swaps market. As it is now, it is often impossible even to know who stands on the other side of a swap contract, and this increases the risk involved. We at the S.E.C. are already working with the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and industry participants to accomplish these goals on a voluntary basis, using the authority we currently have.Because of the truly global nature of the over-the-counter derivatives market, we will need to work closely with governments in other major markets. The climate for such cooperation is good, because the cross-border impacts of the current market problems are obvious to all.Transparency is a powerful antidote for what ails our capital markets. When investors have clear and accurate information, and when they can make informed decisions about where to put their resources, money and credit will begin to flow again. By giving regulators the authority they need to bring the credit derivatives market into the sunshine, we can take a giant step forward in protecting our financial system and the well-being of every American.'"
"'08-10-19,'0','When Rutgers quarterback Mike Teel watched Tony Ciaravino’s potential game-winning field goal bounce off the right upright, just one thought ran through Teel’s mind.“It’s about time we got a break,” he said after the Scarlet Knights escaped with a 12-10 victory against visiting Connecticut on Saturday. “The ball finally bounced our way.”With Connecticut trailing late in the fourth quarter, Zach Frazier drove the Huskies from their 15 to the Rutgers 20. An offensive pass interference call on Martin Bedard during a completion to Kashif Moore pushed the Huskies back to the 35. Bedard’s reception then put the ball at the 25, but Ciaravino’s 42-yard attempt into the wind hit the upright with 1 minute 9 seconds left.Ciaravino entered the game 8 for 11 on field-goal attempts, but was 1 for 4 on the day.“It’s very frustrating,” Huskies Coach Randy Edsall said. “You just don’t expect that with three field goals that are easily makeable for him.”The victory was the first against a Football Bowl Subdivision team this season for Rutgers (2-5, 1-2 Big East). Connecticut (5-2, 1-1) dropped its second in a row.'"

"'08-10-19,'0','KANTHARALAK, Thailand (Reuters) — Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat of Thailand said Saturday that he would seek face-to-face talks with Cambodia’s leader, Hun Sen, to try to ease a growing border conflict over a 900-year-old mountaintop temple.“I am looking for the right time to talk with him,” Mr. Somchai told reporters after visiting Thai troops facing Cambodian forces along the border. “We should have an opportunity to talk.”The Thai leader echoed Mr. Hun Sen’s comments on Friday that outside mediation was not needed to resolve the dispute. “This is an issue between Thailand and Cambodia,” Mr. Somchai said.Both sides have sought to ease tensions since three Cambodian soldiers were killed in a firefight on Wednesday, the worst of several attacks at the site in recent months. Two Cambodians and seven Thais were wounded.Both leaders were expected to attend a Southeast Asian meeting in Beijing this week to discuss the global financial crisis, but it was not clear whether they would meet on the sidelines.“At this moment, there is no change in schedule,” a Thai government spokesman, Nattawut Saikuar, said Saturday. “After talking to him late yesterday, the prime minister will go to Beijing as planned.”'"
"'08-10-19,'0','According to previously undisclosed internal F.B.I. data, the cutbacks have been particularly severe in staffing for investigations into white-collar crimes like mortgage fraud, with a loss of 625 agents, or 36 percent of its 2001 levels.Over all, the number of criminal cases that the F.B.I. has brought to federal prosecutors — including a wide range of crimes like drug trafficking and violent crime — dropped 26 percent in the last seven years, going from 11,029 cases to 8,187, Justice Department data showed.“Clearly, we have felt the effects of moving resources from criminal investigations to national security,” said John Miller, an assistant director at the F.B.I. “In white-collar crime, while we initiated fewer cases over all, we targeted the areas where we could have the biggest impact. We focused on multimillion-dollar corporate fraud, where we could make arrests but also recover money for the fraud victims.”But Justice Department data, which include cases from other agencies, like the Secret Service and Postal Service, illustrate the impact. Prosecutions of frauds against financial institutions dropped 48 percent from 2000 to 2007, insurance fraud cases plummeted 75 percent, and securities fraud cases dropped 17 percent.Statistics from a research group at Syracuse University, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, using somewhat different methodology and looking only at the F.B.I., show an even steeper decline of nearly 50 percent in overall white-collar crime prosecutions in the same period.In addition to the investigations into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the F.B.I. is carrying out investigations of American International Group and Lehman Brothers, and it has opened more than 1,500 other mortgage-related investigations. Some F.B.I. officials worry privately that the trillion-dollar federal bailout of the financial industry may itself become a problem because it contains inadequate controls to deter fraud.No one has suggested that a quicker response would have averted the mortgage meltdown, but some officials said a faster reaction might have deterred more of the early schemes that seized on loose federal lending regulations.“They were very late to the game,” Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who has quarreled with the F.B.I. over its financing priorities, said of the bureau’s response to the mortgage crisis. “They were not on top of this, and they’re just now starting to really do something.”Republicans and Democrats in Congress are pushing for a more aggressive response by the F.B.I. Representatives Mark S. Kirk, an Illinois Republican who sits on the House appropriations committee, and Chris P. Carney, a Pennsylvania Democrat, called on Congress to triple the F.B.I.’s financing for financial crimes investigations.“To fix our system and prevent a repeat of the events we now see,” they wrote in a letter this month to Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, “we have got to set an example by bringing the full might of federal law enforcement against the people who illegally profited or destroyed companies at the expense of our country.”In public, Mr. Mueller has said that the bureau is doing more with less, when it comes to criminal prosecutions. And Justice Department officials have repeatedly asserted the administration’s commitment to fight violent and white-collar crime even as they have not provided the bureau additional resources.But current and former officials say Mr. Mueller has lost a behind-the-scenes battle with the Justice Department and the Office of Management and Budget to replenish the criminal ranks.Interviews and internal records show that F.B.I. officials realized the growing danger posed by financial fraud in the housing market beginning in 2003 and 2004 but were rebuffed by the Justice Department and the budget office in their efforts to acquire more resources.“The administration’s top priority since the 9/11 attacks has been counterterrorism,” Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, said. “In part, that’s reflected by a significant investment of resources at the F.B.I. to answer the call from Congress and the American public to become a domestic intelligence agency in addition to a law enforcement agency.”From 2001 to 2007, the F.B.I. sought an increase of more than 1,100 agents for criminal investigations apart from national security. Instead, it suffered a decrease of 132 agents, according to internal F.B.I. figures obtained by The New York Times. During these years, the bureau asked for an increase of $800 million, but received only $50 million more. In the 2007 budget cycle, the F.B.I. obtained money for a total of one new agent for criminal investigations.In 2004, one senior F.B.I. official, Chris Swecker, warned publicly that a flood of fraudulent mortgage deals had the potential to become “an epidemic.” Yet the next year, as public warnings about fraud in the subprime lending markets began to approach their height, the F.B.I. had the equivalent of only 15 full-time agents devoted to mortgage fraud out of a total of some 13,000 agents in the bureau.That number has grown to 177 agents, who have opened 1,522 cases. But the staffing level is still hundreds of agents below the levels seen in the 1980s during the savings and loan crisis.F.B.I. officials said they had had no choice but to make the cuts in the criminal division, which they said were necessary to expand the bureau’s national security effort, particularly in the wake of criticism of the bureau’s performance in failing to detect the Sept. 11 plot.In white-collar crime, they said the bureau has given up only lower-level cases of marginal significance that might have never been prosecuted anyway. They say they have focused the available criminal resources on public corruption and other difficult crime issues in which the F.B.I. can make a unique contribution.“We only had a finite number of white-collar crime agents available to address the threat that mortgage fraud posed,” said Joseph Ford, who retired from the F.B.I. this year and once served as its chief financial officer.The Justice Department is relying more than ever on the state and local authorities to pick up the slack through joint task forces. And private investigators say that companies victimized by fraud are turning to them in increasing numbers because they are unable to attract much attention from the F.B.I. anymore.In some instances, private investigative and accounting firms are now collecting evidence, taking witness statements and even testifying before grand juries, in effect preparing courtroom-ready prosecutions they can take to the F.B.I. or local authorities.“Anytime you bring to the F.B.I. a case that is thoroughly investigated and reduce the amount of work for investigators, the likelihood is that they will take the case and present it for prosecution,” said Alton Sizemore, a former F.B.I. agent who is a fraud examiner for Forensic Strategic Solutions in Birmingham, Ala.One American company facing extortion demands last year from a computer hacker used private investigators from the Kroll firm to do much of the legwork in the case as the F.B.I. monitored and directed the situation behind the scenes, said Daniel Karson, executive managing director for Kroll. The private investigators even went undercover and set up a sting operation that led them to Germany, where the authorities made an arrest.Mr. Karson said the F.B.I. no longer had the resources to take on such lower-level cases by itself. “When you come in with a garden variety, plain vanilla crime, you may have to stand in the queue,” he said.Some critics question whether the shift indicates not just a lack of resources, but a lack of interest by the Bush administration.After the collapse of Enron in 2002, the Justice Department moved aggressively against corporate fraud — too aggressively, in the view of some people within the administration. It set up a national task force to tackle the problem, garnered hundreds of convictions at companies like WorldCom, Adelphia and Enron, and forced the closure of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, for its role in the Enron collapse.But several former law enforcement officials said in interviews that senior administration officials, particularly at the White House and the Treasury Department, had made clear to them that they were concerned the Justice Department and the F.B.I. were taking an antibusiness attitude that could chill corporate risk taking.Justice Department officials said political pressures had never influenced the way prosecutors approached corporate cases. But the department’s approach has become noticeably more tempered in the last several years.This spring and summer, as public concerns about the subprime mortgage crisis were growing, Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey rejected repeated calls for the creation of a national task force like the one used after the Enron collapse. The attorney general likened the problem to “white-collar street-crime” that could best be handled by individual United States attorneys’ offices.In the last four years, the Justice Department has scored fewer of the big-name prosecutions that marked President Bush’s first term in office. Even when investigations have pointed to corporate wrongdoing, the Justice Department has agreed, in dozens of cases in the last four years, to “deferred prosecutions"" that allowed companies to pay fines in order to avoid criminal prosecution.Paul J. McNulty, who served as deputy attorney general under Alberto R. Gonzales, said the complexity of white-collar investigations and the shortage of investigators had driven a decline in high-profile cases.“There’s no question that the department has been stretched thin when it comes to resources generally, and that has affected white-collar enforcement in a variety of areas,” Mr. McNulty said in an interview.“What happened is that the first years after the Enron collapse, there were some very high profile, noticeable cases — the low-hanging fruit — that gave Justice the opportunity to rack up some very big wins,” he said. “Those cases played themselves out and it became tougher to find those big cases.”'"
"'08-10-19,'0','Mr. Musgrove has inched up in the polls and one recent survey showed him statistically even with the Republican incumbent, Roger Wicker, a former congressman appointed in December to fill the Senate seat vacated by Trent Lott.The odds for a Democratic pickup, however, out of all the states in play, may be longest in Mississippi.The numbers in this state, which has perhaps the most racially polarized electorate in the nation, do not favor the Democrat: whites, a majority, overwhelmingly vote Republican, and 85 percent of them voted for President Bush in 2004. Even if there is a record black turnout, Mr. Musgrove would have to receive about 30 percent of the white vote to win.Nonetheless, analysts give Mr. Musgrove, a hill-country populist who championed education in his terms as governor and lieutenant governor, a better-than-passing chance, particularly as the credit squeeze penetrates even here.“He’s got a shot,” said W. Martin Wiseman, a political scientist at the Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University, noting a surge in voter registration in the state that has topped 170,000 since Jan. 1. “There’s an unknown out there, and it’s going to work in Obama’s behalf.”In mostly black Hinds County, which includes Jackson, there are now more than 20,000 new voters on the rolls since 2004, a plus for Mr. Musgrove, who has managed to attract enough white support in the past to be elected twice to statewide office.“His dilemma is how to keep every one of those conservative whites and get all the Obama vote,” Dr. Wiseman said. “It’s not easy to do in a conservative state like Mississippi. He wouldn’t have a shot if it weren’t for Obama.”If Mr. Musgrove wins, it would be an even bigger coup for Democrats than the House seat the party scored in Mississippi last spring. But the hostility of the political environment is palpable.“It won’t be Muskrat,” said Steve Covington, the patriarch of a family tent-rental business at the Mississippi State Fair here, employing a common term of derision for the former governor, when asked whom he was voting for.“Both of them are crooks,” Mr. Covington said, chuckling. “One of them’s just a little bit less.”Out of 20-odd white voters interviewed at random here last week, only four said they would vote for Mr. Musgrove.Mr. Wicker and Mr. Musgrove roomed together as state senators in Jackson in the early 1990s and are similar in appearance — narrow, white-haired and in their 50s. Mr. Wicker, 57, a reserved, somewhat taciturn Air Force veteran, was known as an ally of Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker, in his early years in Congress, where he was president of the freshman class in 1994.Anti-abortion and pro-school prayer, he nonetheless bucked his state’s conservative former governor, Kirk Fordice, as a state senator in voting for a tax increase in support of education.The intensity of their battle has only increased as Mr. Musgrove continued his unexpected climb in the polls.“It’s really no longer about Ronnie Musgrove and Roger Wicker; it’s about the direction our country takes,” Mr. Wicker told a partisan crowd at a fish fry in rural Scott County, linking his opponent to Mr. Obama, whom he called, to murmurs of assent, “the most liberal person ever to run for the president of the United States.”Mr. Musgrove — 52, conservative, anti-abortion, pro-gun, the son of a road-crew worker who died of pneumonia when the candidate was 7 — calls himself a “Mississippi Democrat” to separate himself from the national party. But he carries the albatross that led to his failure to win re-election as governor in 2003: he supported ridding the Mississippi flag of its Confederate emblem.Many Mississippi white voters hated the idea and turned out in force to defeat it in a referendum, and they have not forgotten.“I ain’t voting for him,” said Kerry Epperson, a supervisor at U.P.S. who was having lunch at a fried-fish restaurant as Mr. Musgrove went table-to-table nearby. “I didn’t like the way he run as governor. I didn’t like the way he handled the flag issue.”Mr. Wicker is making sure the flag issue stays on voters’ minds, running a ubiquitous television advertisement that says Mr. Musgrove “tried to kill our state flag.” At the fish-fry rally for the Republican, an outsized flag, Confederate heraldry intact, presided over the room. On the highway into Jackson, billowing, gargantuan Mississippi and American flags fly over a giant banner promoting the ticket of the Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, and Mr. McCain’s running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin.Mr. Wicker is identifying himself with all three banners, a strategy to compensate for his unknown status outside his home precincts in the northern part of Mississippi, though he represented it over seven terms in Congress. “I’m also a conservative,” he began at a debate with Mr. Musgrove here last week, before going on to associate himself with the word “conservative” four times in rapid succession.There are also reminders along the way of Mr. Musgrove’s divorce while in office — Mr. Wicker frequently cites the stability of his own marriage — and frequent mentions of the Democrat’s contributions from executives of a failed, state-backed beef-processing plant that cost Mississippi some $55 million. Two of those executives have pleaded guilty to giving an illegal “gratuity” to Mr. Musgrove.Mr. Musgrove, for his part, avoids mentioning the Democratic nominee for president, Senator Barack Obama, but does connect his Republican opponent at every opportunity with hated “Washington” — his own term of derision, and one he is betting has potency in a climate of fear that has penetrated even in an insular state that for generations has considered itself immune to national trends.“Washington told Wall Street, ‘We’re going to let y’all regulate yourselves,’ ” Mr. Musgrove told bleary-eyed students at Millsaps College here one recent morning. “The Republicans were in charge. They never said a word.”Privately, some Democratic insiders still give the edge to Mr. Wicker, in a state where the word “liberal” is still the most potent scarecrow of all. Still, the new voters make the equation an uncertain one.“You’ve got a lot of folks who have never voted, or were dormant,” said Dr. Wiseman, the political scientist, “who are likely to vote in greater numbers than ever before, and they’re breaking for Obama.”'"
"'08-10-19,'0','In a coordinated air and ground attack, Senator Barack Obama is charging that his Republican rival for the presidency, Senator John McCain, would make $882 billion in “drastic cuts to Medicare” to pay for his health care proposal.That assertion, which could resonate among elderly voters in swing states like Florida, is being angrily disputed by the McCain campaign. Mr. McCain’s top domestic policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said Friday that the Democrat’s latest assault on the McCain health plan capped the “worst and most sustained distortion of policy in this entire campaign.”In fact, the Obama campaign’s new television advertisement, which Mr. Obama reinforced on the stump in Virginia on Friday and again in Missouri on Saturday, may mischaracterize Mr. McCain’s plan by making assumptions that are stitched together from news reporting and rough back-of-the-envelope calculations by a partisan policy group.The advertisement asserts that the McCain plan would require “cuts in benefits, eligibility or both.” In his speech Friday, Mr. Obama added that “it would mean a cut of more than 20 percent in Medicare benefits next year.”But Mr. McCain has not proposed benefit cuts, though he may find it necessary to make his plan pay for itself. Rather, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said Friday that Mr. McCain would fill any budget hole in the plan through a variety of changes that would leave seniors with “exactly the same benefits.” And he pointed out that Mr. Obama supports many of the same changes.'"
"'08-10-19,'0','A. Anxiety creates cognitive distortion and can make it harder for people to concentrate and to process information, said Myra S. White, a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School who focuses on workplace performance. Their decision-making is impaired, and they are more likely to make mistakes, she said. Because they can’t listen as well, they may need to have instructions repeated to them several times. They may also have shorter fuses and become more impatient.“Anxiety is living in the past or the future; it’s not living in the moment,” Dr. Wehrenberg said, so the work in front of you is bound to suffer.Q. Can your co-workers have an effect on your anxiety level?A. It is very easy to “catch” anxiety through a process known as emotional contagion, Professor Barsade said. Densely populated workplaces, she said, are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon.So if one of your colleagues is moaning that her portfolio has fallen 40 percent and that she will never be able to retire, or another is ranting that your company is sure to go under, be aware that you could “catch” their emotions almost as if they were colds.“Stay open to both positive and negative emotion,” Professor Barsade said. The key to absorbing negative emotions is “to take them in but not let them take over,” she said.Professor Barsade said anxiety might be worsening the financial crisis. A kind of collective anxiety — in part emerging in the workplace — could cause people to take overly drastic actions with their money, which could hurt the economy, she said.Managers need to be aware that their employees are feeling anxious now, Professor Barsade said. They should let employees express their anxiety — and should discuss and clarify the company’s situation honestly.Q. Are there physical aspects to anxiety?A. “Anxiety can wreak havoc on the body,” said Dr. White, who has a doctorate in psychology. Physical symptoms, she said, can include a pounding heart, sweaty hands, headaches and indigestion. Anxious people tend to hold their breath and take shallow breaths, she said, so work on taking deep breaths, especially when you exhale.Yoga, meditation, exercising or simply taking a walk can help dispel symptoms, Dr. White said.“Any time you’re really stuck in your mind, moving your body helps shift it,” Dr. Wehrenberg said.Q. What else can you do to tame anxiety?A. Ms. Wehrenberg recommends this strategy: worry once and do it well.In other words, if you’re going to fret, be systematic about it and get it over with. If you’re concerned about your finances, for example, meet with a financial planner and decide what steps to take to protect assets as best you can. If you’re worried about losing a job, update your résumé and lay all the other initial groundwork for a job search. Then focus on the job you still have; that is something you can control, as opposed to some horrific future scenario that may never occur.If you start to feel anxious about your job or your finances, remind yourself that you have a plan and that you have done everything you can do at this time, Dr. Wehrenberg said. Say to yourself, “Stop, I already worried,” then pull yourself back to your work, she said.“Think about what you’ve got in the now. Today you’re O.K.,” she said. “Focus on what you have instead of what you don’t have.”She says she has patients who feel that they aren’t allowed to enjoy themselves because of the economy. “It’s not going to ruin your portfolio if you play or go out with friends,” she said.But if you feel overwhelmed by anxiety to the point that you can’t finish your tasks or are having destructive thoughts or abusing drugs or alcohol, you should seek professional help, she said.'"
"'08-10-19,'0','Before Mr. Jobs introduced the updated Mac notebooks last week, one of the more persistent rumors circulating on technology blogs was that Apple would acknowledge the worsening prospects for consumer spending and bring out a simple, ultraportable machine priced in the neighborhood of $800. It did not appear.It’s possible that the financial side of Apple’s executive suite sees an urgent need for the company to add products with lower prices, and that the product side, the one that most interests Mr. Jobs, is resisting. Or perhaps no one sees a need to change course.We’ll soon get a glimpse of what Mr. Jobs and his colleagues see: on Tuesday, the company will release its earnings report for the quarter that ended Sept. 30.The numbers will undoubtedly document Apple’s momentum in taking market share from Windows-equipped PCs. Yair Reiner, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, wrote earlier this month that he expected sales of Apple’s desktop models to grow 13 percent, to 4.3 million, in the 2009 fiscal year and notebook sales to increase by 12 percent, to 6.76 million. Even if the industry suffers a downturn, he expects that Apple will suffer less than its competition and will still gain market share. “The upshot is that even against a very bleak macroeconomic backdrop,” Mr. Reiner said, “Apple should be able to continue growing.”Not all observers of Apple, however, are sanguine. If the recession is severe, “eventually, everybody gets slaughtered at some point,” says Tavis McCourt, an analyst at Morgan Keegan & Company.Apple need not be much concerned about its rival Microsoft, which can do little but bang its head against the wall in despair about the Vista fiasco. As if Microsoft’s marketers had not suffered enough indignities, Computerworld gleefully discovered last month that some images for Microsoft’s “I’m a PC” campaign posted on the company’s own corporate site had been created with Macs. (Microsoft has since scrubbed away the incriminating mention of the Mac in the images’ meta-data.) As well as Macs are doing, analysts say Apple’s greatest potential resides in the iPhone. Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, describes the iPhone as “the hottest consumer electronics product in the world,” a “game-changing product” that outdistances wireless players on the hardware side, like Nokia, Motorola and Research In Motion, and all the players on the software side, too, including Microsoft, Symbian and Palm.The first-generation iPhone, unveiled last year, did well, but it’s the second generation, the 3G, that has taken off since its introduction last July. The just-ended quarter is the first in which investors will see the impact on Apple’s income statement. Until Apple releases its earnings, Mr. Hargreaves said, “nobody really knows what the economics are.”Mr. Reiner, too, is looking forward to the earnings announcement with more than the usual interest. Apple has had great success in part because it has convinced customers to turn away from a $1,000 Windows laptop and to buy its $1,600 laptop instead for its stunning displays and ease of use. Historically, Apple has been conservative when giving estimates of its future financial performance to investors, Mr. Reiner said. If, despite the economic downturn, Apple foresees strong demand for its products in the next quarter, the company’s prospects are bright indeed.Looking beyond the immediate quarter, and even beyond the next calendar year, Mr. Reiner said he was extremely optimistic about Apple’s future — because of the iPhone, which is a miniaturized computer with, incidentally, phone functionality.“Who is going to do best?” he asked. “The traditional wireless hardware companies, whose expertise is in radio frequency, or an Apple, with expertise in marrying hardware to software?”IF hard times do arrive, Apple has a perfectly clean balance sheet, with $20.8 billion in cash and no debt. The biggest problem that its corporate treasury faces is what to do with the cash, which Shannon Cross, of Cross Research, estimates will grow to about $30 billion by the end of 2009.Ms. Cross says she expects Apple to pursue a more aggressive pricing strategy for the iPhone, not because of the recession but because the worldwide market for phones is too large — a billion phones sold annually — for Apple to be content with the 10 million units or so it will sell this calendar year.“In 2009,” she predicts, “we’ll get a lower-priced iPhone — iPhone Nano — which will bring it to the masses.”Apple may well turn into a story for the Weather Channel, as well as for CNBC, if it has indeed found a patch of blue sky that follows it wherever it sails.'"
"'08-10-19,'0','“It’s a dirty, foreign, fossil fuel,” said Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action. “The conversion process alone is a major pollutant. It’s not a solution to anything.” At this point, it is not clear what Gov. Jon S. Corzine will say about liquefied natural gas in his master energy plan. According to a statement issued in the last few weeks by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, Mr. Corzine “remains committed to a consistent and reliable supply of natural gas in New Jersey.”But, the statement goes on to say, “the administration will ensure that any proposal for LNG will need to meet the highest environmental standards through the N.J. Department of Environmental Protection.”In 2005, the state supported a project proposed by British Petroleum to build a terminal at Crown Landing in Logan Township, extending 2,000 feet into the Delaware River. But officials remain vague on whether they would back similar proposals offshore.But since then, New York and Connecticut both rejected a bid to build a liquefied natural gas terminal in Long Island Sound. A broad range of environmental groups, community activists and elected officials from both states had strongly opposed the Broadwater Energy plan to build a $700 million, 1,200-foot-long floating platform that could store up to eight billion cubic feet of the liquefied fuel.This month, British Petroleum announced it was suspending its Crown Landing project, a $700 million liquefied natural gas terminal planned for South Jersey. Officials with the company said that with gas prices higher for the fuel in Asia, it was unlikely to be coming to the United States soon.Officials for all three New Jersey offshore proposals said British Petroleum’s decision would not affect their plans to go forward. About 40 liquefied natural gas proposals are pending nationwide; eight terminals are operating.All of the projects are subject to approval by a host of federal and state agencies, including the United States Coast Guard, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the United States Maritime Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the state D.E.P., a process that could take years. The governor can also veto the project.In New Jersey, the Atlantic Sea Island Group is farthest along in the approval process. The Safe Harbor Energy project was proposed in 2006. Last year the Coast Guard deemed the project complete, the first step in the multilevel approval process. It would deliver up to two billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to the region, according to Howard F. Bovers, company president, and would be situated about 13.5 miles south of Long Island and about 20 miles off Sea Bright.Liberty Natural Gas’s proposal calls for building an underwater pipeline 15 miles off Asbury Park that would tie into an existing pipeline to Linden. Tankers would discharge their cargo directly into the pipeline through docking buoys. Conversion would take place aboard the ships.The newest LNG proposal by Exxon-Mobile was unveiled in December. The company expects to begin the permit process for its BlueOcean Energy floating terminal, located 20 miles off the Manasquan-Point Pleasant area, by late 2009.All three companies stress the projects will be safe for the area. But environmentalists and fishing industry representatives do not agree.“You can’t tell me if there’s a spill there won’t be any impact,” said James Lovgren, who operates out of Fisherman’s Dock in Point Pleasant. “I’m not willing to bet my livelihood on that.”'"
"'08-10-19,'0','“Different members tried out reading parts from an early draft of my play ‘AngelBeast,’ ” Mr. Meyer said, “and when the right actors emerged I could then go back for rewrites with more vigor. The characters were now fueled by the actor playing the part.”Audience “talkbacks” after performances are also an integral part of the process and help the company fine-tune projects.At a rehearsal in August the company began creating a play solely through improvisation. Instead of a script it started with a general theme: how technology has altered communication. Armed with cellphones, the actors were directed by Mr. Meyer to avoid working from any preconceived idea. “Find out what your relationship to this way of communicating is,” he told them. “Hate it? Love it? Are you avoiding person-to-person discomfort?” This core idea continues to evolve, Mr. Meyer said, and may even turn into something else altogether in the course of their discoveries.“As a company we are always percolating,” he said.Mr. Meyer started Axial with three other theater artists: an actor and two playwrights. They charged expenses to their credit cards, hoping to make money at the box office. “Remarkably we have never been in debt,” he said. “Out of New York City this is a rare achievement.”Axial is partially funded by the New York State Council on the Arts, the Westchester Arts Council and the William T. Morris Foundation. The theater company now has 15 members — 5 of them Equity actors — as well as a manager and a technical director. All have day jobs.Ryan Mallon was 15 years old when he took his first class at Axial 10 years ago. In 2004 he became a company member, and now he acts and writes. His play “The Tunnel” was produced by Axial last January.Rachel Jones, an Equity actor and a company member from the onset, acts, directs and teaches in the acting program. After moving to Westchester from New York City, she was happy to find what she described as “a vibrant group of theater people” who respected the demands of her life with young children.“We all treasure Axial,” she said. “We nurture it, and it bears fruit. And Howard’s passion is contagious.”At the heart of the theater is collaboration; an actor may write, a director may act.“It’s about the company and not the ego of the individual,” said Stephen Palgon, a company member. “We’re harsh in respect to what’s going to tell the story best. At times it’s not fun — feelings are hurt. But if, for example, something needs to be cut, we’ll get it out.”“The gift of it all,” he said. “You get so surprised.'"

"'08-10-19,'0','My wife and I rent space at a storage facility. We were inside the gate when we saw a woman and her teenage daughter struggling with the entry code they had written on a piece of paper. They asked us to open the gate. I wanted to: there seemed no chance that they were thieves. Plus, they would need a key to get into any rental space. My wife declined and told them to go phone the office. Who was right? — JEFF ZORN, SAN FRANCISCOI’m with you. Ethics is not mere rule-following. To do the right thing requires a real understanding of the circumstances in which we find ourselves — to gauge risks, to interpret the behavior and assess the motives of other people, to ask: what is going on here? In this, ethics overlaps anthropology. Context matters.You reasonably conjectured that the woman and her daughter were not dangerous. What evil designs could they have had? Wait until someone shows up and then steal old lawn furniture or summer clothing or whatever domestic detritus that was squirreled away? It is not impossible that this duo had bad intentions, but ordinary befuddlement, forgetting a combination, squinting at one’s own illegible scrawl, is a likelier explanation and a good basis for deciding to admit them.It is also noteworthy that neither you nor your wife mention feeling threatened by this pair — such unease would be worthy of consideration; it is prudent to heed your own sense of danger — only that your wife was a stickler for procedure.If you had a similar encounter not at a storage center but at the lobby door of your apartment building, then you would be right not to admit the keyless, clueless pair. People up to no good have been known to gain entry in this way and then mug vulnerable tenants or burgle apartments. So your knowledge of the world, not unthinking fidelity to the rules, should guide your actions.'"
"'08-10-19,'0','“The Complete Arista Recordings of Anthony Braxton” (Mosaic; mosaicrecords.com) is a formidable beast, an eight-disc set covering the output of this multireedist and composer during a major-label tenure as impressive as it was improbable. Recorded from 1974 to 1980 and previously available only on vinyl, the material ranges so broadly in structure and scale that it almost defies understanding as a single body of work. Yet Mr. Braxton’s vision is recognizably diamondlike, at once prismatic and tough. He knows exactly what he’s after, even when he struggles to articulate it. In the liner notes Michael Cuscuna, Mr. Braxton’s original producer and now the president of Mosaic, recalls the “blend of excited anticipation and dread” that he felt before planning each release.Mr. Braxton’s palette runs from the existential (unaccompanied alto saxophone) to the quixotic (“Opus 82: For Four Orchestras”), with a lot of action in between. His unstoppable Creative Music Orchestra turns up memorably, and so do several rough-and-tumble quartets featuring the bassist Dave Holland and Kenny Wheeler on trumpet or George Lewis on trombone. Taken as a whole the collection enables a new understanding of Mr. Braxton’s complicated mind-set as he works through a host of ideas about disjuncture and continuity, form and ritual, timbre and pulse. In some ways this was merely a foundation — he’s still furiously composing and performing — but that hardly diminishes its impact or its exhilarating sense of discovery.Elizabeth Powell, the lead singer of this three-piece Montreal indie-rock band, sounds marvelously self-assured on “Some Are Lakes” (Saddle Creek), its reverberant full-length debut. Her voice is alluring but firm, with just barely enough vulnerability to carry off a pledge like “I’ll love you like I love you/Then I’ll die,” which appears in the title track. She’s an equally strong guitarist, committed to the hazy-beautiful school of distortion but not averse to the odd brickbat riff. And where Land of Talk’s breakout EP, “Applause Cheer Boo Hiss,” sounded a bit overheated at times, “Some Are Lakes” conveys a rewardingly lived-in feeling.Some tracks, like “Death by Fire,” reveal a stylistic debt to Broken Social Scene, the Toronto collective with which Ms. Powell regularly consorts (and for which Land of Talk will open on Friday at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple, in a sold-out show). But the album, which was produced by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, casts its own illumination, intense yet rarely harsh.As an improvising cellist, Erik Friedlander has only a handful of forebears in jazz history. Among them is Oscar Pettiford, who became the first major jazz cellist in the late 1940s, after a broken arm left him temporarily unable to play his main instrument, the bass. “Broken Arm Trio” (Skipstone), due out on Tuesday, is Mr. Friedlander’s springy tribute to Pettiford, whose injury also prevented any work with a bow. Inheriting that restriction along with a spirit of midcentury modernism, Mr. Friedlander focuses on percussive pizzicato here; a number of his originals, like “Knife Points” and “Pretty Penny,” employ a boppish pointillism expressly made for nimble fingerpicking. But like his partners, the bassist Trevor Dunn and the drummer Mike Sarin, Mr. Friedlander is aiming for more than a show of prowess. This is effervescent small-group jazz executed with wit and soul.Born in Norway and based in Sweden, this singer-songwriter favors a secretive hush in her songs, which cast love variously as a hazard, a hideout or a sort of slumbering dream state. Her recent album, “Changing of the Seasons,” released in Europe this spring and in the United States this week (on Cheap Lullaby), pairs her girlish, quavering voice with twinkling keyboards and sighing strings. If that doesn’t seem sparse enough, her Web site, anebrun.com, offers for download “Sketches,” which features the same tunes in demo form.When she’s supported by little more than her own acoustic guitar — as she will be on Wednesday night at the Living Room on the Lower East Side (livingroomny.com) — Ms. Brun sounds disarmingly secure, if not quite serene. “Rest your head,” she coos in “Lullaby for Grown-ups.” Then, evenly: “You can’t keep the sky from falling, anyway.”'"
"'08-10-19,'0','There is also another, highly publicized view of the oil market. According to skeptics like George Soros and Michael Masters, a hedge-fund operator, the only thing wrong with the oil market is the market itself. Speculators, they say, drove the price away from its “fundamental” value; worse, a new breed of institutional investor has been buying oil futures, hoarding the supply. Masters compares these investors to the Hunt brothers, the Texas billionaires who cornered the silver market in the late ’70s — until silver crashed and the Hunts landed in bankruptcy. Essentially, he says, the oil price is, or was, seriously “wrong” — a distortion caused by traders that has little to do with the amount of oil being produced and consumed.According to this view, oil traders are the culprits, as are the futures market and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates it. (The agency has also begun its own probe of the oil market.) Masters has fired off scores of e-mail messages to journalists and Wall Streeters, urging limits on speculators. (One message found its way to Senator Joe Lieberman.) Masters is not a disinterested party; his hedge fund has bet heavily on companies, like Delta Airlines, that have been punished by soaring oil prices. But his argument struck a populist chord. “Speculators are driving up the price of food and energy for everyone else,” he told me. Shad Rowe, a Dallas money manager, says the situation raises the bigger question of “whether people in a complex society ought to be allowed to make bets that affect other people and that have nothing to do with them.”Of course, capitalism demands that people, or at least investors, make bets. That is how resources are allocated and money is invested where it is needed; high prices communicate scarcity. You could even say the oil market has performed a vital service to the country by telegraphing the need to conserve and to develop alternative supplies. The number of miles driven by Americans has declined, in recent months, by close to 5 percent. Consumers have abandoned S.U.V.’s, forcing Ford to speed up its plans to close truck factories and emphasize small cars. For similar reasons, General Motors and Chrysler are rushing to introduce electric cars. All of this is healthy, and none of it would have occurred in an environment of $20 oil. “Should speculators go to jail,” notes Robert Barbera, chief economist with the Wall Street firm ITG, “or should they get the Congressional Medal of Honor?”In a sense, the question is whether we want to return to an era of plentiful oil and low prices — assuming it is possible — or to accept that political, geological and possibly environmental limitations will force us to diversify. The candidates, while talking tough about cutting our dependence on foreign oil, have supported some policies that seem inconsistent with that aim. Barack Obama has called for investment in alternative energy sources like wind and solar, and for ramping up production of cars that don’t rely on gasoline. John McCain has supported offshore drilling and nuclear power. Such policies are responsive to the idea that energy, oil in particular, is a scarce resource. And a higher oil price is the most persuasive lobby for all of them. But on the stump, each candidate has inveighed against high gasoline prices — as if prices were the problem, rather than a useful, albeit painful, signal that conventional supplies are running low. Obama supports a windfall tax on oil-company profits, a nonsolution that would discourage drilling and potentially worsen future shortages. (An Obama campaign flier asserts, “While you’re running on empty, Exxon made $4 billion in one month.”) McCain advocated a temporary repeal of the gas tax — a measure that would do the most to revive Americans’ love affair with big cars.Congress took a positive step toward energy conservation last year, raising mileage requirements to 35 miles per gallon, but the new standard will not take effect until 2020 and will not, even then, make cars in the U.S. as efficient as those now on the road in Europe, where the average is about 45 miles per gallon. Wind and solar credits were also extended as part of the financial-bailout bill. Congress also held hearings (with Michael Masters as a prime witness) probing the supposed harm done by oil speculators. Blaming speculators is good politics. In 1958, the government shut down the market for onion futures after a price spike, and recently the Securities and Exchange Commission has seemed to blame speculators for the havoc in bank stocks.The S.E.C. may not be all wrong, but oil trading and stock trading differ in an important respect. The stock market is a secondary market, in which investors merely exchange shares with one another. Except for the relatively rare occasions on which companies raise capital by selling new stock, changes in stock prices have little effect on nontraders, which means that mispricings (or bubbles) can persist for a long time. But commodity markets affect not just investors but also people who use the actual goods — all of us, that is.Crude oil and other energy products are quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a vast commodities pit with giant, wall-to-wall screens that is also a market for metals like copper and gold. Traders at the Merc buy and sell oil for future delivery, and the price on the Merc serves as the reference price for oil shipments around the world. In other words, when a refinery contracts to buy crude oil from, say, Saudi Arabia, it generally agrees to pay the price on the Merc less a certain differential. (The discount depends on the quality of the oil being shipped.) Approximately 500,000 crude-oil futures contracts, representing 500 million barrels, trade on the Merc each day. By comparison, the world uses only 86 million barrels of oil daily. Though in theory the price on the Merc reflects the underlying supply-and-demand trends, on any given day the futures market often wags the physical market, not the other way around.Last June 5, for example, when the decrease in Americans’ gasoline consumption was already apparent, crude oil inexplicably shot up $5.49 a barrel — a record move. As analysts searched for an explanation, the following day oil soared like one of those fabled East Texas gushers — up $10.75. According to Raymond Carbone, a floor trader on the Merc, two news items — neither having anything to do with supply and demand — were behind it. Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the European Central Bank, had made worrisome comments about inflation, which suggested that Trichet might raise interest rates, a step that could strengthen the euro and weaken the dollar. (When the dollar falls in currency markets, the price in dollars of international goods like vacations in France and barrels of crude oil generally goes up.) Also, an Israeli minister said it might be necessary to attack Iran. Israel did not attack — nor did the minister’s remark reflect any policy change — and the dollar was about to get stronger. Nonetheless, Carbone, who was betting on the rally to continue, figured the rumors were good for a ride and maintained his bets.Looked at in isolation, trusting oil prices to Raymond Carbone and his peers on the Merc, and to their fellow speculators around the globe, does seem like madness. In two days, the price of a commodity that is a staple of everyday life rose 13 percent. According to a calculation by an energy economist at the Dallas Federal Reserve, that 48-hour market orgy weakened the future expected output of the U.S. economy by $90 billion, slicing more than half a percentage point off the gross domestic product.But the link to the real economy means that commodity prices tend to correct relatively quickly. After all, when the price of a good is too high, people buy less of it. Also, a futures contract is not just a gambling chit (though many people use it that way). Futures are agreements to buy or sell actual oil (or corn or soybeans, etc.) at a future moment at a particular price. This makes them especially useful to hedgers, who use futures to offset risks in their business. Southwest Airlines correctly anticipated that oil would go up, and via futures bought its jet fuel in advance at prices lower than today’s.Most of the trading on the Merc is probably done by speculators, not hedgers, and the vast majority settle in cash before their contracts expire. But the fact that traders have the right to settle in kind provides an important check. Say that traders went truly nuts and drove the price to $200 a barrel. Oil companies would take advantage and sell $200 oil by the boatload. Either the people who took delivery would be able to find customers for such expensive oil or — more likely — they would go broke, and the price would come crashing down.The system sounds wacky, but those that preceded it were hardly better. Beginning in the 1870s, John D. Rockefeller tried to control oil’s price by monopolizing the distribution — until his company, Standard Oil, was dismantled in an antitrust case. In the 1930s, when oil sank to 10 cents a barrel, the state of Texas adopted a system that mimicked Rockefeller’s — or at least got the same result. For the next three decades, the Texas Railroad Commission controlled supplies by restricting well operators to a fixed number of production days per month. Then, in 1960, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, which by then had supplanted Texas as the center of the oil world, founded the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with the same principle in mind. (In fact, the founders hired a former Railroad Commission engineer to show them the ropes.) Since 1983, when the Merc introduced the crude-oil contract, investors and traders have largely assumed the cartel’s former function of setting prices.The reason that the history of oil is basically one of attempted price fixing is that, as technology has improved, drilling costs have fallen, meaning that prices have been under near-continuous downward pressure. Like most commodities, oil should sell for whatever the cost of producing one additional unit is — in this case, one more barrel. Economists call this the “marginal” cost. If someone charges much more than that, a competitor can offer to sell it more cheaply.It’s only when oil is scarce that things become interesting. If there isn’t enough to go around, then the marginal cost no longer matters because, at the margin, there is no more oil to produce. Under such conditions, oil will rise to the price at which people stop using it — either because they drive less or because they find another energy source. This is called the price of demand destruction. Think of that as the upper bound on the price. With the twin shocks of the ’70s — the Arab embargo and the Iranian revolution — oil did reach an upper bound, jumping tenfold to $40 a barrel in 1981. Demand quickly collapsed, and the price eventually sank all the way back to the marginal cost, $12.Low prices were good news for consumers but a mixed blessing for society. Since it takes time for oil companies, as well as consumers, to react to price changes, markets tend to respond with a perilous lag. In the ’80s, oil companies were spending billions looking for oil, and Detroit was retooling its plants to make smaller cars, even as the price of oil was collapsing.In the mid-1980s the oil industry suffered a terrible slump. Thousands of petroleum engineers were fired or left the business. Congress lost interest in energy conservation, and projects to develop shale oil and other alternatives were dropped. In Europe, high fuel taxes meant that people still had an incentive to conserve. In America, families became unwilling to ride in anything but trucks.Even as oil prices rose in this decade, big oil companies — still responding to the price signal of an earlier period — plowed most of their cash flow into dividends and stock repurchases rather than risk it on exploration. State oil companies overseas, like Saudi Arabia’s, which control four-fifths of the world’s reserves, refused to make the investment to develop their fields to full potential for fear of flooding the market (another reaction to low prices). For similar reasons, there was a lull in building critically needed refineries.By the time oil companies woke up to the consequences of low prices, it was in some sense too late. There was “a missing generation of engineers,” according to Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and the author of “The Prize,” a history of the oil industry. There was also a lack of drilling rigs and men to work them. Drilling costs soared, and equipment was often unavailable. Also, countries where oil is abundant, like Russia and Venezuela, were increasingly chauvinistic and hostile to foreign operators. Civil unrest set back production in Nigeria.By the middle of this decade, various big oil regions — Mexico, Nigeria, the North Sea, Colombia, Venezuela — were experiencing production declines. Matthew Simmons, an energy banker in Houston, made a startling forecast: the entire world’s oil production, he said, was peaking and was headed for irreversible decline.Simmons was dismissed as an alarmist, and much of what he said was extreme. He spoke of a looming, postglobal economy in which transportation grinds to a halt, almost a literal return to the Dark Ages. This isn’t going to happen. At least not right away. The world has 1.3 trillion barrels of proven reserves, enough for 40 years at current rates of consumption. “Peak oil is about geology,” notes Marianne Kah, chief economist at ConocoPhillips. “I don’t think we are running out of oil. We are running out of access to oil.”Kah is right: there is plenty of oil. But it cannot be withdrawn at will like money from an A.T.M.; wells yield only so much liquid per day. And since the flow from aging wells declines by about 5 percent a year, producers that stand pat will shrink. To stay even requires investment — and usually, the incentive of a high price. It also takes time. Thus, in the short run, whether the constraints on supplies are geologic or human may not matter.What frightened markets last spring was the awareness that capacity was flattening at the same time that a strong global economy was pushing demand rapidly higher. And emerging nations would seem to have a lot of oil-demand growth ahead of them. While the U.S. consumes 25 barrels of oil per capita annually and Europe 10 barrels, each Chinese consumes 2 barrels a year. Given their numbers, even a small amount of growth in Chinese consumption will offset a great deal of conservation in the U.S. Rising demand is especially ominous in light of Buffett’s point: there is less spare capacity than in the previous decade. Before, if a war or hurricane were to interrupt supplies, Saudi Arabia could always open the tap farther. Soon there might not be enough. “Imagine if you and I were trading jelly beans,” Ken Hersh, who runs an energy fund, offered in a telling metaphor. “We both love jelly beans, we know our kids are going to like ’em, and our kids’ kids, and five years from now we have to make a trade and we look in the jar and there is only one jelly bean left.” As traders wondered what would happen if there was a natural or man-made disaster, they were pricing each barrel as if it were the very last jelly bean.Institutions also have been counting jelly beans. After the stock-market disasters of the dot-com collapse in 2000 and Enron in 2001, big investors began to look for alternatives to stocks. Wall Street promoted commodities as the answer, and institutions like Harvard University and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System have taken a flier on commodity indexes that are heavily weighted in oil. Masters is incensed because such investors tend to hold for the long haul and thus, he claims, to remove supplies from the market. Then again, commodities could be just the latest fad. Literature from A.I.G., the recently rescued insurer, described commodities as “an asset class which has returns that have historically been comparable to stock returns but with lower volatility.” This is a gross distortion. (It is true only if you calculate the returns in a highly stylized manner.) The fact is that from 1975 to 2005, the average commodity did not keep up with inflation, much less with the stock market. Whether it is wise to invest pensions and endowments in rocks is, of course, their business, but it is hard to see why they should be less free than others to express an opinion — even if it does feed into prices. This, in fact, is what speculators are supposed to do: translate (however imperfectly) expectations about the future into today’s price.You can argue that last July’s $147 peak was irrational, but Aubrey McClendon, the chief executive of the Oklahoma-based Chesapeake Energy, says it was merely the answer to a real-world economics quiz: at what price would the world consume less oil? Americans began to cut back on their driving at $50 oil, and at something like $120 oil they garaged their S.U.V.’s en masse. People in many emerging nations were slower to react, because their governments subsidize local gasoline prices. But as the price rose, such a subsidy became costly, and beginning in May, China, India, Indonesia and others cut their subsidies. The upper bound had been reached.It’s actually the lower bound that should concern Washington now. When you ask economists what the minimum oil price is to sustain the development of alternatives to gasoline — new battery systems or sugar ethanol or even wood chips — you get a range of something like $75 a barrel to maybe $150.Marginal costs for oil are less than those for alternative technologies, though they are rising. The marginal barrels today are found in remote and costly terrain, like the Canadian tar sands or off the coast of Brazil under 7,000 feet of seawater and more than 10,000 feet of ocean floor.One intriguing alternative is natural gas. Its price also soared, from $2 per thousand cubic feet to $13. And while U.S. oil production has been falling for four decades, the gas industry is experiencing a revival. Most recently, gas companies have embarked on a frantic quest to lease land in a vast, wooded region of the Northeast known as the Marcellus Shale that may contain more natural gas than anywhere else in America. The drilling uses a new technology to inject water deep below the surface to split apart the shale, then underground drilling continues horizontally for hundreds of feet.Farmers in the Marcellus who once leased land for $2 an acre are reaping fortunes. One 73-year-old dairy farmer leased 1,100 acres for $2.5 million. There could be many more like him out there. The United States has a lot of untapped shale, and there is no engineering reason that America could not substitute gas, which is cleaner and produces only half as much carbon as oil, for much of its driving. Eight million cars in the world already run on natural gas, though very few in the U.S. do. To Barbera, the economist, whose family owns some land in the Marcellus, it proves that technology will frustrate Thomas Malthus, the classical economist who forecast catastrophic, population-induced food shortages. The only risk in the Marcellus is that falling prices will sabotage the entire enterprise. Last summer, when gas was at a peak, Barbera told me that the gas companies rushing to sign up farmers reminded him of the way venture capitalists once threw money at Web sites. They shouldn’t be asking how high gas can go, he said; they should be asking at what price does the drilling stop.Bingo. Gas has fallen to $7. If it falls much more, the Marcellus looks a lot less interesting. And if oil falls to $70, so do other alternatives.It would be a tragedy if falling prices were to extinguish such alternatives and — given the time lag inherent in energy development — leave the country vulnerable to a yet another round of shocks. There is no disputing, as Ben Bernanke said, that recently falling oil prices are giving the economy a shot in the arm. But new energy projects also create jobs, and though oil prices impose a cost, Europe has lived with high prices (because of the imposition of taxes) and adjusted to them.What can Washington do now? McClendon, the Chesapeake chief executive, whose company is active in the Marcellus, is angling for federal subsidies to help service stations convert to natural gas. This is what every energy pioneer wants: subsidies for what it does. But Congress is probably not the optimal institution for anointing technological winners. Its mandate to use corn for ethanol, while it has done wonders for Iowa farmers, has led to sharply higher corn prices and has not added much (if anything) to the country’s energy supply. And even if politicians act with the purest of motives, there are simply too many possibilities for the car of tomorrow (fuel cells, nickel-hydride or lithium-ion batteries, natural gas, biofuel from wood chips and oil itself) to know which will prove the most feasible.The government could help finance basic research, but there is no reason to rule out any source — oil included. By restricting offshore drilling, the United States is shunning an estimated 18 billion barrels of oil (equal to 80 percent of our proven reserves). As McClendon says, it’s hard to fault Mexico or Saudi Arabia for not developing their fields to the max when the U.S. declares its own territory off-limits.What the country doesn’t want is to remain dependent only on oil — to lose the urgency to develop alternatives. It happened once before. After the gas lines of the ’70s, Jimmy Carter declared that solving our energy problems was the moral equivalent of war. Then, in the 1980s, Americans forgot.The way to avoid a repeat is to dust off an idea that Gerald Ford once proposed: a tax on oil. Ideally, it would kick in only if the price fell back to, say, $70 a barrel. The beauty of this tax is that, very likely, no one would have to pay it. The tax would merely serve as a floor — a new lower bound. Auto companies would never have to worry that cheap gas would tempt consumers away from efficient cars; investors could finance development of batteries and fuel cells, because cheap oil could never undercut them. Oil itself would be used more sparingly and last longer. The oil market did its part when it sent the price to almost $150. The government should make sure there is no going back.'"
"'08-10-19,'0','In Julian Schnabel’s film “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,” Céline, played by Emmanuelle Seigner, sits faithfully at the bedside of the father of her children, Jean-Dominique Bauby, editor of French Elle. Once a bon vivant and serious playboy, Bauby now has locked-in syndrome, a condition that has left him unable to move anything but his left eyelid. In the film, beautiful women come and go. But a mysterious character known only as Inès, for whom Bauby had left Céline, never visits. She is only imagined: a selfish woman who can’t bear her lover’s illness.That’s the sanitized Hollywood version. The real version is now being told in “La Fausse Veuve” (“The False Widow”; Denoël), a book by Florence Ben Sadoun. Céline is Sylvie de la Rochefoucauld, Bauby’s former partner of 10 years and the mother of his children. Inès is Florence Ben Sadoun, the real “wife” who sat by his bed daily and in whose arms Bauby died. De la Rochefoucauld was in New York with a new boyfriend at the time of his death. Ben Sadoun endured the film’s inaccuracy, but Bauby’s friends begged her to write the truth. The result is “autofiction” (not quite a novel, more of an autobiography). Schnabel’s film is beautiful but simply not true. Ben Sadoun’s book is tragic, loving and dignified, proving that the real story is almost always so much better than the manufactured one.

But then the venerable Paris emporium Le Bon Marché isn’t your average department store. According to Christine Chapellu, who, along with Régine Beraud, heads up the women’s fashion buying team: “Our clients don’t even like department stores.

"'08-10-20,'1','Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Garcia are investigating whether investors drove up the price of swaps in transactions that were reported to data providers but never actually completed, according to people briefed on the investigation. If so, that would have helped anybody who sold short financial shares. In a short-sale, investors sell stocks they do not own in the hopes of buying them back later at a lower price.To identify whether there was any manipulation, Mr. Cuomo’s office has issued subpoenas seeking data from various parts of the industry, including stock exchanges, investment firms and three companies involved in processing trades in swaps and stocks, according to people briefed on the inquiry.Those firms are: the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, which serves as the clearing agent for most financial transactions including swaps and stocks; Markit, which provides swaps data to Wall Street banks and investors; and Bloomberg, the financial data company whose electronic system is used by traders to track markets and communicate with one another.The inquiry is in preliminary stages, and people familiar with the investigation say it may not lead to a prosecution.One investor, who asked for anonymity to avoid drawing attention to his firm, said the swaps market was becoming a convenient scapegoat for regulators. He added that evidence of traders’ manipulating share prices was largely circumstantial.Concerns about the market have prompted the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to push investment firms to move trading in credit-default swaps to a regulated exchange by year’s end.Joseph A. Grundfest, a former commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a professor at Stanford Law School, said a partnership between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Garcia made sense given the complexity of the swaps market. This is “an international market and it might well be easier for the United States attorney to get information from some foreign sources than have a local prosecutor pursue the information,” he said.In the past, the state attorney general and the United States attorney’s office have often competed with each other on major white-collar crime cases, like the investigation of Frank Quattrone, the former Credit Suisse banker who was acquitted last year of federal obstruction of justice charges. Tensions between the offices ran high when Eliot Spitzer, the former New York governor, was attorney general.While the United States attorney’s office brings criminal cases, the attorney general’s office typically pursues civil cases, though it can pursue criminal charges. “The efforts of the U.S. attorney’s office, whose primary role will be to determine whether any federal laws have been violated, will serve to complement the broader mandate of the attorney general’s office,” Yusill Scribner, a spokeswoman for Mr. Garcia, said in a statement.Several senior lawyers in Mr. Cuomo’s office, including his deputy counselor and special assistant, Benjamin M. Lawsky, previously worked in the United States attorney’s office. “The probe will bring together top prosecutors from both offices while simultaneously avoiding multiple competing investigations,” Alex Detrick, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in a statement.'"
"'08-10-20,'1','Senator of , 65, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, had emergency surgery in 1988 for an in an artery in his brain and elective surgery for a second one. His campaign released 49 pages of medical records to The late last week showing that he was healthy, but the documents did not indicate whether he had had a test in recent years to detect any new aneurysm.The two other nominees are younger and apparently in good health, but less is known about their medical history. Senator of , 47, the Democratic presidential nominee, released a one-page, undated letter from his personal physician in May stating that he was in “excellent” health. Late last week, his campaign released the results of standard laboratory tests and electrocardiograms from his checkups in June 2001, November 2004 and January 2007. The findings were normal.Gov. of , 44, Mr. McCain’s running mate, has released no medical information.There may be no serious problems with the health of any of the nominees. But absent fuller disclosure, there is no way for the electorate to know.The health of the four nominees is a matter of concern because in the past a number of candidates, and in some cases their doctors and aides, have distorted, kept secret or spoken about the facts only at the last minute when medical events forced the issue. Examples include Senator Thomas F. Eagleton ( ), Senator (cancer), Senator (heart rhythm abnormality) and, as a vice-presidential nominee, (heart disease).I am a physician who has covered the health of presidential candidates for 36 years. Since 1980, The Times has made it a practice to question nominees for president and other high political offices and, with their permission, their doctors about their health.The Times has requested such interviews with Mr. Obama since last spring and with Mr. McCain and his doctors since March 2007. None were granted. More recently, The Times sent letters to all four nominees requesting interviews about their health with them and their doctors. None agreed.The candidates’ health has drawn little attention for most of this long campaign season despite the importance of the issue. But since Mr. McCain selected Ms. Palin as his running mate in August, questions about his health have intensified. In recent weeks, more than 2,700 physicians have signed a petition that ran as an advertisement demanding that Mr. McCain fully release his health records; the petition is sponsored by Brave New Films, the company led by Robert Greenwald, a Hollywood filmmaker who has contributed $2,250 to Democratic candidates and has made a number of anti-McCain videos. Beyond the advertisement, Mr. McCain’s health has become the subject of both speculation and distortion on the Internet and other media.The following is a summary of the publicly known medical information about all four nominees and the outstanding questions about each.Mr. McCain’s difficulty raising his arms and his sometimes awkward gait are remnants of severe, untreated injuries he suffered in . Mr. McCain, a pilot, broke both arms and his right knee when his jet was shot down over North Vietnam in 1967. He experienced additional wounds while being tortured during his five and a half years as a prisoner of war. Mr. McCain may eventually need joint replacements, according to his doctor at the in , Ariz.Mr. McCain has released more details about his health than the other three nominees, though he has done so in a phased way and has apparently not agreed to any extensive interviews about his health. A handful of reporters were allowed to view his records during his bid for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination. Another group of reporters were permitted to see newer records last May. By not allowing reporters to interview him or his doctors extensively about his entire medical history, he has made it impossible to get a complete picture of his diagnoses and treatment.In 1999, early in his first run for the presidency, Mr. McCain allowed a small number of reporters, including me, to review an estimated 1,500 pages of his medical records without photocopying or recording the information.In doing so, Mr. McCain gave the public its broadest look at the psychological profile of a presidential candidate. He released psychological records about him that were amassed as part of a Navy project to gauge the health of former prisoners of war. Assessments were based on standard psychological tests and what Mr. McCain told his doctors after his release. The records mentioned that in 1968, about eight months after his capture and after some particularly brutal beatings from his North Vietnamese captors, Mr. McCain attempted , trying to hang himself with his shirt.The records and his doctors, whom I interviewed with the senator’s permission in 1999, said he had never been given a diagnosis of a disorder or treated at the project’s center for a mental health disorder.The records also showed that a surgeon removed a melanoma from Mr. McCain’s left shoulder in 1993. Melanomas can be a far more deadly form of than the more common basal cell and other types.In early August 2000, just as Mr. McCain’s rival was about to receive the Republican presidential nomination, Dr. John F. Eisold, the attending physician at the United States Capitol, detected two more melanomas, Mr. McCain’s second and third.One on Mr. McCain’s left arm was determined to be the least risky type, in situ. But the one on his left temple was dangerous.A few days after detection of the melanomas, Mr. McCain sought care for them at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale. Mr. McCain’s campaign said this year that the left-temple melanoma was 2.2 millimeters at its thickest part and graded as Stage IIA on a scale in which Stage IV is the worst. Stage II meant that the melanoma had not spread into the lymph nodes. The number of melanomas is less significant than the thickness measured in the pathology assessment of any one of them.Mr. McCain underwent extensive surgery on his face and neck for the melanoma on Aug. 19, 2000. Surgeons removed more than 30 lymph nodes, and pathologists then determined that all of them were cancer free.In March 2007, as Mr. McCain was making his second bid for the Republican nomination, The Times began asking his campaign for permission to speak with the senator and his doctors, citing the history of such interviews.On May 6, 2008, Jill Hazelbaker, a McCain spokeswoman, denied the requests, writing in an e-mail message that The Times was “not at the top of the list” and including a link to a Times editorial that had criticized Mr. McCain for not disclosing health information and Senator of New York for not disclosing financial records.On May 23, Mr. McCain allowed a small pool of journalists, including three doctor-reporters, though none from The Times, to spend three hours reviewing a newer set of his Mayo Clinic records. That set, 1,173 pages, included records from 2000 to 2008 but none of the records made available in 1999. Again, the campaign did not allow the journalists to photocopy any documents.Mr. McCain’s Mayo Clinic doctors answered selected reporters’ questions by telephone, but only for 45 minutes instead of the scheduled two hours. The McCain campaign did not allow New York Times reporters to ask questions in the teleconference.The clinic doctors said that Mr. McCain was in good health and that no medical reason precluded him from fulfilling all the duties of president.The doctors said that a fourth melanoma they detected on the left side of his nose in 2002 was also in situ, the least dangerous type. All four melanomas that Mr. McCain experienced were primary, or new, and there was no evidence that any of them had spread, the doctors said.However, the reporters’ summary cited a report dated Aug. 9, 2000, from two pathologists at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in who examined a of the melanoma taken from Mr. McCain’s left temple a few days earlier.The Armed Forces pathologists suggested that the left-temple melanoma had spread from another melanoma, known as a metastasis or satellite lesion. “The vertical orientation of this lesion,” the report said, “with only focal epidermal involvement above it is highly suggestive of a metastasis of malignant melanoma and may represent a satellite metastasis of S00-9572-A,” which is the “skin, left temple, lateral” biopsy.The pool report was by nature unable to provide a complete portrait of Mr. McCain’s recent medical history. It left several questions, including about the number of biopsies and when they were done. On Aug. 18, 2000, Dr. John D. Eckstein, Mr. McCain’s personal physician at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, noted in Mr. McCain’s records that there were two biopsies of the left temple. Dr. Eckstein’s note did not say where and when the biopsies were performed. The Armed Forces report cited one biopsy, so presumably a second was performed in Scottsdale. The Armed Forces pathologists said a melanoma had developed over a skin whose origin was unclear.A , not one of the four melanomas, had been removed from Mr. McCain’s left temple in 1996 and interpreted as being benign; some experts have speculated that it might have been misdiagnosed, and thus the origin of the 2000 melanoma.The Armed Forces pathologists did not speak in the teleconference in May 2008, and questions raised by their report have remained unanswered. The selected reporters did not ask about that report, and the Mayo Clinic doctors did not discuss it. A complete Mayo pathology report was apparently not included in the pool summary.In interviews, several melanoma experts questioned why the Mayo Clinic doctors had performed such extensive surgery, because the operation was usually reserved for treatment of Stage III melanoma, not Stage IIA.On Aug. 18, 2000, the day before Mr. McCain’s operation, his surgeon, Dr. Michael L. Hinni, wrote in the records that he planned to do the extensive operation because of the size and location of Mr. McCain’s melanoma. In the teleconference in May 2008, Dr. Hinni explained that because the melanoma was two centimeters across he had to make “a 6-by-6-centimeter island of skin, a fairly sizable wound” to remove it.It is not known whether the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale asked pathologists outside the Mayo system for an independent review.If Mr. McCain’s 2000 left-temple melanoma was a metastasis, as the Armed Forces pathologists’ report suggested, it would be classified as Stage III. The reclassification would change his statistical odds for survival at 10 years from about 60 percent to 36 percent, according to a published study.The greatest risk of recurrence of melanoma is in the first few years after detection. His age, his sex and the presence of the melanoma on his face increase the risk.The fact that Mr. McCain has had no recurrence for eight years is in his favor. But cancer experts see the 10th anniversary as an important statistical benchmark, and that would not occur until 2010.In May, his dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic, Dr. Suzanne M. Connolly, said in the teleconference that though there was no way to predict with certainty Mr. McCain’s chance of a recurrence, she judged it to be less than 10 percent. But melanoma is known to be quirkier than most cancers; doctors cite occasional cases in which melanomas come back after 15 or 20 years.Melanomas can spread to various areas in the body, including the skin and any internal organ. In general, such spreading means the melanoma would not be curable. Treatment would depend in part on what organ or tissues are involved and could include additional surgery, , biologics, vaccines and radiation.Many such treatments can be debilitating and impair an individual’s physical and mental stamina. If the patient was the president, the location of a recurrence and its treatment could raise the need to invoke the 25th Amendment, elevating the vice president to president, at least temporarily.On the trail, Mr. McCain has played down concerns about his age by pointing to the vigor of his mother and her twin sister at age 96. Mr. McCain’s father died in 1981 at age 70 after a .In the May teleconference, Dr. Eckstein said that he had not detected any memory deficits in Mr. McCain and that the senator had not reported any. Dr. Eckstein did not report whether Mr. McCain had taken any baseline .Mr. McCain has and takes a statin for high but has no evidence of significant heart disease, his doctors said.In making his medical information public, Mr. McCain released his confidentiality in the traditional patient-doctor relationship.For its part, the Mayo Clinic says it agreed to yield control over all of Mr. McCain’s medical information to his campaign and to refer all questions to the campaign. Pool reporters inspected the records at a hotel near the clinic, which sent the records there under security. In the teleconference, the doctors answered questions by telephone at the clinic with no reporters present.Dr. Eckstein, Mr. McCain’s doctor, said he understood that the campaign had released all the McCain records to the pool reporters. But a spokeswoman at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, asked if the institution could verify that the campaign had released all the records to the reporters, said she did not know whether the doctors had checked to be sure.Last week, The Times contacted the McCain campaign to fill in gaps in the medical records. Ms. Hazelbaker, the McCain spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail message: “As you know, we disclosed over 1,200 pages of Senator McCain’s medical history to Dr. Altman’s colleagues in the press earlier this year. We also arranged a Mayo Clinic briefing with three of Senator McCain’s physicians that Dr. Altman listened to by phone. Additionally, we released a detailed document outlining his most recent physical and lab test results. It was an unprecedented level of disclosure, and Dr. Altman can look at the public document on our Web site if he wishes to do so. It was certainly more significant than the one-page doctor’s note Obama released, though I have little hope The Times will report it that way.”On May 29, six days after the McCain campaign’s disclosures about his recent health, Mr. Obama’s campaign released an undated, single-page letter from his doctor in attesting to Mr. Obama’s “excellent health.”The six-paragraph letter from Dr. David L. Scheiner said Mr. Obama had no known medical problems that would affect his ability to serve as president. Until the release of test results last week, the letter was the only information that Mr. Obama had made public about his health.Dr. Scheiner’s assessment was based on regularly examining Mr. Obama since March 23, 1987. Mr. Obama’s last checkup was on Jan. 15, 2007, a day before he created a presidential exploratory committee and more than a year before his campaign released the letter from Dr. Scheiner, a general internist who practices at the and the Rush University Medical Center.The letter was short, the Obama campaign said, because Mr. Obama had not had any serious health problems. The campaign declined to make Dr. Scheiner available for an interview.Mr. Obama has had a notable medical problem: a difficulty in stopping . It is not known how heavily he smoked. Dr. Scheiner wrote that Mr. Obama began smoking at least two decades ago and had made several efforts to stop. Mr. Obama has used Nicorette gum “with success,” Dr. Scheiner wrote, without defining success.Nicorette, which contains smaller amounts of than do, is a replacement therapy intended to ease the craving for nicotine and other withdrawal effects of .Dr. Scheiner did not say when Mr. Obama had started using Nicorette, how much he had used or for how long he had used it. Reporters have often observed him chewing it.Mr. Obama said he quit smoking in 2007 when he began his presidential campaign. But he has “bummed” cigarettes since then, he has said.Also, Dr. Scheiner did not provide a standard measure of smoking risk. It is known as pack years — the number of packs smoked a day multiplied by the number of years a person has smoked. The pack-year number is used to help determine a patient’s risk of developing lung cancer, heart disease and other tobacco-related ailments.Information about Mr. Obama’s smoking is relevant because studies show that the risk of cancer and other tobacco-related serious diseases declines after an individual stops smoking, but not until then.According to the newly released documents, in January 2007 Mr. Obama had a level of 173 ( 68 and LDL 96) and of 44. Those levels were normal.Nothing is known publicly about Ms. Palin’s medical history, aside from the much-discussed circumstances surrounding the birth of her fifth child last April. Ms. Palin has said that her water broke while she was at a conference in and that she flew to Alaska where she gave birth to her son Trig hours after landing.Last week Maria Comella, a spokeswoman for Ms. Palin, said the governor declined to be interviewed or provide any health records.In 1988, Mr. Biden was working out on a shoulder press weight machine in the Senate gym when a pain shot through his neck. On the train home to , Del., the returned more severely. His head ached. The right side of his body went numb. A doctor later diagnosed a pinched nerve, and a pain clinic prescribed a neck brace.Shortly thereafter, on a trip to , Mr. Biden was alone in his hotel room when he felt a sharp stab in the back of his neck and a lightning flash in his head. The rip of pain was like none he had ever experienced. Nothing Mr. Biden did, including curling up in the fetal position, relieved the pain. He lay unconscious on the floor for five hours, he wrote in his autobiography, ( , 2007).The next morning, he felt somewhat better and flew home. His wife, Jill, summoned from the school where she taught, immediately took him to a hospital. Doctors determined he had a berry-shaped bulge in an artery that was leaking blood into his brain. Such bulges, or aneurysms, can tear at any time. Ruptured aneurysms are fatal in about 50 percent of cases. Up to 20 percent of survivors remain severely disabled. A Roman Catholic priest gave Mr. Biden last rites.After a harrowing ambulance trip to in Washington, a team of neurosurgeons put a clip on the artery to stop the bleeding. While recuperating, he suffered a major complication: a blood clot lodged in his lung.A few weeks later, surgeons operated on a second aneurysm on the opposite side of his brain. Though it had caused no symptoms, it still could have burst as the first one did.Mr. Biden returned to the Senate after a seven-month absence.Now, a question arises: Has Mr. Biden developed a new aneurysm over the last two decades that could burst?Doctors, who long thought that berry aneurysms were a once-in-a-lifetime event, now generally believe that they can recur. About 5 percent or less of patients who have had a berry aneurysm develop new ones at the original site or elsewhere in the brain.“Over the last two decades,” said Dr. Robert F. Spetzler of the Barrow Neurological Institute in , “we have learned much more about aneurysms, and the fact is that when you have had one aneurysm, you are more likely to develop another one. Although the likelihood is very low, it does exist.”Doctors’ views vary widely on what types of brain imaging tests to recommend to patients who have had a berry aneurysm and when to do them. Some conduct no tests. Others periodically conduct tests like magnetic resonance angiograms.Mr. Biden has “recovered fully without continued effects” from the aneurysm, Dr. Eisold, the Capitol physician, said in a letter released by the campaign. Dr. Eisold, a specialist in internal medicine, has a longstanding policy not to talk to reporters about his patients, even with their permission.The Obama-Biden campaign referred me to Dr. Matthew A. Parker, an internist in Washington, who reviewed Mr. Biden’s records and also spoke with Dr. Eisold about them. Dr. Parker said that Dr. Eisold told him that brain imaging tests were not needed now because Mr. Biden had done well for the 20 years after the aneurysm. “It is a nonissue,” Dr. Parker said Dr. Eisold told him.Dr. Parker, who is associated with Hospital and Sibley Memorial Hospital, said he had not treated or met with Mr. Biden and did not have a direct connection to the campaign. records show that Dr. Parker contributed the maximum, $2,300, to Mr. Obama’s presidential campaign on March 13, 2008.The medical records released by the campaign contain a summary of Mr. Biden’s operation and hospital stay in 1988 but no notes from a neurologist or neurosurgeon since then. So it is not known whether Mr. Biden has had recent brain imaging scans or has been evaluated by a neurologist or neurosurgeon recently. Dr. Parker said he did not ask Dr. Eisold when a neurologist or neurosurgeon last examined Mr. Biden.Four leading neurosurgeons interviewed separately in this country and said that as a vice-presidential nominee, Mr. Biden should have had recent brain imaging studies to detect any new aneurysm, because if one is found he might face more and be out of work for weeks or longer.“What would I do in this situation?” said Dr. Eugene S. Flamm, the chairman of the department of neurological surgery at in the . “I would say, get an M.R.A. and check. You can’t just play the statistics.”Doctors caring for political leaders and other prominent people often face difficulty in ordering tests that might clarify a situation for such patients but that are not recommended for all patients.Dr. Parker said, “Some people will say, well, given the high-profile nature of the situation, we should do the test to be sure.” But, he added, “that is not necessarily wise.”Among the reasons is a desire to avoid among patients and because doctors may not know what to do about an equivocal finding.Dr. Parker said that even when he “pressed Dr. Eisold on the very same thing, given the circumstances” with Mr. Biden, Dr. Eisold “was very definitive about” not doing brain scan tests now.The question of an aneurysm aside, the documents show Mr. Biden to have relatively minor health problems, including and . He has an , but a biopsy showed no evidence of cancer. With the help of a statin, he has normal cholesterol levels: 173 (HDL 47 and LDL 98) and triglycerides of 133.All in all, the gaps and paucity of information leave the electorate with insufficient information to fully judge the health of the nominees. The information that has been released is a retreat from the approach that most campaigns took over the last 10 elections.In an earlier time, there was a kind of gentlemen’s agreement between officials and the news media that permitted serious health conditions to be played down or kept secret.was crippled by more than a decade before he became president and, by his fourth term, he had developed serious heart disease, but the public was largely shielded from the profound effects. And while much was made of ’s bad back and the rocking chair that gave him relief, it was only in the years after his assassination that his case of Addison’s disease, a hormonal disorder, became widely known.What might be called the modern era of disclosure arguably began in 1972, when Mr. Eagleton had to step down as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee because he had not informed his running mate, Senator , of his history of depression.In 1992, Mr. Tsongas, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for president, spoke to me to assure the public that he was free of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, after a in 1986. In interviews, his doctors at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute backed his assertion that he was cancer free. But in fact the cancer had recurred, and Mr. Tsongas eventually withdrew from the race. He died two days before his first term would have ended.Other candidates who made themselves and their doctors available include the elder George Bush, , and . A leading example of openness was , whose age, 69, had become an issue in the 1980 election. Mr. Reagan authorized his doctors to be interviewed. He also agreed to an interview himself, against the wishes of his aides, answering all my questions, including what would he do if he became senile as president.'"
"'08-10-20,'1','“They seem to have forgotten that they are there to serve us,” said Benjamin J. Marrison, editor of The Dispatch.That anger spilled into public view in April at a meeting in Washington when the president and chief executive of The A.P., Tom Curley, discussed his plans to cut prices and add new services — and then watched as editor after editor stood to scold him.The A.P. says it is trying to save money for its more than 1,400 member newspapers, and all the changes under way will benefit them. Kathleen Carroll, executive editor of The A.P., said the protests came from a small number of papers and stem from “some element of misunderstanding about what A.P. is trying to do” and frustration over the papers’ finances.“I don’t think any of us can ignore the economic circumstances newspapers are in now,” Ms. Carroll said. “Being the editor of a newspaper in the United States right now is really hard.”Contractually, newspapers must give two years’ notice to drop the service, so those that recently opted out have until 2010 to change their minds. A.P. executives say they suspect that some papers are using that notice as leverage to bargain for lower rates.In addition to the papers that said they would leave the wire, others are considering it, and still others have set up regional cooperatives meant to supplant part of their relationship with The A.P. — a trial run for life after the wire service.Newspapers are going through their most wrenching time since the Depression, with advertising revenue falling about 25 percent over the last two years. But the balance sheet of The A.P., a nonprofit company, is healthy; last year its profit rose 81 percent, to $24 million, on revenue of $710 million, according to a financial statement issued to its members.It remains to be seen whether defections become a major problem for The A.P., the world’s largest news-gathering organization with more than 3,000 journalists in about 100 countries. Without the rich diet of articles, photographs, audio and video it feeds its clients, most American newspapers would be much slimmer and their coverage less expansive.Newspapers banded together 162 years ago to create The Associated Press. Only daily papers in the United States can be members, giving them ownership and a vote in elections for the board. The company has more than 5,000 other domestic clients — broadcasters, Web sites, weekly papers and magazines — and roughly 8,500 abroad.In addition to the news that A.P. reporters produce, the wire also takes breaking news articles from its members and distributes them to other clients.For many members, The A.P. is one of their biggest expenses.“We pay in excess of $1 million a year to The A.P., which is equal to 10 to 12 reporters in the newsroom,” said Nancy Barnes, editor of The Star Tribune.Several editors interviewed for this article said they could find other sources for written material — wire services like Reuters or Bloomberg News, or the news services sold by major newspaper companies. But other A.P. products, especially photography, would be harder to replace, they said.“We thought, ‘We have two years to try and figure this out,’ ” Ms. Barnes said. Her paper is one of the industry’s most troubled; it recently stopped making payments on its debt.This summer, dissatisfied with the way The A.P. handles local news, eight papers in Ohio formed a cooperative to share articles, and some of those papers say they might drop the wire service. Newspapers in Pennsylvania are exploring a similar arrangement.“We’re facing terrible economic challenges, so naturally we’re looking at one of our biggest costs,” said David Shribman, executive editor of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.The editors in Ohio, in particular, say The A.P. has retreated from one of its traditional roles: producing a lot of routine, breaking-news articles.The A.P. wants to make its work more engaging, with more enterprise journalism like features, investigations and analyses — but that is also the direction many papers are going.Mr. Marrison of The Columbus Dispatch said that course had forced newspapers to devote more resources to small stories that used to be covered by The A.P. “Then The A.P. rewrites our story and sends it out,” he said. “So we’re sacrificing our enterprise so that A.P. can do its enterprise? No, no, no. We’re the owners.”Ms. Carroll of The A.P. said it had only “trimmed back on things that weren’t getting much use.”“We’re not trying to absolve ourselves from nuts-and-bolts news, but we cannot survive if we are spending our day doing the mark-up of some legislative measure that is of interest to one part of the state but not another,” she said.The A.P. does not release details about what clients pay, but newspapers’ fees vary based on their circulation and the services they receive. For the last three years, the company has held those fees flat. The A.P. says the fees are partly subsidized by the higher prices it charges to nonmember clients, which account for about three-quarters of its revenue.The A.P. says that a new price structure, set to go into effect in January, will give papers a 10 percent price cut on average. But even that plan caused complaints, leading to multiple revisions since it was first announced last year.Papers object to a requirement that they allow The A.P. to apply its electronic tags to the articles they publish in order for the papers to qualify for the discounted fees.The tags are bits of computer code, invisible to readers, that are intended to make Web pages rank high in Internet searches. While The A.P. says that most member papers have signed up for the tagging program, the largest newspapers, including The New York Times, have developed their own tagging systems and so far have not switched to The A.P.’s.The A.P. recently introduced an ad-supported mobile Internet service, fed by its own work and that of newspapers in the tagging program. To some newspaper executives, the mobile service looks like a bid by The A.P. to make money from their work — and to compete with the papers’ own mobile services.“If you want our content, you should have to come to us for it,” said Ms. Barnes of The Star Tribune.Similarly, some editors and publishers dislike The A.P.’s practice of selling a news service to aggregators like Google and Yahoo; they want their own articles on those sites instead.Jim Kennedy, an A.P. vice president and its director for strategic planning, said that papers should not see The A.P. as a competitor. He said the mobile network would share ad revenue with participating papers — many of which do not have the resources to develop such services — and drive Internet traffic to those papers.“We’re trying to be the portal, linking back to the contributors,” he said. “We know there are members who would rather we didn’t license our content to Google,” he said, “but the money The A.P. gets from that helps defray the costs that members don’t pay.”'"
"'08-10-20,'1','HSBC’s New York presence, which includes every full-page ad in the magazine before the listings section as well as the back cover, extends online as well. The bank will be the sole advertiser on NYMag.com on Monday and Tuesday of this week, with a “significant share of voice” after that. HSBC is also sending e-mail messages to subscribers inviting them to enter a contest to help write the copy for a later ad.Buying most or all of the ads in a magazine — or on a Web site or TV show — has become a popular tactic in recent years as marketers try to stand out in an increasingly cluttered field. Target bought all the ads in an issue of The New Yorker in 2005, and this year ABC bought all the ads in a single issue of TV Guide.The single- or dominating-sponsor approach is attractive to publishers at a time when magazine ad sales are falling. Consumer magazine ad pages fell 12.9 percent in the third quarter of this year, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. New York magazine’s ad pages fell 1.7 percent from 2007 to 2008.Neither HSBC nor New York, which is published by New York Media Holdings, would discuss the cost of the ad package, but according to New York’s rate card, a single full-page ad costs about $64,000, and the back cover is about $81,000, which places the value of HSBC’s buy at about $1.6 million. However, publishers typically give considerable discounts for bulk buying.The New York ad buy is one part of a global campaign from HSBC that began in September called “Different Values.” The effort is centered on print ads that show a single picture of an everyday object repeated three times, each with a single word offering an interpretation of the image. For example, a picture of a baby is shown with the words “love,” “legacy” and “expense.”Such ads are running in Vanity Fair, The Week, GQ, Harper’s and others. Of the 15 such ads in this week’s New York 10 were created specifically for the issue.The campaign also includes a television ad, created as a 90-second spot but shown in 60- and 30-second versions as well, that tells the story of a woman who is arrested in a protest of a logging operation, but is revealed to be romantically involved with a lumberjack. A voiceover says, “We recognize how people value things differently. So what we learn from one customer helps us better serve another.”The ads were created by HSBC’s agency, JWT of New York and London. JWT is part of the WPP Group.Although HSBC has largely been absent from the headlines surrounding the banking industry’s troubles, it is facing challenges of its own. It reported a 29 percent decline in profit for the first six months of 2008, and its stock price has fallen about 30 percent in the last year to about $70 a share.This leads to a third possible interpretation of the New York ad buy: a show of strength.“HSBC is choosing to make a strong statement when there’s a lot of turmoil” among its competitors, Ellen Oppenheim, chief marketing officer for the Magazine Publishers of America, said.'"
"'08-10-20,'1','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — President Bush’s top economic adviser said Sunday that some regions of the United States were struggling with high jobless rates and seemed to be in recession.“We are seeing what anyone would characterize as a recession in some parts of the country,” the adviser, Edward P. Lazear, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN.Unemployment in some areas is “much higher” than the 6.1 percent national level, he said.Mr. Lazear says the administration “has taken the right steps” to thaw out credit markets and get loans flowing to businesses and consumers.Although it will take a few months for the full impact of the Treasury Department’s $700 billion credit market rescue plan to be felt, improvements are already visible, Mr. Lazear said.“Banks are now willing to lend to one another. That’s a huge plus for the economy because the big problem has been that banks have been unwilling to trust one another,” he said.Benchmark credit spreads have shrunk over the last week as new liquidity measures by global central banks and governments have started to take effect. Those spreads have been at unusually high levels, a reflection of risk aversion among banks.Mr. Lazear said the federal budget deficit would grow because of the cost of the bailout, but he declined to say how high.'"
"'08-10-20,'1','Shale.TV, an online news program devoted to covering the extraction of natural gas in Texas, had a juicy story about the walloping that the industry has endured amid the economic crisis.Unfortunately, Shale.TV happened to be part of this troubled industry. Last Monday the company that owned it, Chesapeake Energy of Oklahoma City, canceled the show to cut costs.The program was an unusual attempt by Chesapeake to create its own news product, and the company had hoped to educate people in Fort Worth about the benefits of drilling a mammoth hunk of gas-rich rock below the city known as the Barnett Shale.The show had accumulated several award-winning local journalists before its debut.The price of natural gas, however, has dropped sharply during the economic downturn, and Chesapeake recently announced it would sell some assets. Its chief executive, Aubrey K. McClendon, sold nearly all of his stock this month to meet a margin call.“There is no question that everyone was stunned and everyone was disappointed,” said Olive Talley, a veteran of ABC and NBC who was the executive producer.Some had wondered how the show would make natural gas pipes and industrial equipment watchable.“They had some competent, experienced journalists behind it, but I can’t imagine — other than people directly affected in Fort Worth and nearby areas — that there would be much of an audience at all,” said Ed Bark, a former TV critic who now runs a Web site.'"
"'08-10-20,'1','PLEASANTVILLE, N.Y. — The Knicks eased through their open practice Sunday morning. Inside Pace University’s airy gymnasium, it certainly felt like a day of rest. With two preseason games in the next two nights — against the Nets and the Boston Celtics — they kept the short session light and peppered it with showboating for the 1,200 fans.At one point, Quentin Richardson stepped away from a huddle and hooked in a shot from halfcourt, leading one fan to holler, “Do that in a game!” Halfcourt is probably a little farther from the lane than Coach Mike D’Antoni would like to see his team shooting, but as the Knicks fired with abandon from the perimeter Sunday, it may not be too far off.In his first preseason since moving from the Phoenix Suns, D’Antoni has tried to change the Knicks into a freewheeling, fast-moving, shoot-first team. Though they are clearly a work in progress, the Knicks are slowly showing that they are buying into the new system.Even Zach Randolph explored the outer reaches of his game. A 6-foot-9, 260-pound power forward, Randolph shot almost exclusively from 3-point range Sunday. D’Antoni joked that Pace would have to retire his number.“I think he had more 3-point shots than anybody in the history of Pace,” D’Antoni said. “He was getting into the spirit of an open practice, I guess.”The Knicks’ top draft pick, Danilo Gallinari, was still watching from the sideline, but he received one of the loudest ovations. He struggled with a back injury throughout the summer, but D’Antoni said he was close to returning and could practice in five-on-five play this week. D’Antoni has heard questions about Gallinari’s physical status since the preseason began, so when he was asked about it again, he laughed.“He’s breathing,” D’Antoni said. “We check his pulse every day.”Gallinari grew up in Italy and played the flowing style of European basketball; he said that D’Antoni’s brand of the game was familiar to him. D’Antoni said that once Gallinari was fully fit, he could be a contender, with Wilson Chandler, to start at small forward. But if adapting to the Knicks could come easily to Gallinari, D’Antoni said that adapting to American life was just as important.'"
"'08-10-20,'1','Nevertheless, she said, she was turned down by the producers — not once, but twice. “This was the third time,” she said. “They turned me down twice because I was too old.” ABC confirmed that it passed over Ms. Leachman but not, the network said, because of her age.Ms. Leachman is perhaps having the last laugh, having survived the first four weeks of eliminations to become the surprise of the season. She might be the first 82-year-old to hike her foot above her head on network television — even if it took a little help from her professional ballroom partner, Corky Ballas.That move did not come easily. “I think my back’s sore down low,” she said as she changed clothes, having first wrested a guarantee from a reporter — willfully given — to keep his eyes closed.“I hurt my rib,” she continued. “I have pads in my shoes for my bunion. I have a shot in my knee for my bad knee. I have high blood pressure. Very bad osteoporosis. And asthma. But I’m talking pills for everything so everything is fine.”Still, she is the “Dancing” star who, more than any of her competitors on the show, is hounded to sign autographs and pose for pictures with the largely middle-age, mostly female V.I.P.’s who are allowed backstage.Younger fans of “Dancing” knew less about Ms. Leachman before the current season — beginning with her own dancing partner. When Mr. Ballas met Ms. Leachman, he asked if she had been on the television series “Bewitched.”Ms. Leachman made a more recent impression on the younger generation when she turned in the funniest performance of all on Comedy Central’s roast of Bob Saget. Mr. Saget, who helped introduce the world to the Olsen twins on “Full House,” violated the sitcom and left it for dead in a ditch, Ms. Leachman proclaimed.Mr. Saget, who as a teenager in the San Fernando Valley attended tapings of both “Mary Tyler Moore” and “Phyllis,” said that although Ms. Leachman was not a stand-up comic, “she knew to do what all good comics know, which is to just open the throttle all the way and don’t hold back from the moment you take the stage.”Ms. Leachman professes to not know why she has such support among fans of “Dancing With the Stars,” although clearly her longevity in show business has benefited her over someone like, say, Kim Kardashian, the reality-television and sex-tape star who was voted off three weeks ago.Throughout her career, she explained, “if I were to do some outlandish role, I always made sure I’d be on Johnny Carson to show that I wasn’t that person that I played. I’d be myself. And so people got to know me, I think, and I think they know that I’m honest and truthful and real.“I am from Des Moines, Iowa, not even the city but out in the country,” she added. “I don’t have a lot of trappings, I think, in my personality. I’m just a simple person, with a silly bone.”In a town where most actresses would no sooner admit their age than turn down a chance to walk the red carpet, Ms. Leachman posts her date of birth — April 30, 1926 — on her Web site, cloris.com.Certainly she is an anomaly at a time when, given the ravages of high-definition television, many female stars will not go before a camera without being injected or lifted or receiving some implant.Still, the ravages of a late-blooming ballroom-dance career are beginning to show. She looks tired, perhaps a sign that the two and a half to three hours a day of dance rehearsal — half the time some competitors put in — is wearing on her. In addition, there are the endless publicity demands, including an hour or more giving interviews, like the current one, after both the performance and results episodes of “Dancing With the Stars” each week.Even after all these years in show business, Ms. Leachman said, there are still some things people do not know about her. She is not inclined to reveal them just yet.“They’re in my book,” she promised, which is to be published by Kensington Books. “It’s coming out in the spring. You’ll find out a few things about me.”'"

The strike by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers began on Sept. 6.“We hope this meeting marks a major step forward to resolve this strike, Connie Kelliher, a union spokeswoman, said in a statement to union members. “The union will continue to do everything possible to bargain a contract that addresses the concerns our members have identified.”A Boeing spokesman, Jim Proulx, confirmed that the talks were resuming and said, “We look forward to working with the federal mediator and the I.A.M.” to end the dispute.The union represents about 25,000 electricians, mechanics, painters, riveters and other hourly production workers in and around Seattle; 1,500 in Gresham, Ore.; and 750 in Wichita, Kan. It is the union’s fourth strike against Boeing in less than two decades, after walkouts of 28 days in 2005, 69 days in 1995 and 48 days in 1989.'"
"'08-10-21,'0','As Everett George, a former city correction officer, walked toward his children’s apartment in Harlem on Thanksgiving eve four years ago, he had a definite plan in mind, his lawyer said on Monday.“It was not to kill the children,” said the lawyer, George Goltzer. “It was to kill himself.”But when Mr. George stormed out, he left behind a crime scene so unsettling that police officials were shaken just speaking about it: his 12-year-old autistic son, dead from a bullet to the chest, and his 1-year-old daughter, shot and killed as she sat in a highchair, prosecutors said.Mr. George, 38, who went on trial for murder in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Monday, is using a psychiatric defense. Mr. Goltzer told the jury that his client was “suffering from a serious mental illness” at the time of the killings.But the prosecutor, Maxine Rosenthal, said that Mr. George knew what he was doing when he shot his two children, Dominic and Kristina. In fact, Ms. Rosenthal said, Mr. George told Tishaun Middleton, the mother of the children, that he would trick his doctor into thinking he was crazy. He also tried to kill Ms. Middleton, who had had a troubled relationship with Mr. George, but the gun jammed, the prosecutor said.“The evidence will prove beyond any doubt that this defendant planned this crime,” Ms. Rosenthal said. “This was not a random, sudden, uncontrolled act.”'"
"'08-10-21,'0','It is not that Hispanics are more genetically predisposed to Alzheimer’s, say experts, who say the diversity of ethnicities that make up Hispanics or Latinos make a genetic explanation unlikely.Rather, experts say several factors, many linked to low income or cultural dislocation, may put Hispanics at greater risk for dementia, including higher rates of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, stroke and possibly hypertension.Less education may make Hispanic immigrants more vulnerable to those medical conditions and to dementia because scientists say education may increase the brain’s plasticity or ability to compensate for symptoms. And some researchers cite as risk factors stress from financial hardship or cultural adjustment.The Alzheimer’s Association says that about 200,000 Latinos in the United States have Alzheimer’s, but that, by 2050, based on Census Bureau figures and a study of Alzheimer’s prevalence, the number could reach 1.3 million. (It predicts that the general population of Alzheimer’s patients will grow to 16 million by 2050, from 5 million now.)“We are concerned that the Latino population may have the highest amount of risk factors and prevalence, in comparison to the other cultures,” said Maria Carrillo, the group’s director of medical and scientific relations.In response, Alzheimer’s and Hispanic organizations have started health fairs and support groups. Some Alzheimer’s centers have opened clinics in Latino neighborhoods.“There’s some taboos” about Alzheimer’s, said Liany Arroyo, director of the Institute for Hispanic Health at the National Council of La Raza, which surveyed Latinos. “Folks did not necessarily understand what it was.”Antonia Lopez, who immigrated from Panama to Boston, showed symptoms at about 60, but it was 10 years before the family acknowledged it was Alzheimer’s, said her daughter, Carol Franklin.“My mom was telling people, in her confusion, that I spanked her,” she said. “My brother believed that. He said to me at one point, ‘Don’t say that my mom has Alzheimer’s, because I believe it’s just part of being old.’ ”Overwhelmingly, Hispanics with Alzheimer’s live with multigenerational families instead of in nursing homes. That support can be beneficial, experts say, but it severely stresses families.When Maria Contreras, a Salvadoran immigrant, began wandering and hallucinating, her daughter, Teresa Navas, took her into her home in Silver Spring, Md. The strain on Ms. Navas and her children compelled her to place her mother in a nursing home, but when she kept getting sick, Ms. Navas took her home again and quit her job teaching Spanish.“I have to be with her all the time,” she said. “Sometimes she doesn’t even know who I am.”Mr. Vasquez’s daughter, Ana, 39, moved her parents to her Philadelphia home. She works at a neighborhood grocery and tells her sons, 6 and 11, “Watch out for your grandfather.”Once, Mr. Vasquez was found hitchhiking on a major Philadelphia street. On a visit to the Bronx neighborhood where he had lived, he wandered away, leaving his family frenetically searching subway stations. “I was desperate, crying, especially when the night was coming,” said his wife, also named Ana.Nine hours later, he appeared on their Philadelphia porch, having happened upon a bus to Philadelphia and given the driver a card with their address.Scientists are searching for what sets Latinos apart. Dr. Rafael A. Lantigua, a professor of clinical medicine at Columbia University Medical School, said, “There’s no gene at this point that we can say this is just for Latinos.” Dr. Lantigua added that one gene that increased Alzheimer’s risk was less prevalent in Latinos than non-Hispanic whites.Kala M. Mehta, an assistant professor in the geriatrics division at the University of California, San Francisco, analyzed autopsies from 3,000 Alzheimer’s patients, finding “similar neuropathology” among Latinos, whites and African-Americans.And Mary Sano, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, found that different ethnic groups shared the most common behavioral symptoms, like repeating sentences and uncooperativeness.But researchers say they have seen disparities in the timing of the illness and its severity when diagnosed.Dr. Steven E. Arnold, director of the Penn Memory Center at the University of Pennsylvania, studied 2,000 white, African-American and Latino Alzheimer’s patients.Dr. Arnold found that the Latinos, mostly low-income, poorly educated Puerto Ricans, many with diabetes, “have more depression,” and their scores on tests in Spanish measuring dementia averaged about 15 percent lower than African-Americans and about 30 percent lower than non-Hispanic whites. Latinos were on average about three-and-a-half years younger than non-Hispanic whites and about five years younger than African-Americans, he said.Dr. Christopher M. Clark, director of the Center of Excellence for Research on Neurodegenerative Diseases at the University of Pennsylvania, studied the age at which 174 Alzheimer’s patients in California, New York and Pennsylvania first showed symptoms and found Spanish speakers were on average 6.8 years younger (about 67) than non-Hispanic whites, regardless of whether they were Mexican, Caribbean or South American. That Latinos are on average younger than other Americans accounted for a small part of the gap, but not most of it, Dr. Clark said.Research is scant on the age of onset in Latinos remaining in their native homes, but Dr. Clark said patients in two clinics in Mexico and Puerto Rico did not show symptoms early.Mary N. Haan, a University of Michigan epidemiologist heading the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging, studied 1,800 Mexican-Americans over 10 years and found greater likelihood of Alzheimer’s for those more “acculturated” to American society, based on a number of factors, including diet and social networks. Dr. Haan attributed that to higher stress from being “relatively poorer off” and “more socially isolated.”Dr. Cruz, of the National Hispanic Council on Aging, said, “As you acculturate, you lose those protective factors linked to nutrition, physical activity, social support system, that come with you when you first arrive here.”Dr. Haan found more acculturated people more prone to diabetes, and people with diabetes or obesity more likely to have Alzheimer’s. Researchers theorize that high insulin levels and poor cerebral blood flow can cause brain changes that accompany Alzheimer’s, said Dr. Jose A. Luchsinger, associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center.Dr. Cruz said many Alzheimer’s risk factors “have to do with poor education,” which aggravates nutrition, financial status and health care.Mrs. Mojica, from Puerto Rico, with five years of schooling, developed diabetes and hypertension after a hard life in a rundown row house, where she and her husband care for their 39-year-old mentally retarded son.Not all Hispanics have medical or sociological risk factors.Ida Lawrence, whose Alzheimer’s has made her hide money in socks and shower obsessively, attended high school in Honduras, learning English. Her husband, Robert, said he thought her dementia might be inherited, adding, “She’s been healthy except for the fact that she was coming down with this Alzheimer’s thing.”Mr. Lawrence, who has prostate cancer, struggles to care for his wife, still only 63. “Everybody says to me, ‘Bob it’s going to get worse,’ ” he said.Ms. Franklin finally moved her mother, Ms. Lopez, to a nursing home, where she cries and “doesn’t want nobody to touch her,” she said.“It hurts me so much to see her like that,” Ms. Franklin said. “It’s like I can see her on one side of the mountain and say, that’s not my mom.”'"
"'08-10-21,'0','Like the chief executives on Wall Street, leaders of collegiate athletic programs must acknowledge that the boom days of fund-raising have given way to belt-tightening.“Adjustments have to take place and look bleak in the short term,” said Joe Castiglione, ’s athletic director.In 2006-7, for example, the nation’s largest athletics departments and booster clubs raised more than $1.2 billion, according to a survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Some programs have more than tripled their annual gifts over the past 10 years. From 2002 to 2007, colleges in the six Bowl Championship Series conferences raised more than $3.9 billion through capital campaigns for new facilities, according to the survey.Last May, McClendon and his wife, Kathleen, pledged $7 million to build a boathouse on the Oklahoma River for the women’s rowing team and a housing facility near Memorial Stadium. Castiglione said he had spoken with McClendon, but he declined to say whether McClendon had given Oklahoma the money or intended to. Through a spokesman, McClendon declined to comment.“It makes us concerned for everybody,” Castiglione said. “It’s something that we have to watch for everybody, because it’s hitting people in ways they could have never predicted.”Even the , which has the nation’s top-ranked football team, is bracing for a downturn despite raising $35 million last year through annual giving, suites and premium seating. It also has a $29 million athletic endowment.DeLoss Dodds, the university’s longtime athletic director, recalled the perilous times that followed the 1987 stock-market crash.“We worked with people,” he said. “We absolutely worked with them on whatever commitments they were making or had been making.“When things go bad and things get tough, people have to do realistic things, and we help them do that.”It is perhaps never as bad in than it is in the rest of the country, because love for the Longhorns runs deep and backing them conveys a tremendous status. So Dodds said he was in no hurry to call in the commitments currently on the books, and he had a pretty good idea of how the penny-pinching would play out.“We’ll probably see it first in baseball, maybe, and then maybe in basketball,” he said. “We’ve lost a couple of suite holders in basketball, and I think the economy is part of the reason there. I think people will hold on to their football stuff as long as they can.”Beyond patience, the ensuing months and years will also require diplomacy from athletic fund-raisers as they soothe the bruised egos of deep-pocketed donors, many of them who are enduring public embarrassment.Not all of the nation’s major boosters have the financial wherewithal or the élan of Pickens, whose book, “The First Billion is the Hardest,” is a national best seller.His spokesman, Jay Rosser, said Pickens had so far given more than $700 million to a variety of causes in the past five years.“He looks forward to having a party to celebrate giving away $1 billion,” Rosser said. “Unfortunately, the economic downturn has hit everyone hard, and Boone hasn’t been immune. The chance of a party this year is next to none.“Hopefully, the markets will improve soon and Boone can get back to the business of giving serious money. Boone likes making money, and he likes to give it away.”Kivisto, a former basketball star for , was removed as the chief executive of SemGroup in July and put on leave. Last week, , the former F.B.I director, was appointed by a bankruptcy court to sort out how the company lost $2.4 billion on the and to look into allegations that Kivisto’s personal trading company in the oil futures market incurred $290 million of the losses.It is unclear, however, if Kivisto has made good on the $12 million commitment to Kansas athletics. In 2006, the athletic department acknowledged that Kivisto had contributed $4 million and committed an additional $8 million to a new football complex.It coincided with an announcement that the field inside Memorial Stadium would be renamed in his honor.Lew Perkins, director of athletics at Kansas, said it was his policy not to publicly discuss the specifics about donors or donations.“I will say that Tom has been a friend of this university for a long time,” he said. “He has done everything for us and beyond.”Ultimately, however, it takes trust and toughness on the part of the benefactor and the athletic department to weather tight times. In the case of Oklahoma State and T. Boone Pickens, a sense of humor helps.“Sure you’re concerned about your investments, but I like the person we’re investing with,” Holder said. “I guess the good news is he had a billion dollars to lose.”'"
"'08-10-21,'0','Devils center Bobby Holik will be sidelined three to four weeks with a broken pinkie.Holik was injured Saturday night in Washington and was scheduled to have surgery on Tuesday, General Manager Lou Lamoriello said.The Devils recalled left wing Pierre-Luc Letourneau-Leblond from Lowell of the American Hockey League to take Holik’s roster spot. Letourneau-Leblond is expected to play Wednesday against Dallas, skating on a line with Mike Rupp and David Clarkson. The Devils have won four of their first five games and trail only the Rangers (6-2-1) in the Atlantic Division.“The guys that are playing just have to do the job for you,” Devils Coach Brent Sutter said. “You go through it at different points in the year. Every team does. The teams that handle it the right way and deal with it the right way are always the ones that seem to get through it the best.”Letourneau-Leblond is the third rookie to see ice time for the Devils this season, joining defenseman Anssi Salmela and Petr Vrana. Vrana scored Saturday, becoming the 13th player in team history to score in his first N.H.L. game. Vrana got into the lineup after Brian Rolston sprained his ankle in Atlanta on Thursday.PENGUINS 2, BRUINS 1 Evgeni Malkin scored in the second extra round of the shootout as Pittsburgh won in Boston’s home opener.

"'08-10-21,'0','“For a Republican to be tied at this point in the election in North Carolina is unfathomable,” said Hunter Bacot, a political scientist at Elon University, which Gov. Sarah Palin, Mr. McCain’s running mate, visited last week.No Democratic presidential candidate has won North Carolina since Jimmy Carter did so in 1976. The state has long been a bastion of cultural conservatism; it was in Greensboro last week that Ms. Palin said she loved visiting the “pro-America” parts of the country.But this is a new landscape, even from four years ago, when President Bush defeated Senator John Kerry (and his running mate, John Edwards, of North Carolina) by 12 percentage points in the state.The turnabout can be traced to an influx of new voters and a change in demographics; a slowing of the state’s economy and the collapse of the nation’s financial system; Mr. Obama’s extensive ground organization, huge financial advantage and amount spent on television (seven to one over Mr. McCain); the state’s large population of blacks and students; and Mr. McCain’s neglect of the state.The relative position of the candidates was evident in their visits to the state last weekend.Mr. McCain spoke to a few thousand people in Concord, in Cabarrus County, which is an exurb of Charlotte and which voted lopsidedly in 2004 for Mr. Bush (67 percent to 33 percent). On a sunny Saturday morning, Mr. McCain’s audience seemed made up mainly of his base. They cheered loudly when he mentioned Ms. Palin and “Joe the Plumber,” the Ohio man who has become a symbol of Mr. McCain’s newly fashioned economic message, that Mr. Obama’s statement about wanting to “spread the wealth around” revealed him to be a socialist.Mr. McCain had spoken briefly the week before in Wilmington (also Bush country), but until then he had not visited the state since the May primaries. His plea was blunt: “We have to win the state of North Carolina, and I’m counting on you to do it.”On Sunday, in a fortuitous bit of timing, Mr. Obama spoke in Fayetteville, dense with military families, in his first appearance after being endorsed by former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.Mr. Obama’s visit to the area, which voted marginally for Mr. Bush in 2004, was his sixth trip to the state since the primaries, and he was reaching beyond his base.“The men and women from Fayetteville and all across America who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag,” Mr. Obama said.The state is one of the fastest-growing in the country, becoming home to more immigrants as well as transplants from other states who tend to be more moderate than the natives. This means both a less conservative electorate and a labor force that is growing faster than the supply of jobs.“Somewhere, former conservative icon Senator Jesse Helms must be turning over in his grave at the prospect of Obama winning North Carolina’s 15 electoral votes,” James Bennett, the managing editor of the local newspaper, The Independent Tribune, wrote after Mr. McCain’s visit. “The Republican stronghold that elected Helms to five terms in the Senate no longer exists.”Social conservatives were never thrilled with Mr. McCain in the first place; analysts say that Ms. Palin initially gave him a boost here, but now she does not appear to be drawing support from beyond the base.Polls show that the economy is by far the most important issue for voters.Tom Jensen, a Democratic pollster in Raleigh, said the McCain camp was “counting on the conservative view prevailing over the economy, which is why they haven’t spent any money here, which is why it’s gotten as difficult for them as it has.”Parts of the state, especially around the affluent Research Triangle Park area, show strong economic growth. But others are still suffering from a decline in textiles and furniture making. The state’s unemployment rate hit 7 percent in September, its highest level in six years.Even the state’s banking industry is on edge. The recent merger of Wachovia, based in Charlotte, with Wells Fargo has created great uncertainty, with possible layoffs in the offing.“The Bush years have been very tough on North Carolina, especially the trade policies,” said Marc Farinella, Mr. Obama’s state director here. “And that’s why this race has become so competitive.”As the economy has slowed, the Obama campaign has also stuck to its game plan, building a corps of 17,000 volunteers, registering voters and now focusing on getting them out to vote.While Mr. McCain was speaking at the arena in Concord, a small Obama field office a few miles away bustled with volunteers. They made hundreds of phone calls; others picked up computerized voter lists to canvass; others enter information collected during the day to give up-to-date print-outs to canvassers the next day.The fruits of their labors are beginning to show. The state registered 600,000 new voters this year, 48 percent of them Democrats, 21 percent Republicans, the rest unaffiliated. In early voting, which began Thursday, more than 114,000 people had gone to the polls — 64 percent of them Democrats, 21 percent Republicans and 15 percent unaffiliated.Among the early voters in Greensboro on Friday was Maria Adams, 46, who owns an employment agency. She stayed in line even after being told she would have to wait an hour and a half. “It’s worth it,” she said. “McCain is too hardline and too old and too erratic. He’s out of touch with what matters today, which is the economy.”Mike Duhaime, the national political director for the McCain campaign, said he still felt confident of winning North Carolina. Democrats who win statewide offices are “more centrist” than Mr. Obama, Mr. Duhaime said.Representative Robin Hayes, a Republican who represents this area and is facing a tough re-election fight, said North Carolina was “closer than they want it to be,” and for all of the time and money that Mr. Obama has invested here, “he still can’t close the deal.”“There are significant doubts in people’s minds,” Mr. Hayes said. And indeed, several voters expressed such doubts, picking up on messages put out in McCain campaign robocalls and through false Internet rumors about Mr. Obama’s background and affiliations.Mr. Hayes spoke to the crowd in the arena before Mr. McCain took the stage, and drew on the local pastime to offer encouragement. “If you’re a Nascar fan, and I’m sure you are,” he said, “all you got to win is the last lap.”'"
"'08-10-21,'0','Two former Border Patrol agents who investigators suspect committed some of the more brazen acts of smuggling-related corruption at the border in recent years have been arrested and jailed in Mexico, the United States authorities said Monday.The men, Fidel and Raul Villarreal, who are brothers, were arrested Saturday at a gated apartment complex near the United States Consulate in Tijuana, Michael Unzueta, the agent in charge of the San Diego office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Monday.The Villarreals, along with two other people believed to be involved in the case, were taken to a prison in Mexico City. United States prosecutors were making arrangements for their return to San Diego to face smuggling charges.The arrest is a significant break for investigators, who since 2006 have been looking into accusations that the Villarreals, who fled the country as investigators closed in, were involved in smuggling dozens of illegal immigrants, mostly Mexicans and Brazilians, while on duty and with Border Patrol vehicles.“It was frustrating to see them flee the jurisdiction of the United States,” Agent Unzueta said. “But our perseverance paid off.”The case, among a rash of corruption accusations involving border police agencies in recent years, was all the more striking because Raul Villarreal often appeared on television as a spokesman for the San Diego division of the agency.'"
"'08-10-21,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, publicly apologized Monday for “an error of judgment” in an affair with a subordinate, but he denied that he had abused his position.In an e-mail message sent to staff members after he met with the monetary fund’s board, Mr. Strauss-Kahn apologized to fund employees; to Piroska Nagy, the woman he had the affair with; and to his wife, Anne Sinclair, a high-profile French television interviewer, for the trouble his actions had caused.Monetary fund officials said Mr. Strauss-Kahn had not resigned.The scandal has emerged as the I.M.F. is dealing with the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.It follows the resignation of the president of the World Bank, Paul D. Wolfowitz, who was forced to quit 16 months ago amid a staff uproar over a high-paying promotion he authorized for his companion.The monetary fund’s board of 24 member countries has ordered an investigation by an outside law firm into whether Mr. Strauss-Kahn gave preferential treatment to Ms. Nagy, a senior economist, before she took a general staff buyout offer in August.She is now working for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London.“I apologized and said that I very much regret this incident,” Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister, said in the e-mail message. “Second, while this incident constituted an error of judgment on my part, for which I take full responsibility, I firmly believe that I have not abused my position,” he said.'"
"'08-10-21,'0','Mr. Bush’s aides insist that the president’s desire is still to close Guantánamo when conditions permit, and the White House has not announced any decision. But administration officials say that even Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the most powerful advocates for closing the prison, have quietly acquiesced to the arguments of more hawkish advisers, including Vice President Dick Cheney.A senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration’s internal deliberations said it would be much harder to fulfill a campaign promise to close the prison than either candidate has stated. “This may not be the ideal answer, but what we are trying to do is work with the system we’ve got,” the official said.Mr. Bush’s decision followed a review of the implications of the Supreme Court’s ruling in June that the 250 detainees at Guantánamo have the right to make habeas corpus appeals.The ruling, Boumediene v. Bush, undercut a core rationale for keeping the prison off American soil, raising expectations that Mr. Bush might at last move to close it, a prospect he first raised in June 2006, when he said, “I’d like to close Guantánamo, but I also recognize that we’re holding some people that are darn dangerous, and that we better have a plan to deal with them in our courts.”In August 2007, Mr. Bush said “it should be a goal of the nation to shut down Guantánamo,” adding, “But it is not as easy a subject as some may think on the surface.”Mr. Bush has harshly criticized the ruling, including at least twice in fund-raising speeches for Republicans. When he met with his senior security advisers, no options for closing the prison were on the agenda, the administration officials said.“This is an administration that believes very, very strongly in certain things it has done,” said Matthew Waxman, a professor at Columbia Law School who served in the Department of Defense overseeing detainee polices, “and Guantánamo is one that some administration officials at high levels believe was right all along.”Mr. Cheney and his chief of staff, David S. Addington, have made it clear in the internal discussions this year that keeping Guantánamo open under a new president would validate the administration’s decisions dealing with terrorists, the officials said.Closing Guantánamo would most likely mean abandoning prosecutions against some detainees and risking the release of others who still pose a threat to the United States and its allies.An administration official who favors closing the prison suggested that the next president might reconsider after having access to the classified evidence that the Bush administration believes justifies the indefinite detention of dozens of detainees.“The new president will gnash his teeth and beat his head against the wall when he realizes how complicated it is to close Guantánamo,” the official said.Mr. McCain has suggested moving the detainees to Fort Leavenworth, Kan., home of the Army’s prison. His remarks prompted a letter in June from the two Republican senators from Kansas, Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts, objecting to the idea on a variety of grounds.Mr. McCain’s campaign did not respond to requests for comments about Guantánamo. The Obama campaign declined to comment specifically, but in his platform, Mr. Obama promises to abolish military tribunals and conduct a review to determine which prisoners to prosecute, which to hold under the laws of war and which to release. His proposal does not specify where detainees would be held.Other sites that have been mentioned include the United States Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston, S.C., and the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility, known as supermax, in Florence, Colo.Beyond political opposition in those regions, the officials involved in the administration’s discussions said that bringing the detainees to American soil would allow additional legal challenges beyond habeas corpus and raise the prospect that judges could free them in the United States.The prospect of that became more acute on Oct. 7, when a federal judge ordered the release of 17 Uighurs from China who were swept up in 2002 and held in Guantánamo. The administration had already dropped efforts to declare the men as enemy combatants, but refused to return them to China because of concerns about the treatment they would receive there, trying unsuccessfully to find a third country to accept them.The judge, Ricardo M. Urbina of Federal District Court, ordered the detainees brought to his court in Washington to free them, but the Justice Department appealed and won a stay.One official said that the Justice Department’s arguments — that the 17 men remained dangerous — complicated diplomatic efforts to find a country other than China willing to accept them.The government’s lawyers filed the arguments for a continued stay on Thursday, and on Monday a federal appeals court refused to allow the Uighurs’ immediate release into the United States to give it time to hear the government’s full appeal.Since the Supreme Court decision in June, Mr. Bush and his aides have remained focused on legal strategies for coping with the wave of habeas corpus appeals now flooding the federal court system and seeking new legislation that would allow the government to continue to hold foreign terrorists without charge.A version of that legislation was introduced by Senators Lindsay Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, two of Mr. McCain’s closest friends and advisers. But the legislation stalled and appears unlikely to be adopted during the current session of Congress.The senior administration official involved in the deliberations said that the Supreme Court’s ruling did not grant judges the authority to release detainees in the United States, comparing it to allowing an illegal immigrant to live in the country legally without legal standing.That official and others said that officials from the Department of Homeland Security, along with the Justice Department, have argued most vigorously for keeping Guantánamo open, largely because a ruling like the Uighur case could result in foreign fighters being freed into American communities.“The federal courts have an absolute right to release these people, but the court didn’t say where, and what does that mean, to release them,” the senior official said.“And in our view, the Supreme Court didn’t say, and the district courts don’t have the power, to order the United States to bring somebody from a foreign country — a foreigner — into the United States in complete disregard for our immigration law.”Advocates for closing Guantánamo argued that Mr. Bush is still following the same flawed logic that has made it a reviled symbol, especially abroad.Mr. Waxman, the former defense official, acknowledged the difficulties of closing the prison and the risks involved, but he argued that after seven years, a radical change was required.“Whatever consequence they’re worried about,” he said of the administration’s concerns, “has to be weighed against the damage we continue to incur by keeping the status quo.”'"
"'08-10-21,'0','ON Oct. 13, the chief executives of nine large American banks were called to a meeting at the Treasury Department. At the meeting, Secretary Henry Paulson offered them $125 billion from the federal government in exchange for shares of preferred stock. The chief executives accepted his terms. In some accounts of the meeting, Secretary Paulson is described as playing the role of the Godfather, making the banks an offer they could not refuse. But in one important respect, he was more Santa Claus than Vito Corleone: the agreement allowed the banks to continue paying dividends to common shareholders.Although there are many things to like about the government’s plan, the failure to suspend dividends is not one of them. These dividends, if they are paid at current levels, will redirect more than $25 billion of the $125 billion to shareholders in the next year alone. Taxpayers have been told that their money is required because of an urgent need to rebuild bank capital, yet a significant fraction of this money will wind up in shareholders’ pockets — and thus be unavailable to plug the large capital hole on the banks’ balance sheets.Moreover, given their own equity stakes, the officers and directors of the nine banks will be among the leading beneficiaries of the dividend payout. We estimate that their personal take of the dividends will amount to approximately $250 million in the first year.Bank executives may argue that it is necessary for them to maintain dividend payments to support their stock prices and to make further capital-raising possible. This argument is dubious. In recent years, the fraction of American public companies that pay dividends has fallen drastically, to a level of around 20 percent. The ranks of the companies that do not pay dividends include some of the most profitable and (until recently) best-performing market darlings, like Google.These companies have come to recognize what finance academics have been preaching for decades: for financially healthy firms, there is no particular imperative to pay dividends every quarter, because retained cash can always be paid out to shareholders later, or used to repurchase stock.So why would the banks want to maintain large dividend payouts when they’ve had such a hard time borrowing, are starved of cash, and the credit markets believe that they run a significant risk of defaulting? Shouldn’t these distressed banks be marshalling all of the financial resources available to them to ensure their viability?'"
"'08-10-21,'0','Treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. says taxpayers have nothing to fear from the government’s injection of $125 billion of their money into nine American banks. It is, in Mr. Paulson’s words, “an investment, not an expenditure.” Run the numbers to see what it would take for Uncle Sam to get his money back — plus a modest bonus for his troubles — and it looks as if Mr. Paulson may be right.In return for its cash, the Treasury gets preferred stock that pays 5 percent annual dividends. On the first $125 billion, that’s $6.25 billion a year, or $31.25 billion over five years, at which point the dividends increase to 9 percent. Since the banks will endeavor to pay off the preferred stock before then, the Treasury can probably finance its investment by selling five-year bonds, which on Monday yielded 2.85 percent.The difference between the Treasury’s cost and the yield on the preferred shares adds up to a profit of $13.4 billion over five years. So far, that supports Mr. Paulson’s assertion that “there is no reason to expect this program will cost taxpayers anything.”But there is more. The government is also receiving warrants, which are essentially options, worth 15 percent of the face value of the preferred stock, or some $18.75 billion thus far. If the banks’ shares don’t budge, these could end up being worth nothing. But if one assumes the shares will double during the 10-year term of the warrants — hardly an unreasonable hope, since that would return stocks to their level of a year ago — the Treasury’s warrants, at the time of its investments in the banks, would be worth $9.4 billion right away.All told, the Treasury should reap about $23 billion over five years for shoring up the first nine banks. That’s an 18 percent return. Of course, a single bank collapse, particularly one the size of Citigroup, would quickly turn those returns negative. And when annualized, that return can’t hold a candle to the performance expected of hedge funds or private equity firms. But at least it gives taxpayers something back — a benchmark for the deployment of other government funds.'"
"'08-10-21,'0','As voters have gotten to know Senator Barack Obama, they have warmed up to him, with more than half, 53 percent, now saying they have a favorable impression of him and 33 percent saying they have an unfavorable view. But as voters have gotten to know Senator John McCain, they have not warmed, with only 36 percent of voters saying they view him favorably while 45 percent view him unfavorably.Even voters who are planning to vote for Mr. McCain say their enthusiasm has waned. In New York Times and CBS News polls conducted with the same respondents before the first presidential debate and again after the last debate, Mr. McCain made no progress in appealing to voters on a personal level, and he and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, had alienated some voters.Personal appeal is an intangible element in voters’ decisions. Each voter has a personal reason for connecting with a candidate or not. But the percentage of those who hold a favorable opinion of Mr. Obama is up 10 points since last month. Opinion of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Obama’s running mate, is also up, to 50 percent last weekend from 36 percent in September.In contrast, favorable opinion of Mr. McCain remained stable, and unfavorable opinion rose to 45 percent now from 35 percent in September. Mrs. Palin’s negatives are up, to 41 percent now from 29 percent in September.Mr. Obama’s favorability is the highest for a presidential candidate running for a first term in the last 28 years of Times/CBS polls. Mrs. Palin’s negative rating is the highest for a vice-presidential candidate as measured by The Times and CBS News. Even Dan Quayle, with whom Mrs. Palin is often compared because of her age and inexperience on the national scene, was not viewed as negatively in the 1988 campaign.The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Sept. 21-24, with re-interviews completed Friday through Sunday of 518 adults, 476 of whom are registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus five percentage points for all adults and voters.'"
"'08-10-21,'0','Audrey Hurren, 65, a retired secretary who was waiting for the subway in central London the other day, said that it had all been too much.“I think it wouldn’t do any harm at all for some of the younger generation to be less greedy,” she said. “It’s not a very nice thing to say, but maybe they could behave a little more sensibly.”Mrs. Hurren was raised just after World War II believing that if you couldn’t afford it, you didn’t buy it. By contrast, she said, her granddaughters have more than she ever dreamed of, and are still dissatisfied. “They don’t appreciate anything,” she said. “It’s easy come, easy go. They get a mobile phone; if they don’t like it, they throw it away and get a new one.”In an interview, Mr. Tapp said people in their 30s and younger, too young to have experienced the last recession, in the early 1990s, had grown up in a world “where credit has always been cheap and easy and available.” For them, there is no precedent for frugality. The austerity of the late 1940s and early 1950s, and the privations of the 1970s — when electricity was briefly rationed and the country put on a three-day work week to save fuel — are stories to read about in books.“The idea of saving up for what you buy, that’s what you did when there weren’t any credit cards,” Mr. Tapp said.In the boom years, the so-called soft sections of London newspapers grew fat on articles about ever more expensive goods and services geared toward the conspicuously consuming masses. But suddenly, even the papers are talking as if they have woken up with a jolt after a long drug-and-sugar binge.“I am happy to observe that the decades of vulgar excess are finally over,” the columnist India Knight wrote in The Times of London. “There is a strong collective sense of us all coming back down to earth. It’s like a huge national reality check and, unwelcome as it may be, there is a possibility that it will result in us straightening out our priorities.”The Times recently featured an article about how to make old clothes fashionable by, for instance, cutting the sleeves off coats (and wearing the coats over long-sleeved sweaters). Another article, in The Sunday Times, offered tips on “Fifty Ways to be a Recessionista.” A working mother told The Sunday Telegraph, “I feel slightly sick at our decadence.”The author David Kynaston, whose book “Austerity Britain: 1945- 1951” discusses the difficulties of the post-World War II period, said that until the mid-1980s — the Thatcher era — Britain was “careful, cautious, understated, naturally socially conservative.” But, he added in an interview: “In the 1980s, there was essentially a psychic shift in how to use money. What went out the window was the old Puritan self-consciousness, even a sense of guilt, about money.”After the recession in the early 1990s, everything changed even faster. Spending was glorified; so was borrowing. Banks began offering mortgages with no down payments. People got used to more expensive things.Organic food was presented as a necessity for good health; supermarkets emphasized “luxury” ranges of foods. Britons abandoned traditional seashore vacations and began flying to the Continent, ate at trendy new restaurants, went crazy with new gadgets. In a recent book, the psychiatrist Oliver James complained that the country was suffering from “affluenza.”All of that feels expendable now, said Allison Burton, a 31-year-old hairdresser. She mentioned a friend whose husband had just lost his job. “She wrote down what their outgoings were, and managed to save herself a grand a month,” Ms. Burton said, by doing things like switching to a less expensive cable-channel package.Stores are now marketing themselves on the basis of value rather than quality or exclusivity. Supermarkets have unveiled new no-frills foods and pledged to match their rivals’ low prices. Upmarket Tesco has refashioned itself as “Britain’s biggest discounter.”Lindie Parry, a 25-year-old transportation project manager walking down Victoria Street with her husband, James Bain, 40, said she had begun shopping at less expensive supermarkets. Mr. Bain said that people were remembering that they could often get free coffee at work (not as good as Starbucks, but coffee nonetheless), and that bringing lunch from home was cheaper than buying it in a shop.“It was great while it lasted,” Ms. Parry said of the boom time, “but nothing lasts forever.”'"
"'08-10-21,'0','“If you find diseases before they’ve really emerged,” he continued, “you can control them early on, before you get a major epidemic.”That pre-emptive-strike approach to epidemic management, he said, is what makes chasing the Cameroonian hunters so crucial.When he can persuade the hunters, whom he calls “sentinels,” to supply him with blood samples, he can form a better idea of which new animal diseases they are exposed to — and, by extension, which emerging viruses could pose the biggest threat to humans.Since he began his hunter studies, he has come across several viruses never before seen in humans, including retroviruses from the same family as H.I.V.“With epidemics, people have been standing on the shore, waiting for the gusher to hit the ocean,” Dr. Wolfe said, referring to the tidal-wave impact a widespread epidemic could have around the world. “But to prevent epidemics, you have to look at the various little sources that feed into the river.""With the goal of identifying more of these “little sources” — new disease-causing pathogens — and choking them off, Dr. Wolfe started the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative this year. If new disease strains could be culled before they had a chance to take hold in humans, he reasoned, health organizations would have to spend less money and energy on developing expensive vaccines and treatment drugs.Google’s philanthropic arm, Google.org, is announcing Tuesday that it will contribute $5.5 million to the initiative; that is being matched by $5.5 million from the Skoll Foundation, which supports the work of social entrepreneurs.“Nathan is going to be a rock star in this field,” said Frank Rijsberman, a Google.org program director. “We have high hopes he’ll discover 5 to 10 new viruses within the next few years.”While outsiders and colleagues alike have endorsed Dr. Wolfe’s forecasting tactics, putting them into practice is a tall order. After his team arrives in a rural Cameroonian village on a rickety bus, its first task is to convince local populations that the research poses no threat to their way of life.“People can’t always see a connection between diseases and wild animals,” said Matthew LeBreton, a research coordinator who designs field education programs for the villagers. “And they sometimes think that we’re going to have their meat confiscated. If someone talks to them about bushmeat, that’s what they’re going to hear.”Once rapport is established, the data collection can begin. Technicians supply the hunters with bits of filter paper, which they use to absorb blood dripping from their prey. At the same time, scientists take blood samples from the hunters themselves. All of the samples are tested for unfamiliar viruses.“The main things we look for are: Does a particular virus cause disease, and is it transmissible?” Dr. Wolfe said. “We know there are certain types of viruses that are nasty — influenza, for instance, is an area that is not a blindside. But a lot of viruses have come out of nowhere, like H.I.V., or to a certain extent SARS. Because we know we have the potential to be blindsided, we really have to investigate the unknowns.”To map the emergence of novel viruses, Dr. Wolfe and his colleagues in the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative — more than 100 scientists in nine countries — have begun following other sentinel populations, like people who receive frequent blood transfusions. They have recently expanded their investigations of viruses that cross the animal-human barrier, conducting research in field locations in China, Madagascar, Malaysia and Paraguay.Thanks to new techniques for sequencing DNA in the viruses they find, epidemiologists can quickly identify the most virulent new pathogens — the ones that have high mutation rates or lend themselves to recombination, in which strands of DNA are broken and then joined to other genetic material. A new variant of influenza, for instance, could be dangerous, but it could cause epidemics only if it were genetically capable of staying one step ahead of the immune system’s defenses.Tracking the viral mix in a given population over time is also critical, said Forest Rohwer, a microbiologist at San Diego State University who works with Dr. Wolfe.“Imagine you’re doing routine monitoring of an area,” Dr. Rohwer said. “If you take 100 different blood samples a day to look at the viruses in those 100 samples, and at some point you see a shift away from what you normally see in that system, then you can say, ‘O.K., there’s something wrong here; let’s look at it in depth.’ ”Once a harmful virus has been located, the next step is to determine how quickly it can spread. Dr. Wolfe’s colleagues and other scientists have developed computer simulations that can be customized to take account of population size and density, family size and transportation patterns.“You create a population of individuals and then make the rules for how they move around based on your data,” said Dr. Donald S. Burke, dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of Public Health, who helped create some of these simulations. “It’s like SimEpi.”The simulation then predicts how a virus with a given set of transmissibility properties will thrive in a particular environment. Once Dr. Wolfe and his colleagues isolate a new virus or variant that seems to be spreading in a small area, they can zero in on its primary characteristics — the likelihood that a sick person will infect someone else, for instance — and feed the data into the simulation to generate an idea of how the virus could spread.The results offer a rough but valuable estimate of how and where a nascent epidemic could take hold. So far, simulations show that for all but the most virulent new pathogens, there is “a reasonable combination of policy options well within the range of the health authorities that, if prepared in advance and implemented quickly, could stop a global disaster,” Dr. Burke said, adding, “If that’s the case, then by God, we better get ready.”Dr. Wolfe acknowledges that the task of preparing for the next pandemic is gargantuan — far too big for his team alone.“What we’re doing is our best guess on the ideal way to create an early warning system, but there are going to be 20 or 30 different approaches tried,” he said. “The field of pandemic prevention will become huge over the next few years, funded on the order of billions of dollars. It’s going to be a new movement.”'"
"'08-10-21,'0','“It makes their sound at once accessible,” he continued, “while also fresh and inspiring.”Ms. Bougatsos is ready for the attention. “There’s no such thing as selling out in my mind,” she said, adding that she would love to have her music featured on a TV show soundtrack: “A Jeep commercial, a tampon commercial, anything,” she said. “We’re a band, we make music, and that’s what we want to be known for.”The CMJ Marathon, in which nearly 1,200 bands will perform at more than 75 clubs Tuesday through Saturday, is a way for music insiders and media to play catch-up, network and try to spot the next breakout hit. (Last year the unsigned but hyped Florida group the Black Kids emerged as stars, eventually landing a contract with Columbia.)This year, said Robert Haber, chief executive of the CMJ Network, which oversees the festival and its namesake, the College Media Journal, the schedule is “a bit more eclectic and a little bit more international.” It includes George Clinton and the Nashville bluegrass act the Del McCoury Band, as well as showcases of Israeli and Norwegian groups.But there seem to be fewer must-see shows, though the Swedish singer Lykke Li, the Memphis garage rocker Jay Reatard and the Brooklyn musician Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson are generating hype. And concerts, like the blogger BrooklynVegan’s at the Music Hall of Williamsburg on Tuesday, with Jens Lekman and Ponytail, and unofficial parties are sure to be packed. CMJ will again include panels, film screenings and, for the first time, a comedy festival.“Obviously the goal here is to make sure, especially these days, that the folks who are buying a badge are getting real value for what they’re paying,” Mr. Haber said. (Conferencewide badges cost $495; clubs also sell individual tickets at a range of prices.)That industry angle has long been anathema to the members of Gang Gang Dance, who are playing CMJ for only the second time. Dissatisfied with their first appearance, they turned down requests to perform for years, Mr. DeGraw said. That they acquiesced is part of their evolution and, perhaps, the inevitable mellowing of age. (Most of the members are in their 30s.)They trace the change in their trajectory to the death of an unofficial member, Nathan Maddox, who was struck by lightning on a SoHo rooftop in 2002. “Becoming more serious as a band was a homage to him,” Ms. Bougatsos said. One of their highest-profile performances, at the last Whitney Biennial, was dedicated to him. This summer they also led the East Coast end of 88 Boadrum, a cross-country drum circle organized by the Japanese band the Boredoms.Since the release of their second album, “God’s Money,” in 2005, the members of Gang Gang Dance have also ramped up their ambition: they opened for TV on the Radio at the Hollywood Bowl in 2006, just returned from a tour in Japan and will hit the road again this month, beginning in Toronto. With the addition of Jesse Lee as a drummer to replace Mr. DeWit, now a producer, they will begin recording a new album early next year, a much quicker turnaround than usual.Not to say they are ever going to have mainstream appeal. Ms. Bougatsos likes pygmy, Ethiopian and Bollywood music. Mr. DeGraw listens to Brian Eno’s album “Another Day on Earth” daily, and dub and reggae are band favorites. The members are unabashedly superstitious: they wear Moroccan hand pendants as good luck charms.And contrary to popular belief, they are part of the Manhattan, not Brooklyn, music scene. Though for a while they shared a rehearsal space in Williamsburg with Animal Collective and Black Dice, and all have lived there over the years, Mr. Diamond is the only one who does now — “unfortunately,” he said. (The others live near Chinatown.)Mr. DeGraw attributed the band’s longevity to creative necessity — “it’s medicinal to us,” he said. But even after many years together, the members still struggle with money — subletters and happy hours are also necessities — and have an energy that will be recognizable to the thousands of less established musicians who are descending on New York this week.“We still have this yearning kind of element,” Ms. Bougatsos said, “this urban feeling of being in the city and trying to survive and getting kicked out of our apartments.”'"
"'08-10-21,'0','Some may wonder how Japan, which suffered its own severe downturn in the 1990s and has a stalling economy now, has the right to tell others what to do. But in recent days, lawmakers have begun floating proposals about how Japan, traditionally passive, might use its deep pockets and bitter experience from the 1990s to help global growth and, along the way, Japan’s own export-driven economy.Recently, Shoichi Nakagawa, Japan’s finance minister, offered some of Japan’s $996 billion in foreign currency reserves to rescue smaller nations threatened with bankruptcy by the global credit crisis. Other lawmakers have suggested using yen loans to help developing countries build roads and power plants, to revive global growth and rekindle demand for Japanese bulldozers and other goods.Another idea taking shape here calls for sending accountants and lawyers experienced from Japan’s 1990s financial cleanup to help American banks and regulators sift through mountains of toxic American mortgage debt.While it is unlikely that the nascent proposals would stem what many call the biggest financial crisis since the Depression, the fact they are being discussed at all underscores the vacuum in leadership felt across the world in the wake of an American-led economic debacle. The fact they are appearing in Japan, a nation long content to follow Washington’s lead, reflects what many here call a movement toward a new economic order in which no single country dominates.“With the relative decline in U.S. economic and financial power, it is inevitable that U.S. leadership will also decline,” said Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a former chief cabinet secretary. “We are seeing a new, multipolar economic regime starting to emerge.”Mr. Shiozaki and others are careful to point out that no one is talking about replacing Washington as guardian of the global economy. Rather, what they envision is a world where America shares oversight of the global economy with emerging powers like China and India, as well as Europe and Japan.They are also talking about each country bringing its various strengths to the table as a new, post-subprime world economic order takes shape.Many political leaders favor using Japan’s foreign reserves as a sort of war chest for combating the economic malaise. The finance minister’s offer, made at a meeting in Washington of the International Monetary Fund earlier this month, would keep Japanese money ready as a lifeline to strapped countries.While lawmakers here refuse to say so in public, their biggest source of concern appears to be neighboring South Korea, whose currency and stock markets have both been hard hit by flight of foreign capital.The finance minister’s plan calls for financing bailouts that will be administered by the International Monetary Fund.Japanese finance officials, however, have also been talking with the fund about easing the terms of its bailouts, said Naoyuki Shinohara, the vice minister for international affairs. Asia still has bitter memories of the harsh terms the fund imposed after the region’s 1997 financial crisis.Other proposals call for Japan to spur the global economy through increasing the billions in overseas development loans and other aid it spends building new infrastructure in developing countries in Asia and Africa, for example, as China has also done. A column in Asahi Shimbun, a leading daily, likened the idea to the Depression-era New Deal.“We need to create new sources of demand, or the global economy is in trouble,” said Hakuo Yanagisawa, a former financial services minister who now heads the Liberal Democratic Party’s project team on responding to the current financial crisis. “A purely financial response to the crisis is not enough.”Plans are also afoot to assemble teams of financial experts from Japan’s private sector and 1990s-era government bodies like the Resolution and Collection Corporation, which led Japan’s cleanup of its nonperforming real estate loans a decade ago, according to Mr. Yanagisawa.He said the Japanese government would soon put out feelers through its embassy in Washington about whether such help would be welcomed by American regulators, who face a similarly formidable task of calculating the worth of mountains of mortgage-backed securities polluting the American financial system.But many Japanese say Japan’s biggest contribution would be simply keeping its own economic house in order. They say it should bolster government spending to offset declines in exports to the United States, which appear to be pushing Japan’s $5 trillion economy into recession. A strong economy, and Japan’s relatively healthy banks, which largely avoided the subprime mess, would give the nation a new authority in global economic affairs.'"
"'08-10-21,'0','Two of the playwriting center awards went to New York City programs, Lark Play Development Center and New Dramatists; two others were awarded to the Sundance Institute Theater Program in Beverly Hills, Calif., and the Playwrights’ Center in Minneapolis. Three-Legged Dog, a nonprofit media and theater group in New York City, also received a grant.New Dramatists will use its $675,000 award to offer longer workshops for new writers and to commission new plays that a network of theaters commits to producing. The labs are forming a partnership with the producers, Mr. London said, with each focusing on what it does best.Michael Robertson, the managing director of Lark, said the group planned to use its half-million dollars to ensure that three new plays are each staged at four different theaters around the country within 18 months. The program is a way to combat what he calls world premiere-itis.“In contrast to a world premiere, producers commit to the notion that a play belongs in the American theater’s repertory,” Mr. Robertson said. The original producing company stays on board throughout the entire run, sharing information and advocating for the play. Each of the four institutions will get to call the production a world premiere.The Playwrights’ Center plans to increase pay for all theater artists and start a trailer project to preview plays the way the film industry previews movies.Sundance is expanding its current program of development labs to offer playwrights year-round support, said Philip Himberg, the organization’s producing artistic director. “We’re calling it Sundance 911,” he added. Any alumnus of the program can call at any time throughout the year for help with a new draft, a reading, working with a dramaturge and more.“It will serve as a bridge between the end of our lab and a real production schedule,” he explained. Mr. Himberg is also interested in figuring out ways to make audiences more receptive to new work.Mellon has awarded grants to six producing institutions as well: the Public Theater, Signature Theater Company, Playwrights Horizons and Lincoln Center Theater, all in New York, as well as Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago and the Roadside Theater, in Whitesburg, Ky., in the heart of the coal-mining region of the central Appalachian Mountains.Playwrights Horizons’ $2 million award will go toward creating a consortium with other theaters around the country to produce musicals. Lincoln Center, which received $1 million in March, is using the money to support a new program, LCT3, that showcases work Off Broadway by emerging writers, directors and designers. Its first production, “Clay,” a one-man hip-hop musical by Matt Sax at the Duke Theater, opened on Wednesday.The Roadside Theater, which creates dramas based on the region’s people and history, received $1 million to develop new audiences for live theater, Dudley Cocke, its artistic director, said, and to bring stories about the working class to the stage. The group has gone to other cities to help local writers. A new musical, “Betsy,” on which it collaborated with Pregones Theater in the Bronx, is to open on Nov. 19.Signature’s $1.25 million will help finance its celebration of the Negro Ensemble Company and its ticket subsidy program; Steppenwolf will use its $600,000 to create playwriting residencies that can take advantage of the company’s entire ensemble. Playwrights are often compelled to write “small plays,” two- or three-character works that can physically fit on a company’s second stage, Ms. Ragsdale explained. These new programs will enable them to create on a larger canvas.Ms. Ragsdale said she was particularly excited about the Public Theater’s plan to establish a position for a “master playwright” in conjunction with New York University. This chair, like others in academia, will include a salary, benefits and light teaching duties, while giving a playwright the opportunity to devote time to his or her own work.The idea has been “brilliantly successful” at research universities, said Oskar Eustis, the Public’s artistic director. “We’ve taken that model and applied it directly to the nonprofit theater world.”“Every theater with a budget of more than $5 or $6 million should support a playwright,” Mr. Eustis said. That would create 200 playwriting jobs and “change the landscape of how we support playwrights.”Ms. Ragsdale pointed out that playwrights across the centuries, from William Shakespeare to Clifford Odets, often had a base, a group or a place that supported them. What programs like the one at the Public can do for today’s playwrights, she said, is to “give these artists a home.”'"

That is down from $1.07 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the same period last year.The profit was better than expected, however. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average had predicted earnings of 59 cents a share, excluding one-time items. American Express’s income from continuing operations was 74 cents a share.Shares rose $1.60 , or 6.6 percent, to $25.95 in after-hours trading, after rising $1.02, or 4.4 percent, to $24.35 during the regular session.The card company took a $1.36 billion provision for loan losses, 51 percent higher than its provision in the third quarter a year ago. Its loan-loss rates nearly doubled to 5.9 percent from 3.0 percent a year ago on a managed basis, which includes card loans that are securitized.“We saw clear signs earlier this year of a weakening environment and the recent volatility in the financial markets has reinforced our view that consumer and business sentiment is likely to deteriorate further, translating into weaker economies around the globe well into 2009,” the chief executive, Kenneth I.

"'08-10-21,'0','Premature babies are often given hydrocortisone as a substitute for cortisol, an essential hormone that helps fight inflammation and prevent lung disease. But a new study suggests that the medicine offers little benefit.Researchers writing in the October issue of Pediatrics used data from a study of adrenal insufficiency that randomly assigned 311 babies born, on average, about three months prematurely and weighing 1.6 pounds. They received either hydrocortisone treatment or a placebo in the two weeks after birth.Low cortisol levels before treatment began were not associated with increased mortality, and at five to seven days there was no difference between the two groups in chronic lung disease, infection, brain hemorrhage or vision problems. Mortality was slightly higher in those with increasing levels of cortisol, but the association was not statistically significant.“The good news is that the treatment isn’t harmful,” said the lead author, Dr. Susan W. Aucott, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins. “But we probably don’t need to use it as much as we’re using it. If the baby is doing well, he doesn’t need treatment just because his cortisol level is low.”'"
"'08-10-21,'0','“There is now a greater possibility that the E.U. misses a deadline it set for itself,” Yvo de Boer, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said Monday. “That would call into question Europe’s willingness to back up an offer that was applauded by the whole world with specific policies.”European leaders left the meeting last week saying that they would need unanimity to push forward.Meanwhile, the American presidential election is likely to make the United States’ policy on climate change more proactive. That could further diminish the global influence that Europeans have so far been able to claim.“We should not rule out that at some stage whoever becomes president may have completely new ideas,” said Christian Egenhofer, an energy and climate specialist at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. “If the E.U. doesn’t have its policies in place it could be a very weak discussion partner.”Some energy specialists say that European policy makers seriously misunderstood how difficult it would be to transform the energy sector.Thomas Schneider, a member of IEEE, a professional association for the advancement of technology, said that some of the most direct ways to lower carbon dioxide would be to deploy large numbers of windmills and nuclear power plants. But he warned that even under the most promising timelines, that would be difficult for Europe to achieve by 2020.“The financial crisis has exacerbated the issue of how Europe would meet its targets,” Mr. Schneider said, “but this is mainly an engineering problem.”Even before the credit squeeze became a full-fledged banking crisis, European countries were displaying different levels of enthusiasm for the emissions measures.On one side are Poland and other coal-dependent nations in Eastern Europe, as well as Italy. These countries face potentially higher costs under a system that caps carbon dioxide emissions from heavy industry, as introduced in 2005.Some countries also say that they are being asked to do too much too quickly in areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency.On the other side is France, which uses nuclear sources to generate most of its power, and Britain, which favors climate regulation, partly because it has become a hub for trading permits to emit carbon dioxide. Also favoring regulation are the Dutch and most Nordic countries, which have successfully installed several initiatives to replace fossil fuel-fired power with renewable sources of energy.Officials in Brussels warn that signs of a weakening commitment by European leaders to fighting climate change could start a chain reaction, lowering ambitions among other central players, like China and India. The resolve of some developing countries to participate in a global climate deal could also weaken if they expect that a strapped Europe will become stingier.The European system to control emissions is based on the sale of permits to emit carbon that are worth billions of euros. Under the planned overhaul of the system, industries would have to pay for a substantially larger portion of those permits.Revenue would most likely be earmarked for European governments, but some funds could go toward helping developing countries combat climate change.Mr. de Boer, the United Nations climate official, said that developing nations had already made it clear that they expected more financial support in exchange for becoming part of a global agreement on climate change.'"
"'08-10-21,'0','Under the terms of the cabinet decision, banks that decided to accept the bailout were to have the salaries of their executives capped at 500,000 euros a year as long as the banks were indebted to the state. They could also be forced to forgo bonuses and dividend payments, although that is not definite. In addition, dividends paid out by banks that take up the state package will be paid back into the state rescue fund.The version enacted, however, is more vague, stating that salaries over 500,000 euros a year would be considered “inappropriate,” according to a copy e-mailed by the finance ministry. That still is more precise than the British or French bailouts, which contain more commitments about limiting executive pay.“The government is counting on managers reading the way the wind is blowing and volunteering a cap on wages to save their bank,” Otto Bernhardt, the parliamentary finance spokesman for Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats and chairman of a joint committee reviewing manager pay, told Bloomberg News. “There’s enormous ill feeling among the population about bank pay — 500,000 euros is nearly double the chancellor’s pay.”The government will be allowed to examine the business policies of banks that sign up to the capital injection package and will be allowed block investment decisions it regards as too risky.Germany’s big banks were not rushing to apply for a capital injection. Deutsche Bank’s chairman, Josef Ackermann, said his bank did not need additional capital — after weeks of pushing for a government rescue plan.“I would be ashamed if we were to take state money during this crisis,” Mr. Ackermann said. Thomas Steg, the government spokesman, called Mr. Ackermann’s comments “totally incomprehensible and objectionable.”Commentators in Germany said Mr. Ackermann might be reluctant to seek help because it would mean opening the bank, and possibly even his contract, to scrutiny.Mr. Ackermann received compensation totaling 14 million euros last year, which included benefits and shares. Martin Blessing, chief executive since May of Commerzbank, Germany’s second largest, received 2 million euros, not including shares and other benefits, according to the bank.Merrill Lynch analysts estimated on Monday that Deutsche Bank would require a further capital increase of 8.9 billion euros and Commerzbank 6.2 billion euros. Mr. Blessing, the Commerzbank chief, said he would look at the government’s package and see “whether it comes into question for us.”Unlike the bailout adopted by the United States, Germany is not insisting that banks accept the support.Bavaria’s state bank, BayernLB said it wanted money from the package as soon as possible. “It’s about achieving a fast stabilization,” said Erwin Huber, finance minister of Bavaria, who is chairman of the administrative board of BayernLB.Speaking to ZDF public television, Mr. Huber said it was unclear how much the bank required in terms of fresh capital. But he said he believed it would have to be restructured, merged with another bank or partly privatized.'"
"'08-10-21,'0','The government’s intervention in ING is the latest effort by national and international authorities to calm investors and keep tight credit markets from bringing economic activity to a halt. The United States has announced a $700 billion plan to bail out the American financial system, while European governments last week announced national relief packages valued at hundreds of billions of euros.“Our capital position was in line with previously targeted levels and regulatory requirements,” the chief executive and chairman of ING, Michel Tilmant, said in a statement. “However, market conditions have changed dramatically in recent weeks and have led to an internationally recognized belief that going forward, in this market environment, capital requirements for financial institutions should be higher.”The bank said the transaction was structured to avoid dilution of existing shareholders. The Dutch government will obtain the right to nominate two members to the ING Group supervisory board. The board will review executive pay for senior management “to align it with new international standards,” the company said.ING has major insurance and commercial banking operations. With 338 billion euros in savings and current-account deposits at the end of last year, it is also one of the world’s largest retail banks. The company said it would use the new capital to increase shareholders’ equity in its banking unit by 5 billion euros and strengthen the balance sheet of ING Insurance by 2 billion euros. The other 3 billion euros will be used to pay down debt. ING said the money would raise its Tier 1 ratio — a measure of financial strength — to above 10 percent.In a conference call Monday morning, Mr. Tilmant said the capital increase was “more than sufficient,” and that the company had “drawn the line” under its needs.Folkert Jan van der Veer, a banking analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort in London, said he agreed that the capital position looked more comfortable. “But given the massive uncertainties at the moment, it is hard to say whether it will be enough,” he said. “What we are seeing is that both regulators and investors are taking a view now that is different to the one they held before with regard to what adequate capital is.”Investors are “picking on” the least capitalized banks, he added, meaning that if rival banks keep raising monies, either from government bailouts or new investors, even banks that seem adequately financed now may need help.Like other European governments and the United States, the Netherlands has also explicitly backed bank loans to restore calm to the credit market. The government said it expected to guarantee loans amounting to 200 billion euros.As a result of the deal with Fubon, ING said it would have a book loss of 427 million euros after taxes.'"

"'08-10-22,'0','The project is being jointly developed by Apollo Real Estate Advisors, based in Manhattan; the Blumenfeld Development Group of Syosset, N.Y.; and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, a publicly traded real estate investment trust in Greensboro, N.C.About the Tuscan design, David Blumenfeld, a Blumenfeld principal, said, “We thought it would be something different, something that’s not been seen before on Long Island.”An additional 125,000 square feet will be completed next year and will probably be leased by a national retailer that is not an outlet store, possibly a big-box store like Best Buy, to create “cross shopping,” Mr. Blumenfeld said.The entertainment options at the Arches include a 16-screen 67,500-square-foot Regal Cinemas multiplex, with a 360-seat Imax movie theater; a 32,500-square-foot New York Sports Clubs health club; and chain restaurants like Chipotle, Johnny Rockets and Nathan’s. The center also has a courtyard with outdoor seating, and a fountain area that will be converted into an ice skating rink in the winter.The retail mix at the Arches includes an unusually large percentage of stores that are outlets of high-end retailers: 125,000 square feet is occupied by luxury stores, anchored by a 32,000-square-foot Neiman Marcus Last Call Clearance Center and a 29,000-square-foot Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th. Other luxury retailers include Kate Spade, Calvin Klein, Betsey Johnson and Juicy Couture.The Last Call store is Neiman Marcus’s first store on Long Island. The merchant originally planned to open a full-line store in a luxury mall proposed by Taubman Centers in Oyster Bay, but the mall’s development has been delayed by a lengthy legal battle.Wayne Hussey, senior vice president of real estate and store development for Neiman Marcus, said the Deer Park store was slightly larger than other Last Call stores, because, he said, “Long Island is very dense in terms of population.”Other large stores at the Arches include a 15,000-square-foot Nike Factory Store, a 20,000-square-foot Old Navy and a 46,200-square-foot Christmas Tree Shop, the first on Long Island.Steven B. Tanger, president and chief operating officer of Tanger, said the Arches would be the largest of the company’s 32 centers in 22 states when it was completed. He predicted it would be one of the country’s highest-volume outlet centers, but declined to quantify sales or rents.Richard DiGeronimo, a Mineola, N.Y., real estate appraiser and adviser, estimates that annual rents range from the mid-$20s to low-$30s per square foot for retailers, and more for nonretail tenants. That rent, he said, would not include building operating expenses, common charges and taxes.Despite the current trouble in the financial markets, real estate professionals say that the Arches’ long-term prospects appear strong.According to CoStar Group, which tracks the real estate industry, the retail vacancy rate in the first quarter of 2008 in Nassau and Suffolk Counties was 5.2 percent, somewhat lower than the rate in many major retail centers. Also, Mr. DiGeronimo said, “there is very little new retail product coming online; the Arches is one of the larger developments on Long Island in the last year. They should be able to capture a reasonable market share.”Jonathan Habermann, a securities analyst at Goldman Sachs who follows Tanger, said many outlet centers did not have luxury retailers, a multiplex movie theater or health club. “But given the location and attractive demographics, there’s going to be quite a bit more entertainment appeal” at the Arches, he said. “They’re trying to keep shoppers there longer. It’s going to be a cross between a mall and an outlet center, and create a destination for them.”The Arches had some difficulty attracting tenants because clauses on retailers’ leases at Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Orange County, N.Y., owned by Simon Property Group, and the Americana, a luxury mall in Manhasset owned by Fifth Avenue of Long Island Realty Associates, prevented some stores from leasing in Deer Park, Mr. Blumenfeld said. He said that 20 to 30 tenants at Woodbury Common and several at Americana had “expressed interest in opening at the Arches. Some from Woodbury Common have been able to renegotiate their leases.”A spokesman for Simon declined to comment, and officials for the Americana did not respond to telephone messages seeking comment.Nathan Isbee, who follows Tanger for Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore, said that it “remains to be seen how deep this economic slowdown gets.”But in tough times, outlet stores might be expected to hold up relatively well, he said. “Consumers are going to want to trade down,” Mr. Isbee said. “They’ll be looking for a bargain in this environment. But there could come a point where even inexpensive apparel becomes too much for the customer to bear. At the end of the day, outlet center purchases are discretionary.”'"

"'08-10-22,'0','“Is the economic crisis going to be the end of green?” asks David Rothkopf, energy consultant and author of “Superclass. Or, could green be the way to end the economic crisis?”It has to be the latter. We can’t afford a financial bailout that also isn’t a green buildup — a buildup of a new clean energy industry that strengthens America and helps the planet.But how do we do that without any policy to affect the price signal for gasoline and carbon?Here are some ideas: First, could impose a national renewable energy standard that would require every utility in the country to produce 20 percent of its power from clean, non-CO2-emitting, energy sources — wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, biomass — by 2025. About half the states already have these in place, but they are all different. It would create a huge domestic pull for renewable energy if we had a uniform national mandate.Second, Washington could impose a national requirement that every state move its utilities to a system of “decoupling-plus.” This is the technical term for changing the way utilities make money — shifting them from getting paid for how much electricity or gas they get you to consume to getting paid for how much electricity or gas they get you to save. Several states have already moved down this path.Third, an idea offered by Andy Karsner, former assistant secretary of energy, would be to modify the tax code so that any company that invests in new domestic manufacturing capacity for clean energy technology — or procures any clean energy system or energy savings device that is made by an American manufacturer — can write down the entire cost of the investment via a tax credit and/or accelerated depreciation in the first year.“I’m talking about anything from energy efficient windows to water heaters to industrial boilers to solar panels, and the job creating, manufacturing facilities that produce them — anything that makes us more efficient, lean and economically competitive and comes from a domestic, American source,” said Karsner.He also suggests using some of the money from any to directly incentivize and support states’ efforts to implement and intelligently modernize their building codes to get already well-established national “best practices” quickly into their marketplaces.Lastly, we need the next president to be an energy efficiency trendsetter, starting by reinventing the inaugural parade. Get rid of the black stretch limos and double-plated armored Chevy Tahoes inching down Pennsylvania Avenue. Instead, let the next president announce that he will use no vehicles on inauguration day that get less than 30 miles per gallon. He could invite all car companies to participate in the historic drive with their best available American-made, fuel-efficient, innovative vehicle.Finally, if Congress passes another stimulus package, it can’t just be another round of $600 checks to go buy flat-screen TVs made in . It has to also include bridges to somewhere — targeted investments in scientific research, mass transit, domestic clean-tech manufacturing and energy efficiency that will make us a more productive and innovative society, one with more skills, more competitiveness, more productivity and better infrastructure to lead the next great industrial revolution: E.T. — energy technology.'"
"'08-10-22,'0','A week into the big bailout, banks are beginning to charge each other less for loans and companies are finding it easier to borrow short term. The Dow has been up and down, but so far this week, it is back above 9,000.So has the worst passed? Probably not.The unfortunate reality is that as long as millions of Americans continue to default on their mortgages and housing prices continue to slide, banks will continue to suffer big losses. Unless something is done quickly to help American homeowners avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes, those losses could swamp the bailout effort by exceeding the sums being spent to rescue the banks.Despite the danger posed by foreclosures — to the bailout, homeowners, taxpayers and the economy — the Bush administration and Congress are still depending on banks and other participants in the mortgage industry to voluntarily modify troubled loans, say, by giving borrowers more time to pay or by reducing interest rates.The voluntary approach hasn’t been enough to stanch foreclosures. As things now stand, some 3.2 million homeowners will likely lose their homes to foreclosure this year and next, and millions more will struggle to catch up on delinquencies. Vacancies and defaults will continue to push house prices down; they have already fallen by 20 percent nationwide and are now expected to fall by at least another 10 percent. There is no time to waste to reverse the spiral.Unfortunately, the bailout legislation does not require banks to modify loans in exchange for the infusion of taxpayer dollars. That means the administration and Congress will have to turn up the political pressure on financial institutions that avail themselves of the government’s largess. The Treasury Department should also set up a team to modify any troubled mortgages it gains control of through the bailout.'"
"'08-10-22,'0','“When we look at our numbers, we think we’re competitive here,” Mark Salter, Mr. McCain’s closest adviser, told reporters in Harrisburg on Tuesday. He added, “We would like to get as many Clinton supporters as we can.”Another reason for Mr. McCain’s focus on Pennsylvania may be the shrinking electoral map, as Mr. Obama’s dominance leaves Mr. McCain with fewer and fewer competitive states to campaign in, and the need to avoid another embarrassing concession like Michigan, which the campaign abandoned early this month.Conceding Pennsylvania two weeks before the election would be too much an admission of failure, said G. Terry Madonna, the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, where Mr. McCain appeared before a raucous rally of 7,000 people with his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, in September.“I think it psychologically devastates the entire national campaign if they decide they’re going to pull up stakes and walk away,” Mr. Madonna said.One of McCain’s senior strategists, Charles Black, said that the campaign had fared better in Pennsylvania than in any other blue state in recent months, and that Mr. McCain was a different candidate than President Bush, who waged a long and expensive battle here four years ago. “Bush came close here, but he did badly in the Philadelphia suburbs,” Mr. Black said, arguing that Mr. McCain’s old “maverick” label would have greater appeal in those suburbs, even though Mr. McCain has run a traditional Republican general election campaign.Philadelphia is one of the only major cities in the country where Mr. McCain’s advertising campaign is anywhere near as voluminous as that of Mr. Obama’s. But even there, he lags nonetheless. On Tuesday, Mr. McCain effectively reduced his advertising campaigns in five other states — Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin — in what Democrats suspected was an effort to divert resources to a more robust advertising effort here (though the savings from those moves had yet to show up in the state as of Tuesday night).Mr. McCain’s advisers have contended that they do not expect white voters to reject Mr. Obama, of Illinois, simply because he is black. When Mike DuHaime, the campaign’s political director, was asked in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday what effect he thought race would play in Pennsylvania, he replied, “I hope there is none.”Mr. DuHaime rejected comments made last week by a Pennsylvania Democrat, Representative John P. Murtha, who told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, speaking of his home base, that “there is no question that Western Pennsylvania is a racist area.”Mr. McCain referenced Mr. Murtha’s comments in his third stop of the day, at Robert Morris University here, when he said, “I think you may have noticed that Senator Obama’s supporters have been saying some pretty nasty things about Western Pennsylvania lately.” As the crowd booed, Mr. McCain became tangled up in the rest of his remarks. “And you know, I couldn’t agree with them more,” he said, to silence, and then wandered around in a verbal thicket before finally managing to say, “I could not disagree with those critics more; this is a great part of America.”Mr. Obama, who was in Florida on Tuesday, had no immediate plans to return to Pennsylvania in coming days, perhaps the most telling sign that his strategists were comfortable with his position there. But Democratic officials in the state said they had been urging the Obama campaign to send the senator back there at least once more before Election Day to shore up support.An aggressive ground game for Mr. Obama, meanwhile, is under way in all corners of Pennsylvania, where hundreds of campaign workers and tens of thousands of volunteers were manning 80 field offices in what Democrats described as the largest organizational effort in state history.Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said the voter registration edge was about twice as much as the party enjoyed in the 2004 presidential race. But even with that edge, he said, history suggested that the state would remain close until the final moment. Lyndon B. Johnson was the only Democratic presidential candidate in 50 years to capture more than 51 percent of the vote.“I’m always cautious about Pennsylvania, but there seems to be something different about this whole effort,” Mr. Casey said in an interview on Tuesday. “The dynamic has changed dramatically, not just around the country, but in particular in Pennsylvania, because of the confluence of the economic situation.”After spending last weekend reaching out to undecided voters on a Casey family bus tour across the state, Mr. Casey said the skepticism among older voters toward Mr. Obama had started to fall away after they saw the two candidates side by side at the debates.“There were some people, a certain percentage of undecided voters, who had not seen them both on the same stage,” Mr. Casey said. “It definitely moved some older voters into his column.”Still, Democratic officials in the state said they did not believe that Pennsylvania was absolutely locked up for Mr. Obama. Party leaders are not relying on polling, in case voters are not telling pollsters the truth, but rather on neighbor-to-neighbor efforts to identify supporters.'"
"'08-10-22,'0','This new economic power comes at a time when Mr. Berlusconi is enjoying more political power than he has ever had in 15 years in public office.It also puts him, along with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, hailed for his bank bailout plan, among the world leaders whose political fortunes seemed to be getting a boost from the crisis. Losers appear to be President Bush, whose already low poll ratings have sunk further amid the financial turmoil, and Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which has been buffeted by plunging oil prices and an international backlash over its war with Georgia in August.In Parliament, Mr. Berlusconi’s center-right coalition, the People of Liberty, was elected in April by a wide nine-point margin. It is stronger than ever, having shed some smaller rightist parties, and governs practically unopposed, because of the implosion of the left in the elections. Over the weekend, the main opposition group, the Democratic Party, split with an allied centrist party, Italy of Values, further splintering the ever-squabbling left and center.“This is a phase in which he’s without rivals,” said Ferruccio de Bortoli, the editor in chief of the well-respected financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore. “Whether it’s good for the country, I have my doubts.”The Italian state has always been a major player in an economy in which personal connections are crucial. And in recent weeks, Italy, like most European countries, has been open to bailing out failing financial institutions. But when the head of government is also the most powerful businessman, and one of the wealthiest, in the private sector, it has the potential to take the spoils system to a new level.In many countries, the leader’s popularity often rises and falls with the state of the economy. That does not appear to be the case in Italy.Since Sept. 1, the Milan stock market has dropped 22 percent and economic anxieties are rising along with interest rates on mortgages. But Mr. Berlusconi’s approval ratings are high at 62 percent, according to a poll released last week and conducted by the center-left La Repubblica.His left-wing critics, including the Democratic Party leader, Walter Veltroni, have attributed his success to his sway on the public and private television airwaves. Mr. Berlusconi owns Mediaset, Italy’s largest private broadcaster. A government media watchdog recently reported “an imbalance” on television public affairs programs in September, with far more time devoted to the government than to the opposition.Even though Mr. Berlusconi has said the Italian economy is not in a recession, a view many dispute, on Tuesday he called a meeting next week with banks and Confindustria, the industrialists’ association, to make sure, as he said, “that the financial crisis doesn’t affect the real economy.”Over all, he seems to have reassured Italians that the state has their back.Mr. Berlusconi has also tried to promote investment in his own way.This month, he drew criticism for urging Italians to buy shares in Eni and Enel, Italy’s largest gas companies. For a prime minister to favor certain stocks “was an evident conflict of interest,” said Emma Bonino, vice president of the Senate and a member of the Radical Party.Yet Mr. Berlusconi’s powerful finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, is well respected and even seen as predicting the current crisis in his book, “Fear and Hope,” which appeared this spring and warned of the downside of globalization. Last week, he said the government was prepared to bail out banks on a case-by-case basis.But worry about the power of Mr. Berlusconi and his government is high enough that on Monday Mr. Tremonti sought to play down fears of more state intervention. He said the government would approach any bailouts reluctantly, saying they could be “seriously harmful” to the country’s “political health.”“It may be necessary, but it is absolutely not an opportunity,” he said.Mr. Tremonti also has a strong hand with the parties in the center-right coalition and helped push through some budget measures over the summer, giving the government more flexibility in the current crisis. Budget negotiations usually paralyze Parliament all fall.But not everyone is convinced.For all Mr. Tremonti’s foresight, “the budget was wrong because it presupposed growth,” said Pier Luigi Bersani, the shadow finance minister for the Democrats. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund predicted two years of recession for Italy. Last week, Confindustria predicted that the Italian economy would shrink by 0.5 percent, instead of growing 0.4 percent.It is hard to gauge how much Mr. Berlusconi’s empire has lost. His holding company, Fininvest, which is not publicly traded, announced Tuesday that its net profit had fallen 20 percent this year. Shares in Mediaset have fallen 40 percent since the first of the year, while Mondadori, a publishing house, is down nearly half. Shares in Mediolanum, an insurance company, were down about 40 percent.But in broad terms, Mr. Berlusconi has solidified his position in Italy’s economy, the world’s seventh largest.His daughter Marina now sits on the board of Mediobanca, the storied Milan investment bank that for decades was a counterbalance to state financing and a bastion of old money to his new.Mr. Berlusconi recently warned that Italian companies were open to hostile takeovers, and he hopes to pass a law making them more difficult. His critics fear such a law would reduce foreign investment, keeping power in the hands of a homegrown few.“Hostile to whom?” the left-leaning economist Tito Boeri asked in a front-page article in La Repubblica on Friday. “Hostile to our economy or to the big families that now run Italian capitalism?”And as the credit crisis deepens, Mr. Berlusconi is also moving closer to the country’s two leading investment banks, Unicredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, whose leaders have not been close to the center-right coalition.At Mr. Berlusconi’s behest, the chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, Corrado Passera, worked with the government to engineer the recent bailout of the airline Alitalia. Mr. Berlusconi had pledged during his election campaign to keep the flagship carrier Italian, which meant nationalizing the airline’s losses while trading favors to get private investors to buy a major stake.Unicredit’s shares have plummeted in recent weeks, but it has so far avoided the need for help from the state. Last week, the government of Libya bought a 5 percent stake, becoming the bank’s second largest shareholder.If private recapitalization fails and Unicredit turns to Mr. Berlusconi for state financing, it would wind up “reducing the independence of these very important banks that had previously been out of his grasp,” said Michele Polo, an economics professor at Bocconi University in Milan.Is all this power for Mr. Berlusconi good for the country?“My immediate response is yes,” said Alberto Bombassei, vice president of Confindustria. “In difficult moments it’s good for the country to have a more decisive government.”Beyond the economic uncertainty, Mr. Berlusconi, who seems to enjoy life on the precipice, still remains vulnerable. He is on trial in absentia in Milan, accused of concealing illegal accounts. Italy’s constitutional court is reviewing a law that would grant him immunity.Paolo Bonaiuti, Mr. Berlusconi’s spokesman, said reports of the prime minister’s increased power were overstated. “He has the support of the public,” Mr. Bonaiuti said. “What’s the problem?”'"
"'08-10-22,'0','And it’s not at all clear why such people should be at the front of the line for government help. Why are they more deserving than, say, the growing number of unemployed, many of whom rent their homes?Given all the other imperfect emergency measures that the federal government has taken in recent weeks, it can certainly do more to stem foreclosures than it has. The Treasury Department’s $700 billion bailout fund, as it’s now structured, may spend almost nothing on troubled mortgages. “It’s a question of weights,” Alan Blinder, a former Federal Reserve vice chairman who has been advocating more homeowner help for months, told me, “and I’m really worried that zero is going to be the weight for mortgages.”Zero, or anything close to it, may well be wrong. But the right answer isn’t quite as obvious as it initially sounds.There are two separate groups of people who are at risk of foreclosure, and they often get muddled in any discussion of the housing crisis.The first group is made up of people who, for whatever reason, will not be able to make their monthly payments. Some took out mortgages with initial monthly payments that they couldn’t afford. Others took out adjustable-rate mortgages whose monthly payments have ballooned to an unaffordable level. Still others have lost their jobs.At the start of this month, almost 1.5 million homeowners — out of about 75 million nationwide — were in this category. They were at least two months behind on their mortgage payments. Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody’s Economy.com, estimates that another five million or so will fall into the category over the life of their mortgage, as the economy worsens and more adjustable-rate loans reset.The second group is quite different. It is made up of people who are at risk of foreclosure not because they won’t be able to keep up with their monthly payments — but because they may decide they don’t want to continue making them. These are the homeowners who are “under water,” which is to say their houses have lost so much value that they’re now worth less than the underlying mortgage.Homeowners with an underwater mortgage face a choice. Many will stay put and keep making their monthly payments, because they see their house primarily as a home, rather than an investment. Maybe they love their neighborhood or their children’s school. Maybe they just don’t like the idea of reneging on a deal, as Brett Barry, a real estate agent near Phoenix, put it.Others, though, are going to look at their home purely in economic terms and see an investment that may never pay off. Some of them will choose to walk away.What matters, for the purposes of a bailout, is that the number of underwater homeowners is much larger than the number of people who will be unable to make their mortgage payments. Assuming that home prices still have a ways to fall, something like 19 million homeowners may be under water by 2010 (only a few million of whom will be struggling to make their payments).Now, who should be rescued?Let’s start by acknowledging that morality cannot be the main criteria, unfortunately.The government has already passed the point of drawing fine moral distinctions and is now in the business of stabilizing the economy by whatever means necessary. Someone might argue, then, for rescuing everyone who might end up in foreclosure, regardless of the reason.The problem with this approach — and it’s the heart of the problem with any big-time homeowner rescue — is probably obvious. As soon as the government announces that it will help everyone at risk of foreclosure, a lot of people are suddenly going to decide they’re at risk of foreclosure.Homeowners who are under water will have an incentive to think of their homes in cold economic terms and threaten to walk away, while those who can just barely afford their monthly payments will have reason to slide into delinquency. Multiply 19 million mortgages by a couple of hundred thousand dollars, and the government could be left with $4 trillion in obligations.The other day, I spoke with Sandi Lucia, a saleswoman in Northern California who had lost her job, has had to take a new one at lower pay and was now struggling to meet her monthly payments. Ms. Lucia seems committed to doing everything she can to keep paying her bills. But she also put her finger on the problem. “I want to keep paying my mortgage,” she said. “But if everyone is getting bailed out, what’s the point?”In recent weeks, several intriguing ideas for helping homeowners have begun making the rounds. Mr. Blinder thinks the government should spend about half of the $700 billion bailout fund to buy and then refinance the mortgages of people who, based on their debt and income, appear to have little chance of making their payments. My colleague Joe Nocera has written about a plan that would allow homeowners to forfeit their deeds and rent their homes back from the bank. Ideas like these can be part of the solution.But this financial crisis isn’t going to be solved by a magic bullet. It’s going to require a smorgasbord of programs — some aimed at homeowners in trouble, some aimed at the credit markets, some aimed at the job market — as well as a whole lot of time and patience.The only way to stop the coming rise in foreclosures, at this point, would be a bailout of enormous proportions. And if we’re unlucky enough to get to the point when a $4 trillion program seems necessary to resolve the crisis, there would be a lot of ways to spend the money beyond devoting it all to underwater homeowners. They aren’t the only ones, after all, who live on Main Street.'"
"'08-10-22,'0','Mr. Sununu is in a grueling rematch against former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen in a state that is emblematic of a national climate in which Republicans are in danger of ceding Democrats a filibuster-proof Senate majority for the first time in 30 years.Also emblematic is the quandary Mr. Sununu faces in relation to Mr. McCain’s faltering campaign. Two other Republican senators up for re-election, Susan Collins of Maine and Norm Coleman of Minnesota, have called on the McCain camp to stop automated phone calls criticizing Mr. Obama that they fear will anger voters.In Oregon, another vulnerable Republican, Senator Gordon H. Smith, has even run television advertisements suggesting that he and Mr. Obama are of like minds on some issues.With Senate races everywhere overshadowed by the fight for the White House, perhaps nowhere is the top of the ballot a bigger or more complicated factor than in New Hampshire — a contest that both parties view as critical in determining how much control the Democrats will have in Congress.Mr. McCain, who won the presidential primaries here by emphasizing his maverick flair, had long held the potential for broad appeal among New Hampshire’s independent-minded electorate. That, combined with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s victory in the Democratic primary, left Mrs. Shaheen reluctant to tie herself too closely to Mr. Obama.New Hampshire voters know Mr. McCain well — he campaigned tirelessly here during the primary, and held more than 100 town-hall-style meetings. But some voters who supported him when he first ran in 2000 now say they are disappointed in him.“I can’t listen to John McCain anymore,” said Cathy Farley, who manages a dental office in Manchester and said she found it unbearable to watch Mr. McCain in last Wednesday night’s debate, even though she voted for him in the primary in January and also in 2000 when he thumped Mr. Bush by 18 points.Mrs. Farley, an independent, said that for many years she did not have health insurance and that she would most likely vote for Mr. Obama, in part because she expected he would do a better job expanding coverage.But she also said that she had unhappy memories of Mrs. Shaheen as governor from 1997 to 2002, and that left her open to voting for Mr. Sununu.More common, though, seem to be voters like Mrs. Farley’s husband, Mike, who plans to back Mr. Obama and Mrs. Shaheen, and is evidence of the growing numerical challenge that Republicans face.The University of New Hampshire this month released a study of the state’s demographics, showing substantial gains among Democrats and independents who identify themselves more closely with the Democrats.About one-quarter of the electorate — nearly 250,000 voters — has changed since Mr. Sununu and Mrs. Shaheen first ran against each other in 2002. “Both young voters and recent migrants are more likely to identify themselves as Democrats and less likely to identify with Republicans than are established voters,” the authors wrote.In 2002, when President Bush was still popular, Republicans had an 11-percentage-point advantage among registered voters and Mr. Sununu won by slightly more than 4 percent. This year, registered voters are split evenly, the presidential race is expected to generate record turnout and many voters say they cannot wait to usher Mr. Bush out.Under the circumstances, Democrats say they are virtually unbeatable. Buoyed by the enormous popularity of Gov. John Lynch, who is expected to win re-election overwhelmingly, Democrats say they hope to solidify the gains made in 2006 when they captured the State Legislature and both Congressional seats, riding a wave of discontent with the Iraq war.Rebecca Fee, 66, a grandmother of two from Salem, who attended an Obama rally on Thursday at Mack’s apple orchard in Londonderry, said she had switched to independent after being a longtime Republican. She voted for Mr. McCain in the Republican primary in 2000, then for Ralph Nader that November.Wearing a “Dog Lovers for Obama” button, she said that this year she would vote for Mr. Obama and for Mrs. Shaheen, even though she did not like Mrs. Shaheen as governor and felt some loyalty to Mr. Sununu, who grew up in Salem.“I probably will vote for Jeanne Shaheen because I think it’s important to get the 60 senators for the majority,” Ms. Fee said. As for Mr. McCain, she said: “I’m so sad. He used to be a good man, somebody you could trust.”Mrs. Shaheen was not at the rally in Londonderry. But in the candidates’ first televised debate on Tuesday night, which featured several heated, even angry exchanges, she tied herself to the Democratic nominee.“I am confident that if we have new leadership — I believe we are going to have Barack Obama as the next president — and we have a new senator in Washington representing New Hampshire, that we can move this country in a different direction,” she said.The state Republican Party has struggled since Mr. Sununu’s last race in 2002, when an effort by party operatives to jam Democratic phone lines and disrupt get-out-the-vote efforts led to convictions of four men on federal charges and left the state party virtually broke under a pile of legal bills.One upside for Republicans this year, though, is that the state has ended straight-ticket voting, the practice of allowing voters to pull the lever once for all candidates of one party. Straight-ticket voting was a major factor in the Democratic sweep in 2006.Advisers and supporters of Mr. Sununu say he can win even if Mr. McCain fails to carry New Hampshire. Although Mr. Sununu has trailed in polls throughout the year, most recently by five to nine points, he is not as far behind Mrs. Shaheen as Mr. McCain is behind Mr. Obama.“All we need is for McCain to keep it close,” said Fergus Cullen, the chairman of the state Republican Party. “And he is.”But even some of the most steadfast conservative Republicans said they do not expect Mr. McCain to win New Hampshire this year. Take Andrew Hemingway, his wife, Katie, and their 13-month-old daughter, Morgan.“We’re very conservative Republicans,” Mr. Hemingway, 26, said as they left a rally in Weirs Beach, where Ms. Palin held Morgan up on the stage before a backdrop of Lake Winnipesaukee and fall foliage. “We’re excited about Sarah Palin,” he said. “We’re not so excited about McCain.”The couple intend to vote for Mr. McCain, they just have no hope he can win. “Obama is going to win this state,” Mr. Hemingway said.'"

"'08-10-22,'0','The McClatchy Company, the newspaper publisher, said on Tuesday that its third-quarter profit beat Wall Street expectations, but its advertising revenue fell faster in September than earlier in the year.Net income was $4.2 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.3 billion, or $16.42 a share, in the same period a year earlier, when it took an accounting charge to reflect the poor conditions in the newspaper business.In the latest quarter, net income excluding one-time charges was $10.4 million, or 13 cents a share, topping the 10 cents expected by analysts.Revenue in the period, which ended Sept. 28, fell 16 percent, to $451.6 million, from $540.3 million.Combined revenue for print and online ads dropped 19.9 percent in September compared with a year ago, worse than the 19.5 percent reduction in June, which had been the year’s steepest drop.Gary B.

"'08-10-22,'0','“A full analysis of potential liability will require consultation with a knowledgeable white-collar criminal attorney,” Ms. Kingsley wrote of the embezzlement, which occurred in 2000 but was not disclosed until this summer.In a telephone interview on Monday, Ms. Kingsley and Bertha Lewis, Acorn’s top executive, said the group had begun addressing the concerns raised in the report.“Has everything been done yet? No,” Ms. Lewis said. “We’ve been at this for three months, and we have taken everything she said in the report very seriously. It’s a huge undertaking.”Over the weekend, Ms. Kingsley said, the national board adopted several good-governance policies, like appointing an audit committee for the first time.Disclosure of her report, which was distributed to Acorn and 10 affiliates, increases pressure on the organization at a particularly troublesome time. Besides the inquiries into its voter registration efforts, Acorn faces demands for back taxes by the Internal Revenue Service and various state tax authorities. At the same time, foundations that have backed Acorn are withholding support.Ms. Kingsley’s concerns about the way Acorn affiliates work together could fuel the controversy over Acorn’s voter registration efforts, which are largely underwritten by an affiliated charity, Project Vote. Project Vote hires Acorn to do voter registration work on its behalf, and the two groups say they have registered 1.3 million voters this year.As a federally tax-exempt charity, Project Vote is subject to prohibitions on partisan political activity. But Acorn, which is a nonprofit membership corporation under Louisiana law, though subject to federal taxation, is not bound by the same restrictions.“Project Vote and Acorn have a written agreement that specifies that all work is nonpartisan,” Michael Slater, Project Vote’s new executive director, wrote in answer to e-mailed questions about the relationship.But Ms. Kingsley found that the tight relationship between Project Vote and Acorn made it impossible to document that Project Vote’s money had been used in a strictly nonpartisan manner. Until the embezzlement scandal broke last summer, Project Vote’s board was made up entirely of Acorn staff members and Acorn members.Ms. Kingsley’s report raised concerns not only about a lack of documentation to demonstrate that no charitable money was used for political activities but also about which organization controlled strategic decisions.She wrote that the same people appeared to be deciding which regions to focus on for increased voter engagement for Acorn and Project Vote. Zach Pollett, for instance, was Project Vote’s executive director and Acorn’s political director, until July, when he relinquished the former title. Mr. Pollett continues to work as a consultant for Project Vote through another Acorn affiliate.“As a result, we may not be able to prove that 501(c)3 resources are not being directed to specific regions based on impermissible partisan considerations,” Ms. Kingsley said, referring to the section of the tax code concerning rules for charities.She also found problems with governance of Acorn affiliates. “Board meetings are not held, or if they are, minutes are not kept, or if minutes are kept, they never make it into the files,” she wrote.Project Vote, for example, had only one independent director since it received a federal tax exemption in 1994, and he was on the board for less than two years, its tax forms show. Since then, the board has consisted of Acorn staff members and two Acorn members who pay monthly dues.But George Hampton, who was listed as a board member from 1994 to 2006, said that while he had been a member of Acorn, he had never heard of Project Vote. “I don’t know anything about this,” Mr. Hampton said.Cleo Mata, listed as a board member on tax forms from 1997 to 2006, also said she was not aware she was on the Project Vote board. “If that’s what you say,” Ms. Mata told a visitor to her home in Pasadena, Tex. “I tell you that I didn’t realize I was.”Mr. Slater said he “cannot speak to why Mr. Hampton and Ms. Mata fail to recall their involvement on the Project Vote board.” He noted that Ms. Mata, 63, was “in poor health.”Project Vote assembled a new board this fall that Ms. Kingsley said had greater independence, even though five of the six new members have longstanding ties to Acorn.Ms. Kingsley’s description of the embezzlement differed from the organization’s. In an interview July 8, Ms. Lewis said 90 percent of the $948,607 Mr. Rathke’s brother embezzled came from Acorn and the rest from its charity affiliates.But Ms. Kingsley reported that $215,000 was charged to an Acorn American Express card paid by the Acorn Beneficial Association, a pension fund that has been replaced by a new Acorn pension fund. After the embezzlement was discovered, the Acorn Beneficial Association wrote off the embezzlement as a gift to Acorn.Acorn contends that the fund is not covered by federal pension fund regulations, but Ms. Kingsley wrote: “It is nonetheless the case that a number of organizations, possibly including unions and charities, paid funds into the A.B.A. for entirely different purposes. They did not make those contributions in order to make a gift to Acorn.”Ms. Kingsley also found that the Acorn Fund, a health care benefits fund, had advanced “a large amount of money” to Acorn, adding that it appeared that the money was used to cover “the cash shortfall caused by the embezzlement.”'"

Kudrin, was released Tuesday after spending 11 months in pretrial detention in an embezzlement case viewed as having political undertones. The release was a positive sign for Mr. Kudrin, a leading liberal in the Russian government.Before his arrest last November, Mr. Storchak had served as chief liaison with financial organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.A successor to Mr. Storchak, Dmitri V. Pankin, is now leading negotiations to lend money to Iceland, whose once-booming financial system collapsed this month.The case was a blow to Mr. Kudrin, who publicly described the embezzlement charges as baseless.Prosecutors said Mr. Storchak was released because they had completed their investigation. They added that he could no longer interfere with witnesses and that he had pledged not to leave Moscow before his trial.Mr. Kudrin’s standing is being closely watched as a proxy indicator for Russia’s approach to the financial crisis. He advocates steps intended to modernize and diversify the economy away from reliance on oil and gas, while a faction of officials with backgrounds in the Soviet-era K.G.B. and military favor strengthening the natural resources sector.Last month, The New Times, a magazine in Moscow, reported that hard-liners upset with the terms of the Russian bailout were trying to engineer Mr. Kudrin’s ouster; the release of his deputy now suggests he weathered this challenge.'"

"'08-10-22,'0','History suggests that OPEC will face a tough time propping up prices as oil consumption slows and the world teeters on the edge of a global recession, analysts said. Some experts warn that if the cartel took too much oil off the market, it could push prices up so much as to worsen the global economic crisis.“OPEC’s problem is they don’t know how much demand is falling,” said Jan Stuart, an energy economist at UBS. “So the risk they run is either they don’t do enough, or they do too much. That’s a tough choice.”Nobuo Tanaka, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said a cut in production could harm consumers and delay an economic recovery. “The slowdown may be prolonged,” Mr. Tanaka told reporters on Monday in Paris, where the energy agency, which advises industrialized countries, is based.Oil prices settled at $70.89 a barrel on Tuesday, down $3.36 and near the 14-month low they reached last week.The biggest question is what price the cartel is prepared to defend. In 2000, producers adopted a price band of $22 to $28 a barrel, and adjusted production levels accordingly. The mechanism was imperfect, and many producers felt it constrained them, but it basically worked to ensure stability in oil markets.But defending a price requires spare capacity, so that production can be raised if prices get too high, as well as discipline on the part of OPEC members, so that production can be lowered when prices fall. OPEC abandoned its price band when its spare capacity virtually disappeared in 2005 amid rapidly rising global oil demand.Now, with consumption growth slowing sharply and new oil projects coming online, some spare capacity has become available.Lawrence Eagles, an oil analyst at JPMorgan, said in a research note that he thought the “price-band mechanism offers the best way for OPEC to manage the market under current conditions.” Mr. Eagles said OPEC did not want prices to slip below $70 a barrel, and would be more comfortable with prices around $80.The cartel, which controls 40 percent of the world’s oil exports, has found it difficult in the past to get all its members to abide by production cuts. When prices fall, producers have an incentive to increase their output to maximize revenue, not stick with OPEC quotas.Producers are aware that high prices pose a risk to the global economy. Oil consumption is already falling sharply in developed countries, and there is a rising risk that oil demand could slow even in fast-growing developing nations.OPEC’s researchers recently downgraded their forecasts for global oil demand because of the financial crisis. OPEC expects global demand to rise 550,000 barrels a day this year, to 86.5 million barrels a day.For many analysts, these expectations are still too optimistic. A growing number of independent experts now say they believe that global oil consumption may fall this year, for the first time since 1993.“OPEC will have to decide how far it can ignore the global economic crisis and pressure from consuming countries,” wrote researchers at the Center for Global Energy Studies, a London consulting group founded by Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, a former Saudi oil minister. “The real danger is that a big cut will send prices soaring again, putting the global economy at even greater risk.”Some producers may feel they have little choice. Many exporters have become used to high prices, which feed growing government and social budgets. The group’s 13 members earned $730 billion from oil and gas exports last year, up 12 percent from the previous year, according to OPEC statistics. This year they are on track to hit $1 trillion.Not all oil producers are affected by falling prices in the same way. Iran and Venezuela, for example, need $95 a barrel to balance their budgets, according to various estimates. Both Nigeria and Iraq recently said they would reduce their budgets for next year because of lower prices.Iran’s oil minister, Gholamhossein Nozari, has been among the most vocal proponents of an aggressive reduction in output, suggesting OPEC may have to cut production by as much as 2.5 million barrels a day. “The era of cheap oil is finished,” he told reporters in Tehran on Tuesday.His comments came as Iran, Russia and Qatar discussed the creation of an OPEC-like group for natural gas exports, according to Reuters. The three countries, the biggest holders of gas reserves, will form a “big gas troika” that will meet each quarter, according to Alexei Miller, the chief executive of Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned natural gas giant.Even conservative oil producers allied with the United States, like Saudi Arabia, may take the view at Friday’s meeting that prices have fallen too much. In the absence of an official price target, Saudi experts estimate the kingdom needs oil at $50 to $55 a barrel to balance its budget. A production cut would be a major turnaround for the Saudis, who have recently been pumping full out and had been eager to see oil prices fall below $100 a barrel.Outside of OPEC, producers like Russia are also threatened by a prolonged period of lower prices. Last month, the Russian government sent a high-level delegation to attend an OPEC meeting as observers, a sign that Moscow is anxious.“OPEC will have to act like a cartel for the first time in six years if they want to stabilize the markets,” said Lawrence Goldstein, an energy economist. “The problem is they’ve been fairly ineffective as a cartel. But they are good at crisis management. And this is a crisis for them.”'"
"'08-10-22,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — Riding a wave of consumer enthusiasm for its hand-held iPhone smartphones, Apple reported strong fiscal fourth-quarter profits that outpaced Wall Street’s expectations. But it warned of slower sales ahead.Analysts think of Apple as a bellwether of the consumer electronics industry that should be showing early effects of a slowing consumer economy. The company said Tuesday, however, that any slowdown that it detected late in the quarter ended Sept. 30 might just as well have been caused by customers who were choosing to delay purchases for the new Macintosh portables that were introduced last week.Apple had strong sales in all of its major product lines. It also said that it had sold more iPhones in the quarter than it had since the smartphone was introduced in June of last year.Underscoring the company’s confidence, Apple chief executive Steven P. Jobs participated in the company’s quarterly financial call with analysts for the first time since October 2000. “Some remarkable things are happening, set against the backdrop of the global economic slowdown,” said Mr. Jobs, who stressed several times that he was not an economist. (He said at one point that “your next door neighbor” is as likely to accurately forecast the economic future as an Apple executive.)However, he did not mince words about the company’s progress in quickly becoming a dominant force in the cellphone industry, even against cellphone makers, like Research in Motion, that cater to corporations. “Apple outsold R.I.M. last quarter,” he said. “R.I.M. is a good company that makes good products and so it is surprising.”Apple sold about 6.9 million of its iPhone 3G units in its fourth quarter, compared with 6.1 million cellphones for R.I.M., he said. Apple has already surpassed its goal of selling 10 million iPhones during 2008, he said.'"
"'08-10-22,'0','With both government supporters and protesters periodically parading through Bangkok, political leaders urged calm. Two people were killed and hundreds were injured in clashes this month between the police and antigovernment demonstrators.The ruling on Tuesday was made by a special nine-member bench of the Supreme Court known as the Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions. The judges ruled 5 to 4 that Mr. Thaksin abused his power when his wife, Pojaman, purchased a plot of desirable land from a government agency controlled by the central bank.The judges ruled that because Mr. Thaksin was prime minister he was “supposed to work for the benefit of the public.”Prosecutors had argued that the amount his wife paid, about $22 million, was well below market value, but that argument appeared to fail. Ms. Pojaman was acquitted of all charges and the judges did not order the couple to forfeit the land, as prosecutors had requested.Thailand’s political crisis has increasingly been fought in the courts, with Mr. Thaksin and his allies more often than not on the losing side.Mr. Thaksin’s political party, Thai Rak Thai, was disbanded by a court last year. A successor party, the People Power Party, which now controls the government, is also being threatened with dissolution.The former leader of the People Power Party, Samak Sundaravej, was forced to resign last month as prime minister when a court ruled that remuneration from a cooking show on television violated the Constitution. He was replaced as prime minister by Somchai Wongsawat, Mr. Thaksin’s brother-in-law.The judges on Tuesday issued a fresh warrant for Mr. Thaksin’s arrest, adding to several already outstanding. But it appears unlikely that British authorities will hand him over to Thailand, given Britain’s strict extradition laws.Prosecutors said Tuesday that Mr. Thaksin’s conviction would “expire” within 10 years. His sentence was lower than the maximum three years provided under the law.Mr. Thaksin has an incentive to stay engaged in Thai politics: the $2 billion of his assets in Thailand that were frozen by the courts. In the two years since his ouster in a military coup, Mr. Thaksin has remained very popular among farmers in the north and northeastern part of the country, who make up a large part of the electorate.'"
"'08-10-22,'0','Although those stresses began to ease after the federal government moved to guarantee money-market assets, many investors remained fearful that another ill-timed collapse could cause a more serious run on the funds.Worried about a new round of withdrawals, many money-market investors moved their funds out of the market for commercial paper, or short-term corporate i.o.u.’s, and into safer Treasury bills and cash equivalents that matured overnight. “Liquidity to them today means having something that matures the next day for cash,” said a person close to the Fed’s new program who did not have authorization to discuss it publicly.That left banks and businesses that depend on commercial paper in a jam, and the Fed scrambling to find a solution.The answer came from an industry group led by JPMorgan Chase, according to individuals close to the situation who also were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The bank, along with a group of several major money-market investors, approached the Fed earlier this month with a plan to set up privately run entities that could start purchasing short-term debt from the funds.With the Fed providing the financing, the assurance of a powerful buyer could coax money-market investors back into the commercial paper market, the reasoning went. In turn, the fund would provide an easy source of liquidity in the case of withdrawals.Round-the-clock meetings then began in New York and Washington, with the participants communicating by conference call. A final flurry last weekend culminated in an agreement on Tuesday morning, followed quickly by a public announcement before trading opened in New York.The new program “should improve the liquidity position of money-market investors, thus increasing their ability to meet any further redemption requests and their willingness to invest in money-market instruments,” the Fed said in a statement. “Improved money-market conditions will enhance the ability of banks and other financial intermediaries to accommodate the credit needs of businesses and households.”The actual purchasing of the short-term notes will be accomplished by a group of five funds administered by JPMorgan Chase. Under the terms of the program, each fund will purchase short-term debt from a group of 10 financial institutions, for a total of 50 providers, none of which were identified. Each institution will provide no more than 15 percent of the total debt assets of each fund.The central bank had already said it would provide direct financing to businesses by buying three-month commercial paper, and a separate program provides loans to banks and other financial institutions that buy asset-backed commercial paper from money-market mutual funds.The Fed, which did not set a date for the program to start, said that it might be expanded beyond money-market mutual funds.“This is the first thawing that I really see in terms of helping the commercial paper market unravel itself,” Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, said in a conference call on Tuesday morning.'"
"'08-10-22,'0','NEW DELHI — After more than 60 years, trade opened Tuesday across the de facto border dividing the Indian and Pakistani parts of the disputed region of Kashmir.Sixteen Indian trucks, loaded mostly with apples and walnuts, rumbled across the border on Tuesday morning, said Pawan Kotwal, the commerce secretary for Indian-administered Kashmir. Trucks from Pakistan later made the reverse trip. Trade is initially limited to 21 approved items and two days a week.Nevertheless, on their long journey of rivalry and reconciliation, the reopening of the trade route represents a breakthrough for India and Pakistan, especially because it follows fresh acrimony. After four years of relative peace, the dividing Line of Control this year was again the scene of gunfire as India once more accused Pakistan of allowing militants to sneak across the border.Relations worsened with attacks on Indian soil over the past several months and hit bottom in July with the bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, for which India partly blamed a Pakistani intelligence agency.The decision to reopen the trade crossing came out of a meeting last month between President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. It is meant to bolster confidence between the nations and open contact between ordinary Kashmiris separated by the six decades of conflict.'"

"'08-10-23,'1','“In order to make the bank package acceptable to the public, you need more measures for the economy,” said Wolfgang Novak, the head of policy planning under Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor. “This is a sort of political correctness at work.”BayernLB, a Munich-based bank that took heavy losses on a portfolio of mortgage-linked securities, said Tuesday that it would accept partial government ownership in exchange for a cash infusion. The bank said it would lose 1 billion euros in the third quarter, with more losses possible.The revelation immediately claimed a political casualty. Erwin Huber, the Bavarian finance minister who sits on the bank’s board, resigned Wednesday despite being a powerful member of the regional conservative party.Banks here have often been viewed with suspicion — and never more so than now.The government has emphasized that the rescue program is voluntary, and by all accounts there has been little pressure to sign up. But in the heated atmosphere of pre-election politics, banks that do go to the well are worried about being perceived as weak, at least in the court of public opinion.“The problem is that you have to take humiliation along with money,” said an adviser to some of the biggest German banks, who requested anonymity because decisions on participation had not been made.Deutsche Bank, which insists it can do without government help, fell into a political buzz saw this week nevertheless.Der Spiegel, the German newsmagazine, wrote Monday that Deutsche Bank’s chief executive, Josef Ackermann, had said privately he would be “ashamed” to go to the state for help. Though Deutsche Bank denied the report, German officials called on the bank to support the plan publicly.The reaction angered bank officials because Mr. Ackermann had advised the government on the bailout and helped rescue two banks since the financial crisis began last year. Also, there is no consensus in financial markets that Deutsche Bank needs to raise capital.Still, other German banks have avoided Deutsche Bank’s approach of lobbying for the bailout, then swearing off it.Klaus-Peter Müller, the chairman of Commerzbank, said this week that his bank was considering seeking capital from the state. In an interview with Der Spiegel, Mr. Müller said that bankers needed to “take their hats off” to the politicians who pushed through the rescue package so quickly.Analysts at Merrill Lynch said this week that Deutsche Bank could need 8.9 billion euros, more than any other European bank. But, Crédit Agricole Cheuvreux, another investment bank, recommended this week that its clients buy Deutsche shares.Some banking analysts suggest that Deutsche Bank might tap the plan out of solidarity with other banks. Others think the best strategy may be to wait and see whether financial markets call for banks to be better capitalized.“Every bank has to take a look at whether this makes sense,” said Dieter Hain, an analyst with Fairesearch in Frankfurt. “It’s legitimate enough to take time.”With the economy here slowing but avoiding an outright credit freeze, German officials are devising measures they hope will create some momentum. Estimates suggest gross domestic product could grow about 1.7 percent this year, thanks to a solid first half, but growth will grind to a halt in 2009.Germany still has a bias toward cutting taxes, not spending, and this calculus has conditioned the government’s response to demands for a stimulus.“The government is avoiding this label because they are worried that the list of demands will get ever longer,” said Wolfgang Clement, a former German economy minister. “So you say you are doing targeted measures.”Those could include speeding up changes to the tax deductibility of health insurance premiums, which was planned for Jan. 1, 2010. That would bring 9 billion euros into the economy. Some officials have proposed aid to the auto industry, or easing taxation of environmentally friendly vehicles. In the past, KfW, a big state-owned bank, has often stepped up construction financing in tough times.But doing nothing is not an option politically.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, though ahead in opinion polls, could see that lead sag if conditions deteriorate. And the Social Democrats must contend with the rising appeal of the Left Party, an amalgam of former East German Communists and western populists.Politicians need something more to their credit than rescuing banks, and saying they gave the economy a push would be ideal. “Some people are clearly nervous that if you can’t make some of these arguments going into the elections, you will be in trouble,” said Uwe Andersen, a political science professor at the University of Bochum.'"

"'08-10-23,'1','“Obviously, we were super-excited about winning,” said Burrell, who was 0 for 3 with two strikeouts, “But we need to play better baseball. Hopefully we’ll come out tomorrow and give a better effort.”The Phillies had eight hits Wednesday night. Four players, including Utley and Victorino, each had two. Victorino could not believe his team went 0 for 13 with runners in scoring position and playfully challenged a few reporters to prove as much, reminding them that he did, in fact, score the Phillies’ third run, on Carlos Ruiz’s grounder.“We may have been 0-for, but we still scored,” Victorino said. “You understand what I was saying. We were able to manufacture a run. That’s big.”The Phillies had not played in six days, which meant six days of answering questions about the layoff affecting their timing, six days of conceiving new and creative ways to say that, no, they were not worried. Because, really, what else could they say? That they were freaked out? That Kazmir would throw a no-hitter? That they assumed that they would endure the same fate as the 2007 Colorado Rockies and the 2006 Detroit Tigers, who stumbled in the World Series after a weeklong intermission?“I think I heard both managers say that the layoff hurt them,” said Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel, referring to the Rockies’ Clint Hurdle and the Tigers’ Jim Leyland. “But to me, did it hurt us? I don’t think so because I think we stayed focused on what we was doing.”They practiced in simulated conditions in Philadelphia, stuck with their normal routines and worked out for two days at Tropicana Field to get acclimated. The Tigers took a similar approach, then managed four hits in a 7-2 loss to St. Louis in the opener and lost in five games. Same with the Rockies, who, after an eight-day layoff, had six hits in a 13-1 Game 1 defeat in Boston. Not that the players would admit as much afterward, but the Phillies hitting coach Milt Thompson said he sensed that the time off affected them“You have to remember, we haven’t played in a week,” Thompson said. “It took a while to get our timing back, but we still found a way to win.”Thompson praised how they worked deep counts against Kazmir, forcing him to throw at least 19 pitches in three of his six innings, but also lamented the opportunities squandered. One came in the second, after Victorino and Pedro Felix reached base to begin the inning. With one out and Victorino on third, Rollins lofted a fly to shallow center. Even speedy players like Victorino rarely tag up and try to score on balls like that, but particularly with B. J. Upton, who has a powerful arm, playing center. But Victorino bolted for home and was out by a few steps.“It was miscommunication,” said Victorino, referring to his directive from the third-base coach Steve Smith. “I heard, ‘Go,’ ” and he said, ‘No.’ ”Aggressive base running comes naturally to the Phillies, who ranked fourth in baseball with 136 stolen bases. Their three steals Wednesday were not necessarily ordered to help out an offense trying to find its groove. But the Phillies know that they cannot rely on Burrell, Howard and Rollins, just as they cannot depend on Utley to always carry them, either.“I think we did a lot of things right — we had good at-bats, a lot of good base runners,” Utley said. “I’ve said this before, it’s better to come up empty with a lot of guys in scoring position than not have any at all.”'"
"'08-10-23,'1','Patricia Olive Kavanagh was born in Durban, South Africa, where her father was a journalist. (The ballet critic Julie Kavanagh is a half-sister.) She studied at the University of Cape Town but set her sights on becoming an actress and performed briefly with a touring company. After arriving in Britain in 1964, she did appear in an uncredited, nonspeaking role in the film version of Dylan Thomas’s “Under Milk Wood,” but this turned out to be the high point of a noncareer that she had already abandoned.“I never got paid, but I did get to snog Richard Burton,” she later said.While working as a copywriter for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, she answered an ad offering employment as literary agent and found herself in the presence of A. D. Peters, a legendary agent who showed her the ropes. It was Peters, she said, who taught her the value of silence as a negotiating tool and put her to work selling serial and newspaper rights for authors in the company’s illustrious stable. Her early clients included Arthur Koestler, Rebecca West, Tom Wolfe and S. J. Perelman.She developed a reputation for good taste, sound judgment, few words and careful management of her clients’ careers, as well as a stylishly intimidating manner.“She was never one to undersell anything, and she was always on your case, but there was always the velvet glove,” said Sonny Mehta, the chairman and chief executive of Alfred A. Knopf.She could be as tough with her authors as she was with publishers, refusing to varnish harsh truths or indulge writerly fantasies that ignored the economics of the business. At her death, her long list of clients included Clive James, Margaret Drabble, Robert Harris and the British poet laureate Andrew Motion.Behind the patrician cheekbones and the formidable reserve lurked a wicked sense of humor. “I would sometimes fax her a New Yorker cartoon I thought would amuse her,” Ms. Pagnamenta said. “She would e-mail back, saying, ‘Very droll, Zoë. Hollow laugh ensues.’ ”Wit was not the only surprise up her sleeve. In the 1980s she left Mr. Barnes to embark on an affair with Jeanette Winterson, the author of “Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit.” She later returned to her husband, who survives her. The affair was fictionalized by Ms. Winterson in the novel “Written on the Body” (1992).In 2001, Peters, Fraser & Dunlop, as the A. D. Peters agency had become after a 1988 merger, was bought by a sports marketing company, CSS Stellar. Along with several other disgruntled agents, Ms. Kavanagh left the company last September to form a new agency, United Agents. All her clients left with her.“I doubt if any one of them hesitated, any more than I did,” Clive James wrote in The Guardian of London.Ms. Kavanagh continued to cultivate new writers to the end, signing Ben Goldacre, who writes the Bad Science column for The Guardian, and Jane Borodale, whose first novel, “The Book of Fires,” she sold this summer to HarperCollins.“She was fantastically efficient and just the person you wanted to have represent you,” said Robert Harris, the author of “Pompeii.” “There was no one quite like her really. And she was exotic, like a bird of paradise.”'"
"'08-10-23,'1','Even a casual glimpse of San Diego’s fabled Hotel del Coronado on Coronado Island calls to mind the Technicolor vibrancy and whimsy of the Wizard of Oz. Thus, it’s no small surprise to learn that 100 years ago, “The Del,” as locals call it, was Oz author L. Frank Baum’s favorite winter haunt. Since then, the red-and-white-splashed, multi-turreted hotel has welcomed everybody from U.S. Presidents to drag queens—Billy Wilder filmed “Some Like it Hot” here in 1958, with Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe.Suburban San Diego overflows with golf options, including the site of the 2008 U.S. Open, Torrey Pines. But if you're staying at the Del, or just looking to play golf on Coronado Island, you’ve got one choice: Coronado Municipal Golf Course. It’s only a couple of blocks from the Hotel Del, but its cast of characters couldn’t be more different. Make no mistake: Coronado is a true muni. Tee times can be tough to obtain for anyone, and require an additional fee. Walk-ons usually have better luck. Half of the eucalyptus- and pine-lined, billiard table-flat holes are so non-descript, they’re forgotten the instant you’ve finished them. New white soft sand fills the bunkers at the first hole, old brown stuff greets you at the second. Fivesomes are permitted, provided there are three carts in the group. Oh, and every player must have his own set of clubs. Not a bag, just a set. At the first tee, they paired me with a gentleman who played without glove, golf shoes or bag. He did possess a cardboard box full of clubs that he strapped to his cart.So why should the well-heeled denizens of The Del—or anybody else for that matter—venture to Coronado Muni? L. Frank Baum would tell you “for the adventure.” In truth, you go because it’s one of the best golf values in the country. Coronado’s other nine holes, notably the closing stretch, offer memorable views of San Diego Bay. The 406-yard third hole practically smacks into the Coronado-San Diego Bay Bridge as it eases past massive Navy ships. The 370-yard, par-4 16th takes in a marina dotted with sailboats. The 18th tee is perched at water’s edge. Coronado’s 6,590 breeze-fueled yards offer sufficient challenge for vacation golf and for the amount of play that clogs the course, it’s in surprisingly good shape, with springy fairway turf and reasonably quick greens. Best of all, it’s an easy walk—and to do so costs just $25. For the same price as one oceanfront summer night at the Hotel Del, one could play Coronado Muni every day for a month. Toto, we’re not in Kansas anymore.'"

Dingell, a Democrat, and Fred Upton, a Republican, comes amid plunging vehicle sales as auto lenders struggle to find financing.In addition, two of Detroit’s automakers, General Motors and Chrysler, are considering a merger to combine their cash reserves and cut costs.“In this current economic environment, it is imperative that the government ensures that liquidity is restored so that the U.S. auto industry is able to function until normalcy is restored to credit markets,” the lawmakers say in a draft of a letter to the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Fed chairman, Ben S.

"'08-10-23,'1','In his endorsement of Mr. Obama, noted that “the new president is going to have to fix the reputation that we’ve left with the rest of the world.” That’s not because we crave admiration, but because cooperation is essential to address 21st-century challenges; you can’t fire missiles at the global financial crisis.In his endorsement, Mr. Powell added that an Obama election “will also not only electrify our country, I think it’ll electrify the world.” You can already see that. A 22-nation survey by the BBC found that voters abroad preferred Mr. Obama to Mr. McCain in every single country — by four to one over all. Nearly half of those in the BBC poll said that the election of Mr. Obama, an African-American, would “fundamentally change” their perceptions of the United States.is particularly intoxicated by the possibility of restoring amity with America in an Obama presidency. As The Economist put it: “Across the Continent, Bush hatred has been replaced by Obama-mania.”Steven Kull, director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes, which conducted the BBC poll, said that at a recent international conference he attended in , many Muslims voiced astonishment at Mr. Obama’s rise because it was so much at odds with their assumptions about the United States. Remember that the one thing countless millions of people around the world “know” about the United States is that it is controlled by a cabal of white bankers and Jews who use police with fire hoses to repress blacks. To them, Mr. Obama’s rise triggers severe cognitive dissonance.“It’s an anomaly, so contrary to their expectation that it makes them receptive to a new paradigm for the U.S.,” Mr. Kull said.Europeans like to mock the vapidity of American politics, but they also acknowledge that it would be difficult to imagine a brown or black person leading or .As for , Mr. Obama’s Kenyan father was of the Luo tribe, a minority that has long suffered brutal discrimination in both and in (where it is known as the Acholi). The bitter joke in East Africa is that a Luo has more of a chance of becoming president in the United States than in Kenya.Yet before we get too far with the self-congratulations, it’s worth remembering something else.In the western industrialized world, full of university graduates and marinated in principles of egalitarianism, the idea of electing a member of a racial minority to the highest office seems an astonishing breakthrough. But ’s 95 percent black population elected a white man as its prime minister in 1980, and kept him in office throughout that decade.Likewise, the African nation of has elected a white prime minister of French origin. And don’t forget that is overwhelmingly Hindu but now has a Sikh prime minister and a white Christian as president of its ruling party, and until last year it had a Muslim in the largely ceremonial position of president.Look, Mr. Obama’s skin color is a bad reason to vote for him or against him. Substance should always trump symbolism.Yet if this election goes as the polls suggest, we may find a path to restore America’s global influence — and thus to achieve some of our international objectives — in part because the world is concluding that Americans can, after all, see beyond a person’s epidermis. My hunch is that that is right, and that we’re every bit as open-minded about racial minorities as Jamaicans already were a quarter-century ago.'"
"'08-10-23,'1','You cannot, for example, buy a house with your I.R.A. and live in it, lend money from your I.R.A. to your brother or use your own contracting firm to remodel a dilapidated house bought with your I.R.A. Those who violate this rule, even inadvertently, risk being taxed on the entire account balance.The first step when investing outside of the usual channels is to set up a self-directed I.R.A., in which the account owner controls the investments, and the custodian takes no blame for any downside risk.Whatever the investments, account owners cannot legally hold the title to the assets. Large financial institutions, which generally serve as custodians or trustees for the I.R.A. owner, usually stick with stocks, bonds and mutual funds, or their own financial products.But an industry of about two dozen smaller firms has emerged that will serve as custodians of real estate and a wide range of exotic investments, from chicken manure to cypress tree farms. I.R.A.’s are not allowed to own life insurance, collectibles (like stamps, art or antiques) or stock in small partnerships known as Subchapter S corporations.Statistics are scarce on what portion of retirement assets are in these accounts, but the dollar value seems to be growing. Pensco Trust Company, founded in 1989 and a pioneer in the field, manages $3.3 billion today, up from $758 million four years ago.Tom W. Anderson, chief executive of Pensco, which is based in San Francisco, attributes part of that growth to an increasing appetite for real estate, which makes up 50 percent of Pensco’s accounts. Most of these are cash deals: If the property is mortgaged, some of the I.R.A.’s income is subject to tax, which partly defeats the purpose of the account.Many Pensco clients are entrepreneurs who dip into their retirement savings for capital, Mr. Anderson said. To avoid the self-dealing rules, they must structure their companies so they cannot unilaterally decide a management issue, he said.Richard Harris, 64, a life insurance consultant in Clifton, N.J., invested $70,000 of his I.R.A. in someone else’s business — a bowling alley and bar called the Gutter, which opened a year ago in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Since the start of 2008, the enterprise has made distributions averaging $3,000 a month to Mr. Harris’s I.R.A., and he figures his interest has more than tripled in value.As with all investments, the more firsthand knowledge you have about both the vehicle and the people behind it, the better, said Thomas Baird, 55, a lawyer with Baird, Crews, Schiller & Whitaker in Temple, Tex., who has more than 50 clients who have set up self-directed I.R.A.’s.Mr. Baird used $500,000 of his I.R.A. money to buy shares of a bank in Texas, the Independent Bank of Austin, when his clients started it in 2005. He estimates that his investment has more than doubled in value.Neither Pensco nor the Entrust Group, a competitor based in Reno, Nev., that has 27 franchisees, will recommend specific investments. But both acknowledge that consumers could easily meet deal makers who attend or speak at the seminars the two companies offer.That’s how Louis Bedard, 58, an engineer in Leominster, Mass., linked up with a financial adviser who specializes in alternative investments. Subsequently, he liquidated his entire I.R.A. of nearly $400,000, which had been in mutual funds, and invested it in deals the adviser had put together, making private loans to a contractor who buys distressed houses and renovates them for resale.Mr. Bedard, who said he has earned a steady 15 percent on these investments for more than a year, did not worry that half his net worth, including his own home, was tied up in today’s shaky real estate market.“There’s always risk,” said Mr. Bedard, who had no previous experience with real estate but who reviewed financial information on the properties before lending money to the developer.Occasionally, when investments founder, I.R.A. owners blame the custodians of their self-directed I.R.A.’s. Hubert Bromma, chief executive of Entrust Group, which has 50,000 clients, said that typically the company was sued a couple of times a year by clients who said they “got hoodwinked.” Though Entrust has won these cases, he said, they are costly to defend.Ironic as it may seem in today’s economic environment, “self-direction is much harder than putting money in the stock market,” Mr. Bromma said. Custodians do not vet investments: I.R.A. owners or their financial advisers must perform all the due diligence. “This is an active, participatory sport,” he said.'"
"'08-10-23,'1','“This caper is gonna make for a long day at the office for the good folks at the RNC/McCain press operation,” he wrote on Swampland, the Time magazine blog, where he is a regular contributor, before offering some humorous advice on how they could fight back. (“William Ayers is a terrorist!” was pushback No. 4).Mr. McCain has told associates that he has viewed Mr. Murphy’s criticisms of his campaign — its advertisements, his selection of Ms. Palin and Mr. McCain’s aggressive manner — as an act of betrayal, the actions of a former friend seeking attention and a network platform. Mr. McCain was described as particularly incensed that one of Mr. Murphy’s platforms was MSNBC, which Mr. McCain’s campaign has repeatedly treated as an enemy.Mr. McCain has cut off all communications with Mr. Murphy, associates said. And McCain aides, including Steve Schmidt, a chief strategist who worked with Mr. Murphy on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s campaign for governor of California, have stopped talking to him as well, ignoring telephone calls or e-mail messages, according to Republicans close to the campaign.Mr. Murphy, in a brief e-mail comment, said that he was saying only what he believed, and that he still admired Mr. McCain.“John McCain is a hero to me, but my job as a media analyst is to call it as I see it where campaign strategy is concerned,” Mr. Murphy wrote. “There’s no disloyalty in honesty.”Still, at a time when Mr. McCain’s campaign advisers are already under an intense round of second-guessing, there is no shortage of Murphy associates who suggest that his criticisms, and those of other critics, have been vindicated.“I’ve been one myself,” said Mr. Weaver, who speaks to Mr. Murphy from time to time. “In some cases, speaking for myself, it’s a way of trying to communicate over there what you believe they should be doing.”Mr. Murphy has a long history of having battled with some of the top people in Mr. McCain’s world, notably Rick Davis, Mr. McCain’s campaign manager. Mr. McCain’s advisers said they pay little attention to Mr. Murphy. “Only Mike knows why he does what he does,” said Mark Salter, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. Asked if he thought Mr. Murphy’s comments had an impact, Mr. Salter responded, “Not really.”Whether he is right or not, Mr. Murphy has offered an informed criticism of how Mr. McCain has run his campaign, with an intriguing alternate-universe view of how things might have gone had they followed his advice. But Mr. McCain’s associates said Mr. Murphy’s running commentary was demoralizing and a distraction for Mr. McCain.Mr. Murphy has a reputation in Republican circles for self-promotion; in 2000, he provided to The Washington Post unusual behind-the-scenes access that detailed — and some rivals suggested enhanced — his role as a chief strategist in the campaign.Still, Mr. Murphy’s associates said he was saying on television what he would say were he in Mr. McCain’s campaign.“When he does disagree with the campaign, it’s rooted in him wanting the best for the senator,” said Todd Harris, who worked with Mr. Murphy for Mr. McCain in 2000. “Obviously the guys on the campaign want the best for the senator as well, and there’s just a difference of opinion.”And Mr. Murphy has told friends that he does not believe what he is doing has hurt Mr. McCain. “No one loves John McCain more than Mike Murphy,” said Alex Castellanos, a media consultant who is close to Mr. Murphy and advises Mr. McCain. “I don’t think he has any selfish interest at all.”Still, other former members of the McCain world have taken a different approach. Mark McKinnon, who stepped as aside as senior adviser because, he told associates, he did not want to be part of a campaign tearing down Mr. Obama, has kept whatever criticism he has to himself. Mr. McKinnon declined a request for comment.Mr. Murphy, on the other hand, shows no sign of slowing down. On Wednesday night, he posted an item on his blog that began: “In the category of more unsolicited advice they didn’t ask for, are tired of getting, and will certainly ignore. ...”'"

"'08-10-23,'1','Early in the primary season, when Mr. Obama was still a newcomer little known to Latinos outside Illinois, he began campaigning among Hispanic voters, even in states where he knew he would lose to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the favorite among Hispanics. Political analysts say Mr. McCain has only sporadically and belatedly sought to engage Latino voters.“The McCain campaign was never set up in a way that spoke to Hispanics,” said Matthew Dowd, Mr. Bush’s senior strategist in 2004. “Throughout the entire primary, there was no conversation because they thought that was not where the election was. You can’t start to campaign in September for the general election among Hispanics. They are very frustrated with Bush and the Republicans, so McCain has a bigger hurdle to overcome.”Hispanics account for three of every eight voters here in New Mexico, where the vote has been extremely tight in the last two presidential elections. Al Gore won this state by just 366 votes as the Democratic nominee in 2000, and in 2004, President Bush triumphed by fewer than 6,000.In Colorado and Nevada, Latinos account for at least 20 percent of the population and 12 percent of registered voters. Together, the three Southwestern battleground states have 19 electoral votes that are growing in importance for Mr. McCain as his electoral map shrinks.But events seem to be working in Mr. Obama’s favor. Contrary to what non-Hispanic politicians often assume, immigration does not rank as high on the list of Hispanic concerns as the economy, education and health care.Instead, surveys show that Latinos see immigration as a tool useful in identifying who is friend and who is foe. That may have complicated Mr. McCain’s task: despite his sponsorship of the immigration overhaul legislation, he is burdened by nativist elements within the Republican Party.“The Republican brand has been tarnished as result of the immigration debate and the extreme rhetoric that came out of that debate,” said Janet Murguía, executive director of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group. “We think McCain remains an advocate of a comprehensive approach, but his standing has been undermined by those within his own party and the tough immigration plank in the 2008 Republican platform.”To woo Hispanic voters, Mr. McCain seems to have singled out three groups for attention in the Rocky Mountain West: Hispanic veterans, owners of small businesses and social conservatives, especially those who are members of Protestant evangelical groups or the charismatic Roman Catholic movement.James Luján, 47, a deputy sheriff here, fits into the first category. He is a former marine with a son serving in the military in the Middle East, and he said he worried that Mr. Obama would withdraw precipitously from Iraq.“The troops need to be able to finish what they’re doing,” Mr. Luján said. “I’ve got one son who is 14 and another who is 8, and if we pull out right away, like Obama wants, they’re the ones who are going to have to go back.”His wife, Julie, 36, also supports Mr. McCain. She runs a hair salon, sells real estate as a sideline, and was excited by Mr. McCain’s choice of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate.“I admire a strong, hard-working woman,” Mrs. Luján said. “We need to get out of the financial casino and be responsible, and McCain and Palin are the people who can do that.”But independent political analysts point to what they say are basic flaws in Mr. McCain’s Hispanic strategy. Republicans “can talk all they want about abortion and same-sex marriage, but survey after survey tells us that even among socially conservative Hispanics, it’s the other issues that matter most,” said Christine M. Sierra, a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico.Mrs. Luján’s sister, brother and mother, who work together at JoAnn’s Ranch-O-Casados restaurant here, strongly echoed that assessment. JoAnn Casados, 57, argues that Mr. Obama “sees it the way we see it.”Ms. Casados’s son, Orlando, 39, who works in the family’s chili business, said, “I’m worried about health care and the price of gasoline, which has driven up the cost of doing business, and I think Obama cares more about how that affects people like us.”His sister Suzanne, 29, added, “Obama is more focused on the things that are really important, like the economy and health care, while McCain is up and down and all over the place.”Though the 2004 election showed Republicans could successfully appeal to Hispanic voters, that experience may provide less of a road map this year than might be expected. The Hispanic electorate has grown greatly since then, its numbers swelled by several million newly registered first-time voters: green-card holders who have recently become American citizens and young bilingual and bicultural Latinos who are sometimes referred to as “Generation ñ.”In addition, the bulk of the Latino vote remains concentrated in states not in play, like California, staunchly for Mr. Obama, and Texas, a McCain stronghold. That means the Hispanic vote is likely to be decisive only here in the Southwest and in Florida, where an influx of Puerto Ricans, who traditionally vote heavily Democratic, and Central and South American newcomers, has somewhat diluted the importance of the historically Republican Cuban-American vote.The Obama campaign in particular has sought to seize advantage of those shifting demographic trends, organizing a voter registration drive in states with large or growing Hispanic populations. In Nevada, the number of registered Hispanic voters has doubled since 2004, to about 120,000, which is seen as a factor that could shift the balance there.“Nevada is very dynamic, very volatile,"" said Efraín Escobedo, senior director of voter engagement at National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, an advocacy group. “We’re talking about people who are truly the swing vote in Nevada, with very little party affiliation or allegiance to any particular party or candidate.”Initial concerns that Mr. Obama would not be able to win over Hispanic voters who supported Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primaries have largely disappeared, though signs of what sociologists call “black-brown tensions” still surface. For instance, John Medina, a 70-year-old Navy retiree living east of here, has a McCain-Palin sign in his yard and when asked why he favored the Republican nominee, he replied, “Because he’s not black.”More common, however, was the attitude that Ms. Casados expressed. “We need change, so the fact that Obama is not an Anglo appeals to me,” she said. “He understands what discrimination is about, and if he gets in there and does a good job, that will make it easier for all the rest of us, whether black, Hispanic or Indian, to get past that problem.”'"
"'08-10-23,'1','Granted, hedge funds are not going to disappear. In fact, some are still thriving. Even many of the ones that have stumbled this year are doing better than the mutual fund industry, which has also been hit with withdrawals that have forced their managers to sell.But the reversal for the hedge fund industry represents a sea change for Wall Street and its money culture. Since hedge funds burst onto the scene in the 1990s, they have recast not only the rules of finance but also notions of wealth and status. Hedge-fund riches helped inflate the price of everything from modern art to Manhattan real estate. Top managers raked in billions of dollars a year, and managing a fund became the running dream on Wall Street.Now, for lesser lights, at least, that dream is fading.“For the past five or six years, it seemed anybody could go to their computer and print up a business card and say they were in the hedge fund business, and raise a pot of money,” said Richard H. Moore, the treasurer of , which invests workers’ pension money in hedge funds. “That’s going to be gone forever.”As are some hedge funds. For the first time, the industry is shrinking. Worldwide, the number of these funds dropped by 217 during the last three months, to 10,016, according to Hedge Fund Research.Even some of the industry’s most well-regarded managers are starting to retrench. Richard Perry, who until now had not had a down year for his flagship fund in more than a decade, has laid off some employees. Mr. Perry, who began his career at , is moving away from stock-picking to focus on the troubled credit markets.Three other hedge fund highfliers — Kenneth C. Griffin, Daniel S. Loeb and Philip Falcone — suffered double-digit losses in September.Steven A. Cohen, the secretive chief of a fund called SAC Capital, has put much of the money in his funds into cash, reducing trading by some of his workers.Many hedge fund investors, particularly the wealthy individuals, are flabbergasted by their losses this year. The average fund was down 17.6 percent through Tuesday, according to Hedge Fund Research.“You’re seeing a lot of shock, a lot of inaction, a lot of reassessment of where their allocations are and what to do going forward,” said Patrick Welton, chief executive of the Welton Investment Corporation, whose fund is up double-digits this year.Many investors, Mr. Welton said, had hoped hedge funds would protect them from a steep decline in the broader market. But in many cases, that has not happened.Now Wall Street is buzzing about how much money could be pulled out of hedge funds — and which funds might bear the brunt of the redemptions.Funds have set aside billions of dollars in cash to prepare for withdrawals, and many prominent funds require their investors to leave their money in the funds for years. That could help relieve some of the pressure.But because hedge funds are largely unregulated, they do not publicly disclose the identity of their investors or whether they have received requests for withdrawals. While it might make sense to pull money out of poorly performing funds, investors might also exit funds that are doing well to offset losses elsewhere.Institutions — pension funds, endowments and the like — pushed into hedge funds after the Nasdaq stock market bust at the turn of the century. Many hedge funds had prospered as technology stocks crashed, leading these investors to believe they would in the future.In , for instance, Norfolk County broached the issue with the state’s pension oversight commission, said Robert A. Dennis, the investment director of the commission. Mr. Dennis was impressed that hedge funds had fared so much better than the broader stock market.Though Mr. Dennis says he recognizes the risks that come with selecting hedge funds, he thinks they remain a good investment. Next week, the state commission will vote on whether to allow some towns with pension funds below $250 million to invest in hedge funds, a move Mr. Dennis supports.“Hedge funds are having a bad year, absolutely, but they’re still holding up better than stocks,” Mr. Dennis said. “Losing less money than another investment is, while not great, it’s still something to be at least satisfied with.”But now that the days of easy money are over, some fund managers are throwing in the towel.One manager, Andrew Lahde, was blunt about his decision.“I was in this game for the money,” Mr. Lahde wrote to his investors recently. He made a fortune betting against the mortgage markets, calling those on the other side of his trades “idiots.”“I have enough of my own wealth to manage,” Mr. Lahde wrote. He did not return telephone calls seeking comment.And what wealth there has been. More than anything else, hedge funds are vehicles for their managers to take a big cut of profits. The lucrative economics of the industry is known as “two and 20.” Managers typically collect annual management fees equal to 2 percent of the assets in their funds, and, on top of that, take a 20 percent cut of any profits. Last year, one manager, , reportedly took home $3 billion.But with the industry under pressure, those fat fees are being questioned. Mr. Moore and other investors are starting to ask whether hedge funds deserve all that money. Mr. Griffin, who runs Citadel Investment Group in , plans to offer funds with lower fees.More changes could be coming, including increased regulation. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is scheduled to hold a hearing about regulation next month with five hedge fund managers who reportedly made more than $1 billion last year: Mr. Griffin, Mr. Falcone and Mr. Paulson, as well as and James Simons.'"

The photos appear in my Picasa files but they don’t sync with the other pictures to my iPod. Is there anything I can do?A. The Picasa free photo-management software does not actually store picture files but finds them on the computer’s hard drive and displays them in organized folders within the program. Those photos downloaded from Flickr are somewhere on the computer’s hard drive, possibly in the My Pictures folder. If they are on the desktop, move them to the My Pictures folder or wherever you keep the other photos that have already been copied onto the iPod.Plug the iPod into the PC. Click on the iPod’s icon when it pops up in iTunes and then click on the Photos tab to make sure the player is set to pull in all pictures from wherever the photos are kept on the computer, then click on the Sync button. (Apple has more information on synching photos to the iPod at support.apple.com/kb/HT1678.)If for some reason, the new photos aren’t showing up on the iPod, you might try saving new versions of them. In Picasa 3, select the photos you want to use and click the Export button at the bottom of the screen. When the “Export to Folder” window pops up, navigate to the folder where your other iPod-friendly photos are kept. To make smaller files, you can also resize these copies to 320 pixels wide, which should be fine for iPod viewing.1000 2008-10-23 WASHINGTON — The Small Business Administration, assessing the government’s success in awarding contracts to small businesses, said Wednesday that $83.2 billion went to those companies in the last fiscal year, a record amount. And it said that the government was close to complying with a law requiring that nearly a quarter of federal contracts go to small businesses.But critics quickly responded that the figures failed to reflect the full picture of federal contracting.They argued that small businesses were still not getting their fair share of government contracts. Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine and the ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, was among the critics.“As small businesses represent 99 percent of all firms nationwide and will be vital in leading economic recovery effort,” she said, “it is crucial that these enterprises receive every job-creating and capital-generating opportunity in the federal contracting marketplace.”The S.B.A.’s lack of effective oversight, she said, has been “indefensible.” Only three of the 24 government agencies met all their contracting goals for five categories of small businesses, including service-disabled veterans and women.1001 2008-10-23 Originally intended to be “a scrapbook for my fans,” Eminem said, the book grew to include large chunks of first-person narratives culled from interviews with the journalist Sacha Jenkins, and presented in a conversational style. “Rap is one big Fantasy Island,” Eminem writes. “It’s the place I always retreat to when things get too hectic in real time.”In a section about his family and upbringing, he’s discomfitingly frank: “If you go back and look at the abuse that I took, it’s no surprise I became who I am. Someone I don’t really want to be.”Mr. Jenkins said: “I think Em has an appeal that’s very everyman. That’s his natural voice in the book.” He added: “The guy has been out of the mix and not interacting with a lot of people, let alone a writer. But this was an opportunity for him to get a lot of stuff off his chest, especially in the wake of the death of his best friend.”In fact Eminem’s memories of how Proof toughened him up as a young man are among the most vivid passages in “The Way I Am.” “As difficult as it was to talk about, I had to,” Eminem said. He also writes of how much his retreat from public life had to do with Proof’s death: “After he passed, it was a year before I could really do anything normally again. It was tough for me to even get out of bed, and I had days when I couldn’t walk, let alone write a rhyme. When I tried to put my thoughts together — well, I wasn’t making sense when I spoke, so everyone was trying to keep me off TV and away from the press.”But while Eminem discusses some personal topics in the book — fatherhood gets especially lengthy treatment (“Being a dad makes me feel powerful in a way that I hadn’t known before, and it’s the kind of power I don’t want to abuse”) — he almost completely avoids other, more familiar subjects, like his exceedingly public battles with his ex-wife and his mother, Debbie. (Next month Eminem’s mother will release a memoir, “My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem.”)“Everyone already knows how I feel about those situations,” Eminem said. “I don’t want to keep putting Kim and the kids in everything that I do, stuff where it’s not necessary.” The book, he said, is “more about Eminem and less about Marshall.”And so it’s the career artifacts, especially the handwritten lyrics, that receive place of privilege.For years Eminem would scribble down snatches of lyrics on whatever piece of paper was available — spiral notebooks, hotel memo pads — and carry them around in a backpack. When he wanted to put together a song, he’d riffle through the sheets, pick out some lines that might go together and head into the studio.“I collect words and then I stack them up,” Eminem said of his songwriting process. Often he’d write lyrics in a sort of code, leaving key words out. His reasoning: “If you leave your rhyme pad laying around, no one can make sense of it but you.”More than two dozen of the sheets are reproduced in the book, and they’re impressive in both content and appearance — lyrics scrawled at odd angles, in different ink colors, at lengths varying from a few words to complete verses. A few of them — ones that include lyrics from hits like “My Name Is,” “Stan” and “Lose Yourself” — are on perforated pages so that they can be easily removed.“It reminds me of the sort of crazy scribbling and writing like Russell Crowe’s character in ‘A Beautiful Mind,’ ” said Mr. Rosenberg, referring to the Nobel Prize-winning economist John Nash. “It’s an organized chaos of thoughts.”In an era when stars like Jay-Z famously do not write down their rhymes, instead constructing them in their head and committing them to memory, “The Way I Am” is a celebration of a sort of artisanal approach to rhyme.“In the older hip-hop he has a connection to, lyric sheets have always played an important role,” Mr. Jenkins said. “He’s a traditionalist.”In 2002 Eminem released the book “Angry Blonde,” largely a collection of lyrics — reprinted, not the original handwritten sheets — that sold about 77,000 copies, according to Nielsen BookScan. But that was near the height of his fame; this is a much less certain time for him. Still “we never worried there wasn’t a market,” Mr. Rosenberg said. “He’s certainly done enough over his career to sustain interest, even with having stepped away for a couple of years.”And now Eminem appears ready to return to the world of music. He has been recording with Dr. Dre, with whom he has made his biggest hits, working on songs for his next album, to be called “Relapse.” (There are rumors that the album will be released by Interscope before year’s end, but there has been no official word yet.) Last week he released a teaser freestyle, “I’m Having a Relapse,” on which he sounds vibrant and engaged, stacking characteristically profane and preposterous rhymes atop one another:It seems like every day I get a little flakierThe medication is making my hands a little shakierHand me that 18-month-old baby to shake him upIt’ll only take me aSecond to choke his trachea.In one of the book’s most revealing sections, Eminem talks about how he happened upon his signature bottle-blond look, high on Ecstasy, around the time he was recording his first songs with Dr. Dre. It reads like a comic-book origin story, his new identity presaging a path of bad behavior to follow.Now that he’s preparing to re-enter the music world, though, will the peroxide, and all that comes with it, return? “My hair is back to its natural color,” Eminem said. “I don’t think I’m going back to the dye.”1002 2008-10-23 On Tuesday night, at the end of the gala opening its two-week fall season at New York City Center, American Ballet Theater gave its first New York performance of an American classic, Paul Taylor’s “Company B.” Advance casting had merely said that its 13 roles would be danced by “the company,” and I forgot to check which dancers were performing before the curtain rose.And so the initial pleasure was just to see again this bright but shadow-laden masterpiece, Mr. Taylor’s evocation of aspects of the American mental climate during World War II. “Company B” — a 1991 work that entered Ballet Theater’s repertory earlier this month — is danced to Andrews Sisters songs, and its opening number, “Bei Mir Bist du Schön,” evokes an innocent and carefree exuberance that looks American to Americans and foreigners alike.Just as I was admiring its kaleidoscopic changes of pattern, I singled out two dancers moving with especial sweetness and sensuousness in different parts of the stage, only then to recognize them: Herman Cornejo and Gillian Murphy, among the company’s most remarkable principal dancers. It’s a particular pleasure to see stars bring distinction to relatively simple movement. But the whole troupe dances “Company B” with skill and understanding.Nothing in “Company B” corrupts the innocence of that opening. Subsequent images, however, tell us that these men are going to war, are being injured by gunfire, are dying, are memories. At the end these people are no longer quite a community. Each is leaving the stage alone, sober. The togetherness of the earlier episodes was part of the giddy excitement of wartime. Now it’s goodbye to all that.“Company B” shows no grief or even suffering. Arron Scott in “Tico-Tico” is all speed and impulsiveness; in “Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, Oh!,” Craig Salstein — looking like Eddie Bracken in specs — is chased by seven adoring girls. In “I Can Dream, Can’t I?,” Ms. Murphy certainly can: she spins, jumps and stretches with a beautiful expansiveness.Wounds and deaths here pass like clouds over the sun. As Mr. Cornejo finishes his infectious dance as the boogie-woogie bugle boy of the song of the same name, he suddenly keels over backward (it could be clearer that he’s been shot) and lies motionless. When the lights lift for the next song, he’s still on the floor but alive again, one among five other woman-worshipping guys gazing up to the gorgeous Misty Copeland as she dances “Rum and Coca-Cola.”1003 2008-10-23 “When the economy is tough, people want something that looks optimistic,” said Michael Kors, whose spring collection, with its polka-dotted shantung sheaths and crushed silk party skirts, reflects the upscale aspirations of a sophisticated urban middle class. “No matter how much doom and gloom goes on, they want to believe that anything is possible.”Clothing sales may have slowed dramatically in recent months, according to retail reports, but the audience for entertainment about the exorbitantly rich is blue-chip.“Bratfest at Tiffany’s,” Lisi Harrison’s tale of coddled students at the Octavian Country Day school in Westchester County, has sold 269,000 copies since its publication last winter, according to Nielsen BookScan; it is one of four books in the “Clique” series on the Nielsen list of best-selling juvenile fiction.“Gossip Girl,” the progenitor of much of the spoiled-rotten genre in literature and on television, has drawn an average of 3.4 million viewers for the first seven weeks of its second season, up from 2.6 million last season, according to Nielsen Media Research. Television’s “90210,” a remake of last decade’s “Beverly Hills 90210,” has attracted an average of 4.1 million viewers this fall, making it one of the CW’s highest-rated shows. And “Beverly Hills Chihuahua,” whose pampered canine heroine is a stand-in for spoiled teenagers, was the No. 1 film in the country in its first two weeks earlier this month.Young fans of such screen fantasies seem to remain fixated on the acquisitive habits, social conventions and moral iniquities of their super-rich fictional contemporaries. In “Schooled,” Anisha Lakhani’s acidic narrative about an Upper East Side private school, swarms of seventh graders at a party kick off their high heels before descending on the dance floor. The narrator, who is their English teacher, regards the pile of footwear with a mixture of censure and awe: “Hard to believe, but there they lay, Jimmy Choos, Manolo Blahniks, Giuseppe Zanottis and Christian Louboutins — the abandoned shoes of 12-year-old girls.”A taste for the trappings of the ruling class has also filtered into advertisements and fashions aimed at girls with heiress fantasies. A current ad for Buffalo David Bitton clothing features teenagers in crested blazers, school ties and natty argyle sweaters, which mirror a broad trend in “Gossip Girl” looks for fall.Abigail Lorick, a designer who creates the clothes for a fashion-designer character on “Gossip Girl,” populated her own show, in New York last month, with models flaunting messy beehives and riding crops. Another designer, Phillip Lim, unveiled a playfully patrician collection for spring 2009, introducing diminutive blazers and pussy-bow blouses that would not look amiss on a “Gossip Girl” character or, for that matter, on Lauren Davis Santo Domingo, who was among the coltish society fixtures perched in Mr. Lim’s front row.It may be no coincidence that Ms. Santo Domingo is among a klatch of New York City social swans competing with young Hollywood celebrities for teenagers’ attentions. Departing from its tradition of showcasing young rockers and models, Nylon magazine promoted a crop of “it girls” in its current issue, many of them clearly plucked from a privileged milieu. There is Isabelle McNally, the daughter of Keith McNally, who owns Balthazar and Pastis, restaurants frequented by the well-to-do; and Pixie Geldof (whose father is the Irish rock star Bob Geldof), shown lounging on a damask-covered daybed at her family’s English estate.They are modified versions of Ms. Hilton, the first rich girl in recent memory to be have been embraced by a mainstream audience. Her exploits, and those of her fictional counterparts, “tap into the princess fantasies of 11- and 12-year-old girls,” said David Grazian, a sociology professor who specializes in media and popular cultural at the University of Pennsylvania. That audience is the least psychologically affected by a wildly fluctuating stock market and grim headlines, Dr. Grazian said.Television executives working on the shows argue that they are just giving the audience what it craves. “I don’t think there are five writers in a room who are dying to write about rich people,” said Rina Mimoun, the executive producer and creator of “Privileged,” another show on the CW network. “Definitely the fascination is coming from the public.”Dr. Grazian pointed out that, at least until recently, “that adolescent audience has had more discretionary income than at any other time in our history.”Although parents may have been urging their children to curb their spending, that is a tough sell to those reared with a sense of entitlement. “We are living in an era in which emulations and aspiration has upscaled very significantly,” said Juliet B. Schor, a sociology professor at Boston College.She added that although the odds of significantly improving one’s economic lot have been declining for years, consumers prefer to focus on another message: “The media tells us, ‘Anybody can succeed,’ ” Dr. Schor said. “ ‘You just have to have the right clothing, the right friends, the right décor.’ ”That notion is embodied by Anna Taggert, the middle-class protagonist of “Schooled,” who spends the small fortune she earns tutoring Park Avenue prince-lings on Lanvin dresses and Chanel carryalls. Variations on Anna and her covetous ilk are likely to remain a mainstay of young adult entertainment, for the foreseeable future at least.Publishers and film producers may seek to broaden the range of young-adult entertainment to reflect real world concerns, said Sara Nelson, the president of Publishers Weekly — but only to a point. “I don’t think suddenly you’re going to find books about girls who are earnest and hardworking and help their mothers take in washing.”Nor will those books show adolescents groping in shabby environs. “Sex is somehow more appealing,” Ms. Nelson observed, “if the kids have cooler stuff, better shoes to kick off, better jewelry to flaunt” and a fancier setting — “the back seat of a limousine instead of the bed of a pickup truck.”1004 2008-10-23 “I don’t think this is necessarily real objections,” he added. “It’s all from the horse’s mouth. And it’s all on tape.”“Ultimately, I actually think they will be happy with this book,” he continued. “I think everybody around Rupert will see this and say, ‘This is Rupert.’ ”Of course controversy has been known to spur book sales, and the episode is reminiscent of one involving a book in 2005 about Michael Eisner, the former chief executive of the Walt Disney Company. In that prepublication dust-up — which, not surprisingly, wound up in the newspapers — Disney executives finagled an unauthorized copy and sent a letter to Simon & Schuster threatening legal action if the book contained errors.A spokesman for the News Corporation, speaking on Mr. Murdoch’s behalf, said: “The book conveys Rupert, the family and the company in a flattering light. And certainly portrays Rupert as the risk-taking entrepreneur that he is.”David Drake, a publicist at Doubleday, said, “The factual basis of the book will stand up to scrutiny.” And the News Corporation has not threatened legal action, nor does it plan to — suggesting at least a morsel of validity to Mr. Wolff’s belief that Mr. Murdoch’s objections were mainly a way to soothe any executive egos that may be bruised by the book’s publication.The objections raised on behalf of Mr. Murdoch came after an article on Mr. Murdoch and the book was published in Vanity Fair in the October issue in which Mr. Wolff wrote that Mr. Murdoch was making friends with liberals and that he had soured on Fox News and Mr. Ailes. (A 10,000-word excerpt from the book will be published in the December issue, due out early next month.)“For a long time, he was in love with the Fox chief, Roger Ailes, because he was even more Murdoch than Murdoch,” Mr. Wolff wrote in the October Vanity Fair piece. “And yet now the embarrassment can’t be missed — he mumbles even more than usual when called on to justify it; he barely pretends to hide the way he feels about Bill O’Reilly.”Mr. Wolff and executives at Doubleday said Mr. Murdoch received an advance copy of the manuscript through his son-in-law, the high-profile London public relations executive Matthew Freud, who is married to Elisabeth Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch’s 40-year-old daughter. Mr. Wolff said he believed that Mr. Freud obtained it through an acquaintance at a London newspaper that had received a draft under a nondisclosure agreement for the purpose of negotiating serial rights.“At the point where the book was being presold for serialization rights,” Mr. Freud said in an interview, “there were clearly a number of copies going around, and someone kindly sent me a copy.”In an e-mail message from Mr. Freud to Mr. Wolff on Oct. 2, Mr. Freud praised the book. “This is a remarkable book you have written,” Mr. Freud wrote. “Brilliant on so many levels. Congratulations, seriously. There is a bit of fact-checking on the family stuff if you want notes. But I loved it.”However, four days later, on Oct. 6, Mr. Murdoch himself e-mailed Mr. Wolff and was less complimentary.“I have just read four or five chapters of your book,” Mr. Murdoch wrote. “It contains some extremely damaging misstatements of fact which I will be happy to point out to you if we could meet. Otherwise I will have no option other than to speak to Random House.”A few days later, one of Mr. Murdoch’s top lieutenants e-mailed Phyllis Grann, the editor of the book at Doubleday, raising numerous minor factual errors — which were corrected — as well as several broader complaints, including the characterization of the Ailes relationship and Mr. Chernin’s reading habits. (Mr. Wolff writes that Mr. Murdoch was exasperated because he thought Mr. Chernin did not read newspapers.)The question that has perplexed many in the media world is why Mr. Murdoch agreed to give such wide access to himself and his family. “It’s a big question,” said Mr. Drake, the book’s publicist. “It will always remain a mystery.”Mr. Wolff said that when he made the rounds to interview family members and other News Corporation executives, “everybody said, ‘Why did he do this?’ No one seems to know.”1005 2008-10-23 It is a commonplace in early-music lore that given the remoteness and sketchiness of most of the documentary sources, aspects of any performance are necessarily conjectural. But that educated guesswork is always a matter of degrees, and since scores for obscure repertory are hard to come by, it is often difficult for listeners to determine its extent. So the encore the Spanish viola da gamba virtuoso Jordi Savall, La Capella Reial de Catalunya and Hespèrion XXI appended to their splendid concert at the Rose Theater on Monday evening was a gift to old hands as well as to novices.The program, which opened the season of Great Performers at Lincoln Center and its series New Visions: The Literary Muse, was basically a distillation of the luxurious 2005 Alia Vox album “Don Quijote de la Mancha: Romances y Músicas.” It related episodes from Cervantes’s “Don Quixote” through Spanish music of the 16th and 17th centuries fitted out with texts, and through spoken readings, rendered here by F. Murray Abraham.The encore was the number that closed the first half, the “Ballad of Count Claros of Montalban,” attributed to Francisco Salinas. But as Mr. Savall explained before the reprise, all that had been known of the music was a sequence of four notes cited in a reference. From that germ Mr. Savall and company have created a wildly imaginative and richly textured set of variations running some eight minutes. And as with virtually everything these master improvisers perform, you had the sense that they could easily have carried on twice as long.That improvisational agility filled another need on Monday, since the capella’s lead singer, Montserrat Figueras, Mr. Savall’s wife, was back home in Spain, suffering from a severe cold that had prevented her from flying. One number was replaced and others were reallotted among the singers, who included Arianna Savall, the daughter of Ms. Figueras and Mr. Savall, who also played harp, sometimes as she was singing.The whole served as a vivid and affectionate evocation of Quixote, an eloquent testament to the place he holds in the hearts and minds of Spaniards. The musical performance, as always with Mr. Savall in charge, was exemplary. Mr. Abraham, it seemed, might have been inclined to chew the scenery, if there had been any, and if he had not been so tied to the written word.Mr. Savall and Hespèrion XXI returned on Tuesday in Great Performers’ Little Night Music series in the Kaplan Penthouse, playing sets of dances from Italy, Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It is always a privilege to hear such a high level of performance in so intimate a setting. Among the many added fascinations here was the close-up view of the expert percussionist Pedro Estevan, and of his seemingly unlimited array of subtle touches and strokes on drums and tambourines.1006 2008-10-23 Merck, which now has 56,700 employees, eliminated 10,400 jobs as part of a reorganization announced in 2005, a year after its Vioxx pain reliever was removed from the market because of safety concerns.Merck shares were down 6.5 percent, to $28.02, on Wednesday.The new cuts will take place by the end of 2011 and will involve all areas of the company. About 40 percent of the cuts will come in the United States. The ranks of senior and midlevel executives will be sliced by 25 percent. And three research sites, in Seattle, Japan and Italy, will be closed by the end of 2009.The moves are meant to save the company $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion in operating costs through 2013. But they will also cost the company $1.6 billion to $2 billion in severance pay and other reorganization charges.Merck’s chief executive, Richard T. Clark, said on Wednesday that the overhaul was part of an effort to position Merck for the future — not a response to particular problems in 2008.Merck is trying to reduce its reliance on huge sales forces that bombard doctors. It wants to speed innovation by consolidating research on particular diseases in single locations. And it plans to outsource more manufacturing.“If you don’t change these business models, we’re not going to survive as an industry, let alone a company,” Mr. Clark told analysts on a conference call.But Merck has plenty of specific problems that hurt its third-quarter financial results, also announced on Wednesday. Sales of Fosamax, its osteoporosis drug, plunged 51 percent in the quarter because it lost patent protection.Sales of the cholesterol-lowering drugs Vytorin and Zetia, which are marketed by a joint venture with Schering-Plough, dropped 15 percent worldwide in the quarter, to $1.1 billion, compared with the same period a year ago. The decline came after studies showed that Vytorin was no more effective than a generic statin in stopping the buildup of fatty plaques in arteries and might pose a cancer risk.Sales of the asthma and allergy drug Singulair, the biggest drug Merck sells by itself, increased only 1 percent, to $1 billion, after the Food and Drug Administration said in March that it was looking into whether the drug might increase the risk of suicides.Merck also had setbacks in its vaccine division, which had been a bright spot for the company.Sales of Gardasil, the cervical cancer vaccine, were $401 million for the quarter, a decrease of 4 percent, as questions arose over the vaccine’s necessity, cost and safety, and Merck’s marketing tactics.On the positive side, sales of Januvia, a diabetes drug, and Isentress, a new AIDS drug, did well.Over all, Merck’s earnings fell to 51 cents a share, from 70 cents a year ago, largely because of reorganization charges. Excluding those and other items, the earnings were 80 cents a share, compared with 75 cents a year ago. Merck said its earning for the year would be at the low end of previous guidance.Merck is also planning to move more aggressively into biotechnology drugs, which are made in living cells. These represent some of the industry’s biggest sellers and, for regulatory and scientific reasons, are not subject to the same rapid onslaught of generic competition as pills made from chemicals.Merck has been slower than some of its competitors in moving into biotechnology. But Mr. Clark said Merck aimed to be a leader in that field, suggesting that it planned to make drugs similar to big sellers like Epogen and Neupogen, both from Amgen, which bolster blood cells.1007 2008-10-23 Pfizer said on Wednesday that it had completed part of a larger, $894 million deal to settle lawsuits over its promotion of the painkillers Celebrex and Bextra.The company made official a deal that would pay $60 million to settle investigations by 33 states and the District of Columbia over Bextra, while also agreeing to adopt compliance measures. Various states claimed that Pfizer promoted the painkiller for uses it was not approved for. While a physician is allowed to prescribe drugs for off-label uses, a company cannot market them for unapproved uses.States also contended that the company misrepresented the safety of the drug. Pfizer withdrew Bextra in 2005.As part of the settlement, Pfizer denied that its promotional practices violated any laws.Separately, Pfizer said it stood behind an antismoking drug, Chantix, which had been linked this year by the Food and Drug Administration to possible psychiatric problems.The company said it was unclear whether an increase in reports was because the problems were growing or because of a greater awareness of drug safety issues.1008 2008-10-23 “Customers who signed fixed contracts have a major problem,” said Larry Faria of Nypirg’s fuel-buyers group. “They’ll be hurting because prices are coming down.”The degree of their pain depends on when the contracts were signed. The most acute is for those who signed deals in July, when home heating oil prices peaked at $4.78 a gallon.An additional 8,000 of Nypirg’s buyers signed deals that cap the maximum price they can pay, but allow them to pay less if prices drop. Given the recent slide in prices, these people have made out better than those who signed fixed-price deals. But in many cases, oil companies have been charging customers in capped-price plans 10 to 20 cents more per gallon than the going rate to protect against a rapid fall in prices in the future.Home heating oil companies say they are being unfairly blamed for circumstances often beyond their control, noting that oil prices are set by large refiners and wholesalers. When customers signed fixed-price contracts this summer, their heating oil companies bought the fuel from wholesalers at a similar price, making it difficult to cut prices now.“You are playing the market, and a contract works both ways,” said John Maniscalco, the executive vice president of the New York Oil Heating Association. “If you lock in a fixed price, if the price goes up you’re going to feel like a hero. If it goes down and your neighbors are paying less, you’ll feel different.”Mr. Maniscalco, whose group represents 160 companies in New York City, said that many home heating companies did not see profits rise as much as oil prices because they did not pass along all of the increases to their customers. In many cases, he and others in the industry said, companies have been giving customers an extra month or two to pay their bills in the face of the high prices.“We have to carry our customers and we have to take out credit lines to do it,” said Mike Coppola, who owns Bell Fuel Oil Company in Brooklyn, which has 700 customers. “When it goes up, we don’t immediately raise prices because we don’t want to scare consumers. When there’s a downswing, we try to get some of it back.”But Senator Charles E. Schumer complained that large oil companies have not cut their prices as rapidly as the price of oil has declined on commodity markets, and he has called on the Federal Trade Commission to pressure them to do so.“It’s simply baffling,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “When oil prices go up, gas and home heating oil prices go up, but when oil goes down, mysteriously nothing really happens.”On Wednesday, Andrew J. Spano, the county executive in Westchester, echoed Mr. Schumer’s complaint, sending a letter to local heating oil companies asking them to consider their customers’ plights. He suggested that they consider, for instance, lowering delivery fees to soften the blow.“Some customers, particularly seniors who were worried that there was no end in sight to the cost of oil, locked in rates over the summer when they were at their peak — about $4.50 a gallon,” Mr. Spano wrote. “These consumers are now locked into sky-high prices, even though much lower-priced heating oil is available.”Amid the complaints, more consumers are trying to avoid heating oil altogether by switching to natural gas. Con Edison said that 1,618 single- and multifamily homes in its service territory — most of New York City and Westchester County — converted to natural gas from January to September this year, 11 percent more than during the same period in 2007.But that conversion costs $5,000 to $7,000, so it can be a long-term investment. Though natural gas can be more convenient — no furnaces to clean, no deliveries to wait for — prices have been just as volatile as those of heating oil in recent months.It is too late for such an option at Parkchester South Condominium, a group of 116 apartment buildings in the Bronx, whose board voted this summer to sign a fixed-rate contract that runs through the end of 2008.“We’re blowing our budget out of the water by a couple of million dollars,” said Michael Naclerio, the general manager of the condominium, who declined to say how much he was paying. “In hindsight, it turns out it was the worst decision we could have done.”The board has since negotiated a contract for 2009 that is 30 percent lower, a figure that equals the condominium’s projected heating oil budget for 2008, Mr. Naclerio said.1009 2008-10-23 “The story of the credit rating agencies is a story of colossal failure,” Mr. Waxman said. “The credit rating agencies occupy a special place in our financial markets. Millions of investors rely on them for independent, objective assessments. The rating agencies broke this bond of trust, and federal regulators ignored the warning signs and did nothing to protect the public.”As mortgage delinquencies and defaults have skyrocketed over the last 18 months, it has become clear that the agencies that assigned high ratings to the securities that contained these loans severely underestimated their risks. Indeed, Mr. Waxman noted that S.& P. had downgraded more than two-thirds of its investment-grade ratings and Moody’s had reduced assigned ratings on more than 5,000 mortgage-backed securities.Testifying after Mr. Fons and Mr. Raiter were top executives of the three large rating agencies — Deven Sharma of Standard & Poor’s, Raymond W. McDaniel of Moody’s and Stephen W. Joynt of Fitch Ratings. Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings, an independent rating agency that does not receive payment from issuers, also testified.Among the documents uncovered by the committee was an internal board presentation delivered by Mr. McDaniel to Moody’s directors in October 2007. According to the presentation, he told his board: Analysts and managing directors “are continually ‘pitched’ by bankers, issuers, investors.” At times, he conceded, “we drink the Kool-Aid.”The three current executives of the leading rating agencies denied to lawmakers that conflicts of interest had impaired their judgment on mortgage securities. Mr. Sharma of S.& P. said his firm “was not alone” in being surprised by the decline in housing markets. He cited 27 initiatives taken by the firm to “enhance the integrity of our ratings process.” To protect against conflicts, for example, S.& P. now rotates analysts in their assignments and has established an ombudsman office.Mr. McDaniel also said that Moody’s had changed its practices to strengthen its standards, including hiring more surveillance analysts and compliance professionals. And Mr. Joynt of Fitch Ratings said his firm was committed to the highest standards of objectivity.Mr. Raiter, the former S.& P. executive who left the company in 2005, said that a new and more detailed mortgage loan performance model developed at the company in 2001 and incorporating 2.5 million loans had not been adopted, he said, “due to budgetary concerns.”Mr. Raiter said that the residential mortgage rating group at S.& P. had captured the largest market share among its main competitors — 92 percent or better — “and improving the model would not add to S.& P.’s revenues.”S.& P. said that the detailed model mentioned by Mr. Raiter had been tested by the company and found not to be as reliable as he maintained.Mr. Waxman’s committee also cited an internal e-mail exchange between Mr. Raiter, who had been asked to rate a collateralized debt obligation called “Pinstripe,” and Richard Gugliada, an S.& P. managing director. Mr. Raiter had requested highly detailed data about each individual loan, known as loan level tapes, to assess the creditworthiness of the loans in the security, but Mr. Gugliada wrote: “Any request for loan level tapes is totally unreasonable!!! It is your responsibility to provide those credit estimates and your responsibility to devise some method for doing so.”Mr. Raiter responded: “This is the most amazing memo I have ever received in my business career.” Asked what followed the exchange, Mr. Raiter said he never rated the obligation.Chris Atkins, an S.& P. spokesman, said: “It has long been the practice of S.& P. to review loan level data for new R.M.B.S. securities. The e-mail in question reflects a discussion regarding the appropriate analytical treatment for a C.D.O. rating of an underlying asset that had been rated by another credit rating agency.”Asked how to fix the problem of potential conflicts among rating agencies, Mr. Egan, of Egan-Jones, said change would come only if institutional investors no longer made investment decisions based on ratings produced by agencies that take money from issuers. “Institutional investors know darn well that ratings are paid for by the issuers,” he said, “so why do they have all their investment guidelines geared to conflicted ratings?”1010 2008-10-23 “Roosevelt simply did not want to get close to him or be identified with anything he would want to do, because he was terribly unpopular, and the same now exists with George W. Bush,” said the historian Robert Dallek. “In some ways, he’s trying to rescue his reputation, and the last thing Obama or even McCain are going to care about is saving George Bush’s reputation.”The White House press secretary, Dana Perino, said Wednesday that it was “too early to say” if the incoming president would attend. “Let’s just let this election happen,” Ms. Perino said. “We don’t want to box the next president in.”Mr. Obama, appearing in Richmond, Va., said the meeting provided “an opportunity to advance the kind of cooperation” that he himself had called for last month, when he advocated global coordination in addressing the credit crisis. Mr. McCain’s senior economics adviser, Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, called the session “an important opportunity to take urgent steps toward recovery.”One question, though, is how much Mr. Bush can accomplish with so little time left in office and foreign leaders already looking toward a successor who could easily undo any commitments he makes.The conference will come just days before Mr. Bush’s last official foreign trip, to South America for a conference of leaders of Asian-Pacific nations. Ms. Perino said the White House thought it was important not to wait.“We didn’t want the financial crisis to happen at all,” she said, adding, “but now that it’s happened, we can’t control the timing of it.”Some economists said the meeting could have a calming effect on markets, if only by demonstrating that world leaders are willing to cooperate. “At best it does something; at worst it does no harm,” said Carmen M. Reinhart, a professor at the University of Maryland who is writing a book on financial crises.But others are skeptical that a meeting pulled together on such a hurried basis could produce substantive results. They said that the Bretton Woods conference, which resulted in the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, was years in the planning.“Things like this that produce real results for the world are planned years in advance,” said Edwin M. Truman, who was an assistant secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. “The notion that you’re going to have something come out of this in three months is probably naïve.”Indeed, the meeting is being planned in such haste that Ms. Perino said the White House was not yet certain where it would be held. She said the goal was for the leaders to “agree on a common set of principles for reform” and then direct financial experts “to put meat on the bones when it comes to fleshing out the principles.”Mr. Bush has been under intense pressure from his counterparts in Europe, notably President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, to hold a meeting of world economic powers. But the White House at first sounded resistant to the idea; administration officials have said Mr. Bush is concerned that adding new layers of regulation could stifle free markets and free trade.On Saturday, Mr. Sarkozy and the president of the European Union, José Manuel Barroso, had dinner with Mr. Bush at Camp David and apparently brokered a deal. Although Mr. Sarkozy had suggested earlier that day that the meeting be held in New York, the White House wanted it in Washington, on Mr. Bush’s turf.The president also insisted that the sessions include developing nations — a decision that experts said acknowledges the risk that such countries face, especially now that larger, more prosperous nations have poured billions into stabilizing their banks. The rescue measures adopted by Western countries, including the United States, actually heighten the risk for emerging markets, because banks in those countries are now less safe than those in the Western economies.The talks come as nations like Hungary, Ukraine and Belarus are showing the same symptoms — flight of foreign capital, plummeting currencies and soaring inflation — that hit Iceland recently, capsizing its banking system and hobbling its economy.All these countries are in talks with the International Monetary Fund for loans to stabilize their banks. With Western banks pulling back credit, the list of countries at risk of a financial crisis could grow to include several more in Central Europe and Latin America, economists say.“You’ve got a lot of emerging markets who are going to go to this meeting and say ‘You’ve got to take this seriously,’ ” said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.With Europe and the United States both paying for costly bank bailouts, however, they have limited resources to help countries directly. That suggests a growing role for the fund, as well as for the World Bank. The White House has invited the heads of both institutions to the meeting.The countries invited are drawn from the so-called G-20, a forum of rich and emerging nations that was convened in 1999 after the Asian economic crisis. Its members are: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, Britain, the United States and the European Union.1011 2008-10-23 Reflecting that turmoil, Boeing said it might have to finance the delivery of some airplanes in 2009 because of tight credit markets. It has not financed planes since 2006. It said it had made commitments to provide backup financing for 3 percent of its airplane deliveries through the end of the next decade.For the third quarter, Boeing said its net income fell to $695 million, or 96 cents a share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $1.44 a share, in the period a year earlier.Analysts had expected Boeing to post better results. Its shares were down 5.6 percent.Revenue fell 7 percent, to $15.2 billion. Boeing also said it had negative operating cash flow of $442 million during the quarter, reflecting the effect that the strike has had on aircraft deliveries. In the quarter last year, its operating cash flow was $3.3 billion. Boeing said the strike had reduced its airplane deliveries by 35 jets but said it had a record backlog of $349 billion in jet orders.Aside from the strike, the company said its earnings also dropped because of a delay in production of some of its largest planes. It said work on them was held up by a shortage of galleys, the area in the plane where flight attendants prepare beverages and meals.Boeing halted all its airplane production after the strike by the machinists union, which represents 27,000 workers in Washington State, Oregon and Kansas.In a bulletin to union members Wednesday, Tom Wroblewski, the president of Machinists Union District 751, said it would have been a better business decision for Boeing to reach a deal with the union.""Customers want their planes, shareholders want their value, and our members want to get back to building the best airplanes in the world,"" Mr. Wroblewski said.Labor experts say the strike is a key moment for the union, whose members at Boeing fell as low as about 19,000 when orders for aircraft plummeted after the September 2001 attacks. The union is trying to gain jobs as Boeing is sending more work outside the United States, especially on its new 787 jet, the Dreamliner.Development of the plane, already more than a year late, has continued despite the strike. But Boeing has said the walkout could push back the first test flight of the Dreamliner, which was scheduled to take place this quarter.Mr. McNerney did not give a specific update. But he said work on all Boeing aircraft, including the Dreamliner, would be delayed on a “day for day” basis because of the strike, which has lasted 47 days so far. Given that, it appears likely that the first test flight will be pushed back to next year.But Mr. McNerney said he had not soured on the company’s union-represented work force.“Notwithstanding the strike, and not withstanding the frustration on behalf of our customers, the workers in Puget Sound represented by the I.A.M. are very fine workers,” Mr. McNerney said. “I’m anxious to get them back to work. They can compete for any work that we’ve got.”1012 2008-10-23 DEFENDING HIS ACTIONS Henry M.

Chronicling the battle to defeat that amendment, the directors, Mike Roth and John Henning, intercut tense political skirmishes with the emotional journey of a young lesbian couple whose relationship has been profoundly affected by these events.Defined by swells of success and troughs of despondency, the legal tussle is engrossing and sometimes revelatory; but it’s in the small, personal moments that “Saving Marriage” breaks through. When the gay rights lobbyist Arline Isaacson frets that a lifetime of discrimination may have sapped the self-esteem necessary for her supporters to defeat the amendment, or when the gay, newly elected state representative Carl Sciortino balks at publicly hugging his male supporters, the movie achieves a rare eloquence. The roots of puritanism run deep, but they’re far from invisible.Rambunctious and hopeful, “Saving Marriage” asks us to re-examine an institution  and a word  most of us take for granted. By the end, we may feel that saying “I do” is no different than saying “I am.”Opens on Friday in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver and Boston.Produced and directed by Mike Roth and John Henning; director of photography, Mr. Roth; edited by Paula Gauthier; Music by Jamie Forsyth; released by Regent Releasing/Here! Films. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes.

In an interview with the BBC, Morrissey, the former Smiths frontman and symbol of romanticized depression, said he had begun writing an autobiography to communicate directly with his fans and to speak over the filter of the mainstream media. “With every printed interview, there’s lots of misquotes,” Morrissey told the BBC. “Lots of them are really silly and really extreme, which you have to live with the rest of your life. So it’s setting the record straight.” No publisher or release date for the as-yet-untitled memoir has been announced. Morrissey is also working on a new solo album, “Year of Refusal,” scheduled for next year.1042 2008-10-24 Narek Hakhnazaryan, an Armenian cellist who turned 20 on Thursday, has already won enough prizes to fill two paragraphs in his professional biography. Among the latest entries is first prize in this year’s Young Concert Artists International Auditions. On Tuesday Mr. Hakhnazaryan reaped a major benefit of the award: a Zankel Hall recital opening Young Concert Artists’ 48th season.Mr. Hakhnazaryan, tall and wiry, projected intensity from the moment he took the stage. But rather than opening with fireworks, he started with Schumann’s genial “Fantasiestücke.” Mr. Hakhnazaryan’s tone was lean but warm and supple, animating Schumann’s lyrical phrases with grace. Noreen Polera, a pianist, was an alert, responsive partner.Beethoven’s Cello Sonata No. 3 (Op. 69) cast Mr. Hakhnazaryan and Ms. Polera as equals in a balancing act pitched between Classical elegance and Romantic expressiveness. They negotiated the sonata’s capricious moods and quirky rhythms with compelling unanimity at a slightly subdued overall dynamic that made bold accents leap off the page.Mr. Hakhnazaryan demonstrated his considerable technical prowess in the unaccompanied Sonata No. 1 by Adam Khudoyan, an Armenian composer. The work, from 1961, packed folkish melodies, tricky combinations of simultaneous bowing and plucking, a passage in ghostly harmonics and more into a dense continuous span. Abrupt transitions made the piece seem restless and occasionally aimless, but Mr. Hakhnazaryan’s commitment was persuasive.In a commanding account of Shostakovich’s Cello Sonata in D minor, the martial rhythms that interrupt the opening movement’s melodic outpouring felt especially charged and brittle. Mr. Hakhnazaryan brought a daredevil verve to the intricate Scherzo and opened the stark Largo with an eerie, vibrato-free tone.A gorgeous rendition of Rachmaninoff’s “Vocalise” offered gentle relief, and the program ended with Paganini’s flamboyant Variations on One String on a Theme by Rossini, transcribed from the original violin version.1043 2008-10-24 Drivers who commute by car between New York and New Jersey can assuage their guilt by buying credits from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to offset their vehicles’ carbon emissions.At a board meeting on Thursday, the Port Authority announced that it had approved a measure to pay five companies a total of $2.5 million to set up a carbon offset program for the agency.A Web site where drivers and airline passengers can buy credits to offset carbon emissions they create will be activated in early 2009.Money from the carbon-offset credits is typically used to plant trees, build windmills, install solar panels and take other measures that may help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The announcement came six months after the agency said it would establish an offset program, the first of its kind in the United States by a toll-collecting agency.The program is part of the Port Authority’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2010. The agency also wants to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions it generates by 80 percent by 2050.“We’re deeply committed to being in the national forefront in developing environmentally sustainable practices at our airports, seaports, tunnels and bridges,” Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority, said in a statement.1044 2008-10-24 But the real issue for many New Yorkers will be Mr. Bloomberg and his credibility, now that he has turned his back so thoroughly on the expressed will of the people and on his own past statements.His argument is that times are hard, that continuity is extra important and that voters deserve a chance to keep him.As on other occasions, he seems to believe that because his overall approval ratings are high, New Yorkers will smile on whatever he does.That isn’t the case. The trouncing that he took on big issues like nonpartisan elections, the West Side stadium and congestion pricing makes that clear.What the mayor plays down in his emphasis on the financial crisis is that he was exploring ways to cling to office long before the stock market went into a kamikaze-like dive. But he hemmed and hawed for months. Had he not done that, another referendum on term limits could have easily been put on the Nov. 4 ballot to see if New Yorkers had changed their minds.The Council has rewarded him for his dithering.There can be no doubt how New Yorkers feel. In a survey issued this week by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, 89 percent said that a new referendum — not a City Council deal — was the way to go. A mere 7 percent preferred to go through the Council.Till now, had you ever known 89 percent of New Yorkers to agree on anything? “You just don’t get numbers like this,” said Maurice Carroll, director of the polling institute.On Thursday, some council members warned that their vote would inevitably increase public cynicism about politicians at the worse possible time — just when the Council will be forced to make hard fiscal choices and will need every ounce of citizen support it can muster.That turns the spotlight on the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who has been the mayor’s handmaiden on altering term limits and whose own credibility took severe hits. She, too, used to preach about the sanctity of the people’s voice.Ms. Quinn said on Thursday that her sole interest was the common weal. New Yorkers, she said, now have a chance to vote for “consistent leadership” during this crisis. When reminded at a news conference that she used to hold a diametrically opposite position on how to change term limits, she said that elected officials go off course if they “do not evolve” when circumstances change.In other words, she had to be inconsistent to provide consistency. We’ll let you parse that one.No doubt, both she and Mr. Bloomberg are betting that by the next municipal elections in 2009, people will have either forgotten about this controversy or will weigh it as but one factor among many in deciding who they want in charge. (Can’t you already hear the mayor saying, O.K., you may not like what I did, but c’mon, who do you want now, me or Anthony Weiner or Bill Thompson?)The mayor’s hope is that voters will eventually see Thursday’s action as not a betrayal of democracy, but as a blessing in disguise.Those were the words used by Winston Churchill’s wife, Clementine, after British voters ousted him as prime minister in July 1945. “It may well be a blessing in disguise,” she told him.To which Churchill replied, as many New Yorkers may be saying today, “At the moment it seems quite effectively disguised.”1045 2008-10-24 One of the Greek prime minister’s closest aides resigned on Thursday over a land scandal that has brought the government to the brink of collapse. The aide, Theodore Roussopoulos, who is both the government spokesman and the minister of state, is the second cabinet member to step down over the real estate deal in which valuable land owned by the state was traded for inexpensive property owned by a 1,000-year-old monastery in northern Greece. Mr. Roussopoulos said he was resigning to defend himself from what he called a “malicious and totally groundless attack.” His resignation came a day after Parliament decided to create a committee to investigate the land swap, which has been estimated to have cost the government as much as $130 million.1046 2008-10-24 The two sides do agree that the ballot issue is sure to be the most expensive — and quite likely the most bruising — animal rights campaign ever. The Humane Society alone has already given about $4 million toward the campaign for Proposition 2, about half of what Mr. Pacelle thinks his side will spend before Nov. 4.Californians for Safe Food had raised more than $6.7 million by the end of September, according to federal election documents, with scores of donations from agricultural operations around the country, including egg companies in Colorado, Georgia and Minnesota.California is the nation’s fifth-largest producer — and No. 1 consumer — of eggs, producing an estimated $337 million worth in 2007. Nationwide, the country produces about 77 billion table eggs a year — 250 per American — valued at about $6.7 billion.Considering the market at stake, it is not surprising that Proposition 2 has supplied some of the election season’s most emotionally charged advertisements. One, by supporters, shows images of abused animals on factory farms, while opponents’ commercials have warned that the measure would lead to the importation of unsafe eggs from Mexico.Opponents have pressed a line of attack that suggests that Proposition 2 — which would require that animals be provided room to turn around, lie down, stand up and fully extend their limbs — could expose birds, via contact with their own waste and that of other animals, to such dreaded diseases as salmonella and avian influenza. They also argue that standard egg-laying cages — a little more than eight inches square — actually protect hens from aggression by other birds and predators.Still, the proposition, which would take effect in 2015, has led to a division between some small-animal “pet vets” and large-animal agricultural veterinarians. In September, several agricultural veterinarians formed a group separate from the 6,000-member California Veterinary Medical Association, the state’s leading veterinary group, over the association’s support for Proposition 2.One of those who split was Dr. Nancy D. T. Reimers, a poultry veterinarian who has been paid for work for Californians for Safe Food. Dr. Reimers said people often do not understand the work that veterinarians do on farms.“The folks that are involved in the food supply know what we have to do to keep the animals and the food safe,” Dr. Reimers said. “And they are, by and large, opposed” to Proposition 2.Supporters, meanwhile, question why Proposition 2 opponents have drawn so much financial support from out-of-state egg producers, who presumably would benefit if California egg farmers failed. “You’d think those egg companies would be chomping at the bit” to see the measure pass, Mr. Pacelle said.Those companies, he said, fear a “ripple effect” of similar legislation in other states or a demand from big retailers like Wal-Mart if consumers seek more humane products.Mitch Head, a spokesman for United Egg Producers, a farmers’ collective that represents 95 percent of the nation’s commercial egg producers, said some out-of-state support was a reflection of the fact that an outbreak of disease in eggs anywhere leads to bad press for the industry as a whole.Mr. Head also noted that California was traditionally a trend-setter. “I think they believe that if a few states start doing these things,” he said, “it will come to their states.”As often happens with California ballot measures, the fight over Proposition 2 has drawn the attention of celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey, who recently devoted an episode of her television show to the issue, complete with mock-ups of animals in cages.For Ms. Buckner, such endorsements have only codified her sense that the ballot measure is being pushed by “wealthy, narrow-minded elitists” who do not understand its real-world consequences.“This is an organization raising money from upper-middle-class white women writing $100 checks,” she said.The battle over Proposition 2 comes on the heels of two ballot victories for the Humane Society and animal rights activists: a 2002 ban on “gestation crates” for sows in Florida and a 2006 measure to bar crates for sows and veal cattle in Arizona.Proposition 2 supporters were also heartened by the decision in late September of a federal district court judge in Northern California who found that the United States Department of Agriculture had tried to interfere with the ballot measure campaign by allocating $3 million for a “consumer education campaign” whose language closely mirrored that of the effort by Proposition 2’s opponents.Economic worries could also affect the campaign. While polls have shown Proposition 2 leading, the president of the California Veterinary Medical Association, Dr. William Grant, said he was surprised at how many people had expressed concern about “the fiscal impact on the state, rather than how we care about the animals.”“Had this been up last year, I think this would have overwhelmingly passed without any discussion,” said Dr. Grant, a veterinary surgeon from Garden Grove, Calif. “But in some ways, the fear of the unknown is the greatest fear, and that may be affecting how they’re looking at this. In fact, I know it is.”1047 2008-10-24 Still, there do seem to be enough question marks hovering over this race that it is not quite time for Mr. McCain to ride his bus back to .“It’s an uphill battle,” said , who was the chief strategist for President Bush going back to Mr. Bush’s first run for governor in 1994. “But I remember seven days out from the gubernatorial race, and everybody was like, ‘It’s all over, we’re cooked!’ And we won by seven points.”Here are what Mr. McCain’s advisers are watching hopefully (and Mr. Obama’s are watching warily) as the contest enters its final days.Mr. McCain’s advisers said the key to victory was reeling back those Republican states where Mr. Obama has them on the run: , where Mr. McCain spent Thursday; ; ; ; ; and . If he can hang on to all those states as well as others that are reliably red, he would put into his column 260 of the 270 electoral votes necessary to win. Mr. McCain’s advisers said they would look for the additional electoral votes they need either by taking from the Democrats, or putting together some combination of , , and .Mr. McCain’s advisers are most concerned about Virginia, and understandably so. On the other side of the coin, Mr. McCain’s advisers believe that if he wins or comes close in Pennsylvania, he will probably win in Ohio and Florida. Aides to Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama agree that Mr. McCain remains very much in the game in Ohio and Florida. Not easy, but not impossible either.Two issues have turned up in the final days, courtesy of some inopportune remarks by Mr. Obama and his running mate, Senator of . Both have entered the campaign dialogue, and it is probably a little too early to tell whether they will have the impact that Mr. McCain hopes they will.The first was Mr. Obama’s response to the plumber in Ohio who asked about his proposal to increase income tax rates on households making over $250,000 a year, in which Mr. Obama asserted that there was a need to “spread the wealth.” Mr. McCain seized on the response to reprise the he-will-raise-your-taxes attack that has historically had resonance in states like Florida, and New Hampshire. “We believe we have traction with the tax issue,” said , a senior adviser to Mr. McCain.It was no coincidence that Mr. Obama spent about 10 minutes rebutting the notion that he would raise taxes on the middle class at a rally here in Florida on Tuesday. Advisers to Mr. Obama are carefully watching state polling and focus groups in Florida, Ohio and Virginia, where Mr. McCain is waging a vigorous push on this issue.The other was Mr. Biden’s prediction that a foreign power would test Mr. Obama with a crisis in the first months of his presidency. That remark goes to what has been the heart of Mr. McCain’s argument about the need for the next president to have experience in handling high-stakes situations. No one in Mr. Obama’s campaign is disputing the potential damage from Mr. Biden’s remark, but they hope it will be offset by the endorsement of Mr. Obama by , the former secretary of state, on Sunday.Pollsters say there has never been a year when polling has been so problematic, given the uncertainty of who is going to vote in what is shaping up as an electorate larger than ever. While most national polls give Mr. Obama a relatively comfortable lead, in many statewide polls, Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain are much more closely matched. Even a small shift in the national number could deliver some of the closer states into the McCain camp, making an Electoral College victory at least possible.“The next 13 days will tell the story,” said Gov. of Florida, pointing to recent polls showing Mr. McCain gaining in his state. “I’m optimistic. I think he’s going to take Florida.”The other question is whether there is a hidden resistance among whites to casting a ballot for an African-American. That could potentially be a problem for Mr. Obama in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mr. Obama’s advisers argued that race had already been factored into polls; but it was notable that the Times/CBS News poll found that one-third of voters said they knew someone who would not vote for Mr. Obama because he is black. That is a question formulation pollsters use to try to get at prejudice that a voter might not otherwise own up to.Mr. Obama has made major strides in expanding the voter pool, especially among young people and African-Americans; the question is whether first-time voters, especially younger ones, will actually turn out. Consider this: An ABC News/Washington Post poll on Thursday found that first-time voters support Mr. Obama by 73 percent to 26 percent.Mr. McCain’s campaign looks to history for evidence of how big a step it is for new voters to go from registering, which can take place at a doorstep, to actually voting. Still, by every indication here in Florida — where there were two-hour lines in the southern part of the state as early voting began this week — the Obama campaign may be delivering on the formidable get-out-the-voter operation it has promised.Which is not to say they are not a bit worried.“Complacency is a big concern of ours, and that’s why we’re going to campaign energetically from start to finish here,” , the chief strategist to Mr. Obama said in an interview. “We don’t want anybody to think that this thing is done — it’s not done. One of the things that can undo us is if people believe that.”1048 2008-10-24 Many South Koreans complain that their economy is vulnerable to Western market panic and destabilization because it is more transparent and open to foreign capital than those of neighboring Japan and China, who have so far survived the credit crisis unscathed.“We are collateral damage in a crisis that is not our doing,” said Park Yung-chul, a professor of international finance at Korea University in Seoul. “We live in an unfair world.”They are not the only ones.Emerging markets around the globe have come under simultaneous pressure from the financial tsunami that started in the United States mortgage market.South Korea’s vulnerability is an indication that the global financial crisis has reached a new level.Unlike Iceland, South Korea is a major industrial power, whose $960 billion economy was the 13th-largest in the world last year Economists have been hoping that demand from South Korea and Asian neighbors like China and India could replace some of the lost global demand from slowdowns in the United States and Europe. The biggest concern is that the global credit crisis could cripple South Korea’s banks, which rely more heavily on overseas borrowing than China’s or Japan’s.As global credit markets have dried up, South Korean banks have scrambled to find dollars to repay maturing foreign-currency loans.Woori Bank, one of South Korea’s largest lenders, suddenly found itself unable to borrow dollars after last month’s collapse of Lehman, a bank executive said. Dealers in the bank’s trading room made frantic calls to big foreign banks seeking fresh loans, only to be told bluntly “no,” said Jung Hyun-jin, an executive vice president in the bank’s financing market business unit.Worse, foreign banks refused to roll over many existing loans, forcing Woori to repay them as they came due, also in dollars.With the bank using as much as $280 million of precious foreign currency a week, Woori has stayed liquid thanks to dollar loans from the government, which has pumped tens of billions into banks, Mr. Jung said.Recently, the crunch has begun to ease slightly, with some European banks like Deutsche Bank once again lending dollars to Woori, he said.“International banks, because of their own problems, won’t lend to us,” Mr. Jung said. “We don’t face a solvency problem. We face a liquidity problem.”Last Sunday, the government responded by pledging more than $100 billion in loan guarantees and an infusion of $30 billion in American dollars to prop up the Korean banking system. The government said the additional liquidity should help Korean banks repay or roll over the banks’ $80 billion in foreign currency loans that will come due by June 2009.“The money will buy us breathing room,” said Lee Dong-gull, president of the Korea Institute of Finance, a banking industry research center, speaking of Sunday’s move. “But there will not be a fundamental solution until we can find new sources of foreign currency funding.”The long-term fear is of the effects of a global slowdown on South Korea’s exports, and a trade deficit — the first since the Asian financial crisis. Some economists fear the deficit could also drain South Korea’s formidable foreign currency reserves.Foreign investors have been leaving South Korea since subprime problems first hit last year. In the first six months of this year, net foreign direct investment in South Korea turned negative for the first time since 1980, when such figures started being kept, as foreign investors withdrew a net $886 million, according to the Bank of Korea.Many blame South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, for failing to send a strong signal of government support for banks earlier in the crisis. Earlier this month, Mr. Lee called for South Koreans to reduce energy consumption and exchange their dollars for won, prompting some loyal citizens to line up at banks with dollars in hand, but reinforcing the image abroad that Seoul was unable to come up with a more effective response.One nightmare scenario has been the image of South Korea once again seeking outside help, as it did in 1998 when the International Monetary Fund led a bailout of the country. But with signs now emerging that the month-long global crunch may finally be easing, many economists are confident the country will pull through on its own power. Indeed, economists said the nation’s banks are much better able to weather a recession than they were in 1998. They say the real problem is that developing economies do not have the same access to emergency sources of foreign currency funding that the United States and a few developed countries have, and are thus left unfairly to the mercies of global financial markets.“We thought that sitting on a quarter of a trillion dollars in reserves would be enough to make us okay,” said Dr. Park of Korea University. “Boy, were we wrong.”1049 2008-10-24 William Frey, the president of one of the funds, Greenwich Financial Services of Greenwich, Conn., said that he was acting to protect the firm’s investments. “Any investor in mortgage-backed securities has the right to insist that their contract be enforced,” he said.In letters sent to banks and others, Greenwich Financial said that it was particularly concerned about the impact of a relatively new government program, Hope for Homeowners. That plan, which Congress approved over the summer, allows some borrowers to refinance their mortgages into fixed-rate loans with terms up to 30 years.Mr. Frey said that he was aware of two other funds in addition to his and Braddock Financial that sent similar letters, but he declined to identify them.Told about the letters, John Taylor, the president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a consumer advocacy group in Washington, said that he believed that the government might have to take action to protect homeowners from getting caught between different classes of investors.“We can’t try to operate in a crisis and think that we will be able to satisfy all the lowest common denominators like hedge funds,” said Mr. Taylor.Officials at banks and policy makers who have pushed for loan modifications say the servicing companies have the right to change loans if doing so will maximize returns to all investors.“We think that by doing more modifications rather than less, investors are going to be better off,” said Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa and a leading proponent of aggressive loan modifications.So far, disputes over loan modifications have been largely theoretical because most mortgage servicing companies are not aggressively altering the terms of loans and the government’s refinance program is just two weeks old.But lawyers expect the tension over the issue to build. In authorizing the Treasury to buy $700 billion in mortgages and related securities last month, Congress instructed the Bush administration, as an investor, to modify more loans.Officials at Braddock, a hedge fund firm based in Denver, said they were not against loan modifications per se but that they wanted to make sure renegotiations conformed to the contracts governing mortgage securities, which are backed by thousands of home loans. The most restrictive servicing contracts limit how many and what kinds of modifications mortgage firms can pursue. Other contracts allow the firms to pursue modifications more freely if doing so will minimize overall losses.David R. Myers, a senior portfolio manager at Braddock, said that if mortgage servicing firms did not strictly follow those contracts, it would delay the recovery of the credit market because investors would be less willing to buy securities in the future.1050 2008-10-24 MEXICO CITY — The Mexican Senate approved legislation on Thursday intended to reverse a decline in production by the state-owned oil monopoly Pemex, but analysts said the measures would not go far enough.The legislation frees Pemex from many government controls and will allow the company more flexibility in the way it signs contracts. But critics contend it does not remove the barriers to private investment that make Mexico’s oil industry one of the most closed in the world.Mexico’s lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, is expected to pass the bills by next week.The hope is that the new laws will create a more agile Pemex, formally known as Petróleos Mexicanos, to find and produce more crude oil to halt Mexico’s sharp drop in production over the last five years.Pemex’s crude oil output has dropped 10 percent this year and exports have fallen even faster, by 18 percent. Mexico has slipped from its position as the second-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States, after Canada, to the fourth.The government and many analysts contend that Mexico’s best hope to reverse the decline is to explore for oil in deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, where oil companies have had success in drilling in United States waters. But Pemex lacks the technology and the capital to tap the billions of barrels thought to lie beneath the sea floor at depths of 1,000 feet or more. To attract partners, Pemex would have to grant them a share of any reserves they find, which is forbidden under Mexico’s constitution.The bills would not change that. Instead, they would let Pemex pay cash incentives to contractors for finding oil or using new technology. Pemex relies heavily on oil services companies.1051 2008-10-24 Mr. McCain started his day at a lumber yard in Ormond Beach, where he stepped up his criticism of the Bush administration by pounding the lectern and demanding that the government support his plan to buy troubled mortgages from homeowners. “And why isn’t the Treasury secretary not ordering them to do that?” Mr. McCain asked, referring to Henry M. Paulson Jr.All day long, Mr. McCain told crowds that his opponent would say anything to get elected. “Senator Obama may say that he’s going to soak the rich, but it’s the middle class that are going to get wet,” Mr. McCain shouted to big applause at a rally in Sarasota.In Ormond Beach, Mr. McCain said: “We finally learned what Senator Obama’s economic goal is. As he told Joe the Plumber in Ohio, he wants to, quote, ‘spread the wealth around.’ He believes in redistributing the wealth, not in policies that grow our economy and create jobs and opportunities for all Americans. Senator Obama is more interested in controlling who gets your piece of the pie than he is in growing the pie.”“Socialist!” someone in the crowd yelled.As millions of Americans already know, “spread the wealth around” comes from Mr. Obama’s encounter with Samuel J. Wurzelbacher, known since as Joe the Plumber, outside Toledo on Oct. 12, when Mr. Wurzelbacher wondered aloud if Mr. Obama might support a flat tax. Mr. Obama replied that he did not think it was fair for someone as well-off as himself to pay the same tax rate as a waitress, and then added, “And right now everybody’s so pinched that business is bad for everybody, and I think when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody.”Based on this comment, the McCain campaign has been trying to paint Mr. Obama as a socialist.Mr. Obama spoke on Thursday to a crowd in downtown Indianapolis that the local authorities estimated at 35,000 people, and he hit Mr. McCain as supporting corporate tax cuts.“If Senator McCain wants to defend tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, that’s his choice,” Mr. Obama said at the rally at the American Legion Mall. “But I say, let’s end tax cuts for companies that ship American jobs overseas, and give them to companies that create good jobs right here in Indiana, in the United States of America.”Mr. Obama then left for Honolulu to visit his 85-year-old grandmother, Madelyn Payne Dunham. He is expected to spend much of Friday with her before flying to a rally Saturday in Reno, Nev.While Mr. Obama is only going to be gone for one full day, it is still an unusual occurrence at this point in a presidential campaign.“It’s not optimal, but there was never any debate or discussion or anything,” David Axelrod, the chief strategist for Mr. Obama, said in an interview Thursday. “Barack’s grandmother is one of the formidable people in his life. He wants to go see her on the advice of her doctors. He had to do it now. So we’ll just make do.”1052 2008-10-24 Over the last four years Raffaello Follieri became accustomed to luxury. An Italian-born businessman who ingratiated himself with wealthy Americans, he enjoyed sleeping in five-star hotels, attending fashion shows and whizzing around the globe in chartered jets. He even dated a Hollywood actress.The next chapter in his life, however, will take place in a far more austere environment.Mr. Follieri, 30, sat quietly in a federal courthouse in Manhattan on Thursday afternoon as Judge John G. Koeltl sentenced him to 54 months in prison as part of an agreement with prosecutors in which he pleaded guilty to 14 counts of wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy.“It is plain that the defendant engaged in a substantial fraud involving a significant amount of money over a significant period of time,” the judge said. “The defendant used the proceeds on lavish personal expenditures.”The plea also requires Mr. Follieri to give up $2.4 million, jewelry and 12 watches. The judge instructed the government to contact potential victims of Mr. Follieri’s schemes and said that a hearing would be held in December to discuss how Mr. Follieri’s forfeited money might be disbursed.The sentencing punctuated a dramatic narrative that stretched back to Mr. Follieri’s arrest last summer and became fodder for gossip columnists and TV shows because of his associations with Ron Burkle, a friend of former President Bill Clinton, and the actress Anne Hathaway, whom he dated.1053 2008-10-24 In “A Matter of Life and Debt” (Op-Ed, Oct. 22), Margaret Atwood would have us believe that a lack of a sense of fairness is at the root of the financial crisis. To the contrary, it was a sense of fairness that got us into it.The notion that it was unfair for people with limited means not to be able to own homes is what produced the lending patterns that have come back to haunt us. It was the bundling of the loans into derivative instruments, a consequence of an optimistic blind faith in capitalism as a religion instead of an economic system, that led to this catastrophe.Since Ms. Atwood is a novelist, she might have been aware that it was the transformation of credit into a fiction that blinded the traders, much as it did during the South Sea Bubble that devastated England. The road to hell is, indeed, paved with good intentions.Margaret Atwood reminds us that there has almost always been a social contract in which all humans, who are ultimately brothers and sisters, are expected to treat one another with decency and respect. Now we are suffering and seeing the consequences of forgetting this basic lesson in the form of predatory lending or reckless “investing.”Those citizens who did not show decency and respect to others were seduced by greed. Unless and until we re-establish a mutual respect for one another regardless of our incomes or education, we shall just go from this current crisis to a new one.1054 2008-10-24 Not surprisingly, the souring economy is expected to hit the technology industry. Gartner, a market research firm, recently said that if the economy is weak, technology spending in 2009 in North America will increase only half a percent, down from the 5.3 percent it had forecast previously.Information technology is now so woven into the fabric of business and commerce, noted Peter Sondergaard, Gartner’s senior vice president for research, that spending will not grow much more or much less than the economy as a whole.“In that sense, there is a safety net under the industry,” Mr. Sondergaard said.Still, for the economy as a whole, analysts have been scaling back their projections for business investment and profits over the next year.In early September, for example, Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody’s Economy.com, had expected business investment in the United States to be flat in 2009. Today, the Economy.com forecast calls for a 4.2 percent decline in 2009, while the forecast for total corporate profits for next year has been sheared by $100 billion in the past six weeks.“The financial panic has been a body blow to business investment and corporate profits,” said Mr. Zandi, who now expects the weak conditions to continue until the fourth quarter of 2009.Microsoft’s overall performance held up well, a bit better than expected, said Charles Di Bona, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein. Microsoft’s revenue in its first quarter, ended Sept. 30, rose 9 percent to nearly $15.1 billion from $13.8 billion a year ago. Net income increased 2 percent to $4.37 billion, or 48 cents a share, from $4.29 billion, or 45 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The consensus among Wall Street analysts was revenue of $14.8 billion and net income per share of 47 cents.Microsoft delivered healthy growth of 20 percent in sales of business software, which includes its Office desktop productivity, collaboration and online meeting programs. Indeed, the business software group surpassed the Windows desktop operating systems unit in both sales and operating profits.The Windows group posted a modest revenue gain of 2 percent and a decline of 4 percent in operating income from the year-earlier quarter. The slower growth, Mr. Liddell said, reflected a higher share of Windows sales for low-cost PCs both in developed countries and emerging markets, which have lower profit margins.The weakness in the Windows business, Mr. Di Bona said, showed that corporations are not upgrading their PCs to Windows Vista, which was introduced in January 2007, as quickly as in past product cycles for new Microsoft operating systems.Microsoft’s revenue was also helped by stronger-than-expected sales of its Xbox 360 video game consoles, which were introduced in 2005. Despite its other strengths Microsoft still struggles in its online business, trailing well behind the leader in Internet advertising, Google.For its 2009 fiscal year, which ends in June 2009, Microsoft offered guidance to analysts that was less optimistic than their projections. For the fiscal year, Microsoft said it expected to earn $2 to $2.10 a share on revenue of $64.9 billion to $66.4 billion. The analysts’ consensus, as complied by Thomson Reuters, was net income of $2.13 a share on revenue of $67.12 billion.In the regular trading session, before the quarterly results were released, the company’s shares rose 79 cents, or nearly 4 percent, to $22.32 a share.Most technology companies are either adopting more conservative assumptions about their business prospects, like Microsoft, or taking big steps to prepare for tougher times. For example, Xerox, the big printer and document-handling company, reported profits on Thursday morning that were slightly below Wall Street’s expectations, and announced plans to cut 3,000 jobs. The move, the company said, is intended to save $200 million a year in expenses.Anne M. Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox, said the company anticipated “very, very tough economic times,” and added, “that’s why we’re being so aggressive on cost reduction.”1055 2008-10-24 It is a testament to the Phillies’ pitching staff and the depth of their lineup that they are 8-3 in the playoffs despite this reality: the man who may be the National League’s most valuable player may be one of his team’s least valuable players in the playoffs. In his first 10 playoff games, Howard had struggled to adjust even as the pitchers’ approach against him has not changed. Most of the pitches he has seen are out of the strike zone, and he has had trouble laying off.Howard is an excellent opposite-field hitter, but he is still vulnerable to the low-and-outside pitch, particularly those biting sliders by left-handers. That nugget probably factored into how the Brewers, the Dodgers and the Rays pitched to him.“The biggest thing about him is this guy wants to hit so much,” Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel said, adding: “Sometimes that hurts his hitting. But when he’s patient and he’s seeing the ball and when he’s putting the fat part of the bat on the ball, the ball jumps.”The hitting coach Milt Thompson said after Wednesday’s game that he planned to work with Howard before Thursday’s game on pitch selection and remind him of his strengths, hitting up the middle and the left side. Howard, after acknowledging that he did not see the ball well in Game 1, said he identified pitches much better against the Rays’ James Shields, leaving a two-strike curve in the first before pounding a hanger over B. J. Upton’s head in center for a double. Shields changed his sequence against Howard in their next meeting, firing two fastballs. Howard fouled off the first, then grounded a sharp single through the Rays’ infield shift. Even though he grounded out off Shields in the sixth, Howard held off on two out-of-the-zone changeups and saw eight pitches.“The whole goal today was trying to see the ball and see good pitches and hit them,” Howard said.Manuel has been asked often about Howard’s disappearing power, and his response has invariably been that it will come around, that Howard can contribute just as much by walking or hitting a single. But Howard bats fourth for a reason. His last blast came Sept. 26 against Washington , and his homerless drought — 48 at-bats — is approaching his longest of the season, 49, from May 31 to June 12, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.Thompson said Howard would hit those homers as long as he was patient, but, he added, “It’s not as easy as it sounds.”The Rays are familiar with neutralizing left-handed sluggers, having held David Ortiz to four hits (and one homer) in 26 at-bats in their seven-game triumph against the Red Sox in the American League Championship Series. Maddon compared them, saying: “You don’t trust those guys. They could pop up at any time.”That is the Phillies’ hope. They saw a glimpse Thursday night. But they would like to see more at Citizens Bank Park. A man’s got to eat.1056 2008-10-24 Dynegy, a major owner of coal-burning power plants, has agreed to tell investors more about how global warming could affect its business, Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York State attorney general, announced Thursday.Dynegy has agreed to put detailed information in its financial filings on any material business risks posed by climate change.That could include warning investors about looming government regulations that might make it more expensive to emit carbons, or the possibility that the company could be sued over pollution.The agreement is the second of its type. Xcel Energy made a similar pledge with Mr. Cuomo’s office in August, and the attorney general has pressured three other power companies to follow suit: the AES Corporation, Dominion Resources and the Peabody Energy Corporation.A spokesman for Dynegy, which is based in Houston and provides wholesale power in 13 states, said the company believed that it was already making the types of disclosures sought by Mr. Cuomo’s office, and did not expect to have to change its practices.“We’re going to continue doing what we’re doing,” said the spokesman, David Byford. “To the extent that we identify material risks related to climate change, we’ll disclose them as we do other material risks.”Environmentalists applauded the deal. The former vice president, Al Gore, who appeared alongside Mr. Cuomo as he announced the arrangement in Manhattan, called the disclosure requirement “a new model to combat global warming.”1057 2008-10-24 How much: $89.50 at Ralph LaurenThe annual ritual known as the closet purge comes with its own special brand of dread. While it feels great to get rid of the old and make room for the new, there is no consolation for the horror of having cast off something you really should have kept. Take my husband’s western denim shirt. This is an item of clothing he would wear around the house or use as a rag. Gone. And now, of course, it’s all I want to wear. To add insult to injury, western-style denim is a big trend for spring 2009 (see Givenchy). But rather than returning to the Salvation Army, I went out and found a great men’s version by Polo Ralph Lauren.1058 2008-10-24 The timing may make for a frosty weekend in Beijing, where European leaders are to meet with top Chinese officials at the Asia-Europe summit meeting, held every two years. This year, the global financial crisis is expected to dominate, and cooperation will be high on the agenda.In Beijing on Thursday, José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, called for “unprecedented levels of global coordination.”“It’s very simple: we swim together, or we sink together,” he said in comments reported by The Associated Press.Behind the scenes, China had lobbied against Mr. Hu’s candidacy for the Sakharov Prize. On Oct. 16, Song Zhe, the Chinese ambassador to the European Union, wrote a critical letter to Mr. Pöttering.“If the European Parliament should award this prize to Hu Jia, that would inevitably hurt the Chinese people once again and bring serious damage to China-E.U. relations,” Mr. Song wrote, according to The Associated Press.China had also warned against awarding Mr. Hu the Nobel Peace Prize, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, had described him in scathing terms as a convicted criminal.“The Chinese government will be upset,” said Teng Biao, a legal expert who has written essays with Mr. Hu. “But as a responsible nation that is trying to integrate into the international community, China has to understand that its conduct should follow international protocols. It should embrace the criticism as an opportunity to improve China’s human rights condition.”Mr. Hu remains imprisoned in Beijing and could not be reached for comment. His wife, Zeng Jinyan, a prominent blogger and human rights activist, also could not be contacted. She has lived for months under house arrest with the couple’s infant daughter.The award to Mr. Hu is an embarrassment for the Communist Party two months after China’s successful staging of the Olympic Games. During the Olympics, the Chinese government proved it could smoothly manage the world’s biggest sporting event, but the government also prevented demonstrations at designated protest zones, instituted broad censorship restrictions on the domestic news media and placed numerous dissidents under house arrest or surveillance.Mr. Hu’s conviction in April was part of a nationwide crackdown against dissidents in what many human rights advocates considered a pre-Olympic silencing campaign. Mr. Hu, a Buddhist, has dedicated himself to a range of issues during the past 12 years, including environmental protection, helping AIDS patients, championing the legal rights of Chinese citizens and promoting greater democracy.He also used a personal Web site and e-mail messages to become a one-man clearinghouse of information on rights abuses and other controversies that officials preferred to keep quiet.“Whatever he does, he always stands in the forefront,” Mr. Teng said in an earlier interview. “Everything he wrote, everything he said, is straight from his heart. We have poor people and marginalized people in society whose voices are being muzzled. Hu Jia was trying to be the spokesman for the unheard voices.”Mr. Hu graduated from Beijing’s Capital University of Economics and Business in 1996 and almost immediately plunged into China’s nascent civil society. He traveled to Inner Mongolia to plant trees as a measure to slow the advance of the Gobi Desert.By 2000, China was facing the rapid spread of AIDS, a problem the government had initially denied and remained reluctant to publicly confront. Mr. Hu formed a nongovernmental organization, Loving Source, and focused on caring for people infected with H.I.V. in a blood-selling scandal in Henan Province.Gao Yaojie, a prominent advocate for AIDS patients in China, recalled how Mr. Hu once rode a bicycle down a rutted dirt road to reach an isolated village decimated by AIDS. The road became narrower and potted with holes until Mr. Hu simply put the bike on his shoulder and walked to deliver help to a village where local officials were trying to cover up the problem.“We didn’t do anything wrong,” Dr. Gao said in an interview earlier this month. “The only thing we did was to help H.I.V.-positive people. But we were always under great pressure from the government.”Mr. Hu later began joining Internet petition campaigns calling for the release of political prisoners, while also calling on the authorities to uphold legal rights under the Chinese Constitution.His activism quickly made him a target. In 2006, he spent 168 days under house arrest. Rather than disappear from public view, he produced a documentary, “Prisoners in Freedom City,” which included video of state security agents harassing his wife as she tried to leave their apartment complex, which is known as Bo Bo Freedom City.Indeed, as Mr. Hu faced constant surveillance and harassment, he continued to use the Internet to push for political reform and publicize abuses. His testimony via video link before the European parliamentary committee came last November.“It is ironic that one of the people in charge of organizing the Olympic Games is the head of the Bureau of Public Security, which is responsible for so many human rights violations,” he testified. “It is very serious that the official promises are not being kept before the Games.”1059 2008-10-24 “I think what we have here is a very nervous bear market with very little liquidity,” said Michael Holland, chairman of Holland & Company, an investment firm.But energy stocks gained, helped by a rise in oil prices on expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would cut production levels Friday at a meeting in Vienna. Chevron ended the day 8 percent higher, and Exxon Mobil soared 9 percent.Despite the late gains, continuing signs of a global economic slowdown tempered any uplifting news. Signs of improvement in the credit markets slowed on a day when Alan Greenspan, testifying before a House committee, told lawmakers, “We are in the midst of a once-in-a-century credit tsunami.”Mr. Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, expressed optimism in the long-term outlook for the economy, saying investors would emerge from the current crisis with a “far sounder financial system.” But his short-term outlook was bleak.“Given the financial damage to date, I cannot see how we can avoid a significant rise in layoffs and unemployment,” Mr. Greenspan said.Over all, lending remained relatively turgid. The interest rate at which banks lend to one another, as measured by the Libor rate, fell only slightly, hovering at levels reached before the worst of the credit freeze hit in late September. Demand for short-term Treasury bills, regarded as the safest assets around, rose slightly, indicating a small downturn in investor confidence.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 21/23, to 102 21/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.67 percent, up from 3.59 percent late Wednesday.The dollar was mixed against rival currencies after jumping to multiyear highs Wednesday, while gold prices fell.Crude oil futures were trading above their 16-month low. Light crude oil settled at $67.84, up $1.09.Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at Standard & Poor’s, warned that the economic outlook for the immediate future was recessionary. “The crisis of the moment is the economy,” he said. “Unemployment, the earnings coming in, and the forecasts going forward. Most of the numbers are not that good.”Indeed, there were new reports of deepening job losses on Wall Street. Shares of Goldman Sachs fell more than 5 percent after the company said that it was preparing to cut about 10 percent of its 32,500 employees.“We are getting to a point where stocks moving by 5 or 10 percent on a daily basis is becoming par for the course,” said Ed Yardeni, an investment strategist. “As long as investors can’t tell whether we’re coming or going, I guess we’re going to do both.”Third-quarter earnings reports continued to arrive, bringing largely gloomy news. Dow Chemical was an exception: the chemical maker was up 10 percent after it reported third-quarter net income that beat analysts’ expectations. Shares closed at $24.43. But the Xerox Corporation reported worse-than-expected profit as the weak economy dampened spending by its largest customers. Shares fell more than 3 percent, to $7.71.In European trading on Thursday, markets recovered from earlier losses. The FTSE 100 index in London gained 1.2 percent. The CAC-40 in Paris was up 0.4 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt closed down 1.1 percent.The S.& P./ASX 200 index in Sydney fell 1.17 percent on Friday morning. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index was down 4.45 percent early Friday, while the Kospi in Seoul fell 3.37 percent.For 2008 as a whole, world equity markets have given up 48 percent of their value.1060 2008-10-24 Vittorio Foa, an anti-Fascist intellectual, labor union leader and senator whose life traced the trajectory of the Italian left in the 20th century, died Monday at his home in Formia, outside Rome.

A co-production of Yash Raj Films and Walt Disney Pictures, “Romeo” is something new under the Indian sun: sophisticated computer-generated animation that uses stars to voice the characters. But craftsmanship and Disney aside, “Romeo” is very much a conventional Hindi movie with a small-guys-versus-gangsters plot, song-and-dance sequences and film references galore.Romeo, a honey-colored pup living on the Mumbai streets, has the voice of Saif Ali Khan, and he’s a typical Khan character, a Westernized sweet-talker with a propensity to start every sentence with “Dude” and “O.K. guys.” His idea for financial uplift? Open a hair salon, which he does with his crew of Bollywood-savvy mutts. (The uninitiated needn’t worry; the subtitles let no reference go unparsed, as in “Imitating Shah Rukh Khan” after a line of dialogue.) Trouble occurs when the gang runs afoul of Charlie Anna (Jaaved Jaaferi), the big don dog, who loves Laila (Kareena Kapoor), the same fluffy white creature with dreadful pink eye shadow that Romeo adores.Written and directed by Jugal Hansraj, “Roadside Romeo” may have its stars’ voices, but what it needs is their bodies. Perhaps Bollywood’s most ingratiating quality is how hard the actors work to entertain you: they dance, they cry, they risk appearing silly. The animated dogs in “Romeo” aren’t particularly appealing. They mostly walk on two legs and, unlike Disney characters, don’t wear anything beyond neck gear. They look oddly naked and move awkwardly, which flattens the dance sequences and keeps the film earthbound.And for all the movie-making know-how on display, “Romeo” isn’t visually attractive, though there are some nice touches: a dingy, spit-splattered “No spitting sign”; a beautifully detailed train; and peeling movie posters with images of larger-than-life stars, reminding us of Bollywood’s true glory.1071 2008-10-25 The backlog comprises a mix of open cases and solved cases awaiting analysis and entry of DNA into state and national databases.An audit released Monday by the Los Angeles city comptroller found that 217 backlogged cases here involved sexual assaults so old the 10-year statute of limitations had lapsed. The audit did not determine how many, if any, of those cases might have been prosecuted based on other evidence. The federal government has not quantified the country’s overall DNA evidence backlog since 2003, when it stood at 542,000 cases, but a researcher for Human Rights Watch who has studied the backlog, Sarah Tofte, estimates that it exceeds 400,000.“People just assumed that we were testing every kit,” Chief Papa said, “and we were not.”About 95 percent of state and local criminal cases are resolved through plea agreements, often before DNA analyses are completed. The police and prosecutors rely on confessions, witness testimony and physical evidence like fingerprints and ballistics.Still, DNA remains the most sophisticated and reliable physical evidence, especially in cases with no named suspects or promising investigative leads.Two weeks ago, President Bush signed a bill that includes an additional $1.6 billion over six years intended to speed DNA analyses by hiring temporary crime lab workers, providing overtime pay and renovating crime labs.But many crime labs are disqualified from receiving more money because they have failed to spend previous financing in a timely manner. A report prepared for Representative Howard L. Berman, a Democrat representing a district in Los Angeles, found that the Police Department had spent less than half of the $4.4 million in federal money it received from 2004 to 2008. Los Angeles police officials said that they had spent or committed all but one-third of that money but that they had not properly recorded some expenditures.The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department spent less than half of its $4.9 million in grants, the report said. Law enforcement agencies blame several factors for the DNA backlogs, including restrictions on how the federal money can be spent, local staff shortages, bureaucratic delays and planning problems. Some agencies have also seen the demand for new DNA analyses outpace efforts to clear old cases, criminalists said.Pete Marone, chairman of the Consortium of Forensic Science Organizations and director of the Virginia state crime lab, said staffing levels at crime labs had not kept pace with technological advances in DNA analysis.“Police are starting to send us new work that we couldn’t have done before,” Mr. Marone said. “We can do ‘touch’ evidence now, utilizing DNA analysis to see whether a defendant even touched a weapon. We can get DNA evidence from steering wheels. We can go into a room and find drugs on the floor and we’ll be able to analyze those drugs to determine which hand threw them down on the floor.”Criminalists said that other kinds of evidence occupied much of their time. Many crime labs facing hundreds of backlogged DNA cases have even more shelved fingerprint, serology, ballistics and drug evidence that needs to be tested.“DNA really accounts for just 10 percent of the caseload in crime labs around the country,” Mr. Marone said. “The majority of our work is analyzing drugs.”Processing of a DNA evidence sample takes about a week, said Larry Blanton, a criminologist for the Los Angeles Police Department.After a sexual assault, the police try to collect biological material — blood, semen, saliva — from the victim and the crime scene. If DNA is found, a chemical process creates billions of copies. A machine then produces a profile of 13 unique markers, which are entered into state and national databases for matches. Each DNA sample costs about $1,500 to analyze, criminalists said.About a quarter of the 105 local and state law enforcement agencies that received federal money to reduce their DNA backlogs beginning in 2004, when Congress first authorized the spending, were granted less money this year because they had failed to meet spending goals, according to the report prepared for Mr. Berman. In progress reports filed in January with the National Institute of Justice, about 40 of 82 agencies said their DNA case backlogs had increased or remained constant during the previous six months.“Many places have not even counted their backlogs,” said Ms. Tofte, the researcher with Human Rights Watch.In January, the Denver Police Department reported that it had used federal funds to process 13 cases last year, including eight rape kits, out of 934 backlogged cases. The Miami-Dade Police Department failed to spend any of the $200,000 it requested in 2007 to cut its DNA backlog, whose size was not reported to the federal government.The West Virginia State Police reported that its DNA case backlog had grown to 697 cases by Dec. 31, 2007, from 560 cases in July 2007, despite receiving about $230,000 in federal money.“Our backlog at its peak was around 730, and now we have about a 650-case backlog,” said Lt. Brent Myers, head of the state’s DNA analysis unit. “We haven’t been able to hire temporary employees as we would have liked, so that’s why it’s taken longer to spend that money.”The federal grants can be used to outsource DNA testing or to hire temporary employees, but not permanent staff members.Some police departments have done better. In New York City, a backlog of more than 17,000 DNA samples from sexual assault and homicide cases from 2001 to 2004 was brought under control when the Police Department hired additional criminalists to work more cases, added overtime, bought analysis equipment and hired private firms to process DNA.Elsewhere, the backlog has haunted detectives, as it did in a rape case that Detective Tim Marcia of the Los Angeles Police Department worked 10 years ago. A 43-year-old legal secretary was raped in her home as her son slept in another room. The attacker forced the woman to destroy evidence by cleaning herself.“Given the way everything happened,” Detective Marcia said, “I knew in my gut that this was a repeat offender and he was going to strike again.”Detective Marcia said he had rushed the woman’s rape kit to the department’s crime lab but was told to expect a processing delay of more than a year. He drove the kit to the state’s DNA testing laboratory in Sacramento, about 350 miles north. But a backlog there prevented testing for four months.During that time, the rapist broke into the homes of a pregnant woman and a 17-year-old girl and sexually assaulted them.1072 2008-10-25 A rapidly spreading cholera outbreak has sickened more than 12,000 people and is infecting 1,000 people per month, United Nations officials said Friday. So far, 200 people have died. Health officials say a crumbling water infrastructure, inadequate sanitation and poverty are partly to blame for the outbreak, but they also cite an unusual burial ritual in which mourners drink the water used to bathe the deceased.1073 2008-10-25 China has strongly condemned the decision by the European Parliament to select a jailed Chinese dissident, Hu Jia, for a prestigious human rights award. “We express strong dissatisfaction and stern opposition,” a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said in a written statement issued late Thursday evening. The European Parliament selected Mr. Hu on Thursday as the winner of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for his advocacy of human rights and democracy in China. Last April, Mr. Hu was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on a subversion conviction, based on his critical essays about the Communist Party’s rule.1074 2008-10-25 “He has the best political organization for a presidential campaign that I have ever seen here,” Tom Slade, a former state Republican chairman, said of Mr. Obama. “Bar none. He has run a phenomenally good campaign.”Mr. Obama’s huge financial advantage has turned out to be more lopsided here than in any of the other contested states, displaying, in an outsized way, what Mr. McCain is facing in states like Colorado and Indiana.For the week that ended Thursday, Mr. Obama spent $4.2 million on advertisements, compared with $1 million by Mr. McCain, according to Campaign Media Analysis Group, an independent group that monitors campaign advertising. It was almost impossible to turn on a television this week without seeing an Obama advertisement showing Mr. McCain saying he had voted with President Bush “90 percent of the time.”Mr. Obama’s campaign moved to exploit this state’s increasingly popular, and relatively new, early voting program in a way Mr. McCain did not. He came here for two days this week — as did Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton — using high-profile appearances to hand out literature and urge supporters who turned out to vote, often right up the street from the rally. The result could be seen in long lines of people at early voting sites.Mr. McCain’s advisers said they had put far less effort into the early voting program, instead sticking with what has worked for Florida Republicans for a decade: building up their margin with absentee ballots. But several Republicans said they were afraid that emphasis was missing the way voting behavior is changing here.Mr. Obama has used sophisticated measures here to find and register new supporters. And Florida statistics this week, which sent a shiver of fear through Republicans, attest to his success: Democrats now have a 660,000 edge in voter registration over Republicans in the state, compared with a Democratic advantage of 280,000 voters in 2006.Buzz Jacobs, the southeast regional manager of Mr. McCain’s campaign, suggested that Democrats would have trouble getting all those new voters to the polls. “They traditionally have a better voter registration system, and we have a better turnout operation,” he said.But even several state Republicans said they saw evidence that Mr. Obama was bringing new and highly effective methods to the state to find voters and turn them out.“I’ve gotten seven calls from live Obama volunteers — and the reason I’m getting calls is because I signed up on their Web site to get notifications from their campaign,” said Sally Bradshaw, a Republican who was a senior political adviser to Jeb Bush, the former governor.Ms. Bradshaw, who supported Mitt Romney in the primary, had signed up for the list to keep informed about a rival. “I haven’t received any McCain calls,” she said.Mr. McCain is in this spot today in part because of the conclusion by his campaign this summer that Florida, if competitive, was not as tough as it once was, and that there were more pressing states. Mr. Bush won here by five percentage points in 2004. The Democratic Party had earned months of bad publicity by pressuring its presidential candidates not to campaign in the state before its primary because Florida scheduled its vote earlier than party rules allowed.Political history suggested that Mr. Obama, as an African-American, would have trouble winning support from two of the state’s key constituencies: Hispanics and Jews. And this is the state of one of Mr. McCain’s great primary triumphs: His decisive victory here in January effectively handed him his party’s nomination.Mr. McCain’s advisers decided to focus on other states, limiting spending in a very expensive state. His chief strategist, Steve Schmidt, said he was not surprised to see things get tight, particularly as the housing market collapsed here, putting the economy front and center. “We always suspected that would happen,” he said.The developments have forced Mr. McCain’s campaign to devote precious candidate time and dwindling resources here in the final days of the campaign, at a time when Mr. McCain is facing pressure to shore up his position in other states Mr. Bush won in 2004. He spent a day here on Thursday traveling the state, and will be back next week; Gov. Sarah Palin, his running mate, will be here Sunday.“It was a strategic error on their part,” said Mr. Obama’s campaign manager, David Plouffe.Here as in much of the country, there have been strains between the local Republican organization and the McCain campaign about how to run in the state. Until Thursday, Mr. Crist, a Republican whom Mr. McCain said he had considered for the vice-presidential slot on the ticket, kept what appeared to be a definite distance from the McCain campaign, and made remarks — including one disputing Mr. McCain’s contention that the voting process here was subject to fraud — that were clearly unhelpful to Mr. McCain.In an interview, Mr. Crist disputed the notion that he was anything but whole-hearted in his support for Mr. McCain, and noted that he was accompanying him on a trip he was doing across Florida this week.“I really don’t know what that’s derived from,” Mr. Crist said. “I’m doing everything I possibly can. I’m excited about his candidacy. I love the guy.”Still, Mr. Crist’s associates said he had been irked that after everything he had done for Mr. McCain — many Republicans think he would not have won Florida, and thus the nomination, without the last-minute endorsement of Mr. Crist — the McCain campaign, at the last minute, had refused to broadcast a seven-minute video introduction he had prepared for the convention.From a more pragmatic point of view, Mr. Crist’s associates said he was concerned about becoming too closely identified with Mr. McCain’s campaign, worried that he would hurt his own standing with what one aide described as “Crist-Obama voters.”Some leaders said they had been stymied in their efforts to get help from the McCain campaign, though they said that was now beginning to change.“I did have and do have a frustration about getting people here to keep South Florida in the thick of things,” said Chip LaMarca, the Republican chairman from Broward County. “We had numerous telephone conversations and conference calls. We look forward to having more support here.”1075 2008-10-25 It turns out that every registration application generated by Rock the Vote in New York State is printed with the wrong address — about 100,000 forms this year. Although voters in New York must register with the boards of elections in their home counties — in the city, they’re called boroughs — all the Rock the Vote applications were addressed to the New York State Board of Elections, which does not handle voter registrations.“They backed the post office truck to the building here, twice,” said Robert Brehm, with the state board in Albany. “We had 32 bushels of mail one day. We had every person in the building working on it.”The state workers opened the mail and shipped it to the proper counties. Although city officials said they would try to register everyone who had mailed an application by the Oct. 10 deadline, no one could say how many of these would make it on the books in time for Election Day, given the rickety condition of New York’s voting operations.People in a few other states have also reported registration problems.“That’s not on Rock the Vote,” Stephanie Young, a spokeswoman for the group, said on Friday. “Once they register with Rock the Vote, they print it out and send it on themselves. We’re out of it after that. Then it’s on the State Board of Elections.”Normally, Rock the Vote is not quite that modest, having declared itself the “premier organization representing the intersection of young people, politics and popular culture.”Dressed as the messiah of democratic participation, Rock the Vote was started in 1992 by entertainment industry figures who said they were trying to bring the voices of the young into the political process. For many years, MTV was a major sponsor of the registration drives, although it is no longer involved in Rock the Vote, according to Ms. Young.The initial idea was that celebrities would help rouse young people who were taking no interest in politics. It turned out that some of the spokes-celebrities themselves had not bothered to vote for years. And the campaigns of civic involvement quickly became vehicles for product placement, a way for music companies and corporations to find the marketing sweet spot of people ages 18 to 29. Today, AT&T Wireless and the Xbox are listed as partners with Rock the Vote. A gamer could ask his or her Xbox to e-mail a registration application.Still, all of this might have put a high gloss on the dreary nuts and bolts of filling out forms — if they had been sent to the right address. “The whole idea was you click to register, it takes two seconds, you’ll be ready,” Ms. Nieberg said. “There were all these commercials. P. Diddy was advertising these vote shirts.”Everyone who uses the Rock the Vote registration Web site must provide an e-mail address, which may be shared with its partners. The group reports that it has registered two million young people this year, although that number is almost certainly inflated: it is simply a count of the people who printed out the forms.Asked if Rock the Vote had considered automatically filling out the right addresses on the application forms, Ms. Young said, “That’s not being discussed now.”Lauren Fuller, 24, who canceled her registration in Connecticut after she moved to the city, then tried to register through Rock the Vote, said she was baffled by the mixups. Ms. Fuller put an automatic reply on messages to her Gmail account warning her correspondents to check on their registrations if they had used Rock the Vote.“The whole point is just print the application, fold it, staple it and send it,” Ms. Fuller said. “You’d assume that you’ve taken care of it then. If anyone is not going to follow up on this, it would be the younger demographic.”1076 2008-10-25 Hedge funds and other investors are pulling money out of these countries on an immense scale, analysts said, and putting it into dollars and yen. There were few safe harbors, as commodities also tumbled. Fears of a spreading global recession caused oil prices to fall 5 percent, to $64.15, even after OPEC, the oil cartel, announced it was cutting output. Government-backed mortgage bonds and debt issued by top-rated corporations were also dragged down in the undertow.“This is a panic in the way of the fine 19th-century panics, where we all run around like headless chickens,” said R. Jeremy Grantham, chairman of the Boston-based investment firm GMO, who had predicted stocks would tumble. “I have been in the business for 40 years, and I have never seen anything like this.”So great are the concerns among policy makers about the turmoil in currency markets that it has prompted talk of a coordinated intervention by the leading industrial countries in coming days, to quell the soaring dollar and put a floor under emerging-market currencies.Such a move — in which the Federal Reserve and other central banks would sell dollars and yen and buy other currencies — has been used extremely sparingly by the United States in recent years.“The risk is huge, but it is appropriate at this point, because if the emerging markets go into default, the consequences would be catastrophic,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economist at Harvard.When a developing country’s currency loses value rapidly, it impedes the ability to pay back loans from Western banks. That could cause a rash of corporate or even government defaults — a feature of previous financial crises in Asia and Latin America.In the United States, the rescue effort may also grow. The Treasury Department, officials said, is weighing whether to expand its program of capital injections to encompass insurance companies, many of which own savings and loans, and is under pressure to include the financing arms of the auto companies. The government injections are currently reserved for banks.The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., appears to be drawing the line at investing in hedge funds, which, officials note, do not supply credit to the economy and are in the business of taking on large risks.Indeed, hedge funds accounted for some of the turmoil on Friday. They are being forced to sell their stocks, bonds and other instruments to pay off their investors and lenders. Beyond that, investors are increasingly convinced that the global economy is headed for a long, painful recession.“There has been tremendous activity in the currency markets, the commodity market and the stock market that reveal the fingerprints of forced selling,” said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, an investment firm based in New York.The flight to safety is hurting once-mighty currencies like Britain’s pound. On Friday, worries about how the financial crisis would affect Britain’s economy caused the pound to lose 8 cents against the dollar, falling to $1.53.While a strong dollar might be a boon for American tourists abroad, it creates a host of problems for economies.And the downdraft of the pound and the euro — which fell to $1.26 against the dollar on Friday, its lowest level in two years — is less serious for the economic well-being of Britain and Europe than the deterioration of currencies like the Mexican peso or the Russian ruble.Even if the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and other central banks intervened in the foreign-exchange markets, it was not clear that it would reverse the pressure on these currencies.“I don’t see this as a crisis breaker,” said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. “But it would help emerging-market companies, and give everyone a chance to catch their breath.”The last time the Federal Reserve intervened in currency markets was in September 2000, when it teamed up with the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan to shore up the faltering euro. Before that, the United States and Japan teamed up to buy yen during the Asian crisis in June 1998.With President Bush convening a meeting of the Group of 20 nations in Washington on Nov. 15, analysts said there would be pressure on the United States and other Western countries to show they were trying to cushion the blow of the crisis on developing countries.The International Monetary Fund is trying to arrange a large credit line to help developing countries desperate for dollars. On Friday, Iceland announced it had reached a tentative deal for a $2 billion emergency loan from the fund — making it the first country to seek aid from the fund during this crisis, and the first Western country to do so since 1976.The bad news started early Friday in Tokyo and Seoul, where big companies like Toyota, Sony and Samsung disappointed investors with their earnings. It continued as trading opened in Europe, with Britain reporting that its economy shrank in the third quarter.By the time investors awoke in New York, stock futures had fallen so far that trading in them had been halted. Investors were on notice that the market could fall at least 6 percent, perhaps much more.As trading started, the Dow dropped 450 points, or about 5 percent, and the floor appeared calm. Some traders said they took solace in the fact that the decline had not been greater — and far from the 1,100-point drop that would force a trading halt on the Big Board.“It was frightening, absolutely frightening,” Warren Meyers, a floor trader for Walter J. Dowd Inc., said early on Friday. “Every day we are walking on shaking ground.”Stocks seesawed for much of the rest of the day. A report that existing home sales jumped 5.5 percent in September as banks unloaded foreclosed homes did little to help the market.But at about 2 p.m., stocks started rallying, and by 3 p.m., the Dow was down by just 100 points for the day. It was unclear what was fueling the rally, though investors seemed cheered by reports that the Treasury was weighing investments in insurance companies.The Dow, however, was not able to build on those gains and fell sharply at the end of trading, dropping 183 points in 10 minutes.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 3/32, to 102 18/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.69 percent, up from 3.67 percent late Thursday.As is often the case when stocks fall steeply, the market is starting to entice some investors, many of whom say they have never seen prices so low, to buy. Among them is Mr. Grantham, the GMO chairman.After years of warning that stocks were unreasonably overpriced, he said he now believed they were below their fair value and had been slowly acquiring holdings in blue-chip companies.“It’s a very nerve-racking time to be a value investor,” Mr. Grantham said. “You put a little bit into the market, and the next day you think, ‘What an idiot, what an idiot.’ ”1077 2008-10-25 This season the Public is putting on six new plays by men and one by a woman. Since Mr. Eustis arrived in 2005, the count of new plays has been 19 plays by men and 9 by women (with one by a male/female team). It is a record that Mr. Eustis labeled as “pretty good but not great.”“The issue is best dealt with by consistent consciousness-raising rather than a specific program,” he added, saying the same approach applies to minority playwrights.Mr. Eustis plans to attend the meeting on Monday night, along with representatives from about a half-dozen other institutions, including the Atlantic Theater, the Manhattan Theater Club, Second Stage, SoHo Rep, MCC Theater and Playwrights Horizons, Ms. Jordan said. Audience members will have a chance to question the panelists.The explanation for such an imbalance is a puzzle, said André Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, which has one Broadway and two Off Broadway theaters. Some people argue that “most artistic directors are men, and they don’t relate to or connect with women as much as men,” Mr. Bishop said.“Connecting to a play is a very personal and unconscious thing,” he mused. “I hope that isn’t true, but I don’t know.”He added, “I try to think about these things all the time, but I don’t, because I’m a pathetic mortal.” He said he could not attend the meeting because it conflicted with a board of trustees dinner but said the recent opening of Lincoln Center’s new Off Broadway theater, LCT3, should provide more opportunities for female playwrights.Lynne Meadow is an example of that rare commodity Mr. Bishop referred to: a female artistic director in New York. Ms. Meadow, who has led Manhattan Theater Club for more than 35 years, reviewed submissions from recent years and estimated that about 40 percent came from women. Of 22 plays commissioned in the past eight years, 8 have been by women, she said. Manhattan Theater Club has two Off Broadway stages and one Broadway theater.Over a five-year period, 28 plays by men (including revivals) and 6 by women have been produced. This season, one of six plays is by a woman, Lynn Nottage.Ms. Jordan said she did not think that the sex of the artistic director was an issue, nor that there was conscious discrimination. The primary aim of the meeting is to raise awareness, she said. “Everyone knows of the problem, but they don’t realize its depth,” she said, or that “it is not getting better.” She said she wanted artistic directors and their literary managers to request more plays from American women if they were not getting them from agents.Monday’s meeting will focus on Off Broadway, which includes a number of nonprofit theaters with a mission to bring diverse new work to audiences. Broadway’s high-priced commercial operations, however, have a much worse record. At the moment, none of the plays on Broadway are written by women. The problem seems to be magnified in New York, many playwrights agreed.Gina Gionfriddo, whose play “Becky Shaw” is having its New York premiere at Second Stage in December, said that in her experience, the country’s most prominent festivals — including those at Humana in Louisville, Ky., and at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn. — were dominated by women. She said there were probably multiple reasons for the additional barriers women face, citing the fondness among directors and audiences for revivals and British imports, as well as some unconscious biases.Ms. Gionfriddo said she had been told that her characters were unlikable. “I wonder if Neil LaBute hears this,” she said of a playwright known for his corrosive depictions of human nature. She also suggested that women’s plays often do not resolve as conclusively as those by men, and that they do not follow the Aristotelian model of drama, which makes directors uncomfortable.Andrew Leynse, the artistic director of Primary Stages, where two of the six new plays this season are by men, said his organization was trying to improve that record. (Tina Howe’s new comedy “Chasing Manet” is being presented there.) Balancing all the demands of Primary Stages’ mission is “something we struggle with,” he said, listing support of minority and emerging playwrights, and pleasing audiences, which can sometimes pull in different directions. (The organization’s gala will prevent his attending the meeting, Mr. Leynse said.)For Carole Rothman, the co-founder and artistic director of Second Stage, the disadvantaged position of women is a familiar story. “Is there a cultural bias against women? I don’t know,” she said, but either way, “People don’t care.”Although artistic directors have the largest say over which plays get produced, Ms. Rothman is not convinced that they are the best pressure point. “It’s all about money,” she said. “Talk to people on the board, that’s more important than talking to the artistic director.”She added that contacting enlightened foundations that provide money to the arts and recruiting powerful female artists like Eve Ensler and Jane Fonda are other useful tactics.Ms. Rebeck said that male friends “in the system say to me I have to keep my mouth shut; don’t be part of the problem, don’t be a whiner.” But Ms. Rebeck, who has written on the subject in the London newspaper The Guardian and attended the last meeting, has disregarded their advice.“I think it puts in question excellence,” she said. “Whether it’s cronyism or bias,” she added, the result was that a message is sent that what is put onstage is “not about excellence.”1078 2008-10-25 Shares of the Thoratec Corporation lost more than half their value, to $12.55 in after-hours trading, after the cardiac device maker said wear and fatigue related to its implanted heart pump, the HeartMate II Left Ventricular Assist System, might require surgical replacement that could potentially be fatal. The company reported 27 confirmed reports of damage to the electrical lead that required pump replacement. In five of these cases, patients died because a pump replacement was not feasible, the company said.1079 2008-10-25 Fortune Brands lowered its profit forecast for the year after the slumping American housing market sent sales in its home and hardware unit, which produces Moen faucets and Aristokraft cabinets, down 20 percent. The company said the percentage drop in its earnings per share might range from the high teens to mid-20s. Fortune gets about half its revenue from home and hardware sales.1080 2008-10-25 Congress approved the $700 billion rescue program this month primarily to clean up a severely troubled banking industry saddled with debt. The administration originally envisioned it as a program to buy up distressed mortgage-backed securities and other hard-to-sell assets.But the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., rapidly shifted the focus of the Treasury’s efforts to inject money directly into banks instead, after it became painfully apparent the asset-purchase plan would move too slowly to erase the fear that is keeping paralyzed banks around the world from making loans to one another and in the broader economy.And because the bailout law gave wide latitude to Mr. Paulson, Washington’s interest groups mobilized to take advantage. Administration officials say the law instructs them to invest in financial institutions that are supervised by a federal banking regulator.The Financial Services Roundtable, a lobbying group for financial services companies, asked the Treasury Department on Friday to open its program to broker-dealers, insurance companies, car companies and financial institutions owned by foreign corporations.“The institutions that are excluded play a vital role in the U.S. economy by providing liquidity to the market,” wrote Steve Bartlett, president of the Financial Services Roundtable.That definition can be read to include insurance companies that own saving-and-loan companies and are therefore regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Administration officials said those companies would automatically be eligible to request capital infusions, though they would not be automatically entitled to money.Insurance companies with affiliated thrift institutions regulated by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision include State Farm Mutual, Principal Financial Group, Prudential, Nationwide, Allstate and the American International Group. Insurers with financial holding companies under Federal Reserve supervision include Allianz, Hancock and MetLife.Although the insurance industry is under pressure because of investment losses, some analysts said they did not understand why insurers needed immediate government help.“Who in the insurance business is asking the Treasury for money?” Andrew J. Barile, an industry consultant, said. “Allstate certainly doesn’t need it. State Farm doesn’t need it. And these are the biggest companies in our country.”A.I.G., a huge insurer, nearly collapsed in September because its dealings in credit-default swaps suddenly required billions of dollars in cash that it did not have.But no other insurance company is thought to have anywhere near the exposure to credit-default swaps that A.I.G. had.Virtually all insurers have suffered investment losses, which in turn have driven down their stock prices, sometimes sharply, as investors dumped shares to avoid dilution while companies raise new money. And the credit rating agencies have been reviewing and downgrading many insurers’ debt this month.But neither of those trends implies an urgent liquidity crisis that would leave insurers unable to pay claims, analysts said. Insurers are generally considered immune to run-on-the-bank panics because they do not take deposits. Policyholders cannot usually pull out their money without incurring losses.Mr. Barile, the consultant, thought insurance companies might have liquidity problems to the extent they had expanded into nontraditional areas like private wealth management, leasing and guaranteed investment products, where the obligations turn over more quickly.As the Treasury embarks on its unprecedented program to recapitalize banks, it is also becoming increasingly clear that it wants not only to stabilize the industry, but to reshape it. As part of its $700 billion bailout plan, the government approved a capital investment of $7.7 billion for PNC Financial, paving the way Friday for it to take over National City, a troubled regional bank swamped by losses, in a $5.2 billion deal.The measures, similar to those used in the Wells Fargo-Wachovia deal this month, illustrate the extraordinary lengths that the government is going to facilitate mergers.Bankers say the government appears to be using the investment program both to spur healthier banks to do deals and to encourage weaker institutions to consider selling themselves. The program avoids the political costs and possibly systemic risks of putting another bank into government receivership. But it also puts the government in the uncomfortable position of playing matchmaker as it confronts a second wave of consolidation.“They are playing yenta,” said Christopher Whalen, a managing partner of Institutional Risk Analytics.The government used both carrots and sticks to push National City toward a merger with PNC.By taking advantage of the Treasury’s capital injection program to help pay for its acquisition of National City, PNC averted the risk of securing financing from fickle private investors. PNC exploited a recent change to the tax code, made at the behest of Treasury this month, that will give it an estimated $6 billion tax benefit — possibly enough to cover the entire transaction, according to analysts.Late Thursday evening, regulators agreed to give PNC an additional injection roughly equal to the government money allocated for National City as a sweetener to complete the deal. Bankers said it was doubtful that National City would have qualified for the government’s investment as a standalone institution.National City sealed its deal Friday after learning it was not included on a list of 22 banks slated to receive capital injections from the government. The Treasury Department quickly shelved plans to publish the list so as to avoid giving the kiss of death to banks who are not on it, and will let banks make such announcements themselves.Bankers say the deal is a model for future transactions. More banks are expected to find out whether they qualify for government investments in coming weeks. And those that do not receive injections could come under pressure to find partners, since it will become painfully obvious to investors they did not receive the government’s seal of approval.PNC said it was purchasing National City for $2.23 a share, or nearly 19 percent below the stock’s closing price on Thursday.That makes the acquisition a “take-under,” meaning the purchase price is below the market value of the target company.PNC will inherit nearly $20 billion of losses on bad mortgage and other troubled loans, lifting its presence in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan just as the economy starts worsening.1081 2008-10-25 Several Democratic lawmakers lashed out Friday at hedge funds that have threatened to block attempts to renegotiate mortgages for struggling homeowners.At least two funds, Greenwich Financial Services and Braddock Financial, have told banks that they may take legal action if loans are renegotiated in a way that hurts the funds’ financial interests.Many hedge funds have purchased securities backed by mortgages. The New York Times reported Friday that Greenwich Financial and Braddock Financial, and possibly other funds, were resisting attempts to renegotiate the loans.Several Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, sent a letter to William Frey, the chief executive of Greenwich Financial, and Harvey B. Allon, the head of Braddock, asking them to testify about their positions at a hearing next month before the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. Frank heads that panel.In their letter, the lawmakers expressed outrage that funds were threatening to block the renegotiation of troubled home loans. The letter also urged the funds to voluntarily withdraw their opposition.“For the hedge fund industry, which has flourished from much of the past decade, to take steps so actively in opposition to what is currently in the national interest is deeply troubling,” the letter stated.1082 2008-10-25 Disappointing art auctions in London and Hong Kong this month cost Sotheby’s $15 million in losses on guarantees to sellers, Bloomberg News reported. The losses resulted when an artwork either sold for less than the minimum price the auction house had guaranteed or did not sell at all, Sotheby’s said in a filing late Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. An auction house agrees to pay some consignors a guarantee regardless of whether an item sells to encourage collectors to offer a work through it rather than a rival. A year ago Sotheby’s disclosed a loss of $14.6 million on guarantees from its Impressionist and modern-art sale in New York. Sotheby’s chief executive, Bill Ruprecht, said in May that he would reduce risk by cutting guarantees. On Thursday the company (which recently auctioned Damien Hirst’s “Beautiful Inside My Head,” above) said that guarantees had fallen 50 percent from a year ago and that it planned to “continue to substantially reduce its use of auction guarantees until stability is restored in the global economy and financial markets.”1083 2008-10-25 Classical composers have incorporated numerous traditions into their music, including Czech folk tunes, jazz, blues and tango. David Bruce goes further afield with a work inspired by South African gumboot dancing, a form that originated during apartheid.Since workers were often prohibited from talking while they labored, miners — who wore Wellington boots because of frequent flooding — communicated by slapping their boots in certain patterns, the origin of the rhythmic, energetic gumboot dance. On Thursday at Zankel Hall the St. Lawrence String Quartet and the clarinetist Todd Palmer gave the premiere of Mr. Bruce’s lively “Gumboots” for clarinet and string quartet, a Carnegie Hall commission.The work is divided into two parts, with a wistful, tranquil prelude preceding six jubilant “gumboot dances,” which according to the composer can be interpreted as a celebration of the regenerative power of dance.The slow section opens with a languid duo between viola and bass clarinet. At one point the clarinet fades out over gentle syncopated viola rhythms, as the violinist beats a light rhythm with his bow on the strings.In the final dance the clarinet spins rapid-fire trills over short, rhythmic violin fragments, ending on a joyous note.Mr. Bruce said in remarks from the stage that he was also inspired by Mozart’s ethereal Clarinet Quintet in A, which opened the program.1084 2008-10-25 And yet it was not until last month that many economists began to think a recession was likely, and many believe it began in the third quarter of this year, rather than many months earlier.A major reason for that delayed acceptance of the downturn was that the government initially reported the economy grew at an annual rate of more than 3 percent in the second quarter. That has been revised down to 2.8 percent, and may yet be revised lower some months from now. In any case, other factors are considered by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which makes the final decision. In the last two recessions, the downturn was over, or almost over, when the bureau finally decided it had begun.The first estimate for third-quarter growth will be released on Thursday and is likely to show a decline. The White House warned this week that the figure would probably be disappointing.The accompanying chart shows the Chicago Fed’s index in a three-month moving average, which the Fed says is the best way to evaluate the data.The index measures the change in the economy each month as shown by 85 indicators of economic activity. A value of zero indicates the economy is growing in line with long-term trends, while values above that indicate above-trend growth. The Fed says that a level of negative 0.7 indicates a recession may well have begun.For those who care what the numbers actually signify, a number of plus or minus one indicates the month’s results were one standard deviation above normal economic growth.The Fed said the biggest cause of the sharp falloff in September was a decline in income and production, particularly industrial production.The Fed has index figures going back to 1967, and in one way the current downturn is the longest ever. The three-month average has been negative — meaning that the economy is not growing as fast as normal — for 29 consecutive months beginning in May 2006. The longest previous streak was 25 months, ending in February 1983.As can be seen from the chart, only once has the index gone below 0.7 when a recession did not occur. That was in July 1989, and the figure moved back above that level the following month.Otherwise, every time it has gone below the recession level a recession has occurred, with the starting date almost always being within two months of the indicator reaching that level. The exception was in the 1973-75 recession, when the indicator did not fall to recession levels until the recession had been under way for nine months.Since the indicator hit recession territory last December, that would indicate a recession that started sometime from October to February.The Fed says this indicator will also provide evidence that the downturn has ended, when the three-month average rises to a positive 0.2. That does not seem likely to happen soon.1085 2008-10-25 But given the attractiveness of the no-risk-with-growth pitch at the moment, you’ll probably be hearing a lot about them in the coming months. That makes this an especially good time to review how an index annuity works, what its drawbacks are and whether there are simpler alternatives that can provide better results.First of all, you don’t need to know much about annuities in general to understand the basic premise of an index annuity. You hand over some money for a particular term, say 10 years, and you earn a guaranteed minimum of 1 or 2 percent a year over that period. Then, if there’s a jump in the stock market, as represented by an index like the Standard & Poor’s 500, you’ll also get a chunk of that gain, though generally not all of it.Sounds good so far, right? The first big complication comes from how the annuity providers calculate your return on the index and credit it to your account. There are at least a dozen ways this can happen, according to Sheryl J. Moore, president and chief executive of the market research firm AnnuitySpecs.com, though consumers generally select among just three or four of the industry’s most popular options.The other problem here is that the insurance companies that sell index annuities need to add all sorts of rules and restrictions so they can pay commissions averaging 7 percent to sales representatives, earn a profit and still offer that guaranteed minimum plus upside.First of all, you may need to keep most of your money locked up in the annuity for several years. If not, you could pay penalties, generally known as surrender charges, and possibly lose interest earned, though there may be exceptions for things like severe illness or job loss.Then, there are the three main levers that put a lid on what you can earn in an index annuity. There might be an annual cap that keeps you from getting credit for more than, say, an 8 percent rise in the S.& P. 500, even if the index earns 15 percent in a given year. Or instead of a cap, you simply won’t be allowed to collect more than half or two-thirds of whatever the index earns, even during a raging bull market. This is known as the participation rate. Finally, there may be a fee of 6 percentage points (or lower or higher), known as the margin or spread. It is subtracted from the index’s return before any other restrictions come into play.An index annuity will generally have one of these restrictions or fees, though it could have more.The list of things to keep in mind continues, practically ad nauseam. The restrictions, like the cap, may change during the time you have your annuity, which creates uncertainty. Unlike a mutual fund that tracks the S.& P. 500 and collects the dividends that are paid out, your annuity doesn’t earn such dividends and thus can’t hand them off to you. And while earnings inside an annuity are tax-deferred, you pay ordinary income taxes on that money once you take it out, not the lower capital gains rate.Despite a significant amount of shorthand on my part here, this is still an awful lot to take in. Especially if you’re 65, scared and not financially savvy.Or even if you actually deal with money for a living. “I have never seen an equity-indexed annuity that I understood, and I have never met anyone else who has,” Jay Hutchins, a certified financial planner with Comprehensive Planning Associates in Lebanon, N.H., wrote in an e-mail message. “Trying to figure out how they calculate your return is like unraveling a tangled ball of yarn.”So why even bother? Because if you look back at the last 10 years with the help of professional yarn untanglers, the performance of many, perhaps most, index annuities would have trounced an investment of the same size in an S.& P. 500 index mutual fund.I asked GoFigureNow, an actuarial and educational service that helps sales representatives calculate historical returns on index annuities, to calculate the return on an index annuity with an 8 percent cap, a participation rate of 100 percent and no spread. This sample product also would have paid a 5 percent bonus to the holder of the annuity upfront (a common sales tactic) and used something called an annual point-to-point crediting method for adding gains on the index to the account.The result? The index annuity, which started with $100,000 in October 1998, would have had an account value of $176,478 as of Friday’s market close. The S.& P. 500 index fund, which also started with $100,000, would have actually lost money over 10 years, ending with a balance of $81,890.Those kinds of numbers make an index annuity tempting. But again, remember why we’re here. If you’ve read this far, it’s because you’ve had enough of the drama, you want no downside risk and you’re seeking safety. So throwing all your money in the S.& P. 500 isn’t a real choice for you.So consider this alternative, which many financial planners suggest in various forms: Let’s say you have $10,000, and you don’t want to lose a cent of it. You could take just enough of that money and buy zero-coupon Treasury bonds that will be worth $10,000 in 10 years, thus guaranteeing you’ll get your principal back. Then, you could plop the rest in an S.& P. 500 index fund (to get some of that same upside that the index annuity promises).How might that work out for you 10 years from now? In a simulation examining 50,000 different outcomes using the same sample annuity I described above in the backward-looking comparison, and assuming an annualized S.& P. 500 return of 10 percent (7 percentage points from capital gains and 3 percentage points from dividends), the bonds-plus-index-fund strategy beats the index annuity 81 percent of the time. Take that presumed return up to 13 percent, and the index annuity loses 92 percent of the time.Craig J. McCann, a former Securities and Exchange Commission economist whose firm performed the simulation for me, says he believes that standard annuity terms are even less favorable than the ones I asked him to use. His firm, Securities Litigation & Consulting Group, does work for lawyers suing annuity providers (and for government agencies as well), and the index annuities he has studied have underperformed more than 99 percent of the time.The terms I asked him to use, however, come from Ms. Moore at AnnuitySpecs, who makes a living keeping an eye on the products offered by annuity providers. “I have seen every single index annuity in the past decade,” she said. Ms. Moore has served as an expert witness for annuity providers in cases where Mr. McCann has helped the other side.I’m in no position to referee here about what sort of index annuity is typical. Neither are you. And I haven’t even mentioned other factors here, like the viability of the company offering the policy, the volatility in current index annuity pricing and the insurance features of these annuities that their issuers promote.My point in all this is simply to note that index annuities can be complex, and there are high-performing alternatives that aren’t. Given the stakes now that your portfolio is down double digits, please don’t buy any financial product, index annuity or otherwise, without getting a second (or third) opinion from someone who has no stake in whether you close the deal.1086 2008-10-25 The United States has also harshly criticized efforts to apply the rules to American-based carriers, maintaining the rules may violate international aviation agreements.Friday’s decision was expected, however, after European governments reached a political agreement with the European Parliament in June.The International Air Transport Association has reported that global airline passenger traffic fell 2.9 percent in September, compared with a year earlier. It was the first monthly drop since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003.A drop in air freight of 7.7 percent was the first since the market for technology stocks crashed in 2001, the transport association said.In another sign of gloom in the industry, Europe’s largest airline, Air France-KLM, warned that its earnings would suffer as a result of the financial crisis, sending its shares down sharply.The airline said it was struggling to reach a full-year goal of 1 billion euros in operating profit for the 12 months through March 2009. Air France-KLM vowed to curb capacity and freeze costs, but said that it would “remain comfortably in profit as long as market conditions do not deteriorate any further.”The inclusion of aviation in the carbon trading system will raise costs for airlines, which pay for a portion of their emissions permits to comply. The system also will raise costs for passengers if airlines, as expected, pass on the costs by raising ticket prices.European Union climate officials say it is vital to regulate greenhouse gases from aviation because the sector is growing so quickly.Low-cost carriers like Ryanair, based in Ireland, have made short hops by air accessible for many more Europeans. Even so, the measures approved on Friday include special provisions that could ease the rules on start-up airlines in faster-growing economies within the union, like those in Eastern Europe.New airlines or airlines growing at more than 18 percent annually would be eligible for a one-time limited supply of additional free permits. That measure would ensure that countries “with initially very low but increasing mobility rates are not penalized by the scheme,” European Union governments said in a statement.The airline industry says its gases represent a small fraction of greenhouse gas emissions and that the European measures will be ineffective without a global agreement. Environmentalists say the effect of vapor and emissions from jet engines at altitude could magnify their effect on the climate.1087 2008-10-25 The tide of bad news continued as markets opened in Europe, with Britain reporting that its economy shrank in the third quarter. The pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar in five years. European shares recovered some ground in the afternoon, with the losses in Frankfurt and London pared to 5 percent at the close.The sell-off appeared to be driven by two broad forces. First, investors are increasingly convinced that the global economy is headed for a long, painful recession. Second, hedge funds and other investors are being forced to sell their stocks and bonds to pay off investors and lenders.By the time investors awoke in New York, they learned that Wall Street stock futures had fallen so far — including a 550-point decline in the Dow — that trading in them had been halted. A spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange had to affirm that it would indeed open for trading. Everyone was on notice that the market could fall at least 6 percent and perhaps much more.A few minutes before trading was set to open at the New York Stock Exchange, an unusually large crowd of camera crews and reporters jostled for space in the press gallery to catch glimpses of traders at the opening bell.The usual team of market watchers from CNBC were joined by the likes of Al Jazeera and French television.As trading started, the Dow dropped 450 points, or about 5 percent, and the floor appeared calm. Some traders said they took some solace that the decline had not been greater.“It was frightening, absolutely frightening,” Warren Meyers, a floor trader for Walter J. Dowd Inc., said about trading in the European and futures markets. “Every day we are walking on shaking ground.”Indeed, there were fresh reminders of the economic turmoil. Chrysler, the embattled auto manufacturer, said it would slash 25 percent of its salaried work force. And airline passenger traffic fell 2.9 percent around the world in September, according to a Geneva-based trade group, a sign of further problems to come for the ailing aviation industry.In an emergency meeting in Vienna, OPEC ordered a cut in oil production of at least 1.5 million barrels a day to try to slow the slide in oil prices. But oil futures still fell $3.69 on Friday, to $64.15 a barrel, helping to send shares of energy companies down sharply.A spokesman for the White House, Tony Fratto, said on Friday that “markets are trying to digest lots of new information, both changing economic conditions as well as official policy responses, and it will take time for conditions to settle.”On Wall Street, the yields on Treasury bills dropped, a sign that investors were seeking the safety of the government notes. The yield on the 30-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level in 30 years.A contraction in the economy of Britain, coupled with poor corporate earnings in England and Europe, helped the dollar gain again against the pound and the euro.In the United States, the stocks of automakers like Ford and General Motors suffered after Toyota reported sales declines, suggesting a worsening environment for all carmakers. In Germany, Daimler’s stock dropped 11.4 percent after it reported lower third-quarter earnings.Falls on the London stock exchange were led by declines in banking, airline and mining shares. In Paris, Air France warned of lower profits, sending its shares down by almost 10 percent.In Britain, data released on Friday showed that economic output shrank for the first time in 16 years, by 0.5 percent between July and September, according to the Office for National Statistics.Britain is the first of the seven most-developed industrialized nations to publish economic data for the quarter and some economists said they expected the other nations also to report that gross domestic product shrank.“This is going to be a long, drawn-out downturn of about five quarters of negative growth and there will be very few major economies that will escape recession,” said James Knightley, an economist at ING Financial Markets in London. “With asset values falling, real incomes down and corporate profits declining we can see a real drop in investments and the government is in no position to help.”The services sector, which accounts for 75 percent of Britain’s economy, shrank 0.4 percent in the quarter from the second quarter and business services and finance output contracted 0.4 percent, the Office for National Statistics said.The figures confirmed comments earlier this week by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, that a recession was probable. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said on Wednesday that Britain’s economy would suffer more than other major industrialized countries because of a combination of rising household and public debt, a sharp fall in consumer spending and decline in house prices.Stuart Thomson, investment manager at Resolution Asset Management in Glasgow, said the British economy could face as much as three years of recession. “It’s a global phenomenon and that makes it worse,” Mr. Thomson said.In Asia, there were losses throughout the region. The Kospi index in South Korea plummeted 10.6 percent, falling 1,000 points and heading for a total decline this year of more than 50 percent. The Straits Times index in Singapore hit a four-year low, down 4.8 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 8.3 percent and Taiwan closed down 3.1 percent.The sell-off came as the yen reached a 13-year high of 95.35 against the dollar. Sony, which is suffering an added burden from the strong yen, shocked investors with a sharp reduction in its full-year earnings forecast after the close of trade in Japan on Thursday.The stock was punished on Friday, plunging 14 percent to a 13-year low. Sony, which cited “a deterioration in the market environment brought on by the slowing global economy and an intensification of price competition,” is heavily reliant on export markets in the United States and Europe, where its goods have become more expensive to consumers thanks to the appreciation of the Japanese currency in recent months.1088 2008-10-26 Senator Barack Obama redoubled his efforts to tie Senator John McCain to the Bush administration by seizing on Mr. McCain's remark Sunday that he shared a ""common philosophy"" with the president....1089 2008-10-26 Mr. McCain also found himself defending his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin,” from criticisms about the $150,000 that the Republican Party spent on new outfits for her, a distraction for a candidate who concentrated on attracting whom she called “Joe Sixpacks” and “hockey moms.”“Look, she lives a frugal life,” Mr. McCain said. “She and her family are not wealthy. She and her family were thrust into this, and there was some — and some third of that money is given back, the rest will be donated to charity.”Ms. Palin, as she campaigned in Florida on Sunday, opened a speech by launching her own defense of the clothing purchased by the Republican National Committee.“Those clothes, they are not my property,” Ms. Palin told a large crowd in Tampa. “Just like the lighting and the staging and everything else that the R.N.C. purchased. I’m not taking them with me. I’m back to wearing my own clothes from my favorite consignment shop in Anchorage, Alaska.”She added, “The double standard here — gosh, we don’t even want to waste our time.”Mr. Obama steered clear of the clothing flap — as he has done since it became public last week — and began boiling down his pitch to a simple question to supporters here: “Don’t you think it’s time that we want to try something new?”“The American people don’t want to hear politicians attack each other — you want to hear about how we’re going to attack the challenges facing middle class families each and every day,” Mr. Obama said. “What we need right now is honest leadership and real change.”Heading into the final eight days of the campaign, Mr. Obama is seeking to capitalize on his advantages in states by slowly segueing away from Mr. McCain to close on a positive note. The closing argument that he unveils to voters on Monday in Canton, Ohio, will be amplified on Wednesday during a 30-minute prime-time infomercial on television networks, a rare and expensive move by a presidential candidate.Mr. McCain, who spent the weekend warning voters that his Democratic rival was arrogantly jumping the gun before Election Day, dismissed concerns about his position in the race. He said he could feel intensity and passion in his crowds, adding that he was “proud of the campaign I’ve run.”“We’re doing fine. We have closed in the last week,” Mr. McCain said. “We’ll be up very, very late election night.”1090 2008-10-26 Headlines from the world of property: International hot spots Analysts wade in with their picks: France, Montenegro, the Alps and Singapore make the list.

He says he came to believe that they should be less a matter of search-and-destroy the bad guys and more a matter of win the hearts and minds. He’s no isolationist, of course, but neither can he consistently be labeled either a realist, who requires “a dog in that fight,” or a neoconservative idealist, who would promote American values anywhere and everywhere. May 18, by Matt Bai.The Sailor and the Senators, B.Y.O.B.As the Navy’s liaison to the Senate, Captain McCain found a father figure in Senator John Tower of Texas and fun-loving friends in Senators Gary Hart and William S. Cohen. Thus fortified, he combined a cold war apprenticeship with some hot-time globe-trotting. May 29, by David D. Kirkpatrick.In 1974 at the National War College, Mr. McCain wrote that teaching soldiers about American foreign policy would make them better warriors. The idea was born of his experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. When it came time to resist or rat, Americans captured after 1968, he felt, when the antiwar movement was in full swing, were more susceptible to the latter course than those captured before. Such ideas inform his views of war fighting today. June 15, by David D. Kirkpatrick.“Maverick” McCain was born after his loss in the 2000 presidential race. Suddenly he found unlikely friends in his own Republican Party, as well as among the Democrats. He puzzled and infuriated partisans on both sides, but along the way he came to be seen as the “magic ingredient in any legislative deal,” mastering the art of political triangulation. July 21, by David D. Kirkpatrick.Before 9/11, and After, a HawkThe McCain doctrine is founded on the principle that the exercise of military power sets the bargaining table for international relations. His call for a “rogue state rollback” came long before 9/11. On 9/12, he named Iraq, Iran and Syria as potential targets. Three months later, he rallied sailors and airmen with a cry of “Next up, Baghdad.” Aug. 17, by David D. Kirkpatrick.The McCains own houses in Arizona and on both coasts. The source of their wealth is Cindy McCain’s inheritance from her father, the beer distributorship Hensley & Company. The fortune makes Mr. McCain one of the wealthiest members of the Senate, but little of it is in his name. Aug. 22, by David M. Halbfinger.Freddie and the Campaign ManagerWhile the McCain campaign was accusing the Obama campaign of ties to former officials of the mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, a firm owned by Rick Davis, Mr. McCain’s campaign manager, was on Freddie’s payroll to the tune of $15,000 a month from the end of 2005 through August, when Freddie and Fannie were taken over by the government. Sept 22., by David D. Kirkpatrick and Charles Duhigg; and Sept. 24, by Jackie Calmes and Mr. Kirkpatrick.Mr. McCain loves a good roll at the craps table, but his interest in gambling goes deeper than that. As a two-time chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, he has done more than any member of Congress to shape the laws governing casinos, helping transform the once-sleepy Indian gambling business into a $26-billion-a-year behemoth with 423 casinos across the country. Sept. 27, by Jo Becker and Don Van Natta Jr.He didn’t want to be “a professional P.O.W.” But after Mr. McCain was persuaded to write his memoir, “Faith of My Fathers,” the McCain brand became something of a Hemingway character, a Brando outlaw and Casper Clubfoot’s grandson rolled into one. Oct. 13, by David D. Kirkpatrick.How would Americans be better off for electing, rather than simply admiring, a stubborn patriot? That has been the task of Steve Schmidt and the rest of the McCain campaign strategists. The difficulty of it has caused them to change their candidate’s narrative over and over again in an effort to tap his “true character.” Should it be the heroic fighter versus the quitters? Leader versus celebrity? Maverick versus Washington? Something else? Oct. 26, by Robert Draper.1096 2008-10-26 Clearly, along with the high stress level that comes with a record number of students applying to colleges, there’s the even higher stress level that comes with the realization that in tough times, affording college is no given and there are things that trump fancy windshield stickers from brand-name colleges.“I tell people that SUNY Binghamton is becoming the new Harvard,” said Bob Sweeney, a college counselor at Mamaroneck High School in Westchester. “My son is an eighth grader, and I whisper the names of the SUNY schools in his ear every evening.”The new Harvard is probably still Harvard. The stratospheric private-school sticker price is not what most people pay. And there are still armies of kids getting in line to be rejected at the nation’s most competitive universities.But on the 10 a.m. tour at Binghamton on Friday, Maureen Haas of Jamesport, on Long Island, wore a Cornell lacrosse sweatshirt yet seemed thrilled that her daughter, Erika, who wants to be a doctor, is more interested in Stony Brook or Binghamton. Margaret Heller of Hicksville, also on Long Island, has one child at Villanova but said she was not sure how she could make it work for two at comparable prices.Binghamton’s president, Lois B. DeFleur, said the university had seen a steady increase in applications even before the fiscal crisis, “but it looks this year like it’s going to be a quantum leap.” She attributed the growing interest to the school’s reputation, campus environment and success in the job market. But she knows that’s hardly the only thing.“People want value,” she said. “They always want value. But in this environment, they’re even more concerned with value.”The people on the tour were a reminder that the education universe is wider than the wish lists in the most college-obsessed precincts of Manhattan, Westchester, Bergen, Fairfield or Nassau.Joanne Grover’s son, Tyler, is interested in Clarkson University, a 3,000-student research institution in Potsdam, N.Y., and she thinks she can swing that with financial aid if it works out. Scot Ioset has a daughter at Houghton College, a Christian school in western New York. There’s talk of Delaware, Connecticut and Rutgers, more often than the Top 10 in the U.S. News rankings. Almost everyone has price in mind.“You have to,” Mr. Ioset said. “I’m from Hamilton, where Colgate costs something like $46,000. These schools have to follow Harvard and find a way to bring the price down.”Harvard, of course, has the singular luxury of its $36.9 billion endowment, or whatever is left of it after the market carnage of the past few months. The best-endowed schools can guarantee financial aid for the top students.But there’s only so much scholarship money out there. So cost is looming as a huge issue for those with marginal resources as well as those in fancier neighborhoods who may find that their income and net worth last year will look a lot higher to universities doling out financial aid than it feels to them in the current environment.“I think the most difficult issue confronting parents is the issue of uncertainty,” said Barbara Leifer-Sarullo, the director of counseling at Scarsdale High School. “I had a family come in and say, ‘What if I lose my job in February, March or April?’ It’s a very valid question. So one thing we’re seeing is more people applying to state schools in case their family situation changes.”That, of course, will trickle down to the students for whom there’s not much give on price. Amy Levitan, a single mother from Little Neck, Queens, said that she would be able to afford the expensive schools like Tulane, Delaware, Pittsburgh and Miami that her son Jeremy is considering only if they get a substantial aid package. But with so many more people applying to Binghamton, she knows it will be harder than ever to get in, so Jeremy is also looking at other SUNY schools like Buffalo, Oneonta, New Paltz and Geneseo.Some also warn that people looking at SUNY need to consider the effects of looming state budget cuts. Some hope there might be a slightly better chance of getting into the top schools if others decide not to apply this year.Andy Finn, whose daughter Natalie is a senior at Ossining High School in Westchester, has already visited Binghamton as well as a raft of other schools. He’s open to all options, but said the public route looks a lot better now that it did a few months ago.“We did everything we were supposed to, and after the last 12 months, whatever we contributed to our 529 is all we have left,” said Mr. Finn, an executive with Tourneau watches. “I sat her down after we visited one of the schools in D.C. and said, ‘Let’s look at reality. Some of these schools cost $50,000 and the SUNY schools cost $15,000. That’s a $140,000 difference over four years. With that I will pay for grad school. I will pay your rent when you live off campus. I will buy you a car, and send you to Europe for a summer and still be way ahead.’“You want to do what’s best for your kid, but you also want to make financial sense.”1097 2008-10-26 DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Alex Rivera, a photojournalist who spent his career covering the civil rights movement and working at North Carolina Central University, has died. He was 95.Mr. Rivera died on Thursday, the university confirmed. A cause of death was not reported.Mr. Rivera was born in Greensboro, N.C., and grew up immersed in civil rights activism with his father, a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He attended Howard University and worked for The Washington Tribune, the statement said.In 1939, Mr. Rivera was recruited to create the news bureau at the North Carolina College for Negroes, later North Carolina Central. He served in naval intelligence during World War II, then returned to journalism.Mr. Rivera covered the last lynchings in South Carolina and Alabama, and legal challenges to school segregation. He won a Global Syndicate Award in 1955.He returned to the university in 1977 and led the public relations office until he retired.1098 2008-10-26 “People have grown very nervous,” said Harry Holzer, a labor economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute, tracing cause and effect. “They have seen a lot of their wealth wiped out and as they cut back their spending, companies are responding with layoffs, which hurts consumption even more.”The unemployment is widespread, with Rhode Island the hardest hit.For Dwight and Rochelle Stokes of Phenix City, Ala., the layoffs are a family event. He lost his job two weeks ago as an aviation mechanic at the Pratt & Whitney jet engine facility near his home — a few days after his wife lost hers as a cosmetologist at Great Clips, a family-owned barbershop and beauty salon.“It got really slow in July and August,” Ms. Stokes said. “I would sit there for two hours, and some days we had only 10 clients, four of us for 10 clients.”The broadening layoffs are most pronounced on Wall Street, in the auto industry, in construction, in the airlines and in retailing. The steel mills, big suppliers to many sectors of the economy, are shutting 17 of the nation’s 29 blast furnaces — a startling indicator of how quickly output is declining as corporate America struggles to adjust to the spreading crisis.“We have seen a softening order book in the most dramatic ways in the last week,” said Tom Conway, a vice president of the United Steelworkers of America, adding that layoffs in the industry “are just starting now.”In September alone, 2,269 employers each laid off 50 people or more, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, up sharply from the spring and summer months, and the highest number since September 2001, when the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks coincided with a recession to spook employers. A spike in 2005 was related to Hurricane Katrina.The financial services industry has been cutting jobs since last summer, when the credit crisis took hold. By some estimates, 300,000 jobs will disappear from banks, mutual fund groups, hedge funds and other financial services companies before the crisis subsides — 35,000 of them in New York.Goldman Sachs alone, among the best performers on Wall Street, has announced plans to cut 10 percent of its work force, which stood at 32,594 at the end of last month.The current unemployment rate, 6.1 percent — up more than a percentage point since April — is still relatively mild by post-World War II standards. The highest level since the Great Depression, 10.8 percent, came in November and December of 1982 as the economy was shaking off a severe recession.The unemployment rate hit 9 percent during the mid-1970s recession, and 7.8 percent in the 1990-1991 downturn. The next peak, 6.3 percent, occurred in June 2003, during a long jobless recovery in the aftermath of the 2001 recession.Dwight and Rochelle Stokes, both in their late 20s, have just joined the layoff rolls. So has Mr. Stokes’s father, Warren, 48, who lost a $30-an-hour job this month on the assembly line of the Chrysler truck plant in Fenton, Mo., near St. Louis., where the father had worked for 12 years. “They just cut back,” the son said.Just a year ago, he and Rochelle, and their two very young children, moved to Phenix City from Fenton so he could take the mechanic job at the Pratt & Whitney plant in nearby Columbus, Ga. Airlines send engines there for periodic overhauls, and when Mr. Stokes arrived 400 workers were tearing down and rebuilding 15 engines a month.But as the airlines reduced their flights — and announced 36,000 job cuts, nearly all of them taking place in the current fourth quarter — that number fell to three engines this month and “it was going to be worse for November, just one or two,” Mr. Stokes said.“We came in on Monday morning and our supervisor told us not to touch an engine, and we knew there would be layoffs,” he said. By lunchtime, Mr. Stokes and 100 others had been escorted out of the building, with four weeks’ pay as severance, along with four weeks of health insurance and a $1,000 departure check.As a starting mechanic, Mr. Stokes’s pay, $11.50 an hour, was just over half of what he had earned as the manager of a chain of pawn shops in Missouri. But he took the job anyway, moving with his family, because Pratt & Whitney offered full college tuition. Mr. Stokes immediately enrolled in Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University to pursue a bachelor’s degree in management and a minor in engineering sciences.Using all his spare time, he had earned half the necessary credits when the layoff came. The severance included extended tuition, and Mr. Stokes, piling on course work, hopes to earn his degree by early summer. But he will do so by correspondence course; the family is returning to Missouri, moving in rent free with Mr. Stokes’s sister in Fenton.“I am going to take seven or eight courses and hurry up and get my degree, and my wife will go back to cutting hair,” Mr. Stokes said, “and when I have my degree in June, I’ll apply for a management position. Even though things are bad, I hear there are openings in St. Louis requiring a bachelor’s degree.”1099 2008-10-26 If elected, Mr. McCain would arrive well-scarred at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: 72 years old, the oldest president to enter office, the first Vietnam veteran, a survivor of five and a half years in a North Vietnamese prison camp who could also have a son at war. Jimmy McCain, a Marine, recently returned from Iraq, while his brother John Sidney McCain IV, a Naval Academy midshipman, could be on the way.Driven as much by his notion of honor as by ideology, Mr. McCain could make an unpredictable — his critics say “erratic” — chief executive. By default he is a limited-government conservative, but he readily bends those convictions if a cause seems worthy. He has regularly picked fights with both parties over everything from the tax policy to the war on Iraq, but also knows how to force through bipartisan deals.Mr. McCain has called his decision-making style “instinctive, often impulsive,” as he put it in “Worth the Fighting For,” a 2002 memoir written with his aide Mark Salter. “I don’t torture myself over decisions. I make them as quickly as I can, quicker than the other fellow if I can.”But he also says he has also learned to cultivate what Navy pilots called “situational awareness” — gathering as much information as possible about the context of any decision, including an inventory of his weaknesses and his enemy’s strengths. He got a lesson in its importance 41 years ago over Hanoi.Convinced of his invulnerability, “I placed too much faith on what was beyond my knowledge or control: luck,” Mr. McCain wrote with Mr. Salter in a recent book, “Hard Call.” “I had five and a half very long years to regret my decision and the lapse in self-awareness.”Politically and intellectually, Mr. McCain is a gadfly. Most other lawmakers cultivate one area of expertise like health care, foreign affairs or the budget. Senator McCain, at the apex of his career, hopscotches in and out of pet causes, from patients’ rights to sue health insurers to fuel-efficiency standards to defense contract cost overruns.He reads widely, not only in public policy but also in fiction and history. An aide who looked in his briefcase in July found three books he was reading, two of which he has echoed in public statements since then.One was “The Return of History and the End of Dreams,” by the hawkish foreign policy thinker Robert Kagan, which posits a return to regional great power politics and arguably anticipated Russia’s recent incursion into Georgia. Another was “Tell Me How This Ends,” an admiring account of the troop “surge” in Iraq that Mr. McCain was among the first to embrace. A third book was “Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922,” a popular history of a remote event, the sacking of an Aegean city.Mr. Bobbitt, the scholar who met with Mr. McCain over several days three months ago to talk about his recent work, “Terror and Consent,” said he was surprised by the candidate’s willingness to question his own suppositions. “He is still reading and learning,” Mr. Bobbitt said. “He didn’t have any of the attitude of ‘Look, I am in the middle of a campaign, this is what I have said, this is how it is going to be’ that you would understandably get three months before an election.”Mr. McCain first tasted politics in 1977 as the Navy’s liaison to the United States Senate — a bag carrier, some called the job. He was 40 and unsure of his future, devouring Theodore H. White’s election chronicles to fill in the history he missed, and he turned the assignment into a training seminar for his own political career.Escorting lawmakers on overseas trips and entertaining them with stories of his naval escapades, Mr. McCain listened as the senators gossiped over evening cocktails, or brought him into closed committee staff meetings. And he capitalized on their goodwill: Senator William Cohen of Maine, best man at Mr. McCain’s 1980 wedding, and Senator John Tower of Texas, who many said treated Captain McCain like a son, provided invaluable help in his 1982 election to a House seat in Arizona.As a senator or presidential candidate, Mr. McCain prefers to make decisions by consulting experts with opposing views, preferably watching them clash. “He encourages disagreement in front of him, to see the evidence that disagrees with where he might be headed,” said Kevin A. Hassett, an economist close to Mr. McCain.He sometimes re-examines a position with as little prompting as a voter’s comment in a town hall meeting, his advisers say. After questions during his 2000 primary campaign about global warming or health insurance, for example, he set out to investigate. He soon startled Senate Democrats by co-sponsoring a “patients’ bill of rights.” He read widely about climate change, visited both polar ice caps and became the leading Republican sponsor of legislation to cut emissions.Vietnam, inevitably, has become a recurring reference point. He has often cited the familiar lesson that the United States should never commit its troops without broad public support — “the Vietnam thing,” he recently called it. But he also faults the political leaders of that time for failing to rally Americans to the fight.. He argues that the withdrawal emboldened foes by damaging the nation’s credibility, and ultimately concluded that he had taken the wrong lesson from Vietnam when he supported the pullout of United States troops from Somalia in 1994.“Osama bin Laden observed our withdrawal,” Mr. McCain wrote in his 2002 memoir, “and concluded that America no longer had the stomach for war.”Though his causes may change, Mr. McCain brings the mindset of a warrior to each fight. After Sept. 11, 2001, for example, he argued forcefully and almost immediately for invading Iraq. He repeated assertions about Iraq’s weapons programs and terrorist ties, but his main argument was that the public reaction to the attacks presented an “opportunity” to deter other potential threats by making an example of Saddam Hussein.On other Senate issues, he would bark out tactical goals in morning strategy sessions with his legislative co-sponsors. “It is like laying out a battle plan,” Mr. Salter said. “He would say, ‘O.K., this guy in my caucus is a lawyer and he is going to say this. Who do we got that is a lawyer to talk to him? Who do we got? Who do we got?’ ”He can take defeat hard. After conservatives blocked a major tobacco bill he had negotiated in 1998, Mr. McCain excoriated his own party for consigning children to lung cancer. After losing fights over campaign finance rules, he would lash out at his opponents as corrupt.He relishes conflict, his friends say, and would make a confrontational president. As Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close friend put it: “The man will run across the street to get in a good fight.”But Mr. McCain could be effective. He learned to exploit his combative instincts to maximize his power, mastering the Senate’s sometimes Machiavellian maneuvers and intrigues. He started trying to climb the ladder of the Senate Republican leadership; aside from his quixotic assaults on earmarks and campaign donations, he was a reliable conservative.Then his man-against-machine clash with the Republican front-runner George W. Bush in 2000 opened a new path. Mr. McCain returned to the Senate with a new national reputation as a “maverick,” more popular with liberals and independents than with conservatives.He recognized that in a narrowly divided Senate he could be a pivotal swing player, often able to push forward proposals he favored on the Democratic agenda or at least thwart the will of Republican leaders on the matters he chose (on judicial confirmations or detainee interrogations, for example).His shifting allegiances infuriated opponents. Sometimes, he conspired with former Republican Senate foes against their party leaders and President Bush (judges). Other times, he joined the president to battle the Democrats (on the Iraq war) or fellow Republicans (on immigration). In between, he basked in accolades from Democrats for siding with them on taxes, Alaskan oil drilling, generic drugs, emission rules and other matters.Mr. McCain made plenty of enemies. In confrontations, he could explode in profanity, bolt from meetings in rage, or order other lawmakers out of the room. He says he sometimes uses his explosive temper tactically, to intimidate opponents. But he left enough bruises that Democrats had sheaves of old quotes from fellow Republicans about his volatile temper at the ready when he ran for president.In his first race in Arizona, John McCain campaigned as a well-connected insider with “experience in Washington” who could bring home pork — parochial spending projects — for the state. (He angered Senator Barry Goldwater by attempting to steal credit for a defense contract the senator had steered to the state.)In his 2000 presidential run, he campaigned as an anti-politician. He denounced pork-barrel spending, made campaign finance rules the centerpiece of his agenda, and railed against the influence of special interests in Washington. He opened his bus to the press and mocked the idea of “message discipline.”And though for years he had played down his prison ordeal (“I don’t want to be the P.O.W. senator,” Mr. McCain once told a reporter. “I don’t think it made any change in my basic character”), he began talking about it as a more formative experience. Echoing his 1999 autobiography, “Faith of My Fathers,” Mr. McCain described Vietnam as the crucible that taught him the importance of dedication to a cause greater than himself — a formulation that became his campaign theme.This time around, Mr. McCain — still the “maverick” — has variously run as anointed front-runner, then cash-strapped long shot, and finally a battle-tested “fighter” out to change Washington. In the final rounds of his campaign against Senator Barack Obama, his Democratic rival, Mr. McCain is again in full game face.His campaign has pelted his rival with attacks that make some of his old advisers wince, like questioning Mr. Obama’s patriotism or tying him to “a domestic terrorist.” He made a high-stakes bet on a telegenic but untested running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, with no qualms about leading the charge.If the election were a contest to hold your breath under water, “you would be giving John McCain mouth to mouth before he would let Obama win,” said his friend, former Senator Kerrey.At times, Mr. McCain’s confidence in the righteousness of his own cause may blind him to contradictions. He bashes lobbyists as “birds of prey” but hires a staff of former or “on leave” lobbyists to run his campaign. (While attacking the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Mr. McCain was recently embarrassed by the disclosure that until their collapse this summer they had been paying big monthly fees to the government relations firm of his campaign manager, Rick Davis.)Mr. McCain promises to avoid even the appearance of impropriety or official favors. But around the start of his 2000 race, he wrote a letter of recommendation and arranged a Pentagon meeting to help a big donor win two lucrative California land deals. At the same time, several top advisers were warning him to keep his distance from a female lobbyist because the two appeared overly friendly, two participants in those conversations said.In more reflective moments, Mr. McCain says he tries to maintain a stoic detachment about the prospect of victory or defeat, a habit of mind he says he acquired as Navy pilot and prisoner of war. “I tend to be fatalistic about these things,” he said in an interview not long after he had locked up the Republican nomination, shrugging off his success.The son and grandson of four-star admirals, Mr. McCain wrestles publicly with the burdens of trying to live up to their standards of both accomplishment and honor. Contemplating his first run at the White House, he worried about balancing his ambition for the prize with his own sense of virtue, he wrote in “Worth the Fighting For.”After his loss, he professed himself grateful, at the age of 65, for what might be left of his time. “I did not get to be president of the United States. And I doubt I shall have reason or opportunity to try again,” he wrote, but added, “I might yet become the man I always wanted to be.”1100 2008-10-26 The bailout legislation had two objectives: unfreezing the credit markets and keeping people in their homes. If Treasury is truly committed to these two objectives, both can be accomplished simultaneously. My subcommittee will soon be holding a hearing with Treasury and top finance and legal experts to determine the most effective course of action. Dennis J. Kucinich Washington, Oct. 23, 2008The writer is chairman of the Domestic Policy Subcommittee, Oversight and Government Reform Committee, House of Representatives.Your editorial touches on an important cause of the current crisis — the so-called bankruptcy reform of 2005.After a multimillion-dollar lobbying effort by the credit industry, this measure made it very difficult for middle-class people to file for bankruptcy using Chapter 7, which liquidates debt. And in most cases, bankruptcy judges are prevented from revising mortgages, which means true relief may be effectively impossible.Making Chapter 7 more available and giving judges power to reform mortgages and consumer debt terms would go a long way toward truly bailing out Main Street.Re “This Bailout Doesn’t Pay Dividends,” by David S. Scharfstein and Jeremy C. Stein (Op-Ed, Oct. 21):Dividends are the reward for investing. Appreciation is what we expect to guard against inflation and provide for our retirement. Failure to pay dividends results in volatility as shareholders buy and sell to capture earnings.The no-dividend climate is symptomatic of what is wrong with our economy. Corporations awash in cash not paying dividends has led to overcompensation of and fiscal misadventures by corporate officers who no longer feel responsibility to shareholders.This cavalier view permeated the housing market, leading to a housing bubble with the rapid buying and selling of houses for quick profit.Re “Swapping Secrecy for Transparency,” by Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (Op-Ed, Oct. 19):Yes, that decision by Congress in 2000 not to regulate credit-default swaps paved the way for the current mess we are in. So did the decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2004 to let big investment banks keep tabs themselves on their capital requirements, a decision recently reversed.In keeping with Mr. Cox’s newfound zeal for transparency, how about directing some sunshine on just who was lobbying Congress and the S.E.C. to make those decisions? Transparency has been severely lacking in more than the credit-default swap business.We need a complete overhaul if we are going to get back to governing and doing business with integrity and old-fashioned caution and common sense.We are going through tough, painful times, and they will not end soon, but there is satisfaction and a tangible gain in decreasing your consumption, and finding a number of easy ways to do it. Even financially stable friends of mine have quickly cut back on lunches, cable packages, distant vacations, car size, coffee, A.T.M. visits and lawn treatments — and noticed that daily life does not suffer.There’s something about finding a dozen fast ways to save money that makes a family into a team, united in a cause, and prompts a certain zeal for having another look at your values and intentions. And, the shock has been so severe that this is likely to outlast whatever the length of the recession is, maybe by many years.It’s a new austerity or a recalibration that may affect everything about how people decide, buy and save into the next generation, as it did in 1929, which is not necessarily a bad thing.1101 2008-10-26 Armed with polls that raise the possibility of decisive wins in House and Senate races, Congressional Republicans are trying to turn the situation to their advantage, warning voters about unchecked one-party government and urging them to split their tickets to deny Democrats unfettered control. The Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, issued warnings about one-party control as he campaigned Friday and Saturday.That is also the premise of a recent television advertisement supporting Senator Elizabeth Dole, Republican of North Carolina, whose seat is an integral part of the Democratic drive toward 60 votes, as she fights to hold on against Kay R. Hagan, a Democratic state senator.Ominous music plays in the background as a narrator intones: “These liberals want complete control of government, in a time of crisis. All branches of government. No checks and balances. No debate. No independence. That’s the truth behind Kay Hagan. If she wins, they get a blank check.”If Mr. Obama, of Illinois, defeats Mr. McCain, he could be the first president since Jimmy Carter to enter office with wide control of the House and 60 votes in the Senate. That in theory would give Democrats the power to overcome procedural hurdles that have bedeviled both parties in recent years.“Whether or not the Democrats have 60 is something that is going to be a very significant factor in the way the country is governed,” said Robert A. Caro, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer and Senate historian, referring to the number needed to cut off Senate debate and push legislation to a vote.But even with a 60-vote majority, Democrats could face challenges in pushing their agenda, said former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who had experience with such wide margins during the Carter administration and as a Democratic senator in the 1960s.“People tend to think that if you have got 60 votes you can pass anything you want,” Mr. Mondale said. “It means you can pass a lot more. There’s no question about it. But it’s not a slam-dunk.” He added: “It’s not just a push-button Congress. For sure, they’ll have their own ideas.”Democrats said they were well aware of the mistakes of the past and the overconfidence exhibited during one-party rule of the Clinton and Bush administrations that led to Democrats’ losing control of the House in 1994 and to Republicans’ experiencing a similar defeat in 2006.Chastened by their years in exile, Democrats said they were determined to avoid those pitfalls should voters deliver them control of the White House and Congress.The nature of the Democratic majority, expanded partly through the election of centrists and even conservatives, would also temper Democratic zeal to pursue an overly ideological agenda, Democrats said.“We are going to get new members with a clear understanding that the reason they won is appealing to independents and disaffected Republicans, and they are going to want to continue to do that,” said the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland.Yet even in the last two years, with a slimmer majority, Mr. Hoyer, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders have struggled to manage the competing demands of party factions, including antiwar liberals on the left and fiscal hawks on the right.Republicans said they hoped to retain at least 41 seats in the Senate, giving them the ability to stop legislation they find most objectionable, and still command some leverage in policy negotiations.“I think the Senate operates best when it makes things happen in the middle, and that happens when you have 41 or more people who resist an idea to the point where you can compromise,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and a lawmaker whose own seat is at risk. “I think there will be enough Republicans plus discerning Democrats in the Senate after January to keep a kind of far-left agenda from steamrolling through the Senate like it often does through the House.”Despite having control of Congress for the past two years, Democrats have a pent-up agenda on health care, public works, energy, employment policy and other matters where they clashed with President Bush. Mr. Obama has his own detailed proposals on the economy, taxes, health care and climate change, among other major issues. Democrats say they would move quickly after the election to put their stamp on federal policy.The key to their ability to do so would probably remain the Senate, where many initiatives stalled in the past two years because of Republican resistance and what was effectively a narrow 51 to 49 Democratic majority. A 60-vote majority would give Democrats the power to roll over Republican objections to legislation, executive nominations and judicial appointments, at least on paper.But the number might not be the legislative panacea some envision.One of those 60 would presumably be Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the independent who has backed Mr. McCain this year.And Democrats, particularly more moderate ones, could always align with Republicans to block legislation they found objectionable. In fact, the level of Republican opposition in the Senate has masked some disagreements among Democrats since there were cases when Democrats saw themselves as free to vote with their party on legislation they knew was destined to stall.On the other hand, Democrats say a majority of 57 or 58 senators is tantamount to 60 since Democrats, after an election triumph, expect to be able to peel away two or three Republicans to join them — an easier task than getting the nine they need now.“If the White House political team can’t figure out a way to get two Republican senators to vote with us between Air Force One, tea at the White House, U.S. attorneys and judges and dams and roads and ambassadors and all that other stuff,” Senator Whitehouse said, “somebody should take them out to the woodshed.”Mr. Mondale said that even with 60 Democratic senators, the Carter administration had to sweat for some legislative victories, like ratification of the Panama Canal Treaty in 1978.“I see some people say, ‘Don’t let them get 60 votes because then they’ll get everything they want,’ ” Mr. Mondale said. “In my experience, don’t worry about that.”“You still have to work with Congress, you have to consult with them,” he added. “It’s a tension between being tough and assertive as president on the one hand, and making sure that you are going to have followers when you are leading.”Since World War II, Republicans have never held more than 55 seats in the Senate. The last time the Republicans enjoyed a majority in the House as large as the Democrats could win was in 1947, as a result of dissatisfaction with President Harry S. Truman.For Democrats, expansive majorities in Congress, coupled with control of the White House, have generally occurred in times of crisis — in the 1930s during the Great Depression and in the 1970s after Vietnam and Watergate.Mr. Caro, the biographer, said that in many ways the Democrats could find themselves in circumstances similar to those after 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president and Democrats won a huge majority in the House and held 59 of the 96 seats in the Senate.But Mr. Caro noted that such broad control of Washington by one party had benefits and disadvantages. “Right now we are in another crisis, and it’s very similar in some ways economically,” he said. “Government must be able to move fast and decisively. So that’s an argument for saying it would be a good thing, if we had the same party in control.”“But there is another side,” Mr. Caro added. “Because it’s precisely when one party sweeps to a huge majority that a check on its powers is needed, so that government doesn’t go too far. That’s why the founding fathers gave the Senate such great powers.”1102 2008-10-26 Boston needs Tony Allen to replace Posey’s perimeter defense, and some combination of Glen Davis, Leon Powe and Patrick O’Bryant to provide steady production in the frontcourt.After changing point guards seemingly every six months, the Cavaliers believe they have a steady hand to run the offense and relieve James of some playmaking duties. Williams is not among the league’s elite point guards, but he is a capable floor leader and scorer, averaging 17.2 points and 6.3 assists for the Bucks last season.In Detroit, the bad news is also the good news: the core group that won the championship in 2004 — Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince and Rasheed Wallace — is returning for another season. The team’s president, Joe Dumars, was open to breaking them up but never found the right deal. The Pistons are counting on the continued growth of the youngsters Rodney Stuckey, Amir Johnson and Jason Maxiell to sustain their streak of excellence (five consecutive seasons with at least 54 victories).No team made a more surprising leap last season than the Philadelphia 76ers, who made the playoffs with a 40-42 record, then pushed the Pistons to six games in the first round. They are poised to make another leap after signing power forward Elton Brand in July. With career averages of 20.3 points and 10.2 rebounds, Brand provides the 76ers with much-needed interior muscle and scoring balance, and takes some pressure off the star guard Andre Iguodala (19.9 points a game last season).Toronto, another young team on the rise, is hoping to revive a slightly faded star. The Raptors acquired Jermaine O’Neal from Indiana and are pairing him with the Olympian Chris Bosh to form perhaps the best big-man tandem in the East. Much depends on O’Neal’s ability to stay healthy (he has averaged 51.5 games over the last four seasons) and his willingness to defer to Bosh.Orlando broke through last season with the addition of Rashard Lewis, the explosive growth of Dwight Howard and a career year from Hedo Turkoglu. But the Magic remains weak in the backcourt and on the bench and could slip in the improving East.The last two playoff spots are up for grabs. Chicago’s hopes depend on how quickly point guard Derrick Rose, the No. 1 pick in the June draft, can adjust to the N.B.A. The Bulls have plenty of talent around him.Miami, sabotaged by injuries and poor chemistry last season, could bounce back quickly with a revived Dwyane Wade, a full season with Shawn Marion and the addition of Michael Beasley, the No. 2 pick in the draft.Washington needs its three All-Stars to stay healthy, but Gilbert Arenas (recovering from knee surgery) will start the season on the inactive list. The Atlanta Hawks, who squeaked into the playoffs with 37 wins, will take a step back after losing their sixth man, Josh Childress, to Greece. The Indiana Pacers (with a new point guard, T. J. Ford) and the Charlotte Bobcats (with a new coach, Larry Brown) should be in the playoff hunt until late March.The Knicks, the Nets and the Milwaukee Bucks are in various stages of rebuilding.1103 2008-10-26 Melissa Ann Turner and Dan Cogan Kozusko were married Saturday in Boston.

But participants exchange ideas, job tips and useful contacts, while also batting around ideas about technology, art, business and culture.Likemind might sound like a 2008 version of networking, but to participants, likemind events are distinctly different from the traditional networking parties of the ’80s and ’90s, where slick-suited would-be executives teetered around with a cocktail in one hand and a fistful of business cards in the other.Likemind caters to young professionals in advertising, media and design who are products of the age of personal blogs, warts-and-all YouTube videos and viral marketing. For them, the best pitch is the disguised pitch. Nothing, participants said, is more uncool than the hard-sell of traditional networking (which may explain why likemind is not capitalized).“We just show up over coffee and talk,” said Eric Cedo, a participant in Detroit, in an e-mail message.Likemind was conceived by Noah Brier, 26, the head of strategic planning at the Barbarian Group, an Internet marketing company, and Piers Fawkes, 37, who runs PSFK, a trend consulting company. They knew each other virtually, through their blogs. But in July 2006, they decided to meet at a West Village coffeehouse, ’sNice, and posted a blog invitation. About 20 people showed up.Before long, those friends started bringing friends, and many started blogging about it. Word spread, even overseas, and people started holding their own likemind events.From the start, Mr. Brier said, “it was all very Zen-like. Whoever is there are the right people. Wherever you are is the right place.”Of course, some people aren’t the right people — like those aggressively pushing a business. “People get sniffed out really quickly,” Mr. Brier said. “You can tell when a salesman walks in.”Salespeople and résumé pushers are met with a cold shoulder. “People are overtly nice to them, smile at them, then jump to another table as quickly as possible,” Mr. Fawkes said.Likemind might sound like Meetup.com, which offers people a chance to pull themselves away from their computer screens and chat with, well, like minds. But unlike the typical Meetup group, likemind events are usually not limited to enthusiasts of a specific interest — say, backpacking or dachshund ownership.In a sense, likemind gatherings are more like the networking-party equivalent of so-called “unconferences,” which arose as a rebuke to the staid $1,000-a-head industry gatherings. They are typically free informal retreats where people in the same field can engage in extended open-ended brainstorming sessions unified around a single theme.And like unconferences, likemind gives participants a chance to vet potential business partners, said Timothy Ferriss, the author of the “4-Hour Workweek” and a Silicon Valley productivity expert. Many participants work in small start-up environments that are intense emotional settings, he said.“When you’ve both had three hours of sleep and are on your second six pack of Mountain Dew, emotions will run high and patience will run low,” he added, “so you have to have common ground to share and get through the tough times, or everything falls apart.”Likemind also may fill a personal need for these professionals — many of whom have been liberated from traditional 9-to-5 jobs.These workers need new ways to connect, said Ethan Watters, who studied young urban professionals in his book, “Urban Tribes.” They live far from their families, he said, and work in highly fluid industries where co-workers change continuously. Unlike professionals from an earlier generation, they marry later and have weak ties to organized religious or community groups.“They have no old family, no new family, so there’s a vacuum there, and since we’re social creatures, the vacuum gets filled with things like this,” he said.At the Manhattan likemind event at ’sNice earlier this month, the atmosphere was anything but over-caffeinated. It felt like a Williamsburg loft party before things really get rolling — muted, slightly awkward, but still friendly and full of promise. About 50 people showed up, most under 40, and many dressed in the quirky, thrift-store-inflected ensembles. As a Joy Division single played, people mingled, and made a point of inviting strangers into their conversations.At one table, Michelle Ticknor, an “experiential strategist” in the marketing industry, talked to Mr. Brier, the founder, about how she was so on-the-go that she caught up with friends in airport terminals or on subway platforms.Ms. Ticknor, 35, said she had attended similar gatherings sponsored by Green Drinks, for people interested in environmental issues. “But it became a pickup scene,” she said. “I started to see guys I knew were serial daters showing up.”But even low-key networking is still networking. Ms. Middleton, the Dallas brand strategist, said she walked out of her first likemind meeting with 10 new business cards — gathered discreetly, to be sure — and later touted her attendance at job interviews. She even dropped the name likemind in a cover letter for her current job, which, she said, helped set her apart from other candidates. But she, like other likemind participants, resists the idea that she is networking, because that would cheapen the experience, robbing her of the pleasure she finds there.THE writer Po Bronson said that creative professionals today are overwhelmed by pressures to market themselves at every level of their life and career that “what they are craving is the informality” of such events.Likemind “is not overtly opportunistic,” said Ms. Ticknor, surveying the room. “You can come in, sit with one person for an hour, talking. You don’t come in saying, ‘Oh God, I have to work the room.’ ”“Here is my business card,” she said, pointedly handing him a bag of green tea. Hidden inside, attached to the paper tag, was her job title, cellphone number and e-mail address.1107 2008-10-26 Thus it was that Edwin Post joined the Gilded Age prey, a group of select men (and several women) stalked by the redoubtable publisher. Colonel Mann abhorred what he considered the duplicity of society. He took immense satisfaction in supplementing his own income at the expense of a careless millionaire's misalliance. The jovial Civil War hero, a suave, condescending, robust Santa Claus, mixed in his complicated person two sometimes contrary impulses. He was a true believer — no sloppy grammar or careless vernacular would be published under his masthead. But he was also a cynical extortionist, impatient with public figures so inane that they discarded their private lives for a night of pleasure.This hypocritical reformer had become an object of dread among the city's most prominent citizens: J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, William K. Vanderbilt, and William C. Whitney. His method was simple: hire aggrieved servants, disgruntled friends, or a furious spouse to spy on suspects. Then bully those miscreants into paying for a ""subscription"" to a mostly phantom, wildly expensive illustrated book about leaders of society. Various prices were assessed for each victim, with an eye to what the sinner could afford. What could be easier than such a scam, in the shadow of the Victorian mores that still darkened the resplendent Gilded Age? Money and fevered morality, a glorious mix for a con artist with ethics like Mann's.Pleading a shortage of money, Edwin bought some time to consider his options. Two days later, Ahle came looking for him again. The wayward husband bargained with Mann's representative. ""Give me a little more time and I'll get you the money,"" he pleaded, adding, ""please don't publish the article on Friday"" — the usual pattern for expensive gossip sponsored by Town Topics.Here the truth becomes a matter of conjecture. The official line, constructed by Emily years later, maintained that the victim was unable to produce the $500 ""fee"" for the vanity book (worth about $5,000 in today's currency) — his extensive costs of paying for a mistress aside. Before divulging the news to his wife, Edwin had first sought advice from the couple's mutual ally, prominent society lawyer Phoenix Ingraham (whom Edwin knew to be smitten with Emily). Predictably, their friend had insisted that she be brought into the discussion, whereupon Emily immediately agreed to help bring down this corrupt operation that had netted so many of their friends. There was no question: the Posts should not pay off the bribe. The prospect of a public spectacle, with her husband its sacrificial lamb and she herself the object of prurient gossip, supposedly failed to discourage the always decorous Emily Price Post.Throughout the years, Emily would contend that the couple's private discussions had centered upon Edwin's lack of money as well as their mutual determination to end the insidious blackmail of their friends. But such a grand explanation allowed Emily to displace her husband's painful, real weakness: his inability or, even worse, his unwillingness to protect his wife from scandal.The week following July 11, 1905, both the New York Times and the New York Tribune sustained a running commentary on the sting. ""Stockbroker's Way of Dealing with Bribe Offer"" trumpeted the Tribune's front page. Edwin Post, the article continued, was a partner in a brokerage firm and lived — in the summers — with his wife and children in Tuxedo Park. A terse sentence followed: ""[Post's] action in the case was taken on the advice of Mrs. Post."" The Baltimore Sun, Emily's hometown paper, ran a short front-page article on the affair, failing to mention that the betrayed wife was the daughter of their famous homegrown architect, whom, till then, the city had proudly claimed as its own any chance it got. However briefly, Edwin Post was finally at the center of Emily's life.She never forgave him.Chapter TwoHe knew he'd struck gold when she tried so hard to impress him, stifling her girlish giggles and self-consciously checking her slight slouch. A fetching enough sixteen-year-old from the Pennsylvania countryside, she had been turned out by Baltimore's best finishing school, polished with the high patina of shiny anthracite coal. Josephine Lee won Bruce Price's loyalty, if never quite his heart, within minutes of their meeting at a debutante ball in the winter season of 1869.Young Bruce, an aspiring architect, was undeniably looking to marry money, and Josephine's father, Washington Lee, possessed a postwar fortune in want of spending. The Lees were no anomaly: one of Lee's railroad compeers demonstrated his recent profits, in 1865, by throwing what was the most lavish party in memory. The menus were lettered in gold, the dining room ""smothered in rarest flowers."" Each of the host's guests was presented with a silk cushion embroidered with his name. The wines cost $25 a bottle, the prestigious singers were paid $1,000 for two songs, and the final bill for the extravaganza totaled $20,000 (almost $3 million today), to bravos all around.Emily Bruce Price, Washington Lee's granddaughter, would be a daddy's girl throughout her long life. She unabashedly bragged about her devotion: to Emily, Bruce Price was a giant among men. At six feet, two inches, the architect whose charms were legendary came of age at the end of the Civil War, but he would have stood out in any era. Handsome, naturally convivial, confident, generous: it is easy to understand his daughter's lifelong infatuation. Her adoration, in the end, merely echoed that of Bruce Price's many friends and relatives, who, after being with him for five minutes, seemed convinced they'd made contact with something significant. His niece, a countess by marriage, still recalled, almost fifty years after his death, Bruce Price's ""outstanding personal beauty and personal charm"" and his ""unpretentious confidence in himself."" ""Everyone"" revered him, she said. Emily worshipped him.Born in Cumberland, Maryland, at the end of 1845, Bruce Price had arrived a week and a half too early to be the Christmas baby his parents had anticipated. What would become his trademark of nearly obsessive punctuality stamped his earliest days. The boy, one of an eventual seven brothers and sisters, spent most of his childhood in Baltimore. Hugging the Chesapeake Bay, the nation's third-largest city enjoyed a seventy-mile buffer from the Atlantic, a distinction only one other major American port, Philadelphia, could claim. The location was ripe for a transportation liaison, which the railroad barons of the nineteenth century would pursue with relish, even when slaves were needed to turn dreams into reality.William Price, Bruce's father — ""eccentric,"" sniped some who didn't understand him — was an important lawyer in Baltimore during the turbulent 1860s. A restless man, Price graduated from college eager to leave the outskirts of Washington County in favor of the more prosperous legal garrets of Cumberland. There he met and quickly wed Marion Bruce, a Scottish lass who could minister to his practical side. Their obligatory Episcopal ceremony reflected no particular religious convictions on the part of either bride or groom.Marion herself boasted a family renowned for its small-town achievements: she was the granddaughter of the first president of Cumberland's First National Bank and the niece of Allegheny County's first circuit court judge. She was even prouder to inform her already convinced suitor that her father, a Scotsman who had settled in the region twenty or thirty years earlier, was a first cousin to Francis Scott Key.The agility of a Renaissance lawyer like Price (who would write a novel and build his own house) was in short supply at the time. Still in his twenties and fresh from school, he was elected a member of the Maryland State Senate in 1825. William Price enjoyed debating hard questions. Perhaps inevitably, many considered the complex man a contrarian. His moral allegiance was to the North, but his heart never deserted Dixie.The lawyer came honestly by his often eccentric ways of doing things. After William's father died, you could practically hear the townspeople gasp at the idiosyncratic terms of Josiah Price's will. Josiah left behind a creative document; everyone agreed on that. He had bequeathed his four sons a choice: to attend college or to own real estate. Either/or. William, along with his older brother, chose an education. William's granddaughter Emily, who loved recounting the story, would always emphasize the proper decision her shrewd grandfather made: through his canny judgment, he got it all. The two brothers who chose property died early, their misfortune ensuring that William Price and his favorite brother, Benjamin, acquired both the land and the academic degrees.Without a doubt, wealth and education proved a vigorous coupling. In the 1830s, William parlayed his inheritance into a law firm in nearby Hagerstown, Maryland. In spite of Price's somewhat confusing persona as an erratic gentleman farmer, the man's intellectual dexterity as he nurtured social connections led him quickly to become one of the lawyers sought out by the local powers. He knew about the art of doing people favors — sometimes just from kindness, but often out of expedience.This was the lay of the land that would shape Emily Price's father, William's talented son Bruce. This was a family that believed in passing down its wisdom along with its genes. In the middle of the nineteenth century, when Bruce was two or three years old, William moved his family from Hagerstown to Baltimore. They lived at 27 Washington Street, across from a severe, newly constructed Greek Revival library. Inspired by the chance to enhance the aesthetic harmony in his still raw neighborhood, William Price, though untrained in the arts, designed his family's house to harmonize with the library. The self-taught architect created a one-story Greek Revival building whose enormous wide hallway ran through the entire house to the rear garden door. It takes no great leap of imagination to connect William's mildly chaotic vision with the bold design that informed Bruce Price's Gilded Age aesthetic. Or the panoramic view of the machinery driving her own age that would inspire his daughter.As the last few years of the 1850s teetered to a nervous conclusion, the prospect of war took up a permanent residence among William's legal cronies. The signs around him were hardly subtle: he could sense tectonic plates shifting beneath his family's feet, and he wanted to be ready.The 1860s opened upon the heels of an unusually cold December, the thermometers shivering at zero. Nothing so frivolous as weather ruled the household of William Price, however, as agonized loyalties played out in his family, reflecting the schism at the heart of the city itself. Seaport or not, Baltimore was a southern town with a northern manifesto, its leaders primarily Union men. In more ways than one, Maryland lay on the fault line, geographically in the middle of the nation's coast.Openly pro-Union, Maryland's official position was not without risk: in reality, Maryland was a border state. Though the state contributed men and matériel to the Union's efforts, the Baltimore southern sensibility was no small thing. Many secessionists pushing to legitimize the Confederacy resented the local abolitionists. In a telling paradox of the whole sorry debacle, the 7th Regiment United States Colored Troops and the 9th Regiment U.S. Colored Troops were heavily represented by Baltimoreans, in spite of the city's collusions with slave-owning states. But on April 19, 1861, as northern troops passed through the city on their way south to defend Washington, D.C., the first blood of the Civil War was officially shed. The Baltimore Riots claimed the lives of four soldiers in the 6th Massachusetts Infantry. Several civilians were killed, and many more were injured.Thomas, William's and Marion's firstborn, was barely mentioned in family chronicles. But Bruce's adored older brother Benjamin joined the Yankee forces, while Adrian, four years younger, sided with the Rebels. It was a scene invading every neighborhood. Tangled loyalties rebounded in the anguish echoed across the city. Perhaps such misery motivated William to take the route open to upper-class men of his times: he paid authorities to ensure that young Bruce would not be drafted to fight, regardless of the nation's needs.The Baltimore schism was in many regards a kinship dispute that would run its course. But the repercussions of the deepest confusions about race, class, and nationality that the feud reproduced would resurface repeatedly. On June 10, 2006, the Ku Klux Klan rallied at the Antietam battlefield, where some believe William Price's rebellious third son, Adrian, lost his life on the bloodiest day of the war.Baltimore — ""charm city"" was its later nickname — was not a place where people with options chose to live out the nation's crisis. William Price decided that the early 1860s would be a good time to send his family to the country to stay with other relatives who shared their pro-Union sentiments. Price himself stayed in the city. Long respected for his prudence, he was soon appointed by President Lincoln as U.S. district attorney for Maryland.Excerpted from Emily Post by Laura Claridge Copyright © 2008 by Laura Claridge.

The place was so depressingly dark that “it was hard to wake up in the morning,” he said.The couple then rented a sunny but badly kept one-bedroom, for nearly $2,500 a month, on far West 75th Street. After flooding from above, their walls sprouted mold, which the landlord painted over.At one point, the apartment began vibrating. “It was like an airplane engine; it was brutal,” Mr. Segalis said. The source was a huge floor fan in the apartment upstairs. The landlord made the tenants there place it on a padded carpet.Mr. Segalis and Ms. Kagan admit they weren’t the best neighbors either. Their Havanese puppy, Freddo, barked when home alone. Neighbors left notes of complaint on their door, and Freddo went to doggie day care.The two were tired of moving among unpleasant living situations. To Mr. Segalis, a decent rental would mean a pricey luxury building, but the kind of one-bedroom within financial reach would have “the leaky ceiling and the ’50s kitchen,” he said. So, two years ago, they began looking for a place to buy.They found a one-bedroom of around 770 square feet at the new Aurora condominium on Bayard Street, flanking McCarren Park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The listing price was just under $600,000. “We thought we could afford it,” Mr. Segalis said.Twice they lowered their offer, and twice the developer agreed. They managed to get it to $575,000. That worried them. Why were prices sinking?Besides, the unit faced away from the park, lacking the gorgeous city views of the west-facing units. And, “on a philosophical level, I was really opposed to the huge closing costs” of a new condo, Mr. Segalis said. (In this case, it was an estimated $27,000.)Desirable units throughout Williamsburg seemed to be already gone. So the couple took a break from their search while Ms. Kagan studied for the bar exam (she now practices securities litigation) and they planned their wedding. This time, they decided to look on the Upper West Side.If a place had light, it lacked space. That was the problem at a one-bedroom co-op on 72nd Street near West End Avenue, where a crib sat in the kitchen. “They may have had twins,” Ms. Kagan said. “It was very cramped.” Besides, with two wide streets and bus traffic, “you feel you are living on a highway,” Mr. Segalis said. (That apartment sold for $510,000.)On Craigslist, Ms. Kagan found what seemed like an odd listing, with few words and an upside-down picture. A two-bedroom co-op of nearly 1,000 square feet was for sale by the owner. At $640,000, it seemed too good to be true.On the top floor of a small brownstone building on West 80th Street — an unusual block, with small stores on the lower levels — they walked into a disaster. But “we saw the potential and knew it was a great deal,” Mr. Segalis said.The owners were moving to California while their daughter, who had grown up there, was moving uptown.Ms. Kagan was upset “because she liked this place so much but thought we couldn’t pull it off,” Mr. Segalis said of the financing for the deal. She was the one who handled the negotiations.The seller seemed to think the apartment was in excellent shape. “Fainna’s mom told her the place needed a lot of work,” Mr. Segalis said. “I think she misheard. She said, ‘Yes, we did a lot of work on this place.’ ”Ms. Kagan offered $585,000, then agreed to $595,000. Maintenance is $800 a month.Concerned about co-op board approval — a previous buyer had been turned down — “we were diligent in putting our papers together,” Mr. Segalis said. “We had a thick binder.”The couple have been cheerfully living in their new home since last spring, deciding what to do with it and where to place walls and closets. The apartment is around 90 feet long and 12 feet wide.The design will be done by Scot R. Campbell, their next-door neighbor and a partner in a small architectural firm, Tirmizi Campbell. He and his wife, Ulka Campbell, an epidemiologist, bought the mirror-image unit for $640,000 in June 2007, in “rough condition,” knowing they would gut-renovate it.THE sellers of the apartment that Mr. Segalis and Ms. Kagan bought apparently “never took care of it beyond vacuuming,” Mr. Campbell said.The carpet, he said, is “evaporating before your eyes. You can grab the bricks and pull them out of the wall, except the brick wall is holding up the building.” The floor squeaks. The kitchen lacks cabinets. The closet doors spring open unbidden.In their own place, the Campbells have minimized closets “because we don’t save or hoard things” and maximized open space, Mr. Campbell said. The living and dining area is in front, facing the street. The bedrooms, including a small one for their baby girl, Sonali, are in back.But Mr. Segalis and Ms. Kagan prefer to have the master bedroom as big and bright as possible, so that will be in front.Loud bar patrons from Amsterdam Avenue seem to use their block as a route to the subway station on Broadway, so double-paned windows will block the street noise.The couple’s renovation budget is around $75,000, excluding appliances. They will move out in a few weeks to stay with Ms. Kagan’s parents on Long Island during the overhaul.“I’ve heard stories about the apartment for the price,” Mr. Segalis said, “but never thought it could happen to us.”1109 2008-10-26 Mr. Fulop hopes to put the matter before voters in an election next year.He initially tried to get the Council to pass an ordinance barring members from holding more than one public job, but it met with such resistance, he decided to put it directly to voters via a referendum on the November ballot.He said the city clerk initially told him he needed 1,506 signatures, or 10 percent of those who voted in last year’s election, to get it on the ballot. But a day before the submission deadline, as he was turning in his petition, the clerk said he actually needed 12,000 signatures, or 10 percent of the city’s registered voters — six times the number needed to run for mayor. Mr. Fulop said that if anyone is trying to make it harder for him to pass his measure, he will not be deterred.“It shows the extent to which politicians in New Jersey will go to protect the extra pension and salary,” Mr. Fulop said.Holding dual offices poses inherent conflicts, said Mr. Fulop, who works as a hedge fund trader at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company LLC.Council members sometimes vote on issues that benefit the city at the expense of the county, he said, and if their full-time job is with the county, they are not going to want to jeopardize that. Moreover, he pointed out, some spend hours conducting City Council business on the county’s tab. Last week, for instance, several Council members spent much of the day at a news conference for the Council’s new plans for Journal Square, Mr. Fulop said.Indeed, a recent report by the New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group, singled out Hudson County as having a high proportion of government workers holding more than one public position. Six of nine county freeholders, for instance, hold a second job paid for by taxpayers. Only Essex County had that high a percentage. And seven of Hudson County’s nine-member legislative delegation held a public job in addition to their elected office. Four are mayors.Those opposed to the double-dipping measure say Council positions pay so little — in Jersey City, the job is part time and pays $33,430 a year — that members need another job to make ends meet. For the salary to be high enough, the position would have to be made a full-time one, and city officials interviewed said that was not likely to happen. Mayor Jerramiah T. Healy of Jersey City said such a move would cost $500,000 a year, a cost taxpayers would not want to bear. Moreover, making the job full time would make it impossible for some people to serve in municipal government, he said.“Why should a doctor, a teacher, lawyer or stockbroker, for example, be precluded from serving on their City Council?” the mayor asked.Councilman Steve Lipski said he admired Mr. Fulop’s zeal but questioned his focus. Instead of concentrating on double-dipping, Mr. Fulop should take aim at elected officials who use their position to then obtain a lucrative government job, Mr. Lipski said.“When he makes these proposals, it makes the rest of the council feel like we’re criminals and crooks and that we’re double-dippers,” Mr. Lipski said. “I know a number of my colleagues work for the county or some other government agency, but I think only one or two had gotten their jobs after they were elected.”1110 2008-10-26 Sweet, a lesbian travel company that focuses on eco-friendly and volunteer-oriented travel, has scheduled its first cruise for 2009.From Nov. 8 to 15, the Sweet Caribbean Cruise, aboard Norwegian Cruise Line’s Norwegian Spirit, will travel to Costa Maya and Cozumel, Mexico; Belize City, Belize; and Roatán, Honduras. There will also be a two-day predeparture option in New Orleans, for those interested in volunteer work with a Hurricane Katrina relief organization.Sweet is working with local port cities to improve infrastructure and restore local wildlife habitats through a variety of volunteer programs during the cruise, and it will offset carbon emissions incurred from the trip via Carbonfund.org. Onboard entertainment will include the comedians Suzanne Westenhoefer and Erin Foley, and the singers Jen Foster and Edie Carey.1111 2008-10-26 On a recent morning in Manhattan, a friend of mine walked into his bank, carrying his briefcase. He went up to the teller’s window and asked to withdraw thousands of dollars of his savings, which the teller handed over in $100 bills. He then walked home, holding his briefcase a little more tightly than usual, and put his money in a drawer.Was he being a little paranoid? He knew that he was. His savings were guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which, as government officials have been reminding us lately, has never failed to cover a bank deposit in its 70 years of existence. Cash in a drawer comes with no such guarantee. If there’s a house fire, the money is gone. But my friend figured that even if his savings were at no real risk of disappearing at the bank, they might become unavailable to him for some period of weeks or months, were the financial crisis to keep worsening. He didn’t like that idea. So he was willing to give up a few months of interest — meager interest, to be sure — in exchange for a sense of control. Given all of the once-unthinkable events that had already happened, it was hard to know what might come next.For the better part of the past two decades, Americans have been living in a state of willful optimism about our financial future. It is probably fair to date the start of this period to the late 1980s, when the stock market took off and the Soviet empire began to unravel. Since then, our default attitude toward the economy has been to believe that, one way or another, things will work out.Companies began ditching their pension plans, forcing workers into riskier 401(k)s. But, really, how risky could they be? They were invested mainly in the stock market, one of the most profitable investment vehicles in the history of mankind. We became so comfortable with Wall Street, in fact, that we moved money out of boring old F.D.I.C.-insured accounts and into uninsured mutual funds. Many people simply stopped saving altogether. So did the federal government in the last several years, despite the enormous Medicare and Social Security bills that are just around the corner. We told ourselves that everything would be fine, because the alternative seemed so implausible.The personal saving rate — that is, income minus spending — arguably tells the best story about our recent optimism. From the mid-1950s through the mid-1980s, the rate hovered around 9 percent, which meant that, on average, Americans set aside nine cents of every dollar they earned — to use in the future on college tuition, a down payment, retirement or an unexpected misfortune. In the late 1980s, however, the rate began to fall. In the 1990s, it averaged only 5 percent. In the last several years, it has barely exceeded zero.There was a simple enough justification for the decline. Since the 1980s, incomes for most families haven’t been growing very quickly, which has made it more difficult to save. At the same time, the value of assets, mainly houses and stocks, was growing enormously. So nest eggs continued to get larger even without much new money flowing into them.1112 2008-10-26 The students will learn the mechanics of applying for jobs and good etiquette and habits at work. They will also receive $12 a week to save or invest as they see fit. Some money may wind up in partial shares in the stock market, so the students could soon learn about the maddening capriciousness of that beast.The students, for the most part, don’t watch news programs or read The Wall Street Journal regularly, but the bad news is out there in the ether — in remarks dropped at the dinner table, in stray comments from relatives, in sudden moves friends make because a house has been foreclosed on. Some end up worrying and wondering, even if their parents try to cheer them up.Giovanni Sanchez, 12, learned that an uncle had been fired. Keyonah Bratton, 11, learned the same about a cousin of hers. Awa Nyambi, 11, a slight, bright-eyed young man, has a mother who works at a hard-hit travel company in White Plains. “Mom was talking about the stock dropping and how they may have to let go of some people, people who work on her team,” he said. “They don’t have all the money to afford to keep them on the team.”Adriana Bailey’s father works for the New York Stock Exchange, though, like many other 12-year-olds, she doesn’t know precisely what her father does.“Lots of people at his job are getting fired, and he’s afraid he’ll be in the next round,” she said.Her eyes glimmered, and she looked palpably upset and a little confused. “He used to buy a lot of stuff, jewelry and laptops,” she said. “He has to stop buying it.”For one thing, these children are clearly sensing the desperate maneuvers of high finance and the United States Treasury.“Popular banks like Chase are taking over little banks,” Jasmine said. “People are losing their bank accounts. My mom changed to Chase. Before she had her money in HSBC.”In many ways, they know their parents’ days of wine and roses are over — at least for a while.Ciarra Williams, 12, has a friend who had to move back with her father after her mother lost her home.“A lot of people are losing their houses because of the high mortgage, and it’s causing poverty,” she said.“My mom’s friend, their house is about to go into foreclosure because she couldn’t pay,” Jasmine chimed in. “It was a nice house too.”Teara Williams, 12, Ciarra’s twin sister, noticed how her school was trying fund-raising gimmicks like talent shows so it could afford to maintain the school and buy supplies.And the students are mad at the way grown-ups have frittered away money, even as our new Gilded Age has been turning to dross. Jasmine wondered what was the need of a new Yankee Stadium when the old one did the job perfectly well.“I could see if something was wrong with the building, but who needs a new stadium?” she said.That sparked an echo of outrage from Ciarra. “They’re going through a depression and they think about a stadium?” she asked. “It makes no difference whether it’s old or new.”Their sense of the nation’s financial meltdown is already influencing their plans for what they will do with the money they earn. They’re thinking of investing in stocks that rely on what people always do, good times and bad. People have to eat even if a depression hits. So McDonald’s was a stock the students touted.“I’m going to invest in Apple,” Jasmine said. “They make a lot of money — iPods, iPhones, computers. People like that stuff.”“It’s always the kids who know when the next big thing is,” he said.But Jasmine quickly confessed to some second thoughts about her money.“I’ll put it in savings,” she decided. “Because the way the stocks are going. I’m going to lose.”1113 2008-10-26 Had Schmidt been working for his present client back in 2000, he might have disputed Bush’s premise. After all, in McCain’s first run for the presidency, “true character” was the one thing the hero and campaign-finance-reform crusader seemed to have going for him eight years ago in the Republican primaries. Bush had everything else, and he buried McCain. What campaigns peddle is not simply character but character as defined by story — a tale of opposing forces that in its telling will memorably establish what a given election is about. In 2000, the McCain effort played like that of a smart and plucky independent film that ultimately could not compete for audiences against the Bush campaign’s summer blockbuster. Four years later, in the race against John Kerry, Schmidt and the other Bush strategists had perfected their trade craft. With a major studio’s brutal efficiency, they distilled the campaign into a megabudget melodrama pitting an unwavering commander in chief against a flip-flopper, set in a post-9/11 world where there could be no room for error or equivocation.Schmidt has been in charge of strategy for the McCain campaign since early this summer, and his effort to prevail in the battle of competing story lines has been considerably more problematic. The selling of a presidential “narrative” the reigning buzz word of this election cycle has taken on outsize significance in an age in which a rush of visuals and catch words can cripple public images overnight. , it is said, lost because he could not get his story straight. found her I’m-a-fighter leitmotif too late to save her candidacy. By contrast, the narrative of has seemed to converge harmonically with the shifting demographics and surging discontent of the electorate. It may well be, as his detractors suggest, that Obama is among the least-experienced presidential nominees in our nation’s history. But to voters starved for change, the 47-year-old biracial first-term Democratic senator clearly qualifies. That, in any event, is his story, and he has stuck to it.John McCain’s biography has been the stuff of legend for nearly a decade. And yet Schmidt and his fellow strategists have had difficulty explaining how America will be better off for electing (as opposed to simply admiring) a stubborn patriot. In seeking to do so, the McCain campaign has changed its narrative over and over. Sometimes with McCain’s initial resistance but always with his eventual approval, Schmidt has proffered a candidate who is variously a fighter, a conciliator, an experienced leader and a shake-’em-up rebel. “The trick is that all of these are McCain,” Matt McDonald, a senior adviser, told me. But in constantly alternating among story lines in order to respond to changing events and to gain traction with voters, the “true character” of a once-crisply-defined political figure has become increasingly murky.Schmidt evidently saw the financial crisis as a “true character” moment that would advance his candidate’s narrative. But the story line did not go as scripted. “This has to be solved by Monday,” Schmidt told reporters that Wednesday afternoon in late September, just after McCain concluded his lengthy meeting with his advisers and subsequently announced his decision to suspend his campaign and go to Washington. Belying a crisis situation, however, McCain didn’t leave New York immediately. He spent Thursday morning at an event for the Clinton Global Initiative, the nonprofit foundation run by former President . As McCain headed for Washington later that morning, he was sufficiently concerned about the situation that Schmidt felt compelled to reassure him. “Remember what President Clinton told you,” Schmidt said, referring to advice Clinton had dispensed that morning: “If you do the right thing, it might be painful for a few days. But in the long run it will work out in your favor.”After arriving on Capitol Hill nearly 24 hours after his announcement, McCain huddled with three of his closest political allies: fellow senators , and Jon Kyl. Later that day at a White House meeting convened by Bush and also attended by Congressional leaders of both parties as well as both candidates, McCain said almost nothing, even when House Republicans declared that they were not yet willing to sign onto the administration’s $700 billion proposal. Despite the fact that the deal maker had produced no deal, McCain announced the next day that his campaign would resume — “optimistic that there has been significant progress towards a bipartisan agreement,” as a campaign statement put it — and traveled to that Friday afternoon to debate Obama. On Sunday morning, Schmidt went on “Meet the Press” to insist that his boss’s foray had been crucial in bringing “all of the parties to the table,” with the result that “there appears to be a framework completed.” The next day — Monday, Sept. 29, the day by which Schmidt had earlier warned the crisis “has to be solved” — the House Republicans played the key role in defeating the bailout legislation.Scene by scene, McCain failed to deliver the performance that had been promised. Of course, this was no mere movie. America was in crisis. Perhaps with the Bush theory in mind, Steve Schmidt had advised McCain to “go in all the way” on the financial crisis so as to reveal his candidate’s true character. But given a chance to show what kind of president he might be, McCain came off more like a stymied bystander than a leader who could make a difference. Judging by the polls, the McCain campaign has yet to recover.In reporting on the campaign’s vicissitudes, I spoke with a half-dozen of McCain’s senior-most advisers — most of them more than once and some of them repeatedly — over a period that began in early August. I spoke as well to several other midlevel advisers and to a number of former senior aides. Virtually all of these individuals had spoken with me for previous articles concerning McCain. Their insights and recollections enabled me to piece together conversations and events. My repeated requests to interview McCain and his running mate, , were denied, and with only a couple of exceptions those who spoke to me did so with the stipulation that most or all of their comments not be attributed to them.Despite their leeriness of being quoted, McCain’s senior advisers remained palpably confident of victory — at least until very recently. By October, the succession of backfiring narratives would compel some to reappraise not only McCain’s chances but also the decisions made by Schmidt, who only a short time ago was hailed as the savior who brought discipline and unrepentant toughness to a listing campaign. “For better or for worse, our campaign has been fought from tactic to tactic,” one senior adviser glumly acknowledged to me in early October, just after Schmidt received authorization from McCain to unleash a new wave of ads attacking Obama’s character. “So this is the new tactic.”The Heroic Fighter vs. the QuittersSteve Schmidt is 38, bald and brawny, with a nasal, deadpan voice and a relentless stare. He is also a devoted husband and father of two young children, introspective and boyishly vulnerable for someone of such imposing stature. On mornings, he can be seen standing outside the McCain campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va., a cigarette while he scowls at his BlackBerry. After campaign events in the evening, he often hangs out at a hotel bar drinking beer with fellow campaign workers and members of the media. Whenever possible, he flies back to to spend the weekend with his family. He is not a hothead and tends to hesitate for several beats before offering a well-tailored, often wry answer to a question. Though commonly described in the press as a protégé, Schmidt was a Republican operative for a dozen years before he ever worked for Rove. When Bush returned to the White House, Schmidt was not among those from the 2004 re-election effort who were rewarded with plum jobs, despite his well-regarded work overseeing the campaign’s rapid-response unit. After spending the first half of 2005 heading up the press office for Vice President , Schmidt was sent to Baghdad to improve the administration’s anemic communications strategy in Iraq. He also orchestrated the Senate confirmation hearings of the nominees and and their presentation to the outside world. Along the way, Schmidt never really developed the personal relationship with Bush that would have enabled him to advance in accordance with his talents. In early 2006, when an opportunity came to jump ship, Schmidt took it, departing the Bush administration to spearhead the successful re-election campaign of Gov. in California. He still lives outside , far from Washington. Though Schmidt often brandishes his geographical remove from the Beltway and his lack of interest in another White House job as proof of his equanimity, you get the sense that a McCain victory would bring him no small measure of personal vindication.For a man who seems to relish Rove-like alley fighting, Schmidt is not an ideologue and claims he harbors no ambition of delivering the to a state of lasting supremacy. He also displays great nuance in office politics. Until Schmidt consolidated his power this summer, McCain, it’s fair to say, was not a big believer in organization. The important decisions were all made by him, with various confidants of ambiguous portfolio orbiting around him and often colliding with one another (and often staying in the picture well after their departure — as was the case of , a strategist from the 2000 campaign, who remained close enough to McCain that rumors of his return persisted until fairly recently).A year earlier, in the summer of 2007, the McCain campaign all but collapsed under the weight of financial woes, vicious infighting and the conservative base’s fury over his moderate stance on . Among the senior staff members who walked out were McCain’s longtime political guru John Weaver and several alumni of the well-oiled 2004 Bush campaign. Schmidt — who until that point was not particularly influential — decided to stick around, even without pay. He began to earn McCain’s trust while also befriending the senator’s two closest advisers, who happened not to care for each other.One was Rick Davis, a charming Southern lobbyist and Republican jack-of-all-trades who had assumed control of the campaign’s day-to-day operations. McCain and Davis have for years called each other a half-dozen times a day, but Davis has also cultivated a close bond with , who once when talking to referred to Davis as “our best friend.” The other adviser was 53-year-old Mark Salter, a brilliant, pugnacious writer who has composed all of McCain’s books and major speeches and in a more encompassing sense is McCain’s definer, looking after what Salter himself calls the “metanarrative” of McCain’s transformation from a reckless flyboy and P.O.W. to a courageous patriot. The complicated interdependence between McCain and Salter could be glimpsed during the candidate’s acceptance speech at the Republican convention. Salter sat in the front row, dead center, no more than 15 feet from McCain. I watched as Salter gazed intently at McCain throughout, making subtle motions with his hands and face, and when McCain came to the pivotal line in his P.O.W. tale — “I was no longer my own man; I was my country’s” — its author leapt to his feet and applauded.But in the summer of 2007, Salter and McCain’s relationship frayed when Salter and others tried to marginalize Davis, and McCain resisted. While Salter brooded and Davis spent his hours at headquarters begging donors and volunteers not to jump ship, Schmidt stepped into the void. There was still more than a year until the election, he figured. The problem was that McCain was spending his time talking about Iraq, in distinctly funereal tones. “It’s long and it’s hard and it’s tough,” the senator told one audience in Gilford, N.H., that summer. “I could recommend books on it that’ll make you cry. . . . I know how frustrated you are. I know the sorrow you experience.” Virtually all of his senior staff members, Schmidt and Davis among them, had been begging McCain to focus on the economy, health care and tax policy. Anything, really, except Bush’s war. But according to several senior advisers, the candidate felt a deep sense of responsibility to cheerlead for the troop surge, which he believed would turn the tide in Iraq. It began to dawn on Schmidt that McCain’s stubborn patronage of an unpopular war wasn’t impeding the campaign’s quest for narrative — it was the narrative.“Sir, is the surge working?” he said he asked McCain one day. “Are we winning?”“That’s not what you’re saying on the trail.”“No, sir. It’s not. You’re saying things are getting better. Do you believe we’re actually winning now?”McCain indicated that he did.“Well, going forward, that’s what you should say,” Schmidt replied. He encouraged McCain to denounce the Democrats for advocating a withdrawal of troops — a kind of surrender in the face of victory. Thus did Schmidt initiate the No Surrender Tour late in the summer of 2007, a push through the early primary states that saw John McCain surrounded by war veterans while he lashed out at weak-kneed war critics. Employing considerable artistic license, Schmidt linked McCain’s stance on Iraq with his bravery during his years in captivity in Vietnam, something the candidate had shied away from. Indeed, as McCain told me two years ago, he decided to write his Vietnam memoir, with Salter largely to put the subject to rest once and for all: “I just got bored telling the same old story over and over again. . . . After the 3,000th time, you think, Hey, I’d rather talk about something else.”As one adviser told me two months ago: “It’s against his better nature to be self-aggrandizing. But everybody was telling him, ‘This is about the election, the election’s about your character and this stuff goes along with your narrative.’ ” Schmidt warned McCain that declining to discuss personal matters like his P.O.W. days and his religious faith would very likely have ramifications at the polls. The candidate acquiesced. In speeches, debates and advertising, the McCain campaign made liberal use of his war-hero metanarrative. On March 28, 2008, with the Republican nomination secured, McCain’s first national ad was shown. It concluded with grainy black-and-white footage of the wounded P.O.W. reciting his serial number to his captors, followed by a spoken line that Schmidt loved and adamantly defended, even when others inside the campaign argued that it made no sense: “John McCain. The American president Americans have been waiting for.” Thereafter, McCain seldom wasted an opportunity to extol his own patriotism.Schmidt spent this spring futilely trying to broaden the story line. Americans, he knew, did not share McCain’s devotion to the surge in Iraq. Their concerns lay at home. Accordingly, Schmidt toured McCain through , and , the towns of his beginnings (an idea conceived by Karl Rove, according to a senior adviser), and then made an empathy swing through poor regions of the country. Both came off as contrivances. McCain’s speech in on June 3 of this year — the night Obama effectively clinched the nomination — was delivered against a sickly green backdrop, a poorly executed version of an idea Schmidt borrowed from the eco-friendly 2006 Schwarzenegger campaign. Contrasted with Obama’s ringing articulation of change in St. Paul that very night, McCain’s speech (with its “That’s not change we can believe in” refrain) struck even some Republicans as churlish. McCain was so frustrated by his own, at times, stumbling performance that he vowed never to deliver another teleprompter speech again.The campaign was in the throes of an identity crisis by June 24, when a number of senior strategists gathered at 9:30 a.m. in a conference room of McCain’s campaign headquarters in Arlington. As one participant said later, the meeting was convened “because we still couldn’t answer the question, ‘Why elect John McCain?’ ” Considering that the election was less than five months away, this was not a good sign.“We had a narrative problem,” Matt McDonald recalls. “Obama had a story line: ‘Bush is the problem. I’m not going to be Bush, and McCain will be.’ Our story line, I argued, had to be that it’s not about Bush — it’s Congress, it’s Washington. And Obama would be more about partisanship, while John McCain would buck the party line and bring people together.”The others could see line of reasoning — and above all, the need to separate McCain from Bush. But the message seemed antiseptic, impersonal. That was when the keeper of McCain’s biography, Mark Salter, took the floor. There’s a reason McCain bucks his party, McDonald remembers Salter arguing. It’s because he puts his country ahead of party. Then the speechwriter, who is not known for his dispassion, began to yell: “We’re talking about someone who was willing to die before losing his honor! He would die!”Salter stalked out of the meeting to have a cigarette and didn’t return. But he had said enough. The metanarrative of Heroic Fighter was now joined with one that evoked postpartisan statesmanship. The new narrative needed a label. The first version was “A Love for America.” Then And finally, the one that stuck: “Country First.”The McCain campaign maintained that in contrast to Obama, their candidate had taken on his own party while working with Democrats on such issues as immigration and campaign-finance reform. “Obama pays no price from his party — never has,” Salter told me. “My guy has made a career out of it. So, how can you get people to believe that if you can’t get the press to make an honest assessment of it? You tell a story. ‘When it came down to a choice between my very life and my country, I chose my country.’ That’s why the story’s important. Just as Obama’s story is important to him. I don’t gainsay it. You know, tell your story!”Salter and Schmidt had hoped that the mainstream press would warm to this new narrative. But the matter of which candidate had shown more acts of bipartisan daring failed to become Topic A. The two advisers — each of whom had friendly relations with the media but had grown increasingly convinced that Obama was getting a free ride — took this as further proof that today’s reporters were primarily young, snarky, blog-obsessed and liberal. To Schmidt’s and Salter’s minds, John McCain had always been honest and straightforward with the press, and the press in turn was not acting in good faith toward their candidate. As such it was now undeserving of McCain’s unfettered “straight talk.”But this rationale for shutting out the press has its limitations. For one, when McCain’s Straight Talk Express first rolled out in 1999, the notion was not conceived simply out of the sense that being transparent with the media — and by extension the voters — was just the right thing to do. Instead, it was implemented because the 2000 campaign lacked the money to compete with Bush’s ad campaign. As John Weaver, McCain’s former strategist told me, “We needed the coverage.” For another, McCain happened to like passing the time with reporters, whom he would sometimes refer to as his “base.” In addition, talking openly with the press had some important advantages early on for McCain. According to some of his aides, McCain’s victory in the make-or-break primary in January of this year might not have transpired had he not spent time talking to and overtly courting every editorial board in the state for their endorsements.Regardless, this summer Schmidt sought to convince his voluble candidate that the press was no longer his friend. By July, a curtain was literally drawn to separate McCain from the reporters traveling on his plane. He no longer mingled with them, and press conferences were drastically curtailed. The Bushian concept of message discipline — the droning repetition of a single talking point — that had been so gleefully mocked by McCain’s lieutenants in 2000 now governed the Straight Talk Express.“Gentlemen, let me put a few things on the table for observation and discussion,” Steve Schmidt said to his fellow strategists while sitting in a conference room in the Ritz-Carlton. “Would anyone here disagree with the premise that we are not winning this campaign?”No one disagreed. It was Sunday, July 27, and Obama had just concluded an eight-day swing through the and that received practically round-the-clock media coverage. “Would anyone disagree with the premise,” Schmidt went on, “that Mr. Obama has scored the most successful week in this entire campaign? I mean, they treated him like he was a head of state! So tell me, gentlemen: how do we turn this negative into a positive?”“It’s third and nine,” Bill McInturff, a pollster, observed. “Time to start throwing the ball down field.”Eventually, it was Schmidt who blurted out the epiphany concerning Obama. “Face it, gentlemen,” he said. “He’s being treated like a celebrity.”The others grasped the concept — a celebrity like J-Lo! or Britney! — and exultation overtook the room.John and Cindy McCain showed up at the end of the daylong meeting, and Schmidt took the opportunity to run the celebrity concept by them. The McCains liked it — though the candidate was otherwise cranky: he was tired of being overscheduled and always late and demanded that this change immediately. (It did, according to a senior adviser: “After that meeting, you will rarely see McCain do an event before 9 in the morning.”)Three days later, the new ad went up. “He’s the biggest celebrity in the world,” a female voice intoned, as images of and flashed on the screen. “But: is he ready to lead?” In a conference call with reporters that morning, Schmidt framed the issue with a binary choice straight out of the 2004 playbook: “Do the American people want to elect the biggest celebrity or an American hero?”The idea, McDonald told me, was “to exalt Obama’s eloquence. Push it up to a place where there’s no oxygen. Make it an Icarus thing.” The notion of Obama’s apparent presumptuousness seemed to grow on viewers. And when invaded the fledgling republic of on Aug. 8, McCain’s strategists saw an opportunity for another stark binary choice — albeit one that abruptly shifted the story line back to the international arena: combat-ready leader versus unready celebrity.The execution of the new narrative left something to be desired, however. Three days after the invasion, McCain made a statement to reporters in Erie, Pa., intended to showcase his mastery of the Russia-Georgia situation. Instead, the candidate mispronounced the name of the Georgian president, , three times. The next day, I watched as McCain appeared in York, Pa., to engage in one of his free-form town-hall meetings. But he began the event by standing next to a lectern and reciting Russia-Georgia talking points from prepared notes. Though no doubt this was intended to avoid his previous flubs, McCain’s scripted performance seemed more like that of a foreign-policy novice than a sure-handed sage.When I mentioned this episode later to one of McCain’s advisers, he winced and said: “This is part of the Schmidt gotta-have-absolute-message-discipline thing. That’s one of the disagreements. And John can be really resistant. He’s always worried about being put in a box. He’s got a very sensitive nerve about it. A lot of times I would hear him say: ‘Don’t control me. This is my campaign.’ But I think Steve has convinced him that we’ve got to do this if we’re going to win.”On Sunday, Aug. 24, Schmidt and a few other senior advisers again convened for a general strategy meeting at the Phoenix Ritz-Carlton. McInturff, the pollster, brought somewhat-reassuring new numbers. The Celebrity motif had taken its toll on Obama. It was no longer third and nine, the pollster said — meaning, among other things, that McCain might well be advised to go with a safe pick as his running mate.Then for a half-hour or so, the group reviewed names that had been bandied about in the past: Gov. (of ) and Gov. Charlie Crist (of ); the former governors ( ) and Mitt Romney ( ); Senator Joe Lieberman ( ); and Mayor (New York). From a branding standpoint, they wondered, what message would each of these candidates send about John McCain? McInturff’s polling data suggested that none of these candidates brought significantly more to the ticket than any other.After a moment of silence, Fred Davis, McCain’s creative director (and not related to Rick), said, “I did the ads for her gubernatorial campaign.” But Davis had never once spoken with Palin, the governor of . Since the Republican Governors Association had paid for his work, Davis was prohibited by campaign laws from having any contact with the candidate. All Davis knew was that the R.G.A. folks had viewed Palin as a talent to keep an eye on. “She’d certainly be a maverick pick,” he concluded.The meeting carried on without Schmidt or Rick Davis uttering an opinion about Palin. Few in the room were aware that the two had been speaking to each other about Palin for some time now. Davis was with McCain when the two met Palin for the first time, at a reception at the winter meeting in February, in the J. W. Marriott Hotel in Washington. It had not escaped McCain’s attention that Palin had blasted through the oleaginous Alaska network dominated by Frank Murkowski and , much in the same manner that McCain saw himself doing when he was a young congressman. and others had spoken of Palin as a rising star. Davis saw something else in Palin — namely, a way to re-establish the maverick persona McCain had lost while wedding himself to Bush’s war. A female running mate might also pick off some disaffected Hillary Clinton voters.After that first brief meeting, Davis remained in discreet but frequent contact with Palin and her staff — gathering tapes of speeches and interviews, as he was doing with all potential vice-presidential candidates. One tape in particular struck Davis as arresting: an interview with Palin and Gov. , the Democrat, on “The Show” that was shown in October 2007. Reviewing the tape, it didn’t concern Davis that Palin seemed out of her depth on health-care issues or that, when asked to name her favorite candidate among the Republican field, she said, “I’m undecided.” What he liked was how she stuck to her pet issues — energy independence and ethics reform — and thereby refused to let Rose manage the interview. This was the case throughout all of the Palin footage. Consistency. Confidence. And . . . well, look at her. A friend had said to Davis: “The way you pick a vice president is, you get a frame of Time magazine, and you put the pictures of the people in that frame. You look at who fits that frame best — that’s your V. P.”Schmidt, to whom Davis quietly supplied the Palin footage, agreed. Neither man apparently saw her lack of familiarity with major national or international issues as a serious liability. Instead, well before McCain made his selection, his chief strategist and his campaign manager both concluded that Sarah Palin would be the most dynamic pick. Despite McInturff’s encouraging new numbers, it remained their conviction that in this ominous election cycle, a Republican presidential candidate could not afford to play it safe. Picking Palin would upend the chessboard; it was a maverick type of move. McCain, the former Navy pilot, loved that sort of thing. Then again, he also loved familiarity — the swashbuckling camaraderie with his longtime staff members, the P.O.W. band of brothers who frequently rode the bus and popped up at his campaign events, the ranch where he unwound and grilled wagonloads of meat. By contrast, McCain had barely met Palin.That evening of Aug. 24, Schmidt and Davis, after leaving the Ritz-Carlton meeting, showed up at McCain’s condominium in Phoenix. They informed McCain that in their view, Palin would be the best pick. “You never know where his head is,” Davis told me three weeks later. “He doesn’t betray a lot. He’s a great poker player. But he picked up the phone.” Reached at the Alaska State Fair, Palin listened as McCain for the first time discussed the possibility of selecting her as his running mate.These machinations remained thoroughly sub rosa. McCain’s close friend, Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator, continued to argue passionately for Lieberman — “a McCain-Plus ticket,” he would say. McCain, referring to Romney, at one point said that “Mitt’s been awfully helpful with fund-raising,” according to a senior aide who was present during the discussion. “And he’d bring us .” Pawlenty’s name frequently came up in internal discussions, says that aide. But as for Palin, says another: “She just wasn’t one of the names. I mean, we heard more about Bloomberg.”On Tuesday, Aug. 26, Schmidt picked up the phone around noon and called Jon Berrier, an old friend and partner at Schmidt’s consulting business in . Berrier was asked to get on a plane to , check into a hotel, await further details and tell no one. The next morning, Davis White, who oversaw all of McCain’s travel logistics, met Berrier for breakfast in Anchorage. White informed Berrier that they would meet Palin at a private airstrip that afternoon, and that White would fly with Palin to Arizona to meet with Schmidt and Salter that evening — and then, the following morning, with McCain. If McCain offered the vice-president slot to Palin, White told Berrier, then Berrier would surreptitiously fly Palin’s husband, Todd, and their children to on Thursday evening, and a public announcement would be made there the next morning. The final decision wasn’t to be made until Thursday morning, but they should proceed as if it was going to happen.Palin and her assistant, Kris Perry, met Schmidt and Salter on Wednesday evening in , at the house of Bob Delgado, the chief executive of Hensley & Company, Cindy McCain’s beer distributorship. McCain’s speechwriter had never spoken with Palin before. A senior adviser said: “Salter was always a big Pawlenty fan — son of a truck driver, salt of the earth, genuine guy. Just thought he was a good, honest addition to the McCain brand as opposed to, say, Romney.” That so much momentum had been building in Palin’s favor was likely a surprise to Salter, says one of the few individuals privy to the vice-presidential selection process: “Mark was new to it, and so it was important to us to make sure that he was in on the situation that was brewing.”For two hours, Salter and Schmidt asked Palin questions based on the vetting material. Salter says they discussed her daughter’s and the pending state investigation regarding her role in the controversy surrounding the state trooper who had been married to her sister. The two advisers warned her that nothing was likely to stay secret during the campaign. Salter says that he was impressed. “The sense you immediately get is how tough-minded and self-assured she is,” he recalled three weeks after meeting her. “She makes that impression in like 30 seconds.”Now all three of McCain’s closest advisers were on board. The next morning was Thursday, Aug. 28. Salter and Schmidt drove Palin to McCain’s ranch. According to Salter, the senator took the governor down to a place where he usually had his coffee, beside a creek and a sycamore tree, where a rare breed of hawk seasonally nested. They spoke for more than an hour. Then the two of them walked about 40 yards to the deck of the cabin where the McCains slept. Cindy joined them there for about 15 minutes, after which the McCains excused themselves and went for a brief stroll to discuss the matter. When they returned, McCain asked for some time with Schmidt and Salter. “And we did our pros and cons on all of them,” Salter told me. “He just listened. Asked a couple of questions. Then said, ‘I’m going to offer it to her.’ ”Late that same evening, a McCain spokeswoman, Nicolle Wallace, and the deputy speechwriter, Matthew Scully, were ferried to the Manchester Inn in Middletown, Ohio. Schmidt instructed them to turn off their cellphones and BlackBerrys. Then he opened the door of Room 508 and introduced them to McCain’s running mate. The two aides were surprised. Palin and Scully spoke for about 45 minutes, and the governor handed him a copy of the speech she had intended to give as one of the Republican convention’s many guest speakers. With this scant information in hand, Scully began his all-night drafting of Palin’s first speech to a national audience.During the evening, Scully also traded e-mail messages with Matt McDonald, who had just gotten the news from Schmidt that the vice-presidential pick was someone who did not quite fit the campaign’s current emphasis on “readiness.” The story line, Schmidt informed McDonald, was now Change. The two of them, along with Rick Davis, talked through this rather jolting narrative shift. What they decided upon was workable, if inelegant. First, define the problem as Washington, not Bush. Second, posit both McCain and Palin as experienced reformers. And third, define Obama and his 65-year-old running mate, Senator , as a ticket with no real record of change. McDonald in turn transmitted this formulation to Scully and Salter, who was busily drafting McCain’s announcement speech.The spunky hockey mom that America beheld the next morning instantly hijacked Obama’s narrative of newness. (“Change is coming!” McCain hollered, almost seeming startled himself.) And five days later, in the hours after Palin’s stunningly self-assured acceptance speech at the G.O.P. convention, I watched as the Republicans in the bar of the Hilton rejoiced as Republicans had not rejoiced since Inauguration Night three and a half long years ago. Jubilant choruses of “She knocked it out of the park” and “One of the greatest speeches ever” were heard throughout the room, and some people gave, yes, Obama-style fist bumps. When the tall, unassuming figure of Palin’s speechwriter, Matthew Scully, shuffled into the bar, he was treated to the first standing ovation of his life. Nicolle Wallace confessed to another staff member that she had cried throughout Palin’s speech. Allowing his feelings to burst out of his composed eggshell of a face, Schmidt bellowed to someone, “Game on!”Just as quickly, he resumed his natural state of arch contemplativeness. “Arguably, at this stage?” he observed. “She’s a bigger celebrity than Obama.”A commotion erupted, followed by outright hysteria. It was 11:45, and the Palins had entered the bar. Dozens of staff members and delegates flocked to the governor, cellphone cameras outstretched. Todd and Sarah Palin posed, shook hands and extended their gracious appreciation for 15 minutes. Then, no doubt realizing that they would never be able to enjoy a drink in peace, they withdrew for the evening, again to raucous applause.While all of this was going on, an elegant middle-aged woman sat alone at the far end of the bar. She wore beige slacks and a red sweater, and she picked at a salad while talking incessantly on her cellphone. But for the McCain/Palin button affixed to her collar and the brief moment that Tucker Eskew, Palin’s new counselor, spoke into her ear, she seemed acutely disconnected from the jubilation around her.In fact, the woman was here for a reason. Her name was Priscilla Shanks, a New York-based stage and screen actress of middling success who had found a lucrative second career as a voice coach. Shanks’s work with Sarah Palin was as evident as it was unseen. Gone, by the evening of her convention speech, was the squeaky register of Palin’s exclamations. Gone (at least for the moment) was the Bushian pronunciation of “nuclear” as “nook-you-ler.” Present for the first time was a leisurely, even playful cadence that signaled Sarah Palin’s inevitability on this grand stage.In the ensuing two and a half weeks (which surely felt longer to the Obama campaign), the Palin Effect was manifest and profound. McCain seemed, if not suddenly younger — after all, the woman standing to his side was nearly the same age as his daughter, Sidney — then freshly boisterous as he crowed, “Change is coming, my friends!” Meanwhile, Palin’s gushing references to McCain as “the one great man in this race” and “exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief” seemed to confer not only valor but virility on a 72-year-old politician who only weeks ago barely registered with the party faithful.But just as you could make too much of Shanks’s quiet coaching of Palin, you could also make too little of it. The new narrative — the Team of Mavericks coming to lay waste the Beltway power alleys — now depended on a fairly inexperienced Alaska politician. The following night, after McCain’s speech brought the convention to a close, one of the campaign’s senior advisers stayed up late at the Hilton bar savoring the triumphant narrative arc. I asked him a rather basic question: “Leaving aside her actual experience, do you know how informed Governor Palin is about the issues of the day?”The senior adviser thought for a moment. Then he looked up from his beer. he said quietly. “I don’t know.”In the period before the campaign’s decision earlier this month to wage an all-out assault on Obama’s character as the next narrative tactic, McCain was signaling to aides that it was important to run an honorable campaign. People are hurting now, McCain said to his convention planners as whirled toward the Gulf Coast. It’s a shame we have to have a convention at all. But because we have to do this, tone it down. No balloons, nothing over the top. When his media team suggested running ads that highlighted Obama’s connection with the Rev. , McCain reminded them that he pledged months earlier not to exploit the matter, and John McCain was not about to go back on his word. In such moments, the man who renounced negative ads during the 2000 campaign because he wanted (as he told his aghast advisers back then) “to run a campaign my daughter can be proud of” has been thoroughly recognizable.But that John McCain had lost. Of the noble but perhaps naïve decision in 2000 to unilaterally take down his attack ads, Rick Davis would vow: “That’s not gonna happen a second time. I mean, the old dog can learn a few new tricks.” And yet on this landscape of new tricks — calling your opponent a liar; allowing your running mate to imply that the opponent might prefer terrorists over Americans — McCain sometimes seemed to be running against not only Barack Obama but an earlier version of himself.The flipside to John McCain’s metanarrative of personal valor has always been palpable self-righteousness. In this campaign, his sense of integrity has been doubly offended. First, an adviser said, “He just really thinks the media is completely in the tank for Obama and doesn’t feel like he’s getting a fair shake at all.” And second, another said, “I don’t think John likes people who try to do jobs they’re not qualified for” — referring, in this case, to Barack Obama.In June, McCain formally proposed that he and his Democratic opponent campaign together across America in a series of town-hall-style meetings. He had in fact suggested the same thing to Joe Biden three years earlier, Biden told me back then: “He said: ‘Let’s make a deal if we end up being the nominees. Let’s commit to do what Goldwater and Kennedy committed to do before Kennedy was shot.’ We agreed that we would campaign together, same plane, get off in the same city and go to 30 states or whatever together.” According to Biden, he and McCain sealed their agreement with a handshake. When McCain extended the same offer to Obama in 2008, the Democrat said that he found the notion “appealing” but then did little to make it happen. Since that time, McCain has repeatedly told aides what he has also said in public — that had Obama truly showed a determination to have a series of joint appearances, the campaign would not have degenerated to its current sorry state.But to McCain, that Obama failed to do so carries a deeper significance. Authenticity means everything to a man like McCain who, says Salter, “has an affinity for heroes, for men of honor.” Conversely, he reserves special contempt for those he regards as arrogant phonies. A year after Barack Obama was sworn into the Senate, Salter recalls McCain saying, “He’s got a future, I’ll reach out to him” — as McCain had to and , and as the liberal Arizona congressman Mo Udall had reached out to McCain as a freshman. McCain invited Obama to attend a bipartisan meeting on ethics reform. Obama gratefully accepted —but then wrote McCain a letter urging him to instead follow a legislative path recommended by , the Democratic leader in the Senate. Feeling double-crossed, McCain ordered Salter to “send him a letter, brush him back a little.” Since that experience, says a Republican who has known McCain for a long time, “there was certainly disdain and dislike of Obama.”A senior adviser to McCain said: “The town halls, the ethics bill, immigration reform — all are examples. I think McCain finds it galling that Obama gets credit for his impressive talk about bipartisanship without ever having to bear the risk that is a part of that. It is so much harder to walk the walk in the Senate than to talk the talk.” By extension, then, if the McCain campaign’s conduct would appear to be at odds with the man’s “true character,” it is only because the combination of a dishonorable opponent and a biased media has forced his hand. Or so goes the rationale for what by this month was an increasingly ugly campaign.The worry among his aides had long been that McCain would let his indignation show. Going into the debates, an adviser expressed that very concern to me: “If he keeps the debates on substance, he’s very good. If it moves to the personal, then I think it’s a disaster.” Accordingly, Salter advised McCain before the first debate to maintain, one person privy to the sessions put it, “a very generous patience with Obama — in terms of, ‘I’m sure if he understood. . . .’ ”“The object wasn’t to appear condescending at all — really, the opposite,” an adviser said of Salter’s tactic, which judging by the postdebate polls seemed to backfire. “You put a bullet in a gun, figuring it’ll get shot once. We had no idea it would be shot 10 times.”The Fighter (Again) vs. the Tax-and-Spend LiberalHaving fallen back on the most clichéd of political story lines — the devil you know versus the devil you don’t — only to see the negative tactic boomerang, Schmidt and his colleagues cobbled together one last narrative with less than a month to go. Kicking it off at an event in on Oct. 13, McCain delivered a speech that did not mention “maverick,” or “country first,” or “no surrender.” The new motif was a hybrid of the previous five story lines, especially the first. Mentioning some version of the word “fight” 19 times, McCain was once again a warrior — only more upbeat, more respectful of his opponent, more empathetic to suffering Americans and far more disapproving of the president. Rick Davis told me in September, “The worst scenario for Obama is if he winds up running against the McCain of 2000,” an authentic independent. But if this was the McCain that was now emerging, it was awfully late in the game, and he was encumbered by other versions of McCain gone awry.In the final debate on Oct. 15 at on , McCain barely mentioned any version of the word “fight” but performed forcefully, perhaps even indignantly. By the time Steve Schmidt entered the postdebate spin room, his Obama counterpart, , had already been holding the floor for 20 minutes. Schmidt wore a pinstripe suit and his blue eyes carried a victor’s gleam. Like every other McCain aide I encountered that night, he was convinced not only that the senator had turned in his best performance but that viewers would see him as the clear winner.Schmidt vowed that McCain would spend the final days of the campaign focused on the economy — and on Joe the plumber, the kind of entrepreneur (so McCain thought at the time) who would become an endangered species in an Obama administration. But that did not stop Schmidt from a lengthy monologue questioning Obama’s character and assailing the opposition’s “vicious” and “racially divisive” ads. At a certain point, when a member of the foreign media asked him if all of this spinning was likely to help McCain, Schmidt allowed himself a small grin and said: “Well, look. One of the things I always wonder is why we come in here at the end. . . . It doesn’t really matter, to be totally truthful with you. It’s just part of the ritual. Like eating turkey on Thanksgiving.”A few minutes later, his close friend and colleague Nicolle Wallace tugged Schmidt away from the scrum. They exited the spin room while Axelrod was still holding forth and flew back to Washington late that night.McCain and a number of his advisers remained at their hotel on Long Island. At the hotel bar where many of them lingered into the late hours, I asked one of them whether the debate could make a difference at this late stage. The adviser maintained that regardless of the instant-poll numbers, Joe the plumber and other talking points would likely resonate in the weeks to come.Then the adviser said with a helpless smile, “Hopefully that’ll change the narrative.”1114 2008-10-27 Economists argue that democracy is good for business....1115 2008-10-27 The independent arm of the Republican national party buys ad time in a reliably red state....1116 2008-10-27 John McCain said that he, and not Democrats, would restore the ailing economy.

But these unscripted moments and his record tell a different story. He supported the Democratic budget plan passed just this year that called for raising taxes on people making just 42,000 dollars per year. And Senator Obama has voted 94 times for tax increases or against tax cuts.Senator Obama may say he's trying to soak the rich, but it's the middle class who are going to get put through the wringer, because even the tax increase he admits to misses the target. To pay for nearly a trillion dollars in new government spending, his tax increase would impact 50 percent of small business income in this country, and the jobs of 16 million middle class Americans who work for those small businesses.Whether it's Joe the Plumber here in Ohio or the working men and women across this country, we shouldn't be taxing our small businesses more as Senator Obama wants to do, we need to be helping them expand their businesses and create jobs. America didn't become the greatest nation on earth by giving our money to the government to ""redistribute."" In this country, we believe in spreading opportunity, for those who need jobs and those who create them. And that is exactly what I intend to do as President of the United States.My opponent's massive new tax increase is exactly the wrong approach in an economic slowdown. The answer to a slowing economy is not higher taxes, but that is exactly what is going to happen when the Democrats have total control of Washington. We can't let that happen. We need pro-growth and pro-jobs economic policies, not pro-government spending programs paid for with higher taxes.This is the fundamental difference between Senator Obama and me. We both disagree with President Bush on economic policy. The difference is that he thinks taxes have been too low, and I think that spending has been too high. Senator Obama's priority is not to get spending under control, it is to spend more, and if he has to tax you to do it, he's shown in the past that he doesn't have a problem with that.We cannot spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight: spending ourselves into a ditch and hoping that the consequences don't come. We need to get our government under control, and we need to get our economy moving again. We have to act. We need a new direction, and we have to fight for it.I've been fighting for this country since I was seventeen years old, and I have the scars to prove it. If I'm elected President, I will fight to shake up Washington and take America in a new direction from my first day in office until my last. I'm not afraid of the fight, I'm ready for it.I'm not going to spend $750 billion dollars of your money just bailing out the Wall Street bankers and brokers who got us into this mess. I'm going to make sure we take care of the working people who were devastated by the excesses of Wall Street and Washington.I have a plan to hold the line on taxes and cut them to make America more competitive and create jobs here at home. We're going to double the child deduction for working families. We will cut the capital gains tax. And we will cut business taxes to help create jobs, and keep American businesses in America. Raising taxes makes a bad economy much worse. Keeping taxes low creates jobs, keeps money in your hands and strengthens our economy.If I'm elected President, I won't spend nearly a trillion dollars more of your money. Senator Obama will. And he can't do that without raising your taxes or digging us further into debt. I'm going to make government live on a budget just like you do.I will freeze government spending on all but the most important programs like defense, veterans care, Social Security and health care until we scrub every single government program and get rid of the ones that aren't working for the American people. And I will veto every single pork barrel bill Congresses passes.If I'm elected President, we're going to stop spending $700 billion to buy oil from countries that don't like us very much. Senator Obama will argue to delay drilling for more oil and gas and against building new nuclear power plants in America. If I am president, we will start new drilling now. We will invest in all energy alternatives -- nuclear, wind, solar, and tide. We will encourage the manufacture of hybrid, flex fuel and electric automobiles. We will invest in clean coal technology. We will lower the cost of energy within months, and we will create millions of new jobs.Let me give you the state of the race today. There's eight days to go. We're a few points down. The pundits have written us off, just like they've done before. My opponent is working out the details with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid of their plans to raise your taxes, increase spending, and concede defeat in Iraq. He's measuring the drapes, and he's planned his first address to the nation for before the election. I guess I'm old fashioned about these things I prefer to let the voters weigh in before presuming the outcome.What America needs now is someone who will finish the race before the starting the victory lap ... someone who will fight to the end, and not for himself but for his country.I have fought for you most of my life, and in places where defeat meant more than returning to the Senate. There are other ways to love this country, but I've never been the kind to back down when the stakes are high.I know you're worried. America is a great country, but we are at a moment of national crisis that will determine our future.Will we continue to lead the world's economies or will we be overtaken? Will the world become safer or more dangerous? Will our military remain the strongest in the world? Will our children and grandchildren's future be brighter than ours?My answer to you is yes. Yes, we will lead. Yes, we will prosper. Yes, we will be safer. Yes, we will pass on to our children a stronger, better country. But we must be prepared to act swiftly, boldly, with courage and wisdom.I'm an American. And I choose to fight. Don't give up hope. Be strong. Have courage. And fight.Fight for a new direction for our country. Fight for what's right for America.Fight to clean up the mess of corruption, infighting and selfishness in Washington.Fight to get our economy out of the ditch and back in the lead.Fight for the ideals and character of a free people.Fight for justice and opportunity for all.Stand up to defend our country from its enemies.Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. America is worth fighting for. Nothing is inevitable here. We never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history.Now, let's go win this election and get this country moving again.1122 2008-10-27 Costas Synolakis, director of the Tsunami Research Center at the University of Southern California, has been thinking about the differences and similarities between the so-called financial tsunami and the real thing....1123 2008-10-27 My friend and fellow financial columnist Don McNay, who has consistently opposed the bailout bill, wrote me an e-mail message this weekend that led with this question: ""Your column strengthens my steadfast opposition to the bailout, but I am curio...1124 2008-10-27 Dr. Gary Curhan is a nephrologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. He has conducted some of the most extensive research into the causes of and risk factors for kidney stones , with the goal of improving prevention strategies. “Lifestyle changes can dramatically reduce the risk of stones,” Dr. Curhan said. Here are five things he believes everyone should know about kidney stones.1. If you pass a stone, try to retrieve it. That way it can be analyzed to find out what type of stone it is. The most common type is a calcium oxalate stone, followed by calcium phosphate stones and uric acid stones. “Not knowing the composition of a stone handicaps us,” Dr. Curhan said.2. Drink more fluids. Stones can be prevented if you’re willing to make changes to your diet and lifestyle. Randomized trials have found that making changes in diet can reduce your risk of a recurrence by 40 percent, and observational studies have shown an 80 percent reduction in risk. The most important thing you can do is to drink more fluids.3. Consider dietary changes and medications. Your treatment depends on what type of stone you have and may consist of dietary changes as well as medications to change the profile of your urine. Evidence suggests that the most important changes are drinking more fluids, increasing all fruits and vegetables, and reducing salt, sugar and animal protein in your diet. If urine calcium levels are high, thiazide diuretics can be used. If you have low urine citrate, potassium citrate may be prescribed to help correct the pH in the urine.4. Make sure you get a blood test and full evaluation when you have a kidney stone. Stones can be symptoms of other systemic disorders like diabetes, high blood pressure, hyperparathyroid disease and osteoporosis.5. Get follow-up care. Your doctor should regularly retest your urine with a 24-hour urine test to see if the dietary changes are working.1125 2008-10-27 Campaigning in Iowa this weekend, Senator John McCain briefly invoked a word that has been volatile for his campaign: ethanol....1126 2008-10-27 With many of Wall Street's biggest profit centers shut down because of the credit crisis, making a buck has become a lot harder.

Because there were no immediate charges, the police said they could not release the address in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens where the baby was found.The child was pronounced dead at the scene. The medical examiner’s office will perform an autopsy.Family and friends identified the dead child’s mother as Amanda Williams, the mother of two other children, about 2 and 3 years old. They said she and the children shared an apartment at the Maple Terrace complex with her mother; a teenage sister; and a younger sister, about 8.About 11:30 p.m. on Sunday, two paramedics emerged from the apartment building with Ms. Williams’s two other children, both girls. They were in pajamas and seemed unstartled by the activity swirling around them: the police, the news cameras.David Stewart, 34, a congregant at a nearby Pentecostal church attended by the family, said he was in shock.“She was a full-time mother,” Mr. Stewart said. “She was a very good mother. She did take good care of them. I know that. She took care of them.”1138 2008-10-27 The American Ted Ligety, the World Cup giant slalom champion, finished third in the season-opening race behind Daniel Albrecht and Didier Cuche on the icy Rettenbach course in Sölden, Austria.

Ms. Palin wore a pale pink jacket on Sunday, a departure from the designer suits she has worn on the campaign trail since she was chosen as the Republican vice-presidential nominee.Perhaps to emphasize her frugal tastes, Ms. Palin added that she was wearing beaded earrings handmade by her mother-in-law; a $35 wedding ring from Hawaii that she had bought herself; and a flag pin, which she wears in honor of her son Track, who is stationed in Iraq.Senator John McCain, in an appearance Sunday on “Meet the Press” on NBC, was asked about the episode, which Tom Brokaw, the host, suggested was “a colossal mistake.”“Look, she lives a frugal life,” Mr. McCain said. “She and her family are not wealthy. She and her family were thrust into this, and there was some — and some third of that money is given back. The rest will be donated to charity.”Tracey Schmitt, a spokeswoman for Ms. Palin, said Sunday that a third of the clothes were returned right after the convention.Ms. Palin may have been spurred on by a fiery introduction from the talk-show host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who accompanied her on the campaign trail in Florida.“Instead of the issues, they are focused, fixated on her wardrobe,” Ms. Hasselbeck said of the news media, drawing loud cheers from the crowd. “Now, with everything going on in the world, seems a bit odd. But let me tell you, this is deliberately sexist. I know you know that.”After taking the microphone, Ms. Palin hinted that she agreed with Ms. Hasselbeck.“The double standard here,” she said. “Gosh, we don’t even want to waste our time.”1142 2008-10-27 WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Sunday dismissed one of the jurors in the trial of Senator Ted Stevens after losing contact with her after her father’s death.Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of Federal District Court plans to seat an alternate juror on Monday morning and to order the jury to start their deliberations from the beginning. The move was a setback to Mr. Stevens, Republican of Alaska, who is trying to hold onto his seat and wanted a verdict before Election Day.“I think we’ve been more than reasonable,” said Judge Sullivan, adding that court officials had not spoken with the juror since Friday despite repeated efforts to contact her.Mr. Stevens, who has been in the Senate since 1968 and is now its longest-serving Republican, is charged with lying on Senate financial disclosure documents to conceal $250,000 in home renovations and other gifts from a friend, Bill Allen, a millionaire oil contractor. Mr. Stevens has maintained his innocence.A defense lawyer, Robert Cary, had asked Judge Sullivan to delay his decision until noon Monday in case there was a reason the juror had not contacted the court. “She may be on her way back,” Mr. Cary said.But Judge Sullivan said court officials had repeatedly tried to contact the juror. “She has, for whatever reason, chosen not to communicate further with the court,” he said.1143 2008-10-27 Republican charges of fraud — and Democratic charges of disenfranchisement — are not new. What is different this year is the degree of skirmishing, and the flurry of lawsuits, in advance of the election.This is partly a legacy of Florida in 2000, when it became clear just how much the administration of elections could influence the outcome. That could be true again this year, when high voter turnout is expected to put an extra strain on the system and the tallies in some states could be extremely close.“It is definitely happening earlier and with far more ferocity than we’ve ever seen,” said Jonah Goldman, a lawyer with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights.Voting rights advocates say the Republicans’ accusations of fraud (even though party operatives themselves face possible charges of fraud, most notably in California) are part of a deliberate strategy to create confusion among voters, to galvanize the conservative base and to set the table for possible legal challenges of voters at the polls and of the election results.“There is a real concern that the courts will be asked once again to weigh in on tight races where the losing party may seek to raise real questions about the legitimacy of the vote,” said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of national civil rights and advocacy groups. “You can’t help but conclude that this is an effort to lay a foundation for a subsequent challenge to an Obama victory, should it occur.”There has been ineptness at the polls — an elections official in Mississippi wrongly purged 10,000 voters from the rolls in March while using her home computer — as well as dubious interpretations of state laws, including the “no match, no vote” laws, which require a voter’s registration information to match precisely that of government documents.“There’s always been a struggle, throughout the country’s history, over who could vote, how their votes would be counted,” said Michael Waldman, executive director of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, “and this is not that different, but it does seem more strategic this year. The same arguments are being made all over the country at the same time.”Robert F. Bauer, who is general counsel for the Obama campaign and is overseeing its voter protection program, said that what was different this year was “the very aggressive involvement of the top of the ticket in promoting this fear message.” Mr. Bauer said this was intended to create “an ominous atmosphere” to discourage people from voting.“I don’t recall in recent history,” he added, “a presidential candidate before the fact trying to suggest in a nationally televised debate that the entire electoral system was under assault, the fabric of democracy was at risk.”Mr. McCain’s campaign manager, Rick Davis, said in mid-October that the activities of Acorn had already put the election under a “cloud of suspicion.”Republicans have also been invoking the Florida debacle in 2000, a scene that could help galvanize their base. Ken Blackwell, a Republican who is a former secretary of state in Ohio, has warned, for example, that voters should expect “the kind of chaos you expect from a Category 5 hurricane, with radical groups sending the nation into a protracted legal battle even worse than the mess back in 2000.”A McCain campaign spokesman, Tucker Bounds, said the fraud was real. “When the F.B.I. is raiding Acorn offices and Mickey Mouse becomes a registered voter, it’s not an accusation — it’s a certifiable problem,” Mr. Bounds said. “Barack Obama should stop with the half-cocked accusations and take action to curb the illicit activity.""Mr. Goldman said his concern with what he called pre-election hysteria was that it “ripens the climate for challenges” by undermining confidence in an already-vulnerable election system, one with incomplete voter rolls, long lines, misinformation and unreliable machines.Richard L. Hasen, a professor specializing in election law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said the Republicans were intentionally trying to foster an atmosphere of mistrust. “If you can convince the public and election officials that there’s a lot of fraud in the voter rolls,” Dr. Hasen said, “that’s a reason to purge the lists and mount challenges on Election Day. Where you see claims about Acorn being raised is in battleground states.”Alexander Keyssar, a voting expert at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the author of “The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States,” suggested another possible strategic reason for Mr. McCain’s comments: an effort to “reinforce an image of the Democrats, or at least some Democrats, as the party that, A, will steal elections, and B, will steal elections by somehow mobilizing this threatening nameless mass of people who are ‘other,’ ” a reference to the mostly minority and low-income people registered in drives like Acorn’s.Longer term, he said, the creating of a sense of chaos now could help “set the groundwork for more laws and procedural obstacles” to be enacted by the states before the next presidential election. He said several were already considering laws similar to one in Indiana that required voters to present a government-issued photo ID.The Justice Department has opened a nationwide investigation into charges of fraud against Acorn. But some former lawyers for the department warned on Friday in a letter to Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey that the probe might violate department policy of not initiating such investigations until after an election, citing the “long recognized sensitivity to the role of federal law enforcement officials in elections.”Acorn said that of its faulty registrations, 20 percent to 25 percent were probably the result of duplications, 5 percent were incomplete and 1 percent to 1.5 percent were fraudulent.Voting rights advocates say that there is no correlation between fraudulent registrations and fraudulent voting and that past elections have shown little evidence of actual voter fraud. While it does occur, they say, it is hardly rampant.After the 2004 election in Ohio, for example, the Brennan Center found a voter fraud rate of .00004 of a percent, saying, “Americans are struck and killed by lightning about as often.”But Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday again called for hearings into “the allegations of systematic nationwide registration fraud” by Acorn. They said registration fraud “makes it possible to commit vote fraud in a way that is almost completely undetectable.”In the letter, the Republicans rejected the idea that they were trying “to create a panic in the electorate” by raising such concerns.1144 2008-10-27 Microsoft feared that the farmers, who live about two hours outside Bangalore, would ignore the training advice unless it could prove a quick, valuable return. And so, one set of videos centers on azolla, which can cover the top of a water tank in about a week and lead to much higher milk production from cows.Within four months, Microsoft will spin off Digital Green as an independent nongovernmental organization. Rikin Gandhi, a computer scientist, plans to leave Microsoft to oversee the organization, which will champion the Digital Green methods throughout South Asia and Africa.Microsoft is also extending the Digital Green ideas through another effort called Featherweight Computing, in which it is experimenting with electronic posters and cards that can be sent to farmers. These products include pictures and audio to remind farmers about techniques learned through the videos.A somewhat similar project, Warana Unwired, sought to give members of farming cooperatives fast, simple ways to update records and receive pricing data on crops. A network of about 55 villages had been relying on PCs to collect information about fertilizer purchases, water bills and inventory. The PCs, however, often broke down or were unavailable. To work around these issues, Microsoft turned one PC, which could be properly managed, into a hub for collecting short messages sent via cellphones.“If you want to register your land, a farmer just types in ‘reg,’ the identification number of the farm, the season and how large of a plot he wants,” said Rajesh Veeraraghavan, who was a Microsoft researcher before he left to earn a doctorate in information communications for developing areas. The cellphone system proved cheaper to run and gave farmers near-instant access to their information.Other Microsoft research products cater more toward the company’s traditional strengths. Software that Microsoft calls MultiPoint lets numerous mice connect to a computer, allowing several students to interact with a machine at the same time. Children can play games where they hear a word and then compete to identify the text on a screen to the matching sound.“I have not yet seen a situation where there is one PC per child,” Mr. Toyama said. “Children are usually lined up three deep behind a computer and you see them crawling all over each other. This technology provides a different level of engagement.”Studies run by Microsoft have shown that students learn just as well through the shared approach as they do on their own machines. Although girls, who tend to cooperate to find the information, scored better than boys, who rushed to click without really learning. “For the boys, we’ll have to think more about how the software is designed,” Mr. Toyama said.Mr. Toyama acknowledges his group is afforded a certain amount of luxury in dabbling in areas that are interesting “purely because they extend the reach of technology.” Whether or not the work results in a Microsoft product matters less than forming ties with governments and understanding various people and regions. “In the very long term, what makes a difference to Microsoft’s stock price is the global economy,” he said. “Continuing the growth of that overall economy helps out our business.”If technology like MultiPoint proves compelling, Microsoft’s Unlimited Potential group, a more formal organization directing technology to poor people, will try to incorporate it in commercial products.“It’s real easy for people to get a bunch of money and install a satellite link for schools,” said James Utzschneider, general manager of Unlimited Potential, “but unless you can find ways to pay bills on an ongoing basis, you just end up with this weird thing on top of a building.”Luis Anavitarte, an analyst at Gartner, credits Microsoft with taking the right approach to these markets by relying on its creativity. “But, ultimately, the local governments have to be committed to these projects for them to work,” he added.In the end, Microsoft’s best intentions may not satisfy what locals want. The company surveyed 8,000 people in emerging markets and found their most pressing needs for technology often revolved around entertainment and surfing the Internet.“It reinforced for us that the emerging middle classes are sort of like the middle classes here except they don’t have as much money,” Mr. Toyama said. “It’s sometimes easy for us to get caught up in things and forget we are serving the needs of real people.”1145 2008-10-27 With Mr. Obama’s plan, business leaders say, the devil will be in the unknown details.Mr. Obama would prohibit insurers from rejecting applicants because of medical conditions, require health insurance for children and create a new federal health plan to provide comprehensive coverage to the uninsured. Those beneath certain income levels would be granted tax credits to make premiums affordable, and small businesses would be offered tax credits to provide benefits.The tax credits are projected to cost at least $110 billion. Mr. Obama has said he would pay for it primarily by raising income taxes on those making more than $250,000 and by reducing health spending. But when he announced the plan in May 2007, he emphasized that employers would share in the cost.“We will ask all but the smallest businesses who don’t make a meaningful contribution today to the health coverage of their employees to do so by supporting this new plan,” he said.Left undefined has been what size firms would be exempted, what constitutes a “meaningful contribution,” and how much noncompliant businesses would be required to pay. Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, badgered Mr. Obama in two of their debates to define the penalty, but Mr. Obama did not rise to the bait.“We made a decision even before the plan was rolled out not to decide,” said David M. Cutler, a Harvard economist who speaks for the campaign on health care. “It’s not that there’s a decision out there that we’re not telling. It’s literally that we’ve decided not to decide.”That may be smart politics. But it makes business groups nervous that Mr. Obama might impose an unmanageable burden. They also worry that any time his health plan faces a shortfall, businesses will be asked to up their ante, as has happened in Massachusetts.“Play-or-pay can become a blank check to an already overcapitalized health care system,” said Helen B. Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, which represents 300 companies.Business groups also have concerns that Mr. McCain’s plan to change the tax treatment of health benefits would erode employer-sponsored insurance.Mr. Cutler said the Obama campaign regarded play-or-pay less “as a revenue raiser” than as a way of “leveling the playing field.” It would hold accountable those employers whose uninsured workers might seek treatment in emergency rooms or enroll in government insurance plans, with costs subsidized by others through higher premiums and taxes. Mr. Cutler said the expense to businesses would be offset by savings from Mr. Obama’s proposals to reduce health spending, though that is an uncertain prospect.Several econometric models have assumed that Mr. Obama would have to set his penalty near 6 percent of payroll (Mercer, a benefits consulting firm says that large employers typically pay 15 percent). Recent play-or-pay proposals in California and Pennsylvania put the figure at 3 or 4 percent, and both failed in part because of business opposition.Hawaii is the only state that requires employers to provide health benefits, while Vermont, like Massachusetts, gently fines those who do not. Several other states have enacted similar laws over the last two decades, but they have been repealed, rejected by voters or challenged in court.Economists believe the cost of health benefits is ultimately shifted to employees through lower wages. When wages cannot be lowered, layoffs may result. Katherine Baicker of Harvard and Helen G. Levy of the University of Michigan have projected that play-or-pay might push 224,000 workers into that category.When negotiating their health plan, Massachusetts lawmakers rejected a payroll tax and instead set a “fair share contribution” that was low enough to appease businesses. The amount also was kept low to steer clear of the 1974 federal law prohibiting states from regulating multistate group insurance plans. Companies with 10 or fewer full-time equivalent employees were exempted.State officials hoped the penalty would generate a little revenue, but recognized it was not likely to prompt employers to start offering coverage. It raised only $7.7 million in its first year, well under projections. So when a substantial budget gap opened in the $869 million health plan this year, Gov. Deval Patrick asked businesses to help fill the hole.He compromised on a revised formula that is projected to bring in $30 million by increasing the number and average size of firms that will be penalized. The state expects 1,100 businesses to be fined, up from 855, or about 3 percent of eligible companies.The deal left business leaders satisfied for the moment. They recognize that the $295 penalty is a fraction of the $4,000 that Massachusetts employers spend to insure an individual worker.But businesses worry the state will raise their obligation each year. They argue they have already absorbed costs of insuring 159,000 workers with group coverage since the state began mandating insurance (a total of 439,000 have enrolled, giving the state the country’s highest insurance rate).“You want the system to work,” said Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts. “You just want to make sure there isn’t more cost-shifting to businesses because they are paying their fair share.”State officials are gratified that — contrary to national trends — the share of employers offering health benefits has increased slightly. One fear about play-or-pay is that if the penalty is too low employers will stop offering coverage and pay the fines instead, shifting workers to government insurance programs.But leaders here also are sensitive to the possibility that further increases in the penalty might stymie wage and job growth.“In this day and age,” said Dr. JudyAnn Bigby, the state secretary of health and human services, “it wouldn’t take much of a change in policy to push some entities over the brink.”1146 2008-10-27 Globally, banks have posted losses and write-downs totaling $681 billion since the start of the credit crisis, according to Bloomberg News.So far the damage in the Middle East has been limited. But any large losses in the region could require governments to bail out their own lenders and dash hopes that so-called sovereign wealth funds from the region would be able to help rescue troubled institutions in the West.In Saudi Arabia, always on guard against potential unrest, King Abdullah said that 10 billion riyals, or $2.7 billion, would be placed in an account in the Saudi Bank of Credit and Saving to enable the bank to help hundreds of thousands of citizens obtain loans for family needs, including marriages and home repairs.On Saturday, finance ministers from the Gulf Cooperation Council and central bankers met in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, to discuss a more coordinated response to the crisis. In a statement, officials “underlined their confidence in the stability of the monetary system in their countries,” and said their economies should continue to grow. In addition to Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Cooperation Council includes Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and United Arab Emirates.In Kuwait, the central bank also said it was moving toward guaranteeing deposits at local banks. Many other countries have already taken that step, putting lenders in countries with no guarantee at a disadvantage.Gulf Bank’s chief executive, Louis J. Myers, said the loss would have “no major effects on the soundness of the bank’s financial position, and will not affect its ability to continue business.”Fawzy al-Thunayan, a spokesman for Gulf Bank, said Sunday that the loss was incurred by a Kuwaiti company on a “complicated currency derivative,” essentially a bet on the euro. “The position worsened in the last 10 days as the euro dived against the dollar,” he added, but the customer had been unable or unwilling to make good its losses.The bank will not comment on the amount of the loss “until the position is completely closed,” he said, and trading in Gulf Bank will remain suspended until the affair is settled. Ibrahim Dabdoub, chief executive of the rival National Bank of Kuwait, told Al Arabiya television that the losses were as much as 200 million dinars, or nearly $750 million.The crisis could hurt the gulf states in other ways. KPMG International, the accounting firm, warned last week that financial fraud in the region could run into the billions of dollars a year. Colin Lobo, a KPMG partner, said the financial crisis was creating an environment “where the risk of fraud will increase as businesses come under pressure to show results. Likewise, individuals will also be tempted where costs are rising and income levels are flat.”Stocks in the region are off about 40 percent this year.1147 2008-10-27 By most estimates, teenagers and young adults have abandoned radio listening in droves over the last decade. Teenagers on average spent three fewer hours listing to the radio in 2007 than they did in 1998, according to the radio ratings company Arbitron, and listening had declined more steeply among adults 18 to 24.Arbitron has not published comparable numbers for 2008, but a new study by a media research firm suggests that the trend is changing. The firm, Paragon Media Strategies, reports that 14- to 24-year-olds mostly say their radio listening has increased over the last year or two, while they said the opposite last year. Paragon recruited the respondents and conducted the study online.“Radio stations may be doing a better job at connecting with those people,” said Larry Johnson, the study’s author. “The music may also simply be more interesting. There tends to be a cycle.”The study suggests that portable MP3 players are not as dangerous to radio as they once were thought to be. Those surveyed had roughly the same median number of songs on their devices as last year (about 400), and fewer respondents said the MP3 and other devices cut their radio listening time.

Negotiations, which were held only briefly during the strike, resumed last week in Washington, D.C. with assistance from a federal mediator.The union told members it would release full details on its Web site on Tuesday, but said the new contract would limit the amount of work that outside companies can perform in Boeing plants, an important union demand. The tentative agreement also is a year longer than the machinists’ previous pact.1170 2008-10-28 The McCain campaign and Republicans on Monday seized on a seven-year-old interview that Senator Barack Obama gave about the courts and civil rights, contending it provided further evidence of Mr. Obama’s extremist economic positions.Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee, pounced on the interview, which Mr. Obama gave on Chicago Public Radio in 2001.At a rally in Dayton, Ohio, Mr. McCain said the interview showed that Mr. Obama “believes in redistributing wealth, not in policies that grow our economy and create jobs.” In doing so, Mr. McCain continued to strike a campaign theme that began with an exchange that Mr. Obama had with “Joe the Plumber” on Oct. 12 about taxes.The interview with Mr. Obama, which made the rounds on conservative Web sites in an edited form on Monday and was posted on YouTube, probed his views on the civil rights-era Supreme Court. At the time, Mr. Obama was a state senator and professor at the University of Chicago Law School. He said the Warren Court, as it was known, “never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth.”Further into the interview, Mr. Obama seemed to lament that the civil rights movement became intensively battled in the courts and never took the grassroots steps to achieve “redistributive change.”1171 2008-10-28 CenturyTel, a provider of local phone and Internet services, agreed on Monday to buy Embarq, its larger rival and a spinoff from Sprint Nextel, for about $5.76 billion in stock, in one of the first significant nonfinancial mergers since the onset of the recent market turbulence.The deal successfully ends efforts by Embarq to sell itself. CenturyTel’s offer of 1.37 shares for each Embarq share represented a 36 percent premium over Friday’s closing price of $40.42, the companies said.“We expect that bringing Embarq and CenturyTel together will accelerate both companies’ strategic plans, diversify our revenues and provide us with the expanded networks, expertise and financial resources to build long-term value for shareholders,” Glen F. Post III, CenturyTel’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement Monday.Embarq, which runs the original landline services of Sprint Nextel, hired JPMorgan Chase and put itself up for sale at perhaps the worst possible time, September, amid the financial crisis. Faced with the shriveling of the debt markets, which made deal financing virtually unobtainable, CenturyTel decided to make an all-stock bid.Shares in CenturyTel fell 13.2 percent to $25.62 on Monday, making the deal worth about $5 billion at the closing price. Including Embarq’s $5.8 billion in debt, the merger is valued at nearly $11 billion.1172 2008-10-28 Pensions are still largely state-dependent, not 401(k)-style investment accounts. Even when it comes to the British, who look more like Americans in terms of credit card debt and mortgage exposure, only about 20 percent of them have invested in the market.But history teaches Europeans that situations can go from bad to perilous in no time, and there is a long tradition of burying the family’s treasures in troubled times.Today, tales of people taking money out of banks to keep it somewhere else are circulating in Paris bistros and London pubs. Companies selling or renting safes are reporting an increase in demand, though hard numbers are difficult to establish.“History matters. In times of crisis you really get to know a country and its people,” said Toni Pierenkemper, a professor of economic history at the University of Cologne. “Traumatic events are seared into the collective consciousness and often survive into the next generations.”Germany, where many people lost their savings twice in the 20th century, is one of the richest laboratories of European historical scars — welts that help explain the country’s fears of inflation and its interest in maintaining a complex public-private banking system.The network of 446 publicly owned savings banks, which have been guaranteeing their deposits for three decades, have proved popular in recent weeks as nervous Germans moved part of their savings onto their books.Even more striking, an overwhelming surge in the demand for gold has forced several Internet sites and gold vendors to temporarily shut down their sales operations.“I’ve never seen anything like this. We’re basically sold out until the end of the year,” said Robert Hartmann, co-founder of ProAurum, a gold vendor based in Munich.Despite the shortages, about 200 customers line up at his counter every day, he said, asking for coins and bars, not certificates. According to his estimates, “only about 5 percent of German investors” are interested in converting a small part of their savings to gold, “but it’s enough to put suppliers under strain.”Mr. Heinz, the financial adviser, started diversifying his investments in the run-up to the 1992 recession. He has bought land and gradually built up a stock of gold, which he buys in small units, suitable as emergency payment, and keeps in a safe at a specialized company.He still remembers the stories his grandfather told of a suitcase full of bank notes buying no more than a loaf of bread during hyperinflation in 1923 Germany. He also remembers the currency changes of 1948 that again wiped out savings.Some of his clients share his fears.He tells of one who dropped a vacuum-sealed sack filled with gold and silver to the bed of a lake, in case the government were to levy an additional tax on wealth or try to ban households from owning gold. Another has buried his riches in a forest. All of them think that it is just a matter of time until another wave of inflation erodes the value of money.In France, gold sales have also increased, but people are more trusting of the government.The entire French banking system was state-owned as recently as 1987, and the state has played a prominent role in the economy since the days of Louis XIV.In contrast to the unease and suspicion among most Americans about the government’s taking stakes in distressed financial institutions, many people in France feel comforted — even vindicated — in their belief that the state has a responsibility to look after the economy.“We nationalize, we denationalize and we re-nationalize. That’s the way it goes in France,” quipped Bernard Candiard, director-general of Crédit Municipal de Paris, a 231-year-old pawnshop that is doing brisk business these days and is a state monopoly.“Today we are again in the process of nationalizing banks,” Mr. Candiard said. “It’s a sign to the people. The government wants to give them confidence. And confidence in France is the state. We have a different tradition from America.”In Eastern Europe, where people were hardened by modest living standards under communism, the trust in government is more limited.In Bulgaria, for example, more people are looking at moving their money to Western European banks that offer an unlimited deposit guarantee, said Adriana Alexandrova, a financial executive at the TV2 television station in Sofia.“There is a great lack of confidence in the banks and in the government,” said Ms. Alexandrova, whose parents had to close their pharmacy business after several Bulgarian banks collapsed in the mid-1990s. “Several of my friends have moved their money to safes.”The phrase “he likes gardening” has a double meaning in Bulgaria, she added. “Under communism it mainly meant people preparing jars of pickled vegetables to get them through the winter. These days, it mainly means someone is hiding money in their garden or under their pillow.”1173 2008-10-28 It is now known, for example, that even small blood-sugar abnormalities can cause trouble.A seven-year international study directed by Dr. Metzger, which was released last year at the American Diabetes Association’s annual meeting and published in May in The New England Journal of Medicine, showed clear links between blood sugar levels and pregnancy outcomes, even when the mother’s sugar levels are not high enough to be called diabetes.The study, which followed the pregnancies of more than 23,000 nondiabetic women, revealed that as blood sugar levels increased during pregnancy, the risk of having a baby too large to be born vaginally rose too, as did the baby’s chances of being born with low blood sugar and high levels of insulin.“At levels well below what we would consider to be diabetes, we’re seeing morbidity,” reported Dr. Robert Ratner of the Georgetown University Medical School in Washington.The study found a continuous increase in risk as the mothers’ blood sugar levels rose, with no cutoff point below which the risks were minimal.Gestational diabetes, which affects about 4 percent of pregnant women, usually occurs midpregnancy, by the 28th week of gestation. Though its causes are unclear, there are some clues, namely placental hormones that suppress the action of insulin in the mother. This can result in insulin resistance: the mother’s pancreas continues to spew out insulin but her body’s cells fail to use it properly to process blood sugar, causing sugar levels to rise in the mother’s blood.This extra sugar, though not the mother’s insulin, crosses the placenta and raises the baby’s blood sugar level, giving the baby more energy than it needs to grow normally. The result is macrosomia, a “fat” baby often too big to be born naturally without injury to the baby, mother or both.The baby’s pancreas, stimulated by sugar from the mother, may produce extra insulin, resulting in low blood sugar at birth and an increased risk of breathing problems. These babies are also more likely to become obese children and diabetic adults.In addition to an added risk of diabetes later in life, a woman with gestational diabetes can develop high blood pressure during pregnancy and may need a Caesarean section to deliver an overly large baby.Women are at higher than average risk of gestational diabetes if they are overweight, older than 25, have a strong family history of diabetes, have had gestational diabetes during a prior pregnancy, have previously given birth to a baby weighing nine or more pounds, or have been told they are “prediabetic” with blood sugar levels higher than normal. The risk is greater in African-American, Asian and Hispanic women than in Caucasians.A pregnant woman is unlikely to know her blood sugar is running high unless she is tested. For those with risk factors, a screening test for blood sugar should be done at the first prenatal visit, Dr. Metzger said.Women not at high risk for gestational diabetes should be tested between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy. In this screening test, now routine in prenatal care, the woman swallows a concentrated solution of glucose, and her blood sugar is measured an hour later.If the result is abnormal, a fasting test for blood sugar is next. After about 14 hours of no food or drink other than sips of water, the woman is given another dose of glucose, and her blood levels are measured hourly for three hours. If those levels are abnormal on two or three measurements, the woman is said to have gestational diabetes, though some doctors think even one abnormal level is a bad sign.The treatment goal, as Ms. Bloustein was told, is to maintain a normal blood sugar level, and to keep the level as even as possible throughout the day.The woman should follow a sensible meal plan consisting of three small, well-spaced meals and up to three snacks each day, and limit sweets and refined starches. She must know when and how much carbohydrate-rich food to consume, and her diet should include fiber-rich vegetables, fruits, dried beans and peas, and whole grains.Regular physical exercise is also important. Daily walking and swimming are especially good in pregnancy.If such self-help measures do not normalize blood sugar, the woman may also require insulin, which she can inject herself. In some cases, an oral medication, metformin, may be prescribed with or without insulin.To be sure blood sugar levels stay on target, a woman should test herself via a finger prick and blood glucose monitor at regular times: when she wakes up, before meals, and an hour or two after meals. According to the National Institutes of Health, desirable blood sugar targets are 95 or less upon awakening, 140 or less an hour after meals, and 120 or less two hours after meals.In 6 to 12 weeks after giving birth, a woman who has had gestational diabetes should be retested. And she should keep her own — and her child’s — weight down and be tested periodically for signs of diabetes as she ages.1174 2008-10-28 Polio infections are increasing and spreading to new countries, according to case counts recently released by the World Health Organization.Since April, outbreaks have been found in 10 countries beyond the 4 in which polio is considered endemic — Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. And in those four countries, the number of cases is more than double the number found by this time in 2007.In Africa, cases have been found as far south as Angola and as far east as Ethiopia. Each detected case implies another 200 cases with few or no symptoms, experts say.There have been outbreaks of both type 1 and type 3 polio, which frustrate W.H.O. plans, begun in 2005, to concentrate on a monovalent vaccine against type 1. Recent studies show that vaccine to be far more effective against type 1 than the old trivalent vaccine was. But it does not protect against type 3, and a new monovalent vaccine against that is being introduced. (Type 2 was eliminated in 1999.)Pakistan, which has seen a rapid rise in cases, now has 86,000 vaccination teams going house to house and dosing children at train stations and border crossings. But tribal areas on the Afghan border and contiguous parts of Afghanistan are barely covered because travel is unsafe for vaccinators.The Indian Academy of Pediatrics has endorsed adding injectable vaccine as a backup for those who can afford it, because it can protect children whose oral doses are eliminated by diarrhea.1175 2008-10-28 It is the fact that millions of people have lost their life savings and/or homes and face a dismal future, and the fact that nobody in the modern Republican Party has anything to offer them but demagogy, moralizing or pseudo-philosophical blather.I agree with David Brooks when he writes that John McCain “would be an outstanding president.” But I thought that in 2000. Unfortunately, during the Republican primaries that year, he was pushed aside by the far right, which favored George W. Bush.One can’t help but wonder how much better off our country would be now if John McCain had gotten the nomination then. But now it’s time for Barack Obama to clean up this mess.Frank Rich (“In Defense of White Americans,” column, Oct. 26) provides a compelling analysis of why racially divisive political tactics have failed in 2008, but when he says “there are not and have never been enough racists in 2008 to flip this election,” he misses an important point.Studies using the Implicit Association Test have amply demonstrated that most of us, regardless of our conscious views, harbor unconscious biases against other racial groups.Racially charged tactics in the “Willie Horton” vein aim not to mobilize unrepentant racists, but to manipulate the rest of us — decent people with a strong belief in racial equality — by tapping into these unconscious attitudes.This is a far more insidious tactic, but fortunately, when the racial subtext of those messages is made explicit and our better angels are free to act, we recoil from the implicit racism.The writers are, respectively, associate director of the Center for Social Inclusion and project director, StopDogWhistleRacism.com.Maureen Dowd was too kind to the Republican leadership. When it gets right down to it, it is the party of the “Valentino” dress set. The leaders of the Republican Party can’t really think like the average working person because in their political world only the rich matter.They couldn’t conceive of buying a dress at J. C. Penney or Target. For the Republican leaders, the average working person is the person they have to fool with divisive issues, fear tactics, misleading comments about Democrats and outright lies to get their vote.In using an argument from the feminist Bella Abzug, Judith Warner suggests that the nomination of Sarah Palin shows that women have arrived. A mediocre woman is doing “just as well as the most mediocre of men.”To me, the most important legacy of Sarah Palin’s nomination could be that conservatives, especially conservative men, have found it perfectly acceptable, indeed praiseworthy, for women with young children to combine motherhood and careers and for husbands to share child-rearing.This acceptability is something that feminists have been struggling for since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Unfortunately, Ms. Palin has not embraced policies that would help the average Jane be able to successfully combine work and motherhood.Favorable taxes allowed my company to keep more money, so we recently hired seven people, bringing us to 12. Our employees professionally hone skills creating, servicing and deploying our inventions to global clients.Demand for our products and services, not government programs, allowed us to create these jobs. Politicians make wild claims of creating jobs, but who among us doesn’t understand that taxes, markets and customers mostly determine a company’s future?Taking money from our growing business will limit our ability to create jobs, as it will for others in America. Giving money away, to share the wealth, destroys initiative for lower skilled workers to become higher skilled and gain access to better jobs.If The One is elected, won’t this damage the very ones he claims to help by risking their American dream? While The One may be proud to do so, shouldn’t we all be beyond such economic arrogance by now? Cliff Johns“Blue State Blues,” by Gail Collins (column, Oct. 26), resonated with me.Here in Sherman, Tex. (an hour north of Dallas), almost everyone will vote Republican, even the Democratic husband of my Republican hair-dresser, because he likes the fact that Sarah Palin hunts moose.While it was thrilling to have both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama visit Dallas during the primaries, all is quiet now, and the only excitement these days is the continuing theft of Obama-Biden yard signs by Republican rowdies no doubt hoping to intimidate the relatively few Democrats around here.So many local elections are uncontested that I’ve thought of running myself just to be a Democratic placeholder — not that I would have to worry about winning or actually holding office. Now that Barack Obama is winning over formerly Republican states, perhaps he’d be willing to tackle Texas? We’d love to see him again! Marsha B. McCoy1176 2008-10-28 The National Endowment for the Arts announced its selections for its N.E.A. New Play Development Program on Monday. The two productions chosen as N.E.A. Outstanding New American Plays (which receive grants of $90,000 each) are “Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,” by Rajiv Joseph, which the Center Theater Group in Los Angeles will produce as part of its 2009 season, and Tarell Alvin McCraney’s trilogy, “The Brother/Sister Plays,” which the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., will produce for its 2008-9 season. Five productions were designated as N.E.A. Distinguished New Play Development Projects (accompanied by $20,000 grants), including two at New York theaters: the Lark Play Development Center’s production of “Agnes Under the Big Top, a Fairy Tale,” by Aditi Brennan Kapil, and the Foundry Theater’s “Detour/South Bronx,” by Claudia Rankine.1177 2008-10-28 MOSCOW — President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia on Monday dismissed his prime minister, in the first significant shake-up of his government since the Russia-Georgia war nearly three months ago.The departing prime minister, Lado Gurgenidze, 37, had been in his position for less than a year. A former commercial bank chief, he was seen as a persuasive voice for Georgia as it sought to attract Western investment. He returned last week from a donors’ conference in Brussels, where he accepted pledges of more than $4.5 billion to rebuild Georgia.Mr. Saakashvili replaced Mr. Gurgenidze with a little-known diplomat, Grigol Mgaloblishvili, 35, who has served for four years as Georgia’s ambassador to Turkey.Mr. Saakashvili also said he would propose a new cabinet for parliamentary approval in the coming days. He said that his cabinet “mainly worked well” during the military crisis and that the government shake-up would not be radical. But he said a new team was necessary to face the threat posed by Russia, which has built up its military presence in the enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, among other challenges.“Existential threat hangs over Georgia like a Damocles’ sword,” Mr. Saakashvili said in a meeting with parliamentary leaders. “New radical democratic reforms and liberalization are the only response to the challenges — I do not have any other recipe to offer to the new government.”Political insiders said the announcement was not unexpected. Mr. Saakashvili has faced scrutiny from both inside and outside Georgia since the war, which caused a confrontation between Russia and the West more tense than anything seen since the cold war.1178 2008-10-28 The new Microsoft “cloud OS” — called Azure — gives Microsoft an opening.But many of the giant software company’s competitors believe it is unlikely that Microsoft will be able to maintain its advantage either in market share or profitability in the future.“Today’s announcement of Azure is the same Microsoft, keeping developers locked into their proprietary solutions, and failing to grasp the true power of cloud computing,“ said Mark Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com, a San Francisco company that helped pioneer the commercial Web services market. “Microsoft continues to struggle with what to do about cloud computing because the cloud’s new technology and business models cuts into the heart of their software monopoly.”Nevertheless, Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., declared a third era of operating systems in the hope that it will be able to repeat the success it had with its DOS and Windows operating systems of the 1980s and 1990s.Azure was designed during the last three years by Ray Ozzie, a software designer whose company, Groove Networks, was acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Mr. Ozzie began taking the reins from Bill Gates as the company’s principal software architect in 2006.Before an audience of 6,500 software developers, Mr. Ozzie tried to make the case that programmers who miss a shift to a new Microsoft operating platform are taking a huge risk.Speaking as a software developer who had frequently sat in the audience at similar Microsoft events as a customer, Mr. Ozzie said: “Every time there is a major platform shift in our industry, it has turned into new opportunities for my apps and my business.”His comment was a clear reference to an earlier juncture in the history of the computer industry, when companies like Lotus Development, where Mr. Ozzie worked, were late to adopt the first generation of the Windows operating system. That shift gave the Windows Office suite a significant advantage and helped Microsoft dominate word processing, spreadsheet and other office software.While Microsoft’s software business for corporations continues its robust growth, there are increasing questions about whether the company will be able to strengthen its desktop computing business in an era that is increasingly defined by free or advertising-supported Internet services.Microsoft would use Azure to harmonize traditional proprietary software with a new set of tools based on Internet standards that are widely used to generate the most popular Web services. “This is the first time they are showing all the pieces coming together,” said Peter O’Kelly, a computer industry consultant based in Andover, Mass.Although Microsoft will not release a commercial version of Azure for a year or more, Mr. O’Kelly said that components of the system like Live Services were already being used by millions of PC users.Microsoft gave only one significant demonstration of the kind of applications made possible with its new system. Sentient Software showed a mobile social-networking application called Bluehoo. The company said that Azure would make it easier to expand the service by using computing resources provided by Microsoft.On Tuesday, Microsoft is expected to give its first lengthy demonstration of its Windows 7 desktop operating system, which is intended to rejuvenate the company’s sputtering consumer business. Microsoft has also hinted that it would show off Web versions of several of its Office applications for the first time.1179 2008-10-28 Ms. Merkel’s squabbling coalition of conservatives and Social Democrats is torn, however, on its response, with some advocating adopting populist measures, like cutting taxes, and others favoring a focus on strategic investments that would prevent job losses.Ms. Merkel and the finance minister, Peer Steinbrück, who is a Social Democrat, believe tax reductions would not lead to more consumer spending, but would instead be put into savings as people fear for their jobs. They prefer to focus aid on the manufacturing and construction sector to prevent job losses. A working group is already looking at ways to bolster building renovation work as well as infrastructure projects, but details and costs have not yet been finalized.Mr. Steinbrück, who is credited with bringing Germany’s budget deficit back in line with European Union rules in recent years, is making a big push to win backing for his strategy before the government introduces its economic growth package next week.But the economy ministry, led by Michael Glos, a conservative, favors tax cuts as well as making health insurance contributions tax-deductible which Mr. Steinbrück and Ms. Merkel strongly oppose. Mr. Steinbrück said such measures were “1980s recipes.”Ifo’s October data for manufacturing was especially pessimistic. The manufacturing index worsened from -11.7 to -18.9, largely because of expectations for the next six months.Already, several car manufacturers and other important sectors of the economy are reporting losses or sharp falls in sales as exports plummet and domestic consumer demand shows no signs of lifting.Volkswagen is cutting production at its Seat plant in Spain and its Skoda plant in the Czech Republic. Opel, a division of General Motors, announced it would also reduce output and the luxury carmakers, Daimler and BMW said over the weekend that they would temporarily close factories.Other sectors of the economy are adopting similar measures, including Germany’s timber industry which until recently has thrived on the expansion of the housing, construction and furniture sectors in the United States.Klausner Holz, a privately owned family business and one of Europe’s largest wood-processing firms, announced last week it would cut production.Beginning Saturday, it will introduce short-time work for up to six months and gradually reduce production. “It has been difficult for us,” said Michael Walewski, the company’s spokesman. “This crisis is different. No one can predict when or how it will end.”Around 40 percent of Klausner’s sales have been earmarked for the American market. That is about a third of its total sales, which last year amounted to 700 million euros.1180 2008-10-28 The yen’s rise is owed, in part, to its status as a safe haven — in turbulent times, investors move money into the currency because Japan is the world’s largest economy after the United States’, and its banking system has limited exposure to the subprime crisis, even though it faces recession.But currency analysts say most of the yen’s recent gains are because of the abrupt end of the yen-carry trade.For much of this decade, Japanese and foreigners alike borrowed money in Japan, where interest rates were very low and money was therefore cheap. They invested that money in higher yielding assets across the world, from home loans in Budapest and Seoul to equities in Mumbai.This turned Japan, with its $15 trillion in personal savings built up by the nation’s chronic trade surpluses, into a provider of low-cost capital for the rest of the world.No one knows for sure how large this outflow of yen was.Much of the yen-carry trade took place beyond public scrutiny, in the form of currency options or other types of derivatives trading. Most analysts agree its size was in the hundreds of billions of dollars, with some estimating it reached well more than half a trillion dollars. As the yen-carry trade grew, currency analysts warned it was a bubble of cheap credit, which one day would burst.Now that day has come, say currency analysts and economists. Investors have been unwinding their yen-based loans as part of a panicked flight from risky assets — like Budapest home loans and Mumbai equities — and into safer havens like the yen and the American dollar, which is also rising against the euro and British pound.The prospect of global recession has also led central banks in many countries to cut interest rates, reducing the appeal of borrowing in Japan: South Korea cut interest rates by three-quarters of a point Monday, its biggest one-day move ever.The result has been a huge reversal in the flow of money, back into Japan and its currency. “This is the end of the yen-carry trade, and the yen bubble,” said Tohru Sasaki, chief exchange strategist in the Tokyo office of JPMorgan Chase Bank. “The yen is coming back home.”As this money flows back into Japan, currency analysts expect the yen to keep gaining. Mr. Sasaki says his company’s forecast is 87 yen to the dollar, but it could go as high as 80 yen.Mr. Sasaki said the size of the yen’s rise in recent weeks suggested that at least several trillion yen, or tens of billion of dollars, had flowed back to Japan. He said the last time he had tried to calculate the size of the entire yen-carry trade was three years ago, when he estimated that it totaled 40 trillion yen, or $425 billion. He said it could have easily grown much larger than that in recent years.All this money from Japan added to an excessive abundance of cheap capital that many economists now blame for causing the current financial crisis. Some of the biggest players in the carry trade were American and European hedge funds and banks. But Japanese individuals also fed the outflow of yen by pouring their savings into overseas investments, like emerging markets funds, in search of higher returns.Japan’s normally conservative homemakers even got into the act by trading foreign currencies online, becoming a force in global foreign exchange markets, known collectively as the Mrs. Watanabes.One indicator of the recent return of money to Japan has been a surge of individuals here cashing out of mutual funds that invest overseas. A survey of Japan’s 40 largest such funds showed individuals had withdrawn more than $3.5 billion since Sept. 12, Mr. Sasaki of JPMorgan said.The end of the yen-carry trade could have serious consequences, economists say.In Japan, the higher yen has worsened the already darkening outlook for the nation’s export-driven economy, hurting companies like Toyota and Sony. The yen, and the prospect of a recession in crucial overseas markets like the United States, have helped drive the benchmark Nikkei 225 index down some 50 percent so far this year.Globally, the carry trade’s demise could contribute to an overall increase in borrowing costs, especially for developing countries and lesser-known companies in developed nations, by cutting off a major source of low-cost capital, economists say.“The unwinding of the yen-carry trade is just one more way of taking excess credit out of the system,” said John Richards, head of Asia research at the Royal Bank of Scotland’s Tokyo office. “Higher borrowing costs will go up disproportionately for riskier investments.”A major reason for the end of the yen-carry trade has been a narrowing in the gap in interest rates between Japan and other developed countries. For years, Japan’s low interest rates — the benchmark overnight rate is 0.5 percent — were attractive enough to entice investors to borrow money here and invest it in countries with higher rates of return, despite the foreign exchange rate risks.Now, investors are unwinding those loans as interest rate differences between Japan and the rest of the world shrink, making yen borrowing less lucrative. When its board meets later this week, the United States Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its overnight rate again, from its current rate of 1.5 percent. That is already way down from 5.25 percent when the subprime problems first hit financial markets in July 2007.Since that time, the yen has risen 24 percent against the dollar as investors have repaid their yen borrowings. Indeed, some currency analysts said this dissolution of the yen-carry trade may already be reaching its climax.Koji Fukaya, senior currency strategist in the Tokyo office of Deutsche Bank, said he expected the yen’s gains to continue into November, before settling down at a value of about 90 yen a dollar.“The unwinding and liquidation will continue for a few more weeks,” he said. “Most of the yen-carry trades have already been unwound.”1181 2008-10-28 WASHINGTON — Sales of new homes recorded an unexpected increase in September as median home prices dropped to the lowest level in four years.The Commerce Department reported Monday that sales of new single-family homes rose 2.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000 homes. Economists had expected sales would drop from the August level.The median price of a new home sold in September declined 9.1 percent from a year ago to $218,400, the lowest price level since September 2004, a period when home prices were rising rapidly as the country experienced a five-year housing boom.The surprising increase in September sales still left them 33.1 percent below the level of a year ago as the country is battered by the worst housing slump in decades.The report on a rise in new-home sales followed news last week that sales of existing homes rose in September by 5.5 percent, the largest monthly gain in more than five years.1182 2008-10-28 “To be fair, some of it may be the economy,” said Denny Strigl, Verizon’s president, when asked about landline losses in an interview after a conference call with analysts. “But, quite honestly, it doesn’t jump off the page.”Verizon executives, like those at many companies these days, sought to reassure investors that their business was still sound despite the faltering economy. Its FiOS television and Internet service showed promise, analysts said, with Verizon adding 233,000 new customers. Verizon introduced FiOS to compete head to head with cable companies encroaching on their telephone business.“For now the good in today’s report outweighs the bad,” said Craig Moffett, a research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.In the conference call, Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon’s chief executive, said he was encouraged by the company’s wireless results. “We had what we thought was a good quarter in light of the economic uncertainty around the world,” he said.But he warned that consumers were likely to spend less this Christmas than Verizon executives previously anticipated. Businesses are likely to curtail spending into 2009, he added. For now it is unclear what impact that will have, if any, on sales of the BlackBerry Storm, the newest touch-screen smartphone from Research in Motion.Verizon is hoping it will be a worthy competitor to the popular iPhone, which is offered exclusively by AT&T. R.I.M. expects to begin selling the Storm next month.Mr. Strigl conceded that some Verizon customers had switched to AT&T. Churn, the measure of how many customers switch to a rival, increased to 1.33 percent from 1.12 percent from the second quarter. But Mr. Strigl added that Verizon’s fortunes were “not wedded to one iconic device.”He was referring to AT&T and its exclusive relationship with Apple, the maker of the iPhone. Instead, he said, Verizon’s goal is to bring multiple devices to market so it is not largely dependent on one supplier.When asked about the planned $28 billion acquisition of the rural mobile subscriber Alltel, Mr. Seidenberg said Verizon was moving ahead as planned and would not try to renegotiate the financial terms given the change in the economic climate.Higher financing costs, he said, would have an impact on early profits. “But in no way will the long-term benefit of this deal be negated by some of the short-term issues,” he said.1183 2008-10-28 PARIS — French investigators have concluded that toxic mercury found in the car of a prominent Russian human rights lawyer resulted from an accidental spillage from a broken thermometer before the lawyer bought the vehicle, according to the French police.Earlier this month, the lawyer, Karinna Moskalenko, complained of headaches and vomiting, raising speculation that she had been the target of a poisoning plot. After falling ill, Ms. Moskalenko postponed a trip from Strasbourg, France, to Moscow to attend the trial of defendants in the killing of one of her best-known clients, the writer and journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was shot dead in the entrance to her Moscow apartment two years ago.Ms. Moskalenko has also represented the jailed former oil magnate Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. She has taken many cases involving alleged rights abuses against Chechens to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, where the mercury pellets were found in her car.The suspicion that she may have been poisoned drew comparisons with the case of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer who died after ingesting a rare radioactive isotope in London in November 2006.Earlier this month, Anna Stavitskaya, another lawyer representing the Politkovskaya family, said the mercury might have been part of an attempt to intimidate Ms. Moskalenko.According to the Committee to Protect Journalists in New York, Ms. Moskalenko’s clients have also included Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion who has become an opposition political leader in Russia, and Mr. Litvinenko. . Investigators in Strasbourg said over the weekend that Ms. Moskalenko’s family bought the car in August from an antiques dealer who used it to carry merchandise, including an old thermometer that had broken accidentally. That theory first surfaced when Ms. Moskalenko canceled her trip back to Moscow from Strasbourg in mid-October, but the authorities opened a formal investigation into a possible poisoning.1184 2008-10-28 GOSWAMI--Swapan K.

In the first six weeks of the fall semester, its leaders said, they recruited more than 100,000 new members on campuses in swing states; the organization now has 300,000 members on more than 1,900 campuses.Still, many McCain supporters on college campuses say theirs is a lonely existence.“When I walk down the street carrying my campaign materials, people yell at me,” said Katie Nix, 22, the statewide co-chairwoman of Students for McCain who is a senior majoring in molecular biology and French at the University of Wisconsin. “I just keep hearing, ‘Obama! Obama!’ ”The University of Florida in Gainesville is home to one of the country’s largest McCain student groups, with more than 1,000 members. Some of its volunteers stand for nine hours a day in a central campus plaza, pitching to students and selling T-shirts, their only source of campaign money.The Obama group on campus, though, has hired a shuttle bus to drive Obama-supporting students to an early voting site 20 minutes away.“Obviously, we don’t have the resources for that kind of thing,” said Joshua Simmons, 20, the chairman of Gators for McCain. “Right now, we’re just making sure that students know that this organization does exist, and that there are students out there who support McCain.”As if to punctuate his point, Mr. Simmons was stopped midsentence while walking through campus recently and talking on his cellphone.“What is that, a robot?” he said, exhaling noisily. “The Obama campaign has a robot set up in the plaza. It’s holding a sign that says ‘Powered by hope.’ Which I don’t think is entirely accurate.”At a campuswide tailgate affair at Penn State last spring, the Students for McCain doled out $100 for food for supporters, then watched as the Obama tailgaters trotted out Michael Robinson, a football player with the San Francisco 49ers, and Franco Harris, a Penn State alum who went on to the football Hall of Fame. Mr. Natalo was in despair.Officials in the McCain campaign said they had not neglected college students, but they admitted having a relatively late start. While Mr. McCain had essentially clinched the nomination as far back as February, it was months before he began courting students. And the McCain campaign has not exploited the Internet as Mr. Obama’s has.Students for Barack Obama began as a “Draft Obama” campaign on Facebook in 2006, and Mr. Obama now has more than 2.2 million Facebook supporters. The McCain campaign created a social-networking site for McCain supporters called “McCainSpace” only in August.The campaign Web site, meanwhile, JohnMcCain.com, lists 23 “coalitions” for supporters to join, but none for students. (There are, however, Bikers for McCain, Lawyers for McCain, Asian-Americans for McCain and Sportsmen for McCain.)A McCain campaign aide said the Internet was “one component of an overall effort” to build a grass-roots youth network.“We very much believe that peer-to-peer contact is the best way to mobilize young voters,” said Joseph Pounder, a campaign spokesman.Adam Meldrum, the campaign’s national youth director, has organized regional directors, who have established a Students for McCain chairman in each state.On Saturdays, the campaign sometimes holds 45-minute conference calls with students, said Megan Buwalda, a McCain volunteer and senior at Western Michigan University.“They give us talking points,” Ms. Buwalda said. “Like ‘10 reasons why the youth would be excited to vote for McCain.’ ” (One reason, she said, is “McCain will be the first to bring global warming as an issue to the Republican Party.”)But those talking points do not always go over well, she said, especially when so many other students are focused on Mr. McCain’s lack of tech-savvy, his out-of-date cultural references and, most of all, his age.“People do make a big deal out of that,” Ms. Buwalda said. “ ‘McCain, he’s out of touch, he’s old,’ things like that. But I really think, Barack Obama might use his BlackBerry more often, but McCain spent his life serving the country.”During Mr. McCain’s unsuccessful bid for president in 2000, he was immensely popular with students, who admired his willingness to buck convention. He stoked his appeal with regular appearances on “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” and “Late Show with David Letterman.”“When McCain came to campus back in 2000, he was a rock star,” said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. “He really connected with the students. He bounced on the stage. They liked the straight talk, and they liked the things he said. He was funny and sarcastic.”When Mr. McCain returned to the Dartmouth campus in 2007, “there wasn’t the same physical presence and level of energy,” Ms. Fowler said. “And the straight talker was a lot more circumspect.”Of course, it still remains to be seen how many students, a notoriously fickle group, will turn out to vote on Election Day. But more than 6.5 million people under the age of 30 voted in primary contests in 2008.In a USA Today-MTV-Gallup telephone poll of 18-to-29-year-old registered voters this month, Mr. Obama held a 29 point advantage over Mr. McCain. Since exit polling began in 1972, the largest gap between two presidential candidates in this demographic group has been 19 points.Reflecting on the disparity, Mr. Natalo sounded a bit like Mr. McCain.“We are the underdog,” he said. “We just have to work a lot harder.”1207 2008-10-29 “The reforms we need to put in place are so sweeping and the political environment is so hostile to consensus, I think we will be in a phase of longer-term building of public understanding,” said Ms. Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a research group in Washington.Both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain continue to support legislation that would include a path to legal status for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the country.As a result, groups that oppose legal status for illegal immigrants, who mobilized a wildfire movement of largely Republican voters against a comprehensive immigration bill last year, are sitting out the presidential race. Instead, they are focusing on Senate and House races, where they hope to stop the Democrats from winning large majorities.“We’re going to have an incredibly bad White House, so we’re in for some tough defensive battles,” said Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, which favors reduced immigration. “We have to make sure we’ve got at least 41 senators so we can block any Obama or McCain amnesty.”Seeking to broaden support for legalization, Mr. Obama embraces new law-and-order language adopted in the Democratic Party platform at the convention. Although Americans are “welcoming and generous,” the platform states, “those who enter our country’s borders illegally, and those who employ them, disrespect the rule of law.” Instead of the Democrats’ emphasis, as recently as last year, on integrating illegal immigrants into society, the platform says, “We must require them to come out of the shadows and get right with the law.”Heather Higginbottom, the Obama campaign’s director for policy, said Mr. Obama had not altered his basic views. If elected, Mr. Obama would insist that illegal immigrants pay back taxes and fines, learn English and go to the back of the immigration line to become legal.For Mr. McCain, there has been a sharper turn from the past. He was unable to stop the Republican Party from adopting a platform at the September convention that directly rejected his support for legalization. “We oppose amnesty,” the platform states, describing “the American people’s rejection of en masse legalizations” as “especially appropriate.”Some Republicans have not forgiven Mr. McCain for joining Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, to write a bill, known as comprehensive immigration reform, which passed the Senate in 2006. Mr. McCain stayed on the sidelines last year as a version of that bill stalled in Congress. Then, under pressure from rivals in the Republican primaries, Mr. McCain said early this year that he would not vote for that bill if it came up again.He has supported the Bush administration’s aggressive enforcement campaign against illegal immigration, calling it a necessary first step to persuading Americans to accept any legalization program. In recent weeks his campaign has avoided the term “path to citizenship” to describe the option Mr. McCain would offer illegal immigrants, saying only that he would deal with them in a humane way.The McCain campaign is hoping that his differences with the Republican Party will help to reinforce his image as a maverick, especially among Hispanic voters. One of his television advertisements in Spanish shows Mr. McCain speaking of illegal immigrants as “God’s children,” as Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado, the Republicans’ most outspoken foe of illegal immigrants, looks on, scowling.“Senator McCain risked his own political career to get a bill in the Senate that would benefit Latinos,” said César Martínez, a producer of the McCain advertisements in Spanish.Obama supporters say they do not mind his campaign’s silences, since they are confident he remains committed to an overhaul including legalization, and debate has often proved polarizing.“We feel very comfortable with where he stands,” said Eliseo Medina, international executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, who has been barnstorming for Mr. Obama. “We do not have to have it repeated to us over and over again.”Ms. Higginbottom, the Obama policy adviser, acknowledged that high unemployment in coming months could make an immigration overhaul a harder sell but said Mr. Obama would argue that American workers would benefit if millions of unauthorized immigrant workers, currently vulnerable to exploitation, gained their labor rights.While the candidates have skirted the immigration issue in speeches and town-hall-style- meetings, they are clashing head on over it in the Spanish language media, in negative advertisements that have played heavily in swing states with growing numbers of Hispanic voters like Colorado, Florida, Nevada and New Mexico.In those advertisements, Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama each tries to show that the other was less consistent in supporting legislation to change the system, including provisions to legalize illegal immigrants.1208 2008-10-29 WASHINGTON — Senator Barack Obama will use his prime-time half-hour infomercial on Wednesday night to make what is effectively a closing argument to a national audience of millions. At times he will speak directly into the camera about his 20-month campaign, at others he will highlight everyday voters, their everyday troubles, and his plans to address them.Mr. Obama’s campaign agreed to provide The New York Times with a minute-long trailer for the 30-minute program, which is to run on four broadcast networks at 8 p.m. It will be the first time in 16 years that a presidential candidate has bought network time, in prime time, for a prolonged campaign commercial.The trailer is heavy in strings, flags, presidential imagery and some Americana filmed by Davis Guggenheim, whose father was the campaign documentarian of Robert F. Kennedy. As the screen flashes scenes of suburban lawns, a freight train and Mr. Obama seated at a kitchen table with a group of white, apparently working-class voters, Mr. Obama says: “We’ve seen over the last eight years how decisions by a president can have a profound effect on the course of history and on American lives; much that’s wrong with our country goes back even farther than that.”Then, while standing before a stately desk and an American flag, Mr. Obama, in a suit, says: “We’ve been talking about the same problems for decades and nothing is ever done to solve them. For the past 20 months, I’ve traveled the length of this country, and Michelle and I have met so many Americans who are looking for real and lasting change that makes a difference in their lives.”Jim Margolis, Mr. Obama’s senior advertising strategist, said the program would then go on to feature “the stories of four different Americans, or American families, and kind of what they’re confronting.”1209 2008-10-29 To make matters worse, corporate earnings have now started to plunge, too. Assuming that they keep dropping, stocks would also need to fall to keep the price-earnings ratio at its current level.As stocks were soaring on Tuesday afternoon, I called James Melcher to hear a dose of fact-based bearishness. Mr. Melcher is president of Balestra Capital, a hedge fund in New York, who wrote an essay for his clients two years ago that predicted the broad outlines of the financial crisis (and then arranged Balestra’s portfolio accordingly). Like the bulls, he said that no one could know what the market would do in the short term. “But to think stocks are cheap now,” he added, “is not rational.”He went on: “In the last 20 years — and particularly in the last six or seven — you had the most massive creation of liquidity the world has ever known.” Consumers went ever deeper into debt, thanks to loose lending standards, and a shadow banking system, made up of hedge funds and investment banks, allowed Wall Street to do the same. All that debt lifted economic growth and stock returns.“It was a nice party,” Mr. Melcher said. “The problem is that all the bills are coming due at the same time.” He thinks stocks could easily fall an additional 20 percent and maybe 35 percent before hitting bottom.So who’s right — the bears or the bulls? The smartest people in both camps, like Mr. Melcher, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Bogle, have a healthy dose of humility about their own conclusions. And when you dig into their arguments, you find that they’re not quite as different as they first sound. But they are different, and it’s worth taking a minute to consider the numbers.There are any number of ways to measure the valuation of the stock market. Some examine prices relative to earnings, others are based on cash flow, a company’s underlying assets or the total value of the market. But they tell a pretty consistent story right now. Stocks, which were fabulously expensive for much of the 1990s and this decade, no longer are.My favorite measure is the one recommended by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, in their classic 1934 textbook, “Security Analysis.” They urged investors to use a price-to-earnings ratio — stock prices divided by average annual corporate earnings — based on at least five years of earnings and, ideally, closer to 10. Corporate profits may rise or fall in any given year, but a share of stock is a claim on a company’s long-term earnings and should be evaluated as such.The 10-year price-to-earnings ratio tells an incredibly consistent story over the last century. It has averaged about 16 over that time. There have been long periods when it stayed above 16 and even shot above 20, like the 1920s, 1960s and recent years. As recently as last October, when other measures suggested the market was reasonably valued, the Graham-Dodd version of the ratio was a disturbing 27. But periods in which the ratio has jumped above 20 have always been followed by steep declines and at least a decade of poor returns.By 1932, the ratio had fallen to 6. In 1982, it was only 7. Then, of course, the market began to self-correct in the other direction, and stocks took off.After Tuesday’s big rally, the ratio was just a shade below 16, or almost equal to its long-run average. This is a little difficult to swallow, I realize. Stocks are down 40 percent since last October, and every experience from the last 25 years suggests they now have to bounce back.But that’s precisely the problem. Since the 1980s, stocks have always bounced back from a loss, usually reaching a high in relatively short order. As a result, the market became enormously overvalued.As Robert Shiller, the economist who specializes in bubbles, points out, human beings tend to put too much weight on recent experiences. We think the market snapbacks of 1987 and the current decade are more meaningful and more predictive than the long slumps of the 1930s, 1940s and 1970s. Of course, anyone who made the same assumption in 1930 or 1975 — this just has to turn around soon — would have had to wait years and years until the investment paid off.Now, Mr. Buffett, Mr. Bogle and their fellow bulls know all this history, and they’re still bullish. (Though I’d be more bullish, too, if I could get the favorable terms that Mr. Buffett did. In exchange for his money and his good name, Goldman Sachs and General Electric each guaranteed him an annual return of at least 10 percent.)So on Tuesday afternoon, I also called Mr. Bogle, the legendary founder of the Vanguard Group, the investment firm whose low-cost index funds have made a lot for a lot of people.He, too, prefers the 10-year price-to-earnings ratio, he said, but he didn’t think that it necessarily had to fall to the same bargain-basement levels it reached in the 1930s and 1970s.You can certainly see why that would be the case. Investors are well aware that the market fell to irrationally low levels during past crises, and they may not allow it to become so cheap this time around.Mr. Bogle also thinks that corporate profits will rebound nicely within a couple of years and likes the fact that interest rates are low. Low rates have often — though not always — accompanied bull markets.But it was his last argument that I think is the main one for most investors to focus on. “I’m not looking for a great bull market,” he said. There are some reasons to be optimistic about stocks, he said, “and I also look at the alternative.”And, really, how attractive are the alternatives? Savings accounts and money market funds will struggle to keep pace with inflation. Bonds may, as well.Stocks, on the other hand, are paying an average dividend of about 3 percent, which is better than the interest on many savings accounts, and stocks are also almost certain to rise over the next couple of decades.If that is your time frame — decades, rather than months or years — this will probably turn out to be a perfectly good buying opportunity. In the shorter term, though, it’s a much tougher call, and it involves a lot more risk.1210 2008-10-29 Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia posted a third-quarter loss Tuesday as advertising revenue in its publishing division fell 18 percent and ad results in the current quarter were down.The company, founded by Martha Stewart, said fourth-quarter ad revenue was moving down at a rate of nearly 20 percent. The publishing segment, its biggest, fell the steepest in the third quarter, while the broadcast, merchandising and online units held up.“I wish the print market was stronger, but it’s not, so print ad revenue has been soft in Q3 and the trend is persistent to Q4,” the chief financial officer, Howard Hochhauser, said in an interview.Mr. Hochhauser said that the ad weakness was spread across categories, but added that “retail was one of the harder hit.”The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue of about $83 million, short of the average analyst expectations of $88.7 million. For the year, the company forecast revenue of about $295 million, below the average estimate of $300.7 million.For the third quarter, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia lost $3.7 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with a loss of $4.4 million, or 8 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.1211 2008-10-29 But for the long run, they say, the president’s fiscal record will hinge on whether he can achieve the health care cost savings each promises, which in turn will help control the fast-rising expenses for and . Neither candidate has a comprehensive proposal to address unsustainable growth in those programs.“Neither one of them is being fiscally responsible,” said David M. Walker, a former head of the who has long warned about the perils of deficits.The next president will inherit economic challenges greater than any other president since 75 years ago. Yet while the country entered the after a decade of budget surpluses, today’s crisis hits a nation in worse financial shape — with growing wartime deficits, heavy borrowing from foreigners, and crushing retirement health costs for aging baby boomers looming.The deficit for the 2008 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, was $455 billion, or 3.2 percent of total economic output. Analysts say it could reach $1 trillion in 2009, or more than 7 percent of projected economic output, with the country in recession and fighting a two-front war. During the 1980s, the deficit peaked at about 6 percent of economic output; economists consider anything above about 3 percent to be a worrisome level for the deficit.So far, both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama have insisted they do not have to have to scale back their pre-crisis platforms.The fiscal outlook and history suggest otherwise. Among past promises that crashed against realities: Roosevelt’s pledge to balance budgets, ’s and George Bush’s antitax vows and ’s middle-class tax cut. The current President Bush kept his biggest promises, for tax cuts and a Medicare prescription-drug benefit, but the national debt has doubled to more than $10 trillion during his administration., who was Mr. Clinton’s first budget director, said he had warned Mr. Obama of the realities ahead, should he win. “I’ve told him, Bill Clinton found this out. He walked into the Oval Office, and suddenly he found he had a bigger deficit than he even thought he had.” Mr. Clinton’s reaction, he said, was, “I’m not going to be able to do what I want to do!”Mr. McCain’s proposed tax cuts would mean about $1.5 trillion in lower revenue over his term, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Extending the Bush income tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 beyond their scheduled 2010 expiration would account for more than a third of that total. He also would change the to hit fewer middle-income taxpayers, reduce corporate income taxes and accelerate business write-offs for equipment. The 10-year cost of Mr. McCain’s tax plan would be as much as $4.2 trillion, the center says.The Republican’s health plan mostly seeks to reduce prices. Mr. McCain would also provide a tax credit of up to $5,000 a family to buy insurance, at a cost of about $800 billion through 2013. To partly offset that, he would make workers’ employer-provided health benefits taxable as income. He also proposes savings from unspecified changes in Medicare and Medicaid.Mr. McCain has fewer spending initiatives than Mr. Obama. His main one is to increase the size of the military. He proposes energy incentives, offset by selling permits for emissions of heat-trapping gases that are believed to contribute to . He also offers income supplements for older, low-income workers and more financing for the education law.To help balance the budget, Mr. McCain claims billions of dollars in savings from reducing forces in . Neither he nor Mr. Obama, however, account for the increasing deployments to . Mr. McCain also calls for cutting “corporate welfare,” ending spending earmarks for special projects and freezing domestic appropriations in his first year.By his final budget for 2013, Mr. McCain estimated he would cut $114 billion — he does not say how — to reach balance. He would still be about $200 billion short, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. But that estimate does not include the costs of the $700 billion financial bailout package already passed by Congress (its proponents say much of the price tag will be recouped by the government in the long run) or any additional economic stimulus plans that Congress might approve in coming months.Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a centrist budget watchdog group, estimated Mr. McCain could fall about $600 billion short in 2013, roughly the annual cost of Medicare.Mr. Obama would extend the Bush tax cuts for taxpayers making less than $250,000 a year, and repeal them immediately for those above that level. He would cut other taxes, including for low-income workers and small businesses, and raise taxes on the dividends and capital gains of the affluent. Like Mr. McCain, he would change the alternative minimum tax to apply only to the rich, as intended, and close corporate loopholes, most of them unspecified.Mr. Obama says the new revenue from higher taxes on the well-off would pay for his health plan, which would cost an estimated $115 billion the first year, but increase after that. That still leaves his tax cuts for everyone else to add to the deficits.The Tax Policy Center estimated that the overall revenue loss would be nearly $1 trillion for Mr. Obama’s term, and $2.9 trillion measured over a decade. Annual federal spending, which exceeds 20 percent of gross domestic product, would grow under both men’s plans. Revenue would continue to be a lower percentage, measured against the size of the economy — 18.3 percent under Mr. Obama, and 17.6 percent under Mr. McCain, according to the tax center. The difference signals continued, deepening deficits.The size of both candidates’ tax cuts troubles many budget analysts. Even if the next president succeeds in reining in health care costs, said Joseph J. Minarik, senior vice president of the business-supported Committee for Economic Development, those savings will take years to appear while the tax cuts would be immediate.Mr. Obama’s spending plans, beyond his health care initiative, would mean increases for education, infrastructure, research and foreign aid, and more for bolstering the military than Mr. McCain has proposed.He has a more ambitious climate-change proposal, mandating that companies buy emissions permits at government auctions. The estimates that those could bring in up to $300 billion annually by 2020. Mr. Obama would use the initial revenue for energy initiatives and tax rebates to offset many Americans’ fuel costs.1212 2008-10-29 On Tuesday morning, the company demonstrated Windows 7 before a group of more than 6,000 programmers attending the company’s Professional Developers’ Conference being held here through Thursday.“We’ve done a lot of work around how you manage the windows, how you launch programs and how you manage the windows of the programs that you’ve launched,” said Steven Sinofsky, the Microsoft technologist who has led the development of the new version of Windows. “It’s all about personalization and putting you in control of the PC, and that’s a big initiative that we’ve had.”Mr. Sinofsky took the stage and issued an apology of sorts for the problems and frustrations associated with Windows Vista. He said the company had listened to and was responding to the feedback.“We got feedback from reviews, from the press, a few bloggers here and there, oh, and some commercials,” he said, with a nod to a lengthy Apple advertising campaign that has mercilessly poked fun at Microsoft’s woes.He also said that he had not taken particular offense at Apple’s ad campaign teasing the giant software developer. However, the laptop did have an “I’m a PC” sticker on its cover, a reference to a recent series of ads Microsoft ran that were widely viewed as a somewhat belated response to Apple. “As an engineering team we have to do what engineers do, when you build a product, when you build a service, you step back and say what have we learned from this, what can we do better, what went well, how do we build on our experience,” he added.He then demonstrated a “pre-beta” version of Windows, acknowledging that some features were still missing. The presentation focused generally on the more polished control features of Windows 7 including how on-screen notifications are handled, an issue that was an irritant for early Vista users who complained about the nannylike behavior of the software.Other new features in this very early version included an enhanced and more flexible task-bar, more powerful search features, and an easier-to-use home network and file sharing. There was also a hint that Microsoft plans to revise Windows 7 to take advantage of the coming wave of multicore microprocessors from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Mr. Sinofsky said the company would give more details on the ability of the new program to handle up to 256 processors.Mr. Sinofsky, who previously led the development of the company’s Office application, showed Windows 7 running on a low-priced Lenovo notebook computer equipped with just one gigabyte of memory and a relatively low-power Intel Atom microprocessor. This suggests that the new version of the program will require far fewer resources than its predecessor, although Mr. Sinofsky declined to make specific performance promises.Microsoft also said that it planned to offer versions of a number of its Office applications via a Web browser instead of as an application on a PC, via the Microsoft Office Live Web service, and to businesses through a hosted subscription.1213 2008-10-29 The problem is that newly risk-averse investors are shunning biotechnology stocks, which are among the riskiest investments around, because most experimental drugs fail.Biotech companies accounted for 86, or 25 percent, of the 344 companies that, as of Oct. 9, were in danger of being delisted by Nasdaq because their share price was less than $1 or they failed to have an adequate market valuation.One of those is DeCode Genetics, which has regularly made headlines for discovering genes linked to cancer, heart attacks and numerous other diseases. The company’s stock has fallen more than 90 percent in the last year to 29 cents a share.Investors apparently are concerned that the company’s cash is running low and that it will have trouble paying a $230 million debt that comes due in 2011. It has not helped that DeCode is based in Iceland, which has suffered a financial collapse, and that it lost millions of dollars on investments in auction rate securities. The company is now planning to sell certain operations.There are exceptions, of course. The big biotechnology companies, including Genentech and Amgen, have products on the market and are highly profitable. The biggest companies are in such strong financial shape, in fact, that their shares are roughly flat for the year, far better than stocks as a whole.But most biotechnology companies — several hundred publicly traded ones and thousands more in private hands — are unprofitable and can sustain themselves only with periodic infusions of cash from willing investors or pharmaceutical companies. It can take hundreds of millions of dollars and 10 years or longer to bring a drug to market.“For a biotech company, cash is a raw material,” said George Milstein, head of investment banking at Pacific Growth Equities, an investment bank specializing in health care.Some 113 biotechnology companies, up from 68 in the first quarter, now have less than a year of cash at their current spending rates, according to Rodman & Renshaw, an investment bank. That is about one-third of the publicly traded biotech companies it tracks.Lack of access to credit is not the main problem for small biotechnology companies, which are considered so risky that even in boom times they cannot borrow much money from banks.Some, though, have issued securities convertible into common stock, which might have to be paid back in cash if the stock price falls below the conversion rate.That happened to AtheroGenics after its drug for heart disease failed in a clinical trial. Paying off $30.5 million in notes that came due in September would have left it with little cash to test its drug as a treatment for diabetes. So it defaulted, entered bankruptcy and is now trying to sell itself or the drug.For biotechnology companies, though, the main impact of the credit crisis involves the broader market. Some hedge funds have pulled out of biotechnology investing, while others have had to sell shares to cover losses elsewhere or to return money to their investors.To be sure, the industry has been through funding droughts before, such as in 1998 and again in 2002, and most companies survive.But this crisis comes as other factors were already souring investors on biotechnology. Drug development has become longer and more costly, in part because the Food and Drug Administration has become more demanding. And there is more pressure to cut drug prices.So far this year, public and private biotechnology companies have raised $5.6 billion, according to the publishing company FDC-Windhover’s Strategic Transactions database. That is only one-third the amount in all of 2007 and likely to be the lowest amount since 2002.It has been virtually impossible for biotech companies to go public this year. That deprives venture capitalists, who help start and nurture small companies, of one of the main ways of realizing a return on their investment. And it means they have to keep financing their companies longer. Those factors — plus the fact that some venture capitalists are investing in publicly traded biotechnology companies because their shares have become so cheap — mean there will be less money left for starting new companies.When investors do invest, they are more often insisting on quick returns. Robert I. Blum, chief executive of Cytokinetics, a publicly traded company based in South San Francisco, Calif., said hedge funds had constantly pressed him to spend money only on the company’s drugs that were already in clinical trials and to abandon earlier-stage research aimed at finding new drugs.“They were challenging us and critiquing us for still investing in research,” Mr. Blum said. He said such pressure threatened to dry up innovation.Cytokinetics partially bowed to the pressure in September, cutting some of its early research and dismissing 45 employees, or 29 percent of its work force.As a company’s cash and stock price diminish, raising money becomes even harder. Companies do not like to sell new stock cheaply because it dilutes existing shareholders. And potential new investors, sensing a company is desperate, drive a harder bargain. So do pharmaceutical companies, which are desperate for new drugs and have the cash to buy smaller biotechnology companies.“I have a sense that Big Pharma is sitting on the sidelines waiting for them to hit bottom,” said Dennis Purcell, senior managing partner of Aisling Capital, a life-sciences investment firm.Fund-raising would also get harder if Nasdaq carried through on its threat to delist biotech companies that have become penny stocks. But with so many companies in various industries in trouble, Nasdaq has now suspended enforcement of its delisting rules for three months, until Jan. 19.Some companies are managing to get money. Phenomix, a San Diego company, put off trying to go public but licensed a diabetes drug to Forest Laboratories for an initial payment of $75 million. Ista Pharmaceuticals of Irvine, Calif., got a $65 million credit line from Deerfield Management and two other shareholders.But risk aversion is spreading even to some companies not in immediate danger of running out of cash.Despite having about $200 million on hand, Maxygen last week suspended work on its lead drug — aimed at protecting cancer chemotherapy patients from infections — rather than commit $100 million or so to move the drug through clinical trials. The company, based in Redwood City, Calif., said it would reduce its work force by 30 percent and would explore selling itself.Russell Howard, the chief executive, said the company’s market valuation was only about $130 million. That is less than its cash on hand, meaning investors were placing no value on the drug or any of the company’s other programs.“Why would you be investing more in this business,” he said, “if the market doesn’t care?”1214 2008-10-29 A victory by any of the Democrats could bring to Washington a new approach to Latin America, which has been dominated by the Republicans’ combativeness with Cuba. It would also highlight the demographic shifts of the last decade in Florida, defined by growth among non-Cuban Hispanics and younger Cubans who are more likely to vote Democratic.Fernand Amandi, executive vice president of Bendixen & Associates, a local polling company that has done work this fall for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has identified the trend. “It would be the first sign of turning Florida from a purple state to one that’s blue,” he said.Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and the Diaz-Balarts declined repeated requests for interviews. At a forum in Miami this summer, Mario Diaz-Balart said he would never talk to The New York Times because “it’s a biased newspaper.”But in debates and in advertisements, their response to the Democrats has been clear. For the Diaz-Balarts, it combines a focus on their Congressional records with attacks on their opponents’ character.Mr. Garcia, a former chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation, has come under fire for taking campaign money from Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who is embroiled in a real estate scandal.Mr. Martinez, meanwhile, has been labeled a criminal.He was, in fact, convicted in 1991 of extorting money from developers while he was mayor of Hialeah. The conviction was overturned on appeal, and two retrials ended with hung juries. But Lincoln Diaz-Balart has made sure the cases are not forgotten. At a debate this month, he said, “I’ve never embarrassed our community with a corruption scandal, and I think that’s a very important ingredient to keep in mind.”One of his campaign’s television advertisements also calls Mr. Martinez “horrifying,” with quotes from testimony in the trials and grainy video of a man who appears to be Mr. Martinez punching someone. Mr. Martinez has run attack advertisements too, including one that accuses his opponent of accepting a suitcase of cash from an indicted Puerto Rican politician. Mr. Diaz-Balart’s Web site calls it “a proven LIE,” after telling The Miami Herald that he received only $400 from the politician’s family in 2006. In an interview, Mr. Martinez said the nastiness was driven by Republicans in an effort to distract voters from the economy.But Ken Spain, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which has spent $600,000 or so on its own advertisements attacking Mr. Martinez, said the tactics were legitimate. “The facts speak for themselves,” Mr. Spain said. “Character is going to be, and should be, a very important issue in these campaigns.”So far, the race between Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Ms. Taddeo has been cleaner. Until recently, Ms. Taddeo had been considered a long shot because she is relatively unknown and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen has a reputation for being attentive to constituents. But with the Republican brand beaten down nationwide, Ms. Taddeo has been gaining. One recent poll put her down by just seven points, a 24-point swing from a few months ago.The rally last Thursday at the Little Havana Activities Center was in her district, and in a sign of how serious the races have become, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, introduced the candidates. It was her eighth trip to the area during this election cycle.1215 2008-10-29 Federer and Wawrinka won the gold medal in doubles at this year’s Olympics in Beijing, which Federer deemed one of the highlights of his career. That victory helped salvage a season that had been disappointing by his standards to that stage, in part because he contracted mononucleosis in late 2007 and had to change his training schedule.After Beijing, Federer won his fifth straight United States Open to move one victory away from tying Pete Sampras’s career record of 14 Grand Slam singles titles.“I am excited to once again join my fellow Swiss teammates, who I have a great friendship with,” Federer said in a statement on his Web site posted Tuesday confirming his intent to play against the United States. “And I look forward to what I am sure will be a tough weekend.”The United States has won the Cup a record 32 times, but Switzerland has yet to win, and it is one of two significant gaps in Federer’s otherwise impeccable résumé, along with the lack of a French Open singles title.“I think he does look at history and does look at the importance of Davis Cup and trying to get that,” McEnroe said. “And the fact that Rafael Nadal already has one with Spain and could get another one this year in Argentina could be a factor, too, because those two are so competitive. Our guys have one, and there’s nothing more they’d like than to try to get another one, and we still feel we can do that with the team we have and the young guys coming up.”Tim Curry, a United States Tennis Association spokesman, said the timing of Federer’s announcement was helpful because Friday is the deadline for prospective host cities to send letters of intent. Official bids are due Nov. 21, with a selection announcement to follow in December. Curry said the U.S.T.A., before Federer’s commitment, had already been in contact with representatives from Birmingham, Ala.; San Antonio; Beaumont, Tex.; and Greenville, N.C.The attendance figure to beat for a Davis Cup series in the United States is 50,962, which was the record three-day figure for the 1990 final against Australia in St. Petersburg, Fla. The single-day attendance record for any sanctioned tennis match is 27,200, which was set during the 2004 final in Seville, Spain, where Nadal and Spain beat Roddick and the United States.Whatever site the Americans choose, McEnroe anticipates laying down a very quick surface. “We certainly feel Wawrinka plays better on a slow court,” McEnroe said. “As we know, it’s pretty difficult to make Roger uncomfortable, so we’re going to do everything we can to make Wawrinka uncomfortable.”1216 2008-10-29 TEHRAN — Iran announced Tuesday that it had opened a naval base in the Gulf of Oman to counter any hostile forces, in what was clearly an allusion to American Navy vessels patrolling nearby.The announcement, reported by Iran’s Fars news agency, quoted a naval commander, Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, as saying Iran had created the base because of the presence of “nonregional forces” around the Gulf of Oman, which is the gateway to the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf, vital transit routes for the area’s vast oil supplies.“We have created a new defense front in the region,” the admiral was quoted as saying. “We are capable of preventing the entry of any enemy naval forces into the strategic Persian Gulf.”The base, opened on Monday, is in the port of Jask, 700 miles southeast of Tehran. Admiral Sayyari did not specify the type or number of warships or weapons deployed there.Twenty percent of the world’s oil is shipped through the Strait of Hormuz. It has been the focus of tension in recent months, with Iran threatening to close the strait if the country came under any military attack.The announcement from Iran came two days after American forces in neighboring Iraq crossed into Syria in a raid to stop weapons smuggling to Iraqi insurgents.The United States military has accused Iran of smuggling weapons into Iraq, as well as running militia training camps for Iraqis, and the Syria raid increased speculation that Iran might also be subject to such incursions.1217 2008-10-29 WASHINGTON — The steep buildup in government spending on intelligence programs continued over the past year, according to figures made public on Tuesday, but American intelligence agencies are also bracing for a new era of austerity.Spending on intelligence operations increased by some 9 percent last year, to $47.5 billion, Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, said Tuesday. That figure includes most intelligence spending, including the budget for the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the operation of spy satellites, but it does not include several billions that the military services spend annually on intelligence operations.When the military spending is included, the new figure confirms that the American intelligence budget has doubled over the past decade, primarily to meet the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a worldwide campaign against Al Qaeda. In 1998, the last time the intelligence budget was publicly disclosed before a 2007 law made it mandatory, it stood at $26.7 billion, and there were more F.B.I. agents working in New York City than C.I.A. officers operating around the world.The size of the 2009 budget, under which the intelligence agencies are currently operating, remains classified.Yet current and former intelligence officials said that some belt-tightening had already begun because of the economic crisis, and that further large increases in the budget were unlikely, no matter who became the next president. They said discussions under way to determine the 2010 budget reflected White House demands for greater spending restraint.1218 2008-10-29 PARIS — Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain called Tuesday for China and the Persian Gulf states to put up more money to help the International Monetary Fund deal with the fallout of the credit crisis.The appeal of Mr. Brown grabbed the spotlight ahead of a meeting on Tuesday with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who called the proposal interesting and vowed to work “hand in hand” with the British leader — just as they had on a coordinated rescue plan for European banks. Mr. Sarkozy said he also believed that the fund needed “additional means” to help ailing economies.“Our first priority at the moment is to stop the contagion to other countries, including in Eastern Europe where there are problems emerging,” Mr. Brown said before the meeting with Mr. Sarkozy in Versailles, southwest of Paris.The talks were arranged to prepare the European Union’s position ahead of a 20-nation summit meeting on Nov. 15 in Washington, which is intended to explore ways to reorder the global financial system. Mr. Sarkozy holds the rotating presidency of the 27-member European Union.Mr. Brown’s appeal to resource-rich emerging economies to help pay for bailout plans highlights how stretched the Group of 7 industrialized countries have become in dealing with the global economic rout.1219 2008-10-29 Details of the contract, released in an e-mail message by the union, showed that workers would receive a 15 percent increase in pay over the four-year life of the contract, whose length is a year longer than their previous pact.They would also receive at least $8,000 in bonus payments over the first three years of the contract, and would be allowed to transfer some of that money to their pension plan.The union summary also said it had reached new agreements meant to limit Boeing’s use of outside contractors — a crucial dispute between the two sides.Boeing had agreed to preserve the jobs of nearly 2,200 facilities and maintenance employees for the life of the contract, the summary said, and the company promised the union that its vendors could deliver materials only to designated areas of its plants, except for the facility that will assemble the Dreamliner.The union said the tentative agreement had the unanimous endorsement of its negotiatingcommittee. A ratification vote will take place on Saturday, with a simple majority of those voting required for approval.Union leaders, in the e-mail message, said they had gained “important and substantial improvements” over a contract proposal made before Labor Day, which Boeing had called its “best and final offer.”Before the strike, Boeing had offered the union an 11 percent raise over three years, while the union sought 13 percent over that same period. The average machinist is paid about $27 an hour, or $56,000 a year, not including overtime.Boeing’s airplane production halted after the strike began. Last week, it said its third-quarter net income dropped 38 percent because of the strike and other production issues.But Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said he was optimistic a deal would be reached soon, based on informal conversations with union leaders.Last week, Mr. McNerney said there would be a ramp-up period after the strike ended before Boeing resumed full production. The strike had threatened to delay the first test flight of the Dreamliner, whose official name is the Boeing 787, which is scheduled to take place before the end of the year.Production delays already have pushed back the Dreamliner by more than a year. The first planes are now scheduled to be delivered in late 2009.1220 2008-10-29 AMSTERDAM (AP) — The insurance company Aegon said Tuesday that it had taken an investment of 3 billion euros or $3.7 billion from the Dutch government, acting to shore up its cash position in the face of the continuing financial crisis.The company also said it expected to post a loss of around 350 million euros ($436 million) in the third quarter and canceled dividends and executive bonuses for the rest of the year.“We welcome this additional capital buffer that the Dutch state has provided in this time of uncertainty and unprecedented economic turmoil,” the chief executive, Alex Wynaendts, said in a statement.As recently as Oct. 9, Mr. Wynaendts said Aegon could maintain its credit ratings without raising fresh capital.The government aid is the latest of many such interventions in the United States and Europe. In Aegon’s case the question appeared to be when and how, rather than if, it would need support.1221 2008-10-29 REYKJAVIK, Iceland (Reuters) — Iceland’s central bank raised its key interest rate by 6 percentage points, to 18 percent, on Tuesday, two weeks after it had eased policy to soften the impact of the country’s financial crisis.The move, which one economist called extreme, was the latest by authorities to prop up the country’s frozen currency and markets, offering investors a high return for putting money back into the North Atlantic island’s crippled financial system.The head of Iceland’s central bank, David Oddsson, said the increase was part of a deal struck with the International Monetary Fund.The monetary fund and Icelandic authorities agreed on Friday on an economic program under which Iceland would receive a $2 billion standby facility. The agreement requires approval from the agency’s board.A strategist at BNP Paribas Emerging Markets, Elisabeth Gruie, said the increase “has come a bit out of the blue following the latest interest rate cut.”1222 2008-10-29 TIGHTER CREDIT After years of flooding mailboxes with offers for credit cards, lenders are pulling back on solicitations at a time when the economy is squeezing consumers.

For example, General Motors and Ford did not offer iPod integration on most of their models until 2006, after Apple had begun selling its fifth generation of iPods and long after digital music connectivity had become commonplace in aftermarket audio systems.“The technology changes at such a rapid pace that ours is always the latest,” said Jim Grant, a Car Tunes store manager. “It’s a much more seamless integration, and the cost from the aftermarket side is greatly less.”Aftermarket devices are also easier and cheaper to upgrade when newer technology arrives, and are available in a wider variety than similar factory options. Portable devices, like navigation systems, can be shared among a family with multiple cars.On the other hand, because the additions are designed for all vehicles, some do not work as well in or fit as elegantly into individual vehicles as factory systems do. And anything mounted on the windshield by suction cup or plugged into a cigarette lighter outlet adds clutter that an in-dash system does not.Although sales of new vehicles have slumped to their lowest level in more than 15 years, mobile electronics retailers say their business is increasing. Some consumers who put off trading in their cars are instead spending a few hundred dollars to install stereos that integrate with their iPods, systems for hands-free cellphone capabilities and satellite radio receivers.“People are keeping their cars and choosing to put some money into it,” Mr. Grant said.Despite how large the mobile electronics market has become, nearly half of consumers prefer to have such devices installed at the factory, according to a study by the Consumer Electronics Association.This year, 27 percent of the nation’s drivers plan to buy portable electronic devices for their vehicles, compared with 21 percent who plan to have such devices permanently installed, the study said.Navigation units are the most popular portable devices, with sales expected to reach 15 million this year and 18 million in 2009.Portable satellite radio receivers are also big sellers, although demand has fallen now that many automakers offer them as factory options, as are hands-free, Bluetooth cellphone kits.Consumer interest in portable devices has made automakers think more about how to adapt their vehicles to those products. Many cars and trucks now have two or three power outlets in the front seat, and more in the rear for passengers. Most have an auxiliary input for the stereo. U.S.B. ports are increasingly common.“The automakers are very receptive because they understand that technology is increasingly factoring into purchase decisions,” Mr. Koenig said.William Kole, a doctor in Clinton Township, Mich., wanted to play music from his iPod Touch, show DVDs and control his cellphone with voice commands in the 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan that he bought this summer. But rather than add on the $4,000 option from Chrysler that would have given him those extras along with navigation, he paid $1,300 to have Car Tunes install a system made by Pioneer.Dr. Kole also has a Ford Escape sport utility vehicle with many of the same features installed at the factory. But he said the system was not as good as the Pioneer add-on he had bought and “actually cost a lot more.”“Factory stuff is O.K.,” he said, “but I like some of the name-brand stuff. It’s better quality, and they have a lot more options.”1238 2008-10-30 With less than a week to go until Election Day, the two senators were battling for votes in crucial territory....1239 2008-10-30 Six days before the election, Senator John McCain rallied supporters in Florida.1240 2008-10-30 TiVo has another component of its business as well — selling its software to cable and satellite providers, many of whom offer their own generic, lower-priced DVRs to their customers. This year, TiVo won a $104 million judgment in a patent-infringement lawsuit against Dish Networks, which should help it get better bargaining terms as it tries to get other cable and satellite operators to use its technology.People who get TiVo’s service on a partner’s set-top box, like DirecTV’s or Comcast’s, will not have access to the Netflix video service. TiVo hopes that Internet deals like its Netflix partnership can help it sell more of its own devices, which make up only a fraction of the DVR market.“For us this is very much aimed at new customers,” said Tom Rogers, chief executive of TiVo. “There are nine million Netflix subscribers out there who are movie lovers and who want something that really adds juice to their overall television experience.”The deal further extends Netflix’s Watch Instantly service — the inevitable successor to its DVD-by-mail franchise. In the last year, it has signed deals to digitally deliver its catalog to high-definition Blu-ray DVD players from LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics, and to subscribers of Microsoft’s Xbox Live Internet gaming service. Netflix has also invested in Roku, a start-up that manufactures a $99 set-top box that brings Netflix’s streaming service to TVs.Recently, Netflix has been hobbled by the economic downturn. It reported last week that it added far fewer subscribers during its third quarter than it had promised, and its stock has dropped by about 40 percent in the last month.There is a certain irony in the partnership between TiVo and Netflix. In 2004, well before the current industry scrum over bringing digital video into people’s homes, Netflix and TiVo worked together to develop a prototype Internet film-delivery service. The effort was plagued by licensing and technology hurdles and never came to fruition.“That was a great testament to the over-optimism of technologists like me,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, recalling the earlier partnership. “The market just wasn’t ready and our ambitions got a little ahead of us. We couldn’t get enough rights to make it commercially interesting.”Now, he said, Netflix has a growing portfolio of programs available for digital streaming and last month added a catalog of 2,500 films from the Starz cable network. “I think every idea has its time and our time is now,” Mr. Hastings said.1241 2008-10-30 “It’s a source of revenues to the carmakers that they are going to exploit to the fullest,” said Joseph Phillippi, a principal in the firm AutoTrends Consulting in Short Hills, N.J.The days when consumers evaluated cars strictly on their design, performance and safety features are fading fast. Most automakers are competitive in product quality, and they have broadened their lineups to the point where a customer can buy a pickup truck from Toyota as easily as a compact car from Ford.Often the availability of the newest gadget can tip the balance for car buyers.“The cars out there have become so good in all the traditional ways,” said Karl Brauer, editor of the automotive research site Edmunds.com. “Manufacturers all make cars that are safe, reliable, comfortable and have nice design features. Technology is really becoming one of the last points of differentiation.”Five years ago, there wasn’t a single car model that could connect to an iPod, according to Edmunds.com. Now there are 257 models that can hook up to Apple’s ubiquitous music player.During that period, the number of models with D.V.D. entertainment systems has more than doubled. In 2003, there were 40 models available with satellite radio systems. This year, it’s 260.The list goes on — including Bluetooth telephone connections, in-dash navigation systems, rearview cameras and parking sensors, and heated seats, mirrors and cup holders. In August, Chrysler introduced a dealer-installed cellular-Wi-Fi hotspot that lets anyone in the car surf the Internet. Such extras were once available only in expensive luxury cars. But they have found their way into the mass market.“Auto companies are selling economy cars with the same luxury features that started out in the Lexuses and Audis,” Mr. Brauer said. “It allows consumers to personalize their cars without going to some specialty shop.”When Vadim Mitlitski went shopping for a large crossover vehicle, which combines the features of an S.U.V. and a minivan, he considered an array of electronic options that would appeal to his family of four.He chose a Buick Enclave CXL loaded with parking sensors, satellite radio, a tire monitoring system and, most important, a dual-screen D.V.D. player for the rear seats.“Having two kids and in-laws, I wanted something that would keep everybody entertained on long rides,” said Mr. Mitlitski, a 39-year-old research scientist from North Bergen, N.J.Popping in a video for his children is no different from gathering the family to watch television after dinner at home, he said.“Actually, the only difference is my couch is not heated at home like my car seats,” he said.Auto companies are pouring resources into figuring out which new features are most appealing to the largest audience.“The baby boomers are interested in one set of technologies, and the Generation Y consumers have a different view,” said Steve Bartoli, Chrysler’s vice president for global product marketing.Older consumers, particularly minivan, crossover and S.U.V. buyers, want features that appeal to their families.“They want to make sure their children or grandchildren are comfortable and compliant in the vehicle,” said Mr. Bartoli. “They want the D.V.D. players and the ‘stow and go’ seating in the minivan so their kids are happy.”Those under 30 are more interested in music, Web access and voice-activated phone and entertainment systems, he said.Meanwhile, automakers are discovering the difference between the unmet needs of older buyers and the latent desires of a younger crowd.But once a feature like iPod connections catches on with one demographic group, it quickly becomes a “must-have” for others.Ford has embraced what it calls the “democratization” of new technology, meaning the company plans to make its latest features available in all models, not just the most expensive.The company’s voice-activated Sync system, a communication and entertainment network for mobile phones and digital music players, was introduced on the Ford Focus, a lower-priced compact sedan, and then rolled out on more expensive models.“This is technology for everybody, which is exactly what has taken place with cellphones and BlackBerrys and iPods,” Mr. Buczkowski said. “We want customers to think of these technologies as part of our brand, just like safety or performance.”People want to be able to do things in their car that they are used to doing at home, he said.The biggest challenge for automakers is to keep current. Vehicle manufacturers are used to product cycles that take years to complete, but consumer electronics evolve at a much faster pace.The in-vehicle navigation system is a good example. Early versions were limited to maps, traffic reports and the like. But the newest ones can convey real-time sports scores, weather conditions and even the location of a nearby Chinese restaurant.Such advances put automakers in a delicate position between giving consumers more technology and distracting them from driving safely.“The consumer is always going to be looking for something more,” Mr. Bartoli said. “We have to make it easier for them to use new equipment without compromising safety.”Many navigation systems cannot be programmed while driving, and the latest entertainment systems and phones employ voice controls.CUSTOMIZATION of a car is now an integral part of the showroom experience, even for economy models.Toyota’s Scion brand pioneered giving customers a wide range of options to add to models like its boxy xB wagon. Buyers can choose not only elaborate sound systems tailored to the vehicle, but can also decorate it with color-coordinated door handles and gauges.Industry analysts predict that consumers may even be able to change body styles on a vehicle.“We conceivably could have a basic vehicle platform, maybe powered by fuel cells, that has multiple body choices,” Mr. Phillippi said. “You use it as a four-door sedan, but if your needs change you can go down to the dealer and have them put a roomier, crossover body on it for long trips.”For now, consumers will have to be satisfied with loading up the interiors of their vehicles with the comforts of home.Elizabeth Muirhead, a financial analyst from Downingtown, Pa., recently drove her young family to Maryland in her Honda Odyssey minivan.With three young children in the back of the van, the drive could have been a high-stress experience.That was until she put “Charlotte’s Web” on the D.V.D. player and had the kids plug in their headphones, while she and her husband tuned in their own music on the satellite radio system.“It was pretty much what we would have done at home,” she said.1242 2008-10-30 Mr. Wurzelbacher, who has said he wants to buy a small plumbing business, campaigned with Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the vice-presidential nominee, in Ohio on Wednesday.“Now, Joe didn’t ask for Senator Obama to come to his house, and he didn’t ask to be famous,” Mr. McCain said in his speech in here. “He certainly didn’t ask for the political attacks on him from the Obama campaign. Joe’s dream is this dream, Joe’s dream is to own a small business that will create jobs, and the attacks on him are an attack on small businesses all over this country. These are people like Gus the Homebuilder and Peter the Exterminator right here in Miami. Small businesses employ 84 percent of Americans, and we need to support these small businesses, not tax them.”From there, Mr. McCain’s address moved into his new mouthful of a slogan against Mr. Obama, a charge that his Democratic rival would be a redistributor, or the redistributor in chief, or some similar formulation that seems to conjure up images of the internal workings of cars.“Senator Obama is running to be redistributionist in chief,” Mr. McCain said in here. “I’m running to be commander in chief. Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth. I’m running to create more wealth. Senator Obama is running to punish the successful. I’m running to make everyone successful.”Stylistically, Mr. McCain readily admits that he will never be an orator like Mr. Obama, a disparity he has sought to use against his rival, who he regularly says is eloquent but lacks the experience to match his words.While Mr. McCain’s speeches are more smoothly delivered than they used to be, he can still sound angry and sharp, as he did at times here on Wednesday. Still, he has modulated from his harsh tones of early October, when rowdy crowds were shouting insults about Mr. Obama.Only after he delivered his economic message on Wednesday did Mr. McCain get to national security, the issue he had planned to be at the center of his general election campaign.“If we are going to change Washington, we need a president who has actually fought for change and made it happen,” Mr. McCain said. “The next president won’t have time to get used to the office. We face many challenges here at home, and many enemies abroad in this dangerous world.From there, Mr. McCain turned to another favorite Joe, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Obama’s running mate, who told campaign donors at a recent fund-raiser in Seattle that if Mr. Obama was elected, the world’s leaders would test his mettle as a young president, just as they did John F. Kennedy. Mr. McCain has pounced on the remarks as a sign that Mr. Obama is not ready for the presidency, and contrasted that with his own military experience in the 1960s and 1970s.“Senator Biden warned that Senator Obama would be tested with an international crisis,” Mr. McCain said. “I have been tested. Senator Obama hasn’t. Senator Biden referred to how Jack Kennedy was tested in the Cuban missile crisis, and I have a little personal experience in that. I was on board the U.S.S. Enterprise, and I sat in a jet cockpit on the flight deck waiting to take off. We had a target. I know how close we came to a nuclear war, and I will not be a president that needs to be tested.”Mr. McCain continued: “We know Senator Obama won’t have the right response to that test, because we’ve seen the wrong response from him over and over during this campaign. He opposed the surge strategy that is bringing us victory in Iraq and will bring us victory in Afghanistan. He said he would sit down unconditionally with the world’s worst dictators. When Russia invaded Georgia, Senator Obama said the invaded country should show restraint. He’s been wrong on all of these. When I am president, we are going to win in Iraq and win in Afghanistan, and our troops will come home in victory and honor.”Mr. McCain closed his speech with a figurative call to arms.“Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight!” Mr. McCain shouted. “America is worth fighting for. Nothing is inevitable here. We never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history. Now, let’s go win this election and get this country moving again!”1243 2008-10-30 “I’m not in the business of talking about media bias, but what if there was a tape with John McCain with a neo-Nazi outfit being held by some media outlet?” Mr. McCain said in an interview with radio station WAQI in Miami. “I think the treatment of the issue would be slightly different.”Some conservatives question the sincerity of Mr. Obama’s stated support for Israel, a crucial issue to many Jewish voters in swing states like Florida. Mr. Obama’s campaign says that his stance on the matter has not changed and that his public and private positions are identical. Mr. Khalidi has said much the same of the candidate’s stance.In countering the McCain attacks, the Obama campaign also cited a tangential link between Mr. McCain and Mr. Khalidi. Mr. McCain is chairman of the International Republican Institute, which gave grants in the 1990s to the Center for Palestine Research and Studies, of which Mr. Khalidi was a founder, to conduct surveys of Palestinians. The International Republican Institute’s 1998 tax filing says it gave $448,000 to the Palestine group, money that originated with government grants to the Republican organization.The Times article about the dinner said that one speaker had read a poem accusing Israel of terrorism and that another had compared West Bank settlers to Osama bin Laden.“What we don’t know is how Barack Obama responded to these slurs on a country that he professes to support, and the reason we don’t know is the newspaper that has this tape, The Los Angeles Times, refuses to release it,” Ms. Palin said at a rally in Bowling Green, Ohio. “It must be nice for a candidate to have major news organizations looking out for their best interests like that.”Officials of the newspaper said they were inundated with complaining phone calls on Wednesday, after conservative commentators on television, radio and the Internet called for the tape’s release. But Doyle McManus, the paper’s Washington bureau chief, said it was being unfairly maligned for a rather routine agreement with a source.“It’s not unusual for reporters to be given information in ways that allow them to authenticate it but don’t give them complete control of the information,” he said. “We are sometimes shown documents that we are allowed to read but not keep.”He would not say whether The Times still had the tape or whether it showed anything of Mr. Obama’s reactions to anti-Israel statements.1244 2008-10-30 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi says he wants to outlaw graffiti, making it a crime to write or draw on city walls and public buildings in Italy without permission. Mr. Berlusconi said on Wednesday that measures to discourage “people who spoil walls and shops” would be introduced by decree at a cabinet meeting on Friday. Penalties could include fines and even prison sentences, the prime minister said. Early this month, Mr. Berlusconi said that he wanted to eliminate graffiti “because in some of our cities, it looks like we’re in Africa rather than Europe.”1245 2008-10-30 A Syrian court sentenced 12 prominent dissidents to two and a half years each in prison on Wednesday for calling for democratic reforms and an end to the Baath Party’s monopoly on power. The dissidents, 11 men and a woman, were arrested last year after holding a large meeting to revive a movement that called for freedom of expression and a democratic constitution in Syria, which has been ruled by the Baath Party for four decades. Their case has drawn international condemnation, with the United States and European nations repeatedly calling for their release. The defendants, who are among Syria’s leading intellectuals and opposition figures, have been in jail since their arrest. The charges against them included “weakening national morale.”1246 2008-10-30 “There is no crying in baseball, that’s been stated several years ago, and so we’re not going to be a bunch of crybabies,” Maddon said. “If we don’t win this game tonight, you’re going to hear me one time say ‘I wish we had gone back to the beginning’ not once.”SHIELDS WAITS FOR GAME 6 James Shields was scheduled to start Game 6 if the Rays were able to extend the series Monday. Shields told Joe Maddon on Tuesday that he would be willing to pitch in the resumption of Game 5, but it was a brief conversation.“And he basically told me that I have a better chance of pinch-hitting than I do of pitching,” Shields said.MANUEL’S EMBARGO Only a few people knew of Commissioner Bud Selig’s intention to play Game 5 to completion, and that group did not include those with the most invested in the World Series: the players. Manager Charlie Manuel was aware, and though the team was clearly befuddled after play was suspended Monday night, Brett Myers said Wednesday that he supported Manuel’s decision not to tell the players.“I think if we knew about it, that would have taken away from what we really had to go out and accomplish,” said Myers, who would start a potential Game 6 on Thursday night in St. Petersburg, Fla.“You can’t be told it’s going to be nine innings, regardless. I think we needed to play the game like it was going to be nine innings regardless and play hard. I don’t think by them telling us or not telling us it was going to affect how we were going to play. But then again, if they were to have told us about that, it might have affected how we would have played.” BEN SHPIGELPHILLIES WIN IN NEVADA Some sports books in Nevada declared the Philadelphia Phillies the winner of Game 5 of the World Series even though the game was suspended with the score 2-2 in the middle of the sixth inning.A top gambling regulator says a handful of Tampa Bay Rays bettors have complained. The Nevada Gaming Commission enforcement chief Jerry Markling told The Associated Press on Wednesday that different sports books have different rules about baseball betting.Some have rules stating that rain-delayed games are over after a certain period of time. The books use the score from the last completed inning to determine a winner.That would make the Phillies the winner. They led, 2-1, after five innings. (AP) PHILLIES HELPING ECONOMY Thrilled to have their team in the World Series, Phillies fans have been buying team caps, T-shirts, jackets and other souvenirs.“This has blown away everyone’s expectations, including the team, including our vendors,” Howard Smith, Major League Baseball’s senior vice president for licensing, said Wednesday.Chase Card Services said purchases of Phillies merchandise doubled, to $160,000, on the day they made the playoffs. When the Phillies won the pennant, the figure jumped to $271,000 from $108,000.One retailer, Modell’s Sporting Goods, had matched its sales figures from the entire 2007 postseason before the first pitch was thrown Monday night for Game 5, Smith said.Sales of Rays merchandise tripled this season, Smith said.That number is likely to continue to rise with young players like Evan Longoria, B. J. Upton and David Price getting national exposure during the playoffs. (AP)1247 2008-10-30 Qwest Communications International posted a profit for its third quarter Wednesday but said the continued slide of its traditional phone business is forcing it to cut 1,200 jobs, 3 percent of its work force.The cuts will come before the end of the year, and will leave the company with 33,500 employees, 9 percent fewer than at the end of 2007.That is about the same rate at which customers are canceling their phone service to go wireless or sign up with a cable company.The cuts will come from all levels and units, the company said.1248 2008-10-30 But the problem runs deeper. Mr. Sarkozy is trying to promote a stronger economic role for the leaders of European Union states that use the euro, including a more powerful role for himself, in order to put pressure on the European Central Bank and the European Commission, which largely control the euro-zone economy.But other major states, especially Germany, are skeptical about his intentions. They believe that Mr. Sarkozy, who has often excoriated the Central Bank for its focus on limiting inflation, wants to sharply increase the size of France’s budget deficit — despite European Union restrictions — to stimulate an economy considered to be in recession and to create jobs.At the beginning of the American subprime mortgage crisis, Mr. Sarkozy, with France as the current six-month president of the European Union, got good marks for taking action. He called summit meetings, rushed to Washington, made proposals and even pulled the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, whose country does not use the euro, into an extraordinary summit meeting of the leaders of the states using the euro — the so-called Eurogroup. In large part, the activity was intended to calm Europeans looking for leadership in a confusing time.But they are also going to look for results, said Katinka Barysch, an economist and the deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London. “For Sarkozy, it’s a tricky strategy,” she said. “In a situation where confidence is in such short supply, having a politician leave the impression he’s in charge and can do things can be good. But if like Sarkozy, you convene one summit after another and present one idea after another, you raise expectations you can’t fulfill.”Recent pronouncements by Mr. Sarkozy have rubbed the Germans and the British the wrong way, in part because he has reverted to an old habit of acting without consulting his allies.Quite unusually for Europe, Mr. Sarkozy has also called other leaders to summit meetings on extremely short notice, sometimes just a day, a senior European diplomat said, causing consternation and confusion.Mr. Sarkozy’s relations with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have deteriorated again, diplomats and French officials say, over both his lack of consultation and his efforts to pressure the European Central Bank.In particular, Mr. Sarkozy has called for two European initiatives that have been widely criticized. The first is a European Union sovereign fund to protect the ownership of important business with suddenly low stock prices. The other is a “unified economic government” of the European Union that would bring the heads of state together on economic issues, and not just the finance ministers.Mr. Sarkozy argues that leaders must lead, and that with the Czech Republic and then Sweden, neither of which uses the euro, taking over the European Union presidency in 2009, Europe’s ability to deal with the global financial crisis will be reduced.He wants a new dialogue between country leaders and the European Parliament, suggests Daniel Cohen, a professor of economics at the École Normale Supérieure, as a way of undermining the European Commission. Mr. Sarkozy would also like to lead the Eurogroup for that period, instead of Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, Mr. Cohen said.“There is a need to think and talk at the level of Europe, because there will be hard times coming,” Mr. Cohen said. “The ability of France to fight recession will be contingent on the size of its fiscal deficit,” which is already at the European limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.Mr. Sarkozy — and not him alone — wants the European Commission to relax the rules because of the recession, and that will produce “a debate in difficult circumstances” between France and Germany, which supports the limits and does not want to see European institutions undermined.Mr. Sarkozy has worked politically without any real ideology in this crisis, promising safety to the French, appealing to nationalist instincts and trying to play an important role in Europe, and he has helped himself in the polls, said Pierre Rousselin, the foreign editor of Le Figaro.“Sarkozy is a bit a magician without clothes, but the important thing is the perception, and he’s doing pretty well,” Mr. Rousselin said. “The time will come when people ask, ‘Where’s the beef?’ But I’m not sure we’ve reached that point yet. To energize Europe itself is a pretty good thing.”1249 2008-10-30 With auto companies closing factories that produce sport utility vehicles in favor of smaller, gas-efficient cars, it may be hard to veer back to the gas-guzzling days very quickly. But Dan Lopez, business manager at the Ford dealership in the Louisiana town of Sulphur, near here, says he has already noticed a shift. Truck sales froze over the summer, he said, but now “some people are gradually getting back into the truck market. We’re used to the comforts, frills and whistles, and so if gasoline goes down to a reasonable level, people will not stay in a little boxy fuel-efficient car.”Gasoline demand is still down from last year, in part a reflection not just of high prices but also of the economic slowdown. As unemployment goes up, fewer people are driving to work and going out to dinner and shopping. Vacation trips are being put off. Trucking companies are consolidating routes as factory and retail orders slide.Oil prices are sinking as the global economy weakens, and gasoline is following oil downward. The national average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline on Wednesday was $2.59, $1.05 lower than a month ago and more than $1.50 below the record of $4.11 in July. Gas prices have not been this low since March 2007.The latest statistics released by the Department of Transportation for August show that when gasoline prices rose, Americans responded by driving less. In that month Americans drove 15 billion fewer miles, or 5.6 percent less, than in August 2007. It was the 10th consecutive month of a decline in miles driven and the most sustained reduction since the 1970s.It will be a while before the government releases official traffic data covering the last few weeks, when gasoline prices were falling steeply, so it is too soon to say for certain that people are driving more. But along with anecdotal evidence, some early statistical indicators suggest some increase in gasoline demand in recent weeks.Data compiled by MasterCard Advisors, covering both credit and cash sales of gasoline, had been showing a strong decline of gasoline consumption in early October, when prices were still high. For the weeks ending Oct. 3 and Oct. 10, for example, gasoline sales were down 9.5 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively, compared with the same weeks in 2007.But a MasterCard Advisors report released Tuesday showed that in the last two weeks, with pump prices falling, consumption of gasoline was down only 6.4 percent in each week compared with the same weeks of 2007.Michael McNamara, vice president of MasterCard’s SpendingPulse data service, said gasoline consumption declined in recent months because of a combination of the slowing economy and high prices at the pump. “You are starting to get some easing from one of the two pressure points,” he added.Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, said: “Demand is trickling back among everyday people.” He added that gasoline retailers around the country were telling him “they are probably past the bottom of demand destruction for 2008, meaning they see subtle signs that gasoline demand is increasing.”Mr. Kloza and other analysts, however, note that the severity and longevity of the recession will largely determine how much people drive in the coming year. The apparent increase in discretionary driving has by no means translated into improved fortunes for the Detroit automobile companies, whose sales remain deeply depressed, partly because the credit crisis is preventing people from getting car loans.The big uncertainty in the minds of analysts is whether the summer’s run of high gasoline prices wrought any lasting change in the nation’s consumer psychology.Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, said that what happened over the summer “was not demand destruction but demand reduction, which is largely reversible.” He added, “The sharp price increases did not happen long enough to permanently affect behavioral decisions.”Mr. Goldstein’s view, however, is not shared by all energy analysts.“Four-dollar gasoline might have accelerated behavioral changes, but the behavioral changes began at $2.50 or $3 a gallon,” said Aaron Brady, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.A report Mr. Brady co-wrote in June noted that more Americans bought the Toyota Prius hybrid than the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle in 2007 and that the growth in total vehicle miles traveled in the United States slowed significantly in 2005 and 2006, before declining slightly in 2007. The report noted that it was the first time that total vehicle miles had declined since the late 1970s.The Arab oil embargo and Iranian revolution led to oil supply shocks at that time, creating a prolonged period of high gasoline prices that lasted through the mid-1980s. People cut down on their driving and drove smaller cars, and government standards forced a big improvement in the fuel efficiency of the American car fleet.But in the late 1980s, as prices eased, people switched back to larger cars. With prices low through the 1990s and early 2000s, sport utility vehicles became the vehicle of choice for many Americans. Those vehicles, because they were technically light trucks, were subject to lower efficiency requirements.Conservationists hope there will be no similar loopholes in recently adopted efficiency standards that dictate that automakers build vehicles averaging 35.7 miles a gallon for passenger cars and 28.6 miles a gallon for light trucks in model years 2011 through 2015, with better mileage for the trucks after that. Other analysts, however, warn that improved fuel efficiency over the years has simply encouraged people to live farther from work and otherwise drive more miles on the same budget.In Vinton, as in so many American towns, what drivers seem to care about most is the price at the pump, and they said in recent interviews that cheaper gas was helping them live better.Willy Lewis, a nurse’s aide, said he just started mowing his lawn every week again after mowing it every third week this summer to save gasoline. Katina Sneed, a housewife who would like to work as a secretary, complained that higher gasoline prices had impeded her ability to find employment.“I didn’t have enough money to put in the car to look for a job” until the last few weeks, she said. “I can do a little more searching now.”1250 2008-10-30 THE price tag on a men’s cotton suit from Clemens en August, a German label that is difficult to come by, reads $633. It also notes that the suit hypothetically would have cost $1,583 if you were buying it at a store like Barneys New York. But Barneys doesn’t carry the line, nor does any other luxury store.For the last three years, Alexander Brenninkmeijer, the designer of Clemens en August, has sold his collections only in museums and art galleries around the world, usually for no more than three days at a time. Last week, he was in Tokyo at the Zel Gallery. Next week, starting Tuesday, he will be at the Chelsea Art Museum in Manhattan. There’s no middleman, so Mr. Brenninkmeijer charges wholesale.“I thought it would be a good idea to go on tour so we would be able to cut out that high retail margin,” he said.Before starting the label, Mr. Brenninkmeijer worked with the designer Kostas Murkudis, who sold his collections at Harvey Nichols and Bergdorf Goodman. Mr. Brenninkmeijer said that prices were marked up so much it was hard to sell them.“The problem was, for young contemporary designers, there’s hardly any chance to become big independently,” he said. “One of the last designers to have that was Helmut Lang, but even he was taken over by Prada.” (That didn’t exactly work out, either.)Mr. Brenninkmeijer’s collection was called Clemens en August after the founding brothers of C&A, his family’s fashion business in the Netherlands, but it operates independently and has a more austere luxury look, with slim tuxedo suits or techno fabric jackets for women, and an emerald velvet suit or shiny athletic pants for men. A women’s silk blouse costs $365, and a jersey dress with a cotton back is $255.1251 2008-10-30 Wearing a flag pin, Santos announces his candidacy by telling supporters, “I am here to tell you that hope is real.” And he adds, “In a life of trial, in a world of challenges, hope is real.” Viewers can almost hear the crowd cheering, “Yes, we can.”Comparisons between Senator John McCain and the “West Wing” Republican candidate, Arnold Vinick, a white-haired Senate stalwart with an antitax message and a reputation for delivering “straight talk” to the press, also abound. Vinick, played by Alan Alda, is deemed a threat to Democrats because of his ability to woo moderate voters. And he takes great pride in his refusal to pander to voters, telling an aide: “People know where I stand. They may not like it, but they know I’ll stick with it.”Even the vice-presidential picks are similar: the Democrat picks a Washington veteran as his vice presidential candidate to add foreign policy expertise to the ticket, while the Republican selects a staunchly conservative governor to shore up the base.Certainly some of the parallels are coincidental. It is unlikely, for example, that the writers knew Mr. Obama had an affection for Bob Dylan when they made Santos a Dylan fan. But it is the unintentional similarities that make the DVDs of the sixth and seventh seasons, which at the time received mixed reviews, so rewarding to watch now. In both “The West Wing” and in real life, for example, the Phillies played in the World Series during the election campaign.As the primaries unfolded this year, “I saw the similarities right away,” said Lawrence O’Donnell, a producer and writer for the series who has appeared on MSNBC as a political analyst. Mr. O’Donnell had used Mr. McCain as one of the templates for the Vinick character in the episodes he wrote, though he said that “McCain’s resemblance to the Vinick character was much stronger in 2000 than in 2008.”Echoing the criticism Mr. McCain faced during the primaries, a White House aide in “The West Wing” contends that Vinick is “not conservative enough” for the Republican base. Sometimes the two candidates’ situations are almost identical: when the press starts asking where Vinick attends church, he tells his staff that “I haven’t gone to church for a while.” Asked in July by The New York Times about the frequency of his church attendance, Mr. McCain said, “Not as often as I should.”Mr. Alda and Mr. McCain are the same age. When a hard-edged strategist played by Janeane Garofalo joins the Santos campaign, she immediately alludes to Vinick’s age. “He’s been in the Senate for like 90 years. He was practically born in a committee room,” she says.In the same way that Obama surrogates have subtly knocked Mr. McCain’s lack of computer skills, the Garofalo character remarks to the Santos campaign manager, Josh Lyman: “Why are you always talking about high-tech jobs? Because Vinick uses a manual typewriter.”Conversely, Santos staffers talk about getting video of the candidate with his “adorable young children hugging their hale and vital dad.” The casting of Mr. Smits introduced story lines about the prospect of a minority president. But when an aide suggests a fund-raising drive in a Latino community, Santos snaps: “I don’t want to just be the brown candidate. I want to be the American candidate.” The Obama campaign has made similar assertions.Still, “The West Wing” — like Mr. Obama — does not ignore racial issues entirely. In the seventh season Santos delivers a speech on race at a critical moment for his campaign, and staffers privately worry that voters will lie about their willingness to vote for a minority candidate.If the show sometimes seems like a political fantasy — a real debate where politicians are required to answer questions? a candidate rejecting an attack ad? — it also reflects the tenor of the real-life campaign season.Santos wins the nomination only after a lengthy fight on the convention floor, an inexact parallel to Obama’s extended primary fight with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Just as the Obama campaign pivoted to the economy this fall, Lyman tells Santos staffers that “this new economic message may be our ticket,” and he winds up being right. An economic crisis does not ensue, but back-to-back emergencies on “The West Wing” — a nuclear power plant malfunction and a dispute in Kazakhstan — bring to mind the election-defining qualities of the actual economic crisis.“Dramatically, they are exactly the same thing: the unforseeable,” Mr. O’Donnell said.As President Bush did during the bailout talks, Jed Bartlet, the Democratic “West Wing” president played by Martin Sheen, brings both candidates to the White House for a briefing. Facing the prospect of deploying 150,000 American soldiers to Kazakhstan three weeks before the election, Vinick grumbles, “I can say goodbye to my tax cut.” He tells Santos, “Your education plan’s certainly off the table.”Santos emerges victorious weeks later, but only after a grueling election night. Online, some “West Wing” fans are wondering whether the show will wind up forecasting the real-life result as well. In Britain, where the series remains popular in syndication, a recent headline on a blog carried by the newspaper The Telegraph declared: “Barack Obama will win: It’s all in ‘The West Wing.’ ”1252 2008-10-30 Procter & Gamble lowered its full-year forecasts on Wednesday because of a stronger dollar and higher costs for materials used in products like Tide laundry detergent.The company lowered the bottom end of its profit forecast for the current fiscal year, which began July 1, citing volatility in commodity, energy and currency markets.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer products maker, said it still faced high commodity prices.“We’re not seeing that commodity recession. You might be seeing it on television, but we’re not seeing it in the reality in the marketplace,” A. G. Lafley, chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call.Now that prices of some commodities are falling, analysts have questioned whether consumers will soon see lower prices in stores as well.1253 2008-10-30 Blasting music too loud for too long through an iPod’s headphones could lead to damaged ears or hearing loss years down the road. Most recent iPods have a volume-limit control on the settings menu that can be used to lower the maximum volume to a more ear-friendly level.On the iPod Classic, the volume-limit feature is under the settings menu. On newer iPod Nanos, go to the settings menu to playback and then to volume limit. On an iPod Touch, tap the settings icon, then tap on the music icon on the next screen to get to volume limit. Parents worried about the children resetting the iPod to the maximum volume can lock the volume level with a four-digit code. J. D. BIERSDORFER1254 2008-10-30 A scientific panel has issued a blistering report against the Food and Drug Administration, saying it ignored important evidence in reassuring consumers about the safety of the controversial chemical bisphenol-A.The panel, in a report issued this week, did not draw any conclusions about the safety of the chemical, known as BPA. But it criticized the drug agency as ignoring crucial studies and using what it said were flawed methods in reaching its conclusions.The agency’s evaluation of BPA “creates a false sense of security” and “overlooks a wide range of potentially serious findings,” the report said.In a statement, the agency said that the report “raised important questions” and that more study was needed, but it did not back away from its claim that the chemical was safe. It will review the report on Friday.BPA is widely used to make hard, clear plastic water bottles and baby bottles, and it is found in the lining of nearly every soft drink and canned food product. The chemical appears to have estrogen-like effects, and in animal studies it appears to accelerate puberty and pose a cancer risk.1255 2008-10-30 Hungarian stocks and the currency soared Wednesday after the country secured more than $25 billion in backing from global institutions led by the International Monetary Fund.Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the monetary fund, said late Tuesday in Washington that a deal had been reached to provide Hungary a 17-month stand-by loan of 12.5 billion euros, or $15.7 billion. The European Union said it was ready to provide a loan of 6.5 billion euros or about $8.1 billion, while the World Bank agreed to provide 1.0 billion euros, or $1.3 billion.“The Hungarian authorities have developed a comprehensive policy package that will bolster the economy’s near-term stability and improve its long-term growth potential,” Mr. Strauss-Kahn said in the statement. “At the same time it is intended to restore investor confidence and alleviate the stress experienced in recent weeks in the Hungarian financial markets.”The package is subject to approval by the executive board of the monetary fund.The Budapest Stock Exchange rose more than 11 percent, and the currency, the forint, also rose. The dollar fell 2 percent, to 201.32 forint, after a decline of 5.3 percent Tuesday on expectations that a deal would be reached.“Panics contain some irrational elements,” Julius Horvath, head of the economics department at the Central European University in Budapest, said. “But my intuition is that this is a pretty substantial package.”1256 2008-10-30 TOKYO — Sony reported a 72 percent drop in profit in the most recent quarter on Wednesday, hurt by a stronger yen and the global slowdown.The poor results were expected, after the Tokyo-based electronics and entertainment conglomerate last week cut its annual profit forecast for the fiscal year through March 2009 by 58 percent.Sony made that revision after sales of its Bravia line of flat-panel televisions and digital cameras fell faster than expected in October, suggesting a deepening slump in the second half of the fiscal year.Sony has joined a succession of Asian exporters reporting lower earnings, including Canon, Samsung and Honda, which all cut yearly forecasts. They have blamed drops in global and particularly American demand, contradicting an old notion that Asian economies were decoupling from the United States.This evidence of continued vulnerability to an American slowdown, combined with panicked selling because of the financial crisis, has hammered stock prices across the region. Shares in companies like Sony, once a darling of foreign investors, have plunged as these investors have fled. That drove Sony’s shares to a 16-year low on Monday.1257 2008-10-30 Senator Barack Obama broadcast a half-hour prime time infomercial on Wednesday  on three of the major broadcast networks -- Fox, NBC and CBS -- as well as Univision, BET, TV One and MSNBC.

He steadfastly turns down requests to do interviews in English, professing not to be able to communicate well enough.Approached by an Associated Press reporter after a recent practice, Semin winked and grinned and said clearly, “I don’t speak English.”Later, his English also seemed fine as he rebuffed a member of the Capitals’ public relations staff who tried to persuade Semin to talk.“He understands more than he lets on,” said Capitals General Manager George McPhee, who signed Semin to a $9.2 million, two-year contract extension that runs through next season. “Every once in a while, he’ll blurt out a sentence in English. Like yesterday, he’s the one who yelled down the hall to the rest of the players, ‘We have a meeting in two minutes!’ He knows what’s going on.”Still, Semin leaves it to others to explain his progress.McPhee, Coach Bruce Boudreau and teammates point to two main factors: Semin is healthy, and, at 24, he is growing up.“It’s maturation. That’s the big key, right there,” Boudreau said. “His responsibility on the ice. His work ethic. All of those things.”Semin now shows up for optional skating sessions, for example.It’s not merely that Semin tied a franchise record for points through nine games, which is a good thing for the Capitals, considering Ovechkin put the puck in the net in only one game this season.It’s also that Semin is cutting down on no-excuse penalties, with only four minutes in the box so far. And he’s making a real effort to help out at the defensive end.In Tuesday night’s game against the Nashville Predators — which Ovechkin missed — Semin was on the ice for nearly seven minutes during penalty kills, more than all but one teammate. On each of Nashville’s first three power plays, Semin helped eat time by making a steal, converting one into a pretty pass that set up a short-handed goal by Steckel.“Phenomenal,” Steckel said. “When you play with him, you get a lot of good passes.”Then, eight seconds into a Capitals power play in the third period, Semin took a pass from Nicklas Backstrom and powered a wrister over goalie Dan Ellis’s left shoulder and just under the crossbar with such velocity that the puck snapped right back onto the ice.Semin stood there, motionless, staring at the puck. Only when his teammates skated over to hug him and smack him on the back did he smile.“It’s kind of depressing,” Washington forward Matt Bradley said good-naturedly, “knowing I’ll never be able to do half the moves he does.”Ellis said: “He’s got a world-class shot, he’s got a great set of hands, he works really well, he’s got teammates that play well with him, and he’s in a system he can exploit.”1291 2008-10-31 Still, the two candidates’ positions on criminal justice have been defined over their years in public life and provide some insight into how they might govern as president.In a speech before the National Sheriffs’ Association this year, Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, called for tougher punishment for violent offenders and appeared to disagree with Mr. Obama’s contention that the prison population is too high.“We still hear some academics and politicians speaking as if a rising rate of incarceration and a reduction in crime were unrelated facts,” Mr. McCain said. “But, of course, when the most violent and persistent criminals are in prison, crime rates will go down.”Mr. McCain has also opposed assault rifle bans and restrictions on certain kinds of high-capacity ammunition magazines, positions contrary to those of Mr. Obama, Democrat of Illinois.Both candidates say they will increase financing to law enforcement agencies — Mr. Obama has said he would like to reinstate the COPS grants created by President Bill Clinton but abandoned by President Bush. Mr. McCain said he would eliminate Justice Department earmarks, calling them “the broken windows of the federal budget process.”“As it is, funds distributed by the Department of Justice are too often earmarked according to their value to the re-election of members of Congress instead of their value to police,” Mr. McCain said.Mr. McCain also favors tougher sentences for illegal immigrants who commit crimes and more federal money to help local agencies detain them.Both candidates supported the Second Chance Act of 2007, which provides money for job training and for drug counseling and other re-entry programs.Mr. Obama has emphasized civil liberties, sensitivity to racial inequality and tough penalties for the most violent felons. He was a state lawmaker when the Illinois police and prosecutors were under siege. In 2003, doubt was cast on the convictions of several Illinois death-row inmates leading to a death-penalty moratorium that is still in effect.Some critics say Mr. Obama’s role in the death-penalty moratorium has been exaggerated. Christine Radogno, a Republican state senator, said that Mr. Obama took credit for work accomplished by Gov. George Ryan, a Republican who imposed the moratorium, pardoned a number of death-row inmates, and established a commission to study capital punishment.“To claim that Barack was the impetus for those reforms is an overstatement,” Ms. Radogno said.Recent disclosures have revealed that Chicago police officers had tortured suspects into giving false confessions.A member of the State Senate’s judiciary committee, Mr. Obama on several occasions was helpful in placating law enforcement officials while also helping pass criminal justice legislation opposed by many of them, according to Illinois police officers and prosecutors.As a state lawmaker, Mr. Obama supported changes to the death penalty, including a bill that let judges reject a death sentence for someone convicted on the sole basis of an informant’s testimony.He also opposed a measure that would have applied the death penalty for gang-related murders because he feared that the law would be applied unevenly.“He had to bridge a very diverse constituency which included Hyde Park and some very tough areas on the South Side,” said Richard Devine, the Cook County state’s attorney, who at first opposed and then supported Mr. Obama’s videotaped interrogations measure.“He had to keep the liberals happy, but also protect people in high-crime areas,” Mr. Devine said.Among the most hotly contested measures was one that required police officers to electronically record homicide interrogations, a requirement intended to reduce the number of forced or false confessions.Illinois was the first state to pass legislation requiring such a widescale electronic recording, and it was initially resisted by the police and prosecutors.Mr. Obama shuttled between both sides at the Statehouse in Springfield, eventually writing several compromises into the bill that helped gain its passage. They included limiting the mandatory recordings to interviews conducted at police stations, and providing money for smaller police and sheriff’s departments to buy recording equipment.On other legislation, Mr. Obama has been criticized for not taking the initiative and for voting “present” rather than yea or nay. One measure would have increased penalties for dealing certain drugs and another would have required adult prosecution for minors accused of firing a gun near a school.Richard Pearson, the chief lobbyist for the Illinois State Rifle Association, called Mr. Obama “an amiable fellow” who was “the king of the ‘present’ votes.”Mr. Pearson said Mr. Obama was a consistent opponent of gun rights. He said Mr. Obama, as a state senator, voted against a law that waived gun registration laws for people who used their firearms in their own homes in self-defense.Since being elected to the United States Senate in 2004, Mr. Obama has helped sponsor legislation intended to reduce the disparity in prison sentences for crack cocaine versus powder cocaine because of his concern that existing laws unfairly discriminate against ethnic minorities.He has also said he would instruct the Justice Department — particularly the Civil Rights Division — to change mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, create loan-forgiveness programs for law students who become public defenders, and increase the number of police officers nationally.1292 2008-10-31 The briefing on Afghanistan appears to have been the most extensive that Bush administration officials have provided on any issue to both presidential campaigns. It was organized by Barnett R. Rubin, an Afghanistan expert and a professor at New York University, and included John K. Wood, the senior Afghanistan director at the National Security Council; Lt. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry, a former American commander in Afghanistan who is now at NATO headquarters; and Kai Eide, the United Nations representative in Afghanistan, according to some participants.“The intent was to ensure that everyone understand that the situation is very fast-moving, and if the new administration spends three months trying to figure out what to do, it’s too late,” said one administration official who participated in the discussion.The Obama campaign sent Jonah Blank, a foreign policy specialist for Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Craig Mullaney, another Afghanistan adviser for Mr. Obama, participants said. They said the McCain campaign was represented by Lisa Curtis and Kori Schake, two former State Department officials.The sessions were unclassified, but the participants agreed not to discuss their briefings or the contents of their discussions publicly.The briefing was part of an effort by the departing Bush administration to ease the transition to the next team in a time of war and economic dislocation and allowed officials to try to have some influence over the next administration’s plans.Both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain have promised to increase the number of American troops in Afghanistan. Many in Washington are awaiting the results of a review to be led by Gen. David H. Petraeus, who takes over command of all United States forces in Iraq and Afghanistan at Central Command on Friday.American intelligence officials believe that Taliban commanders are convinced that they are winning. Not only are they establishing themselves in larger swaths of the country, but their campaign of violence is shaking the will of European countries contributing troops to the NATO mission.General Petraeus’s review will ultimately make recommendations about whether additional troops are needed in Afghanistan and, if so, how many. Gen. David D. McKiernan, the top American commander in Afghanistan, has requested three additional brigade combat teams for the mission, above the one extra Army brigade and one Marine Corps battalion already approved by President Bush.General McKiernan’s request, if approved, would be expected to add more than 15,000 combat and support troops to the mission, beyond the 8,000 or so scheduled to arrive in January under the orders issued by Mr. Bush.American commanders have also spoken of the importance of better engaging Afghan tribes as a weapon against Taliban encroachment. Some have suggested using the model of the “tribal awakening” that occurred in Iraq, when the American military teamed with some former Sunni insurgents to try to drive out Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.But General McKiernan has cited significant differences in the history and culture of Afghanistan, as well as a greater complexity in the Afghan tribal system, as reasons why the Iraqi model does not directly apply in Afghanistan. Of the more than 400 major tribal networks inside Afghanistan, the general said recently, most have been “traumatized by over 30 years of war, so a lot of that traditional tribal structure has broken down.”1293 2008-10-31 Television networks needed a hit, and Barack Obama gave them one.An infomercial on behalf of Mr. Obama was a smashing ratings success on Wednesday night, proving to be more popular than even the final game of the World Series — and last season’s finale of “American Idol.” The audience for Mr. Obama’s program far exceeded the expectations of television executives — and many political pundits who questioned whether Mr. Obama was engaging in overkill in buying a half hour on so many networks.Mr. Obama’s 30-minute commercial, which played on seven networks, broadcast and cable, was seen by 33.55 million viewers, according to figures released by Nielsen Media Research. On the three broadcast networks that carried the special, the audience totaled more than 25 million, easily surpassing the number for the last World Series game on Fox, which averaged 19.8 million viewers. The special was also available on Univision, and three cable networks, MSNBC, BET and TV One.“I was shocked by the number Obama was able to draw,” said Leslie Moonves, the chairman of CBS. “It’s just a stunning number.”On CBS, the infomercial was seen by about 8.6 million viewers, a number that topped the show CBS usually runs on Wednesday night at 8, “Old Christine,” which averages about 7.2 million.On NBC, the disparity was even greater. Its regular show there, “Knight Rider,” has been averaging just under 7 million viewers. Mr. Obama pulled in 9.8 million for his half-hour special.MSNBC, where the Obama campaign bought the half hour at the last minute because ABC decided to stick with its hourlong show, “Pushing Daisies,” improved by more than 50 percent over usual audience totals.1294 2008-10-31 WASHINGTON (AP) — In a decision that could reshape the way banks and high-tech firms protect their intellectual property, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday that a man’s business concept was too vague for patent protection.The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled against Bernard Bilski, who had attempted to patent a method for managing weather-related risk through commodities trading. The Patent and Trademark Office had rejected his application, saying it did not involve a particular machine and did not physically transform anything.Relying heavily on 1970s-era Supreme Court decisions that established the “machine-or-transformation test,” the Chief Judge, Paul Michel wrote for a nine-judge majority Thursday that Mr. Bilski’s patent application did not meet an older definition of “process” under patent law.The decision was watched closely by many industries because it could determine whether thousands of existing patents will hold up in court. People accused of patent infringement might argue that under the new case, those older patents are invalid.The industries most affected are financial services and software companies, which gain competitive advantages by developing complex ideas that might not always lead to tangible results.Mr. Bilski could not be reached for comment. His attorney, David Hanson, said, “obviously we’re disappointed,” but that he had not yet conferred with Mr. Bilski about a possible appeal.1295 2008-10-31 SAN FRANCISCO — I.B.M. sued one of its top executives on Thursday in an attempt to prevent him from taking a position at Apple.The company said that the executive, Mark Papermaster, who until last week had been manager in charge of the company’s blade server business, had signed a noncompete agreement with I.B.M. that would prevent him from accepting a job with a competitor until one year after leaving I.B.M.The company said that Mr. Papermaster had been one of its top 300 managers and that he had access to a wide range of the company’s intellectual property and trade secrets.“Mr. Papermaster’s employment by Apple is a violation of his agreement with I.B.M. against working for a competitor should he leave I.B.M.,” said Fred McNeese, director of I.B.M.’s corporate media relations group. “We will vigorously pursue this case in court.” The suit was filed at the United States District Court in Manhattan.Until leaving the company last week, Mr. Papermaster was vice president of I.B.M.’s Blade Development unit, an organization that sells computers for corporate data centers. In the past he has also headed technology development for the company and has played a major role in the design of its Power microprocessors.Apple also has a small business selling a server version of its computer systems that is aimed at corporate applications. However, Mr. Papermaster has also held other positions at I.B.M. Apple may also be interested in Mr. Papermaster’s processor design expertise. Earlier this year, Apple purchased PA Semi, a small microprocessor design firm that was developing microprocessors based on the I.B.M. Power design. At the time Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, said that Apple would use that expertise to create hardware for its iPhones and iPods.1296 2008-10-31 Those who execute corners usually make lots of money from the short-sellers. But they end up owning a company for which they paid too much. The stock is delisted from the stock exchange, since there no longer are enough public shareholders, so there is no ready market for the stock. If the group that executed the corner used borrowed money, they may be in big trouble.In the 1920s, the most famous corner in the United States was in stock in Piggly Wiggly, a grocery store chain. The corner was successful, but the man who executed it eventually went broke.But there have been successful corners. Cornelius Vanderbilt once pulled one off, with members of the New York City Council as the victims. They had tried to profit by shorting a railroad company Vanderbilt controlled, and then revoking the company’s principal asset, a license to operate a street railway. Vanderbilt bought shares, and kept the price from falling. Owning more shares than there were outstanding, he offered to let the council members cover their short positions with only small losses, if they reinstated the license. They did.The big loser in that corner was a legendary speculator, Daniel Drew, who had proposed the idea to the council members. He was forced to purchase shares at very high prices.It is Drew who is credited with the saying “He who sells what isn’t his’n, must buy it back or go to pris’n.”For the cornerer, there is also the risk that rules will change when powerful people get in trouble. That was one of the things that broke the Hunt brothers’ attempted corner in silver back in 1980. The authorities made it almost impossible to bet on silver prices rising, and the Hunts went broke.Now, from Germany we have a new version of the corner, using derivatives in a way that may have removed much of the risk for the people planning the corner.Briefly, here are the relevant facts: Porsche, for some reason, wants to control Volkswagen, and has been building up its stake, thereby driving up the price. Hedge funds, figuring the share price would fall as soon as Porsche got control and stopped buying, sold a lot of VW shares short.Then last weekend, Porsche revealed that it owned 42.6 percent of the stock, and had acquired options for another 31.5 percent. It said it wanted to go to 75 percent.The result: instant short-squeeze. The German state of Lower Saxony owns a 20 percent stake in VW, which it said it would not sell. That left precious few shares available for anyone else. The shorts scrambled to cover, and the price leaped from about 200 euros to a high of over 1,000 euros. VW became the world’s most valuable company, if you believed that market price.It appears that Porsche put one over on whoever wrote that option, or options. The options are said to be cash-settled, although we do not know much more about them than that. That means Porsche does not have to buy the shares — which it might have a lot of trouble paying for. Instead, at settlement it merely has to accept the cash difference between the market price and the price it has agreed to pay. The result could be tens of billions of euros in profits, without the headache of owning shares no one else wants to buy.There has been a lot of speculation about who is on the hook for those options. Of course, those people may have used other derivatives to lay off some of their risk on who-knows-who-else. That is one result of having opaque markets, which Wall Street used to love because it made for higher profit margins. Now it may be one more loss for some already reeling bank or banks.After all this is done, the VW share price will fall to some more reasonable level. And there are rumors that Porsche has purchased put options, presumably with later exercise dates, to profit from that fall.By Tuesday night, the establishment was fighting back. Germany’s premier stock index, the DAX, was changed to cut VW’s proportion in it. That allowed index funds to sell stock, adding to the supply of shares, and VW’s shares are back to about 500 euros.In the United States, there are numerous laws and regulations to stop corners. But Porsche insists it broke no German laws, adding that “allegations of price manipulation by Porsche are therefore without any foundation whatsoever.” It placed the blame on — you guessed it — “speculative short sellers.”If this works, Porsche will have made billions from a car company at a time when cars are not selling very well. It will not have done that by selling cars, but a profit is a profit.Of course, rules can be changed, as Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt learned. The brothers angrily protested that it was unfair to change the rules in the middle of the game, but the rules were changed and the brothers went from billionaires to bankrupts.If it comes to a question of whether regulators step in, Porsche has the advantage of facing off against short-selling hedge funds. There may not be a less popular group of investors, and their losses would provoke little sympathy.But banks now have friends in high places. If Porsche’s option coup threatens a major bank, the bank might ask for help. Will governments step in to protect their investments? Stay tuned.1297 2008-10-31 “We think we can win over a swath of conservative Democrats as well as independents and obviously Republicans,” said the campaign’s political director, Mike DuHaime.What Mr. DuHaime and Mr. McCain’s other advisers leave unsaid is that without Ohio, Mr. McCain will most likely lose the election.So, as Sandusky goes, so goes the nation, or so the McCain campaign hopes. To help, Mr. McCain enlisted Joe the Plumber, otherwise known as Samuel J. Wurzelbacher of Holland, Ohio, the McCain campaign’s embodiment of a small-business American everyman. But despite Mr. Wurzelbacher’s newfound celebrity, he had something of a wobbly start on Thursday.“Joe’s with us today!” Mr. McCain called out at the rally at Defiance Junior High School. “Joe, where are you? Where is Joe? Is Joe here with us today?”“Joe, I thought you were here today,” Mr. McCain continued, with dimmed enthusiasm.Still nothing. The crowd murmured.“All right,” Mr. McCain said, realizing that Joe was nowhere to be found. “Well, you’re all Joe the Plumbers!”It turned out that Mr. Wurzelbacher, as he told CNN, had never received final confirmation from the McCain campaign that he was expected. The campaign, after watching Mr. McCain haplessly call out for Mr. Wurzelbacher on the cable networks, dispatched a car and rushed the plumber to Mr. McCain’s next event, in Sandusky, where Mr. Wurzelbacher spoke.“All right guys, I didn’t prepare anything,” Mr. Wurzelbacher said at a rally at the Washington Park gazebo in Sandusky. “The only thing I’ve been saying is just get out and get informed. I mean, really know what you’re talking about when you’re talking about it. Don’t take everyone’s opinions. I came to my own opinions by research. Get involved in the government. That way we can hold our politicians accountable and take back our government. It’s all ours.”Mr. Wurzelbacher is the man Mr. Obama encountered in Holland on Oct. 12 and told him in response to a question about the flat tax that he wanted to “spread the wealth around.” The McCain campaign seized on the remarks and has been trying to portray Mr. Obama as a socialist.Mr. McCain’s Ohio bus tour took him from west to east, from Defiance to Youngstown, across solid Republican areas and then into “Reagan Democrat” counties where Mr. McCain wants to appeal to working-class and conservative Democrats. He will spend another full day here on Friday.Mr. Obama, who has traveled extensively across the state, will be here again on Sunday.Ohioans have come to expect no less. “This year some other states are trying to supplant our role as the decider,” said John C. Green, a political scientist and pollster who is director of the Bliss Institute at the University of Akron. “And I have to say, a lot of Ohioans are getting pretty irritated by that.”1298 2008-10-31 WASHINGTON — Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.The American Bankers Association complained on Thursday that bankers around the country were “extremely upset” about how the Treasury Department was trying to offer them billions of dollars in fresh capital.“These bankers believe they are being asked — in some cases pressured — to participate in a program they did not want and do not need,” wrote Edward L. Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association, in a blistering letter to the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.Saying he had “deep concerns with the lack of clarity about the program,” Mr. Yingling said the confusion had grown sharply this week over what the government’s purpose was.The bank lobbying group said the main confusion was over whether the purpose of the program was to shore up healthy banks, as Mr. Paulson has insisted, or to rescue failing ones.Mr. Yingling said he was alarmed that lawmakers in Congress were criticizing the Bush administration for its reluctance to impose tougher restrictions on banks that accept government money. Some Democratic lawmakers have complained that banks are taking taxpayer money with one hand while paying out dividends to shareholders with the other. Some policy makers have also complained that banks are not lending enough and might be paying their executives too much.1299 2008-10-31 But supporters say much of that criticism is unfair, given that the crisis originated in the United States. They also say that Mr. Lee is starting to find his stride, coming up with tax cuts and public money to stem the crisis.Backers and opponents alike agree that Mr. Lee still has a battle ahead to win back the faith of South Korea’s often fickle public, which turned against him soon after he took office because of a trade deal resuming American beef imports. “He is still struggling to live down the beef fiasco,” said Jasper Kim, a professor of international relations at Ewha Women’s University in Seoul. “The public’s loss of faith has hung over him during this financial crisis.”Mr. Lee still appears to have a long way to go in regaining that trust. An Oct. 20 opinion poll showed 24 percent of Koreans supporting Mr. Lee, and 31 percent approving of his handling of the economic crisis. That is up from an approval rating of 15 percent in June, when Seoul streets were filled with huge candlelight vigils against the American beef deal. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus five percentage points.“People had high expectations of Lee Myung-bak with his image as being the economic president,” said Yoon Hee-woong, a researcher at the Korea Society Opinion Institute, which conducted the polls. “People got disappointed because they have yet to see the government perform.”After first playing down the threat, Mr. Lee changed his tune, saying last week that the financial crisis was worse than the crash of 1998, when the won plummeted. He has also taken measures aimed at shoring up the banking system and the broader economy, including cutting taxes, approving $4 billion in spending to stimulate construction and pledging $130 billion to ease banks’ foreign currency shortages.On Monday he made a rare address to the National Assembly, warning South Koreans to “pull together their strength and wisdom again,” a reference to the nation’s recovery from 1998.“President Lee was slow to realize the seriousness of the crisis,” said Kim Jung-sik, an economics professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. “But he realizes it now.”Still, the perception remains that Mr. Lee and his ministers have been inconsistent on important economic issues and particularly on currency policy. The finance minister, Mr. Kang, initially backed a weak won to bolster exports. However, when that led to politically unpopular price increases for imported oil and other commodities, the government intervened to jack up the currency. When financial markets started tumbling last month, the government appeared to change again, not intervening to halt the won’s fall.Critics say Mr. Lee’s administration has also appeared inconsistent on another crucial issue, foreign reserves. The administration has said that South Korea holds enough dollars to repay all its loans from overseas, but has also urged companies and individuals to help the nation by exchanging their dollars for won.“One day, he says we’re O.K. The next day, he says we are in trouble,” said Lee Geun, a professor of international studies at Seoul National University. “His flip-flopping has been very confusing.”Analysts say Mr. Lee badly needs to appear effective during the current crisis, after the setbacks on his major economic initiatives so far. The slowing economy makes it unlikely that he can deliver on campaign pledges of achieving 7 percent growth and a doubling of average annual incomes to $40,000. Mr. Lee, a former chief executive of Hyundai Construction, has also shelved for now his pet project of building a 336-mile canal across South Korea.“Lee Myung-bak has not had a single big policy success so far,” said Dr. Lee of Seoul National University. “He needs something to show.”1300 2008-10-31 It wasn’t so long ago that the composer and violinist Daniel Bernard Roumain was devoting himself to chamber works, occasional orchestral scores and vigorous ensemble pieces that combined elements of classical music, rock, jazz and hip-hop. But thanks to a three-work commission from the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Mr. Roumain has been thinking in larger, more theatrical terms lately.The first piece, “One Loss Plus,” heard last November, is a quirky 80-minute exploration of loss, both personal and global, based partly on stories posted, at Mr. Roumain’s invitation, on YouTube. Mr. Roumain unveiled the second installment, “Darwin’s Meditation for the People of Lincoln,” at the Harvey Theater on Wednesday evening. It was meant to be less freewheeling than “One Loss Plus,” but Mr. Roumain’s openness and curiosity got the better of him.As he explains in a fascinating program note, he originally planned a piece about Abraham Lincoln, in time for Lincoln’s bicentennial. In his research he discovered that Charles Darwin was born on the same day, Feb. 12, 1809, and shared Lincoln’s moral aversion to slavery. So Darwin was invited to the party as well. It turned out that Darwin had a great fondness for Haiti, and Mr. Roumain often draws on his own Haitian roots in his music. Haiti also became part of the piece, its national anthem and some Creole songs joining the Darwin and Lincoln writings from which the work was built.Mr. Roumain engaged the playwright Daniel Beaty to compile and narrate the text, and when he decided to include lyrics by the Haitian singer and songwriter Emeline Michel, he invited her to join the production too. Add Mr. Roumain’s orchestral music and his own electric-violin playing, and you’ve got a pretty crowded score.To a great extent Mr. Roumain and his collaborators made this overstuffed piece work. Mr. Beaty’s text so thoroughly intertwined Lincoln’s thoughts and Darwin’s that it wasn’t always evident which was the source, and text fragments were repeated and recombined like musical themes throughout the work. Ms. Michel’s singing and recitation, in French and English, had an appealing, slightly throaty quality, and Mr. Roumain’s solos, though occasionally showy, were mostly ruminative and lyrical.But the orchestral score, played by SymphoNYC and conducted by Paul Haas, seemed almost incidental. Much of the time it either provided a slow-moving, hazy, string-dominated backdrop to Mr. Beaty’s text or slipped into an oddly cheesy orchestral pops sound, with electric bass and drums and tropical brass figures. Not until the final act — particularly “Fast Black Dance Machine,” a long orchestral interlude in which Minimalist repetition collides with high-energy jazz — does the better side of Mr. Roumain’s genre-crossing style make a belated appearance.1301 2008-10-31 A former Atlanta police officer pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges for his role in a botched drug raid that ended in the shooting death of a 92-year-old woman. The former officer, Arthur Tesler, faces more than 10 years in prison on a charge of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death. The police originally said officers had gone to the home of the woman, Kathryn Johnston, in northwest Atlanta, in 2006 after an informant said he had bought drugs there. But after finding none, officers tried to cover up the mistake by planting bags of marijuana, prosecutors said. In May, Mr. Tesler, 42, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for lying to investigators, but federal prosecutors decided to pursue more charges after reviewing the case.1302 2008-10-31 A state law intended to keep children away from sex offenders on Halloween night can be enforced in its entirety, a federal appeals court ruled. The order means that the state’s registered sex offenders must remain inside their homes from 5 to 10:30 p.m. Friday night unless they have “just cause” to leave, like a medical emergency. They must keep their outside lights off and post a sign saying they are not distributing candy. They may not have any Halloween-related contact with children. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit stayed a lower court’s ruling blocking parts of the law until it could consider the state’s appeal and rule on the merits — sometime before next Halloween. The stay had been sought by Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican, and Attorney General Jay Nixon, above, a Democrat, after the lower-court ruling in the case brought by four sex offenders sued over the law. “This stay comes not a moment too soon, as hundreds of thousands of Missouri children prepare to go trick-or-treating,” Mr. Nixon said.1303 2008-10-31 MOSCOW — Companies belonging to two of Russia’s richest men are among the first recipients of a $50 billion bailout program. The project, like so much else here, is opaque in its details but has resulted in some of the nation’s oil windfall being funneled to well-connected Kremlin insiders.Under the plan being put in motion this week, money is channeled through the state development bank Vneshekonombank, known as VEB, whose chairman is Russia’s prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin. The stated goal is to help Russian industrialists refinance loans to Western banks, with aid flowing quickest to those companies at risk of having assets seized as collateral by foreign owners.Critics charge that the bailout is another example of the cronyism here and a lack of transparency.In the largest loan to come to light so far, Rusal, the aluminum and mining company of the billionaire Oleg V. Deripaska, Russia’s richest man, was awarded $4.5 billion to repay a syndicate of Western banks led by PNB Paribas. Without the loan, Mr. Deripaska, who is seen as a close ally of Mr. Putin, could have been compelled to surrender 25 percent of the Norilsk Nickel company, which he had put up as collateral.Separately, Mikhail M. Fridman, the principal partner in Alfa Group, an investment company, was granted a $2 billion letter of credit from VEB that rescued the most valuable asset in the group’s telecommunications holdings, VimpelCom, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and operates under the Beeline brand in Russia.By Friday, shares pledged as collateral for a loan from Deutsche Bank had fallen below the triggers for margin calls, and the bank could have seized the 44 percent stake in VimpelCom in what would have been a major blow to the Alfa Group.“They were minutes away,” from losing the company, said a representative for a large European company familiar with the talks.1304 2008-10-31 Everyone agrees, however, that preparation is critical. There are different approaches.In 2005, Tergat asked a geography professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Sean Hartnett, to create a special elevation profile so he could study the minutiae of how the hills were set up.Salazar is now coaching Kara Goucher, who will make her marathon debut in New York just two months after competing on the track at the Beijing Olympics. Salazar has had Goucher run the last three miles of 23-mile runs up the 4 percent grade to his home in Oregon wearing a weight vest. She said that, after two months, she feels confident enough on hills that if she is among the leaders with 200 meters (about 218 yards) to go, she will have a shot. “If I have to kick uphill, that would be cool for me,” she said.Magdalena Lewy Boulet, who competed in the 2008 Olympic marathon, has done hill work indoors on a treadmill in California under the guidance of Jack Daniels, a distance coach at the Center for High Altitude Training at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. She runs about 10 one-minute intervals on a 20 percent grade, with one-minute intervals of rest.The goal is to be strong enough to handle the aerobic demands and physical pounding and not panic when uphill splits slow down.When Daniels studied the effects of hill running as an exercise physiology researcher for Nike in the early ’80s, he found that: “If you’re going uphill, you’ll go a little slower with the same effort. If you’re going down, you’ll go a little faster with the same effort.A good rule of thumb, Salazar said, is “a 1 percent grade will slow you down approximately 10 seconds per mile.”Daniels said that “the idea is to try to maintain effort going up the hills.”Over a marathon distance, uphill surges often backfire, unless it is a kick to the end.“You just don’t get as much bang for your buck,” Dixon said, explaining that the same effort it would take to pull 20 meters ahead of your competitors climbing a hill might have been 40 meters if done on the flats.“The energy demand of running down a hill doesn’t make up for the cost going up it,” Daniels said. “You’ll never gain as much going down as you lose going up. That’s pretty well clear. Let’s say it costs you X energy to run on the flat. And it costs you X+2 to get up a hill. It probably costs you X-1 to go down a hill. You lose more going up than you gain going down.”On race day, runners can apply these principles to their tactics.Dixon advocates committing to the hill. “I think a lot of runners approach it and hesitate because they know the challenge of it,” he said.To do this, Dixon said: “Assess the hill. Split it into thirds or quarters. In the first quarter, re-position your center of gravity, work your arms like you’re pulling on a rope. When you get to the end of that first quarter, don’t look up because it will make you lean back. When you get to the crest, never relax. Run through it as if it goes on for another 10-15 meters. Then, on the downhill, reset your center of gravity and be careful.”1305 2008-10-31 FRANKFURT — Volkswagen said Thursday that its third-quarter net profit rose 28 percent as auto sales rose in emerging markets, and it stuck to its forecast of topping last year’s sales.The company reported net profit of 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion), compared with 947 million euros in the period a year ago. Sales climbed in emerging markets like China, Russia and India, offsetting slackening demand in Europe and the United States. Sales for the quarter rose 11 percent, to 29 billion euros ($38.3 billion), compared with 26 billion euros a year ago.“Volkswagen has performed well so far in a difficult environment,” the chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, said in a statement.Volkswagen’s nine-month profit rose 28.5 percent, to 3.7 billion euros ($4.9 billion), compared with 2.9 billion euros a year ago. Total sales rose 5.5 percent in the first nine months, to 85.4 billion euros ($113 billion), from 81 billion euros in the period a year ago.For the current year, Volkswagen said it continued to expect that deliveries, sales revenue and operating profit would exceed the previous year’s figures. The company sold 6.2 million cars in 2007 — helping to push 2007 revenue up almost 4 percent, to 108.9 billion euros, compared with 104.8 billion euros in 2006.Volkswagen will break ground on a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., next year, where the company will build a new midsize sedan aimed at the largest sales segment of the American car market.The company added that it was in a position to benefit in the tough economy because of its cost and investment discipline, as well as its solid liquidity position and conservative refinancing policy.1306 2008-10-31 The American Express Company, a big credit card lender, said Thursday that it would cut 10 percent of its work force, or about 7,000 jobs, as the company braced for an economic slowdown.Amex said it expected the move to save $1.8 billion in 2009, when it anticipates a wave of new losses and a decline in the growth of consumer credit card spending.“Card-member spending in such an environment is likely to be very slow. Loan growth will be restrained and some of that will reflect the steps we’re taking to lower credit risk” as the economy weakens, the chairman and chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in a conference call earlier this month. “To prepare for this difficult environment, we are moving ahead with plans” to reorganize the business.American Express said Thursday that the reductions would occur across business units, markets and staff groups, primarily focusing on management and other positions that do not interact directly with customers. As part of the overhaul, American Express could take an after-tax charge of as much as $290 million in the fourth quarter.“The charge is primarily associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately 7,000 jobs or about 10 percent of the company’s worldwide work force,” American Express said.In addition, a hiring freeze has been imposed, and the company said that it was suspending management-level raises next year. The company also plans to reduce investments in technology, marketing and business development.1307 2008-10-31 ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN The economy contracted from July through September, the government reported, while consumer spending dipped for the first time in 17 years.
