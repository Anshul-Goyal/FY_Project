"'06-10-01,'0','“The Republicans are using Fox News to gin up their base, and now — for the first time — the Democrats are doing it, too,” said Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist with McMahon, Squier & Associates who handled Mr. Dean’s presidential campaign.Engaging Fox News in such an aggressive manner, however, may not be the smartest strategy. If there’s a base that needs energizing for these midterm elections, it belongs to the Republicans, and a Clinton-led attack may only revivify them. And so far, there is just one clear beneficiary: Fox News. The news channel has highlighted the contretemps on many of its programs, boosting the ratings in the process.Democrats do not view Chris Wallace as a partisan gunslinger, as they do some other Fox News personalities. But his questions about whether Mr. Clinton did enough to destroy Al Qaeda ignited simmering Democratic and Clintonian anger.Democrats had been furious with White House attempts over the last few months to to portray Democrats as weaker on national security than Republicans. And defenders of the Clinton administration were furious about “The Path to 9/11,” the ABC docudrama that they claimed depicted the administration in an unfair light. All this fed into last week’s reaction, Democratic officials and strategists say. “I think it’s important for us to call it what it is,” said Karen Finney, communications director for the Democratic National Committee, speaking about the recent incidents. “We can’t let conservatives and Republicans get away with painting us in a corner and mischaracterizing who we are and what we stand for.”The incendiary interview appeared on the same day the pessimistic National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq was leaked. And the two events provided an opportune moment to strike, Ms. Finney said.Soon after the “Fox News Sunday” telecast, Mr. Dean mentioned both items in a combative statement. And the Democratic National Committee followed up Mr. Dean’s statement with an e-mail fundraising appeal, complete with a YouTube link to the interview.“I think you’re seeing the beginning of an alternative Democratic approach,” a desire to strike back hard, said Mr. Begala, a former Clinton adviser.“Clinton tapped into something in the Democratic zeitgeist,” Mr. Begala said. “We’re really tired of being bullied, particularly by Fox.”Democrats have believed, nearly from the moment Fox News began in October of 1996, that the news channel was institutionally biased against them. Fox News officials have disputed such charges, saying the network is merely a corrective to what they contend is a pervasive liberal bias in the news media.Nonetheless, most Democrats have believed the network could not be ignored. If no one appeared on their shows, who would make the Democratic case? The cable news channel, despite a fall-off in ratings over the past year, still towers over its competitors. And although the viewers who regularly watch Fox News are more likely to be Republican, Democrats and independents still turn up in significant numbers — 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, compared with 34 percent who are Republicans — according to a recent survey from the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.Swing voters are important in some states, particularly the Northeast. How they react to the Democrats’ more confrontational approach could help determine how far the Democrats get in their efforts to gain control of the House and Senate.Some Democrats said they believe that a more muscular approach in taking on the Republicans could help them grab onto an issue that has been an Achilles’ heel for the Democrats in recent elections: national security.And that couldn’t make some Republicans happier. “I think it puts national security front and center and reminds people that this administration is taking the fight to the terrorists and recognizes the threat America faces,” something the Democrats do not, said Danny Diaz, Republican National Committee spokesman.The Republican National Committee is doing its bit to spread that point of view. After the Clinton interview, it sent talking points to its grassroots membership and to the news media, and ramped up efforts to book people on TV and radio programs to comment on the debate.And Fox News executives have not seemed to mind furnishing screen time to Democrats so they can bash the network. (Roger Ailes, the chairman and chief executive of Fox News and Fox Television Stations, was unavailable to comment for this article.)After all, the ratings don’t lie.The first three days of the week saw primetime and daily increases of 20 percent and 13 percent, respectively, compared with the average over the previous four weeks. And “Fox News Sunday” got its best ratings in three years.'"
"'06-10-01,'0','But Stone’s career does have its oddities, and, by unhappy coincidence, one of those oddities bears on that same vexed question of journalism and lunch. MacPherson reminds us that in 1992, three years after Stone’s death, a high officer of the former Soviet Union’s former spy service, the K.G.B., revealed that from time to time in the 1960’s, Stone did accept luncheon invitations, and the K.G.B. picked up the tab. The K.G.B. agent was Oleg Kalugin, and, in recalling those lunches, he left the impression that Stone might have been a Soviet operative. Stone’s enemies in the United States, in a delirium of joy, responded to Kalugin’s remarks by leveling some very serious posthumous accusations at Stone, and they have kept on doing so, as anyone could have predicted.Eventually, however, Kalugin clarified his remarks. MacPherson has tracked him down to confirm his clarifications, and she concludes emphatically that Stone was not, in fact, a Soviet spy, nor did Kalugin ever mean to suggest otherwise. MacPherson is scathing about the accusations. The attacks, “as tawdry as they are untruthful,” she writes, have been made by those with “a vested interest in portraying Stone as a paid Kremlin stooge because he remains an icon to those who despise all that the far right espoused.” She goes on in this irate vein — which would be fair enough, except that carried away perhaps by her own polemical fury, she seems not to notice that in her ardor to rescue Stone from his enemies, she has yanked the rope a little too firmly and has accidentally hanged the man.MacPherson informs us that Kalugin, having specified that Stone was never on the Soviet payroll, described Stone as a “fellow traveler” — meaning a friendly supporter of the Soviet cause, though not a disciplined member of any Communist organization. Kalugin explained (in words no admirer of I. F. Stone will want to read) that Stone “began his cooperation with the Soviet intelligence long before me, based entirely on his view of the world.” Stone was “willing to perform tasks.” He would “find out what the views of someone in the government were or some senator on such and such an issue.”MacPherson beams a benign light on those remarks. She observes that, first, there is a world of difference between merely cooperating with the K.G.B. and actively serving as an espionage agent; and, second, any proper journalist would leap at the opportunity to chat with well-connected functionaries of a foreign power; and, third, many a Washington big shot has conducted back-channel conversations with foreign governments. And so forth, one exculpatory point after another, each of which seems reasonable enough, except that, when you add them up, the sundry points seem to have missed the point. Stone, after all, has been extolled as a god, or, at least, an inspiring model for the journalists of today, and while it is good to distinguish between cooperation and espionage, and excellent to learn that Stone sought out acquaintances in many a dark corner, something about his willingness “to perform tasks” as part of his longtime “cooperation with Soviet intelligence” is bound to make us wonder, What on earth was that about?MacPherson acknowledges that sometimes a slant or bias did creep into Stone’s journalism — a “double standard,” as she describes it, which tended to favor the Soviet Union and, in later years, other left-wing dictatorships. Osnos, the publisher of “The Best of I. F. Stone,” worked for Stone as an assistant in the 1960’s and boasts of this in his introduction; and Weber, a freelance writer who edited the anthology, makes plain that he, too, stands solidly in Stone’s corner. Yet even their book sometimes demonstrates, if only inadvertently, the slant or bias in his work — for instance, his commentary on the death of Stalin in 1953, with its ringing homage: “Magnanimous salute was called for on such an occasion.” For that matter, even Stone’s Vietnam journalism, as presented both in MacPherson’s biography and in the anthology, looks only halfway prescient today. Stone foresaw that America would lose the war, and he was admirably shrewd about this. But, from reading his articles, you would never have guessed what the consequences of Communism’s victory would be — the forced labor camps, the flight of the boat people into the South China Sea, the massacre of huge portions of the population of Cambodia and so forth: topics on which he was not so prescient.MacPherson, in her attempt to explain these several peculiarities, paints the political landscape in which Stone came of age, and she puts a lot of emphasis on the anti-Semitism and general horribleness of the old Russian empire of the czars, which Stone’s immigrant parents remembered, and on the scary nature of sundry right-wing movements in the United States during the 1920’s and 30’s — all of which, the Old World Jewish memories mixed with the New World observations, prepared the young Stone to look with genuine and realistic fear on the rise of European fascism. He was never any kind of Communist, not even in a freelance, unaffiliated way, except for a fleeting and probably whimsical moment at the start of the Great Depression. His political principles were insistently liberal, and when he was seized by a more radical or utopian impulse, he liked to invoke the lofty ideals of Peter Kropotkin, the Russian anarchist. But he did come to regard Communists and the Soviet Union as fascism’s most reliable enemies, therefore deserving of special sympathy. That is MacPherson’s explanation. A lot of people in the 1930’s and 40’s would have made the same argument and would have added, besides, that Communism was progressive, even if it wasn’t perfect. But something must be missing from this explanation.The organized left was pretty big in New York and elsewhere in the United States in those years, but the largest and most powerful institutions of the left, far from being Communist, were some of the Jewish social democratic trade unions and the Yiddish-language Forward and a few other journals, nestled on what might be described as the more conservative or social democratic wing of the socialist movement; and the people who ran those social democratic organizations were, from the very start, more consistently hostile to fascism than America’s Communists ever managed to be, even if the Communists were noisier. But those same social democrats who stood up against fascism also managed to be remarkably well informed and undeluded about the realities of Soviet life. This was chiefly because American social democrats paid respectful attention to their own oppressed comrades from Russia, the Mensheviks, some of whom fled into American exile with hair-raising reports about Bolshevism and its deeds. If only Stone had likewise listened to those Menshevik stories, he might have learned a thing or two. For that matter, he could have listened to the Russian anarchists in exile, the followers of Kropotkin, who, having fled the Soviet Union, struck up an alliance with the American social democrats and were likewise eloquent about Communist repression. But he didn’t listen, or rather, he listened only for what he wanted to hear. And why was that?Very likely it was because, in his own, unorganized, pro-Communist wing of the left, the fashion was to demonize and dismiss the Mensheviks as ghastly reactionaries and counterrevolutionaries, embittered to the point of insanity by their political failure in Russia. An example of this sort of demonizing crops up in an article of Stone’s from as late as 1951, reprinted in “The Best of I. F. Stone,” in which he allows himself to sneer a bit at someone described as “a bitterly anti-Communist writer, who himself advocates American aid to counterrevolutionary movements within the Soviet Union.” And yet this person, who sounds frightfully right wing, practically czarist, in Stone’s description, was in fact a scion of the Mensheviks in America, Boris Shub, who advocated American aid to the struggling and forlorn democrats of the Soviet Union — aid to the very kinds of people, the champions of human rights and labor unions, who eventually did overthrow Communism. It depresses me to see this sort of sneering in Stone’s journalism — it reminds me of the ways in which liberal exiles from countries like Iraq and Iran, the Mensheviks of our own time, are sneered at today as tools of imperialism and people without principles.From time to time, though, Stone alternated his defenses of Communism with criticisms, and some of these were admirably sharp. He wrote a ferocious denunciation of Stalin in 1956, which you can likewise find in “The Best of I. F. Stone,” a very fine piece, even if he did follow it up in the years to come by putting his faith in still other Communist megalomaniacs — in Fidel Castro at the start of the Cuban revolution (until Stone recognized with dismay that Castro, too, was a tyrant), and in Ho Chi Minh. Anyway, in his last years, Stone seemed to learn from these repeated mistakes. One of the bravest things he ever did was to sign an open letter in 1979 written by Joan Baez, protesting the “totalitarian” policies of the Vietnamese Communists. For some reason, MacPherson fails to mention this letter, although you can find a mention of it in an earlier and still valuable biography of Stone by Robert C. Cottrell, “Izzy,” which came out in 1992. But that letter has always seemed to me rather impressive. Signing it was brave because Stone had to know that a good many of his own admirers on the pro-Communist side of the American left were going to denounce the letter (which they did with a full-page ad in The New York Times). But signing the letter was brave mostly because, by acknowledging the repressive nature of Vietnamese Communism, Stone risked making some of his own journalism from the war look, in retrospect, less than astute. At minimum, he made himself look inconsistent. But then inconsistency may have been what made him great.It’s not easy to explain a political personality like I. F. Stone’s. The 20th century produced a brilliant literature of fanaticism — a literature by and about hard-line Communists who became maniacs of their own dogmas and then turned the other way, in some cases to become authentic liberals, in other cases to become maniacs of anti-Communism. But a literature that adequately accounts for the people who never did become fanatics, a literature about the non-maniacs, about the people who remained liberals at heart yet, even so, kept applauding one left-wing tyranny after another — a convincing and thorough literature about these people is harder to find. MacPherson’s biography, for all its landscape-painting of the left-wing past, seems to me not up to the task (and, in any case, the book contains too many small errors of fact: her assertion that Kropotkin abandoned pacifism only during his old age in World War I, when, in reality, the young Kropotkin was craftily ambiguous about revolutionary violence; her assertion that Communists in 1933 ran the garment workers’ union in New York, which in fact was run by the hardest of hard-line social democrats; her assertion that a famous anti-totalitarian manifesto in New York in 1939 was signed by many Trotskyists, when the manifesto was in fact produced and dominated by Sidney Hook’s non-Trotskyist circle of social democrats and liberal academics — and so on). I can think of only one genuinely great biography of a fellow traveler written in our own anti-totalitarian age, though the biography happens to be of such a person in France and not in America. This book is Bernard-Henri Lévy’s “Sartre: The Philosopher of the Twentieth Century,” which came out in the United States in 2003 and attracted very little attention.To cite a book on Sartre in connection to Stone might seem a stretch, but these two men, it seems to me, lived parallel lives — Stone, the political journalist who dabbled in philosophy (“The Trial of Socrates” was his old-age best-seller) and published his own magazine; and Sartre, the philosopher who dabbled in political journalism and likewise published his own magazine. The two men were of the same generation, and had the same political instincts. Stone boasted of his anarchist impulses, and so did Sartre; and at the height of the cold war, neither man was thereby inhibited from siding with the Stalinists. Stone read Sartre and cited him with admiration — notably on the topic of Israel and the Arabs. Sartre, for his part, published Stone’s articles in France. Stone and his family lived in France for a short while during the early 1950’s, and Sartre paid him a visit, which was a singular honor. And in Lévy’s book I think we can find the explanation for this kind of political personality.Sartre, as Lévy describes him, was, in his own extremely idiosyncratic fashion, a totalitarian — someone who got swept up in the craziness of the 20th century because he wanted to subsume himself into a mass movement, and who therefore ended up taking a sort of masochistic pleasure in distorting his own best thoughts and intuitions. But Sartre was, at the same time, not a totalitarian. Sartre was a lover of freedom, who felt a positive aversion to the idea of submitting his own thoughts to anyone else at all. Sartre was a paradox. He did not add up, and that was his attraction. This has got to be the explanation for Stone as well. Those years of doing favors for the K.G.B. do suggest that Stone, too, was, in his own fashion, willy-nilly a totalitarian — at least, sometimes. He wrote journalism he knew to be untrue. That was why, in a rueful moment, he spoke about “the morass into which one wanders when one begins to withhold the truth.”But Stone was also not a totalitarian. He was a lover of freedom. A part of him always rebelled against the culture of mendacity he helped to foster in his own corner of the American left. He was a paradox. He did not add up. In our own hair-raising era today, a good many people naturally want to rummage through the past in a search for heroes, and some people will keenly hope that in I. F. Stone they have found their man. His charming and humorous prose style, his amiable personality on the page, his incontestable bravery, the quality in him that, in spite of everything, was never petty or contemptible — all this is hugely attractive, or would be, if only you could separate out the other aspects. “All governments lie,” Stone’s maxim, ought to be plastered across every journalist’s desk. But the lesson Stone can offer us today is, I would say, mostly a reminder that we will have to rise to our own occasion, and not expect heroes from the past to guide our faltering steps. A useful reminder, unfortunately. In any case, a truth.'"
"'06-10-01,'0','BERLIN, Oct. 1 — Hungary’s president, Laszlo Solyom, speaking on national public television Sunday just as the polls closed in local government elections, asked Parliament to oust Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany for lying to the country about the state of the economy.The surprise announcement by Mr. Solyom, an independent who was elected president last year, came as the voting ended in what was seen as the first test of Mr. Gyurcsany’s political future since antigovernment protests erupted in Budapest and other cities over two weeks ago.Voters cast ballots on Sunday in mayoral races and elections for local representatives in 3,174 cities, towns and villages. According to preliminary results released late Sunday by the National Election Office, with some 76 percent of the votes counted, the main opposition party, Fidesz-Hungarian Civic Union, seemed poised to win mayoral races in 15 of Hungary’s 23 largest cities, as well as majorities in the county councils in 18 of the 19 counties, The Associated Press reported.Mr. Gyurcsany’s Socialist Party was seen retaining power in most of Budapest’s 23 districts, and Mayor Gabor Demszky of Budapest — supported by the government coalition of Socialists and Free Democrats — was likely to win his fifth consecutive term since the 1990 return to democracy, The A.P. said.As television viewers were waiting for the first results to trickle in just after the polls closed at 7 p.m. local time, Mr. Solyom, a quiet-spoken former president of the Constitutional Court of Hungary — the equivalent of the Supreme Court in the United States — appeared on screens.'"
"'06-10-01,'0','But friends and relatives of Ms. Clark were overjoyed by the decision. They and her lawyers say that since her conviction, Ms. Clark, the daughter of a onetime Communist newspaper editor and a prominent marketing executive, has become a new person, accepting responsibility for her actions and forging a strong relationship with her daughter, who was a baby at the time of the holdup.“She’s a changed woman,” said Leon Friedman, one of Ms. Clark’s lawyers, who is a law professor at Hofstra University. “She is very sorry for what happened. She realizes what a terrible mess she made. She has taken all kinds of constructive steps in her life, and she’s a different human being than the one who took part in those terrible events.”On Oct. 20, 1981, a group of the radicals tried to make off with $1.6 million from a Brink’s truck outside the Nanuet National Bank at a shopping center in Nanuet. A guard, Peter Paige, was killed, and a shootout at a roadblock left two police officers from Nyack dead: Sgt. Edward O’Grady and Officer Waverly Brown.In the next five years, the police rounded up more than 20 suspects, including members of the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army. Even today, one suspect, Cheri Laverne Dalton, who changed her name to Nehanda Obiodun, remains a fugitive; she was last reported to be living in Cuba.The Rockland County district attorney, Michael E. Bongiorno, said he planned to appeal the ruling that overturned Ms. Clark’s conviction. “I strongly and respectfully disagree with the judge’s decision and her legal reasoning,” he said.Ms. Clark, then 31, was arrested on the afternoon of the robbery and has been imprisoned at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County. She would almost certainly face three charges of second-degree murder, as she did before.But her supporters say that a new trial, or a plea deal, could yield a better outcome. Even if she is convicted again, a new judge could choose to make her sentences of 25 years to life concurrent rather than consecutive.Ms. Boudin, who was a fellow inmate at Bedford Hills, pleaded guilty to a single charge of murder and one of robbery and received a sentence of 20 years to life in prison.In 2003, after a campaign to win her parole that is echoed by the efforts of Ms. Clark’s supporters to win her a new trial, Ms. Boudin emerged from prison, clutching a bouquet of dried roses that had been brought to her from her mother’s funeral a decade earlier.While the ruling last month has given hope to Ms. Clark’s supporters, it has aroused a welter of emotions in Rockland County, especially among those in law enforcement.Chief Van Cura was a 21-year-old officer when his two colleagues and the Brink’s guard were killed.“I knew these guys personally, and they’ve all missed birthdays and graduations and weddings,” he said. “It’s a very difficult thing. The officers were carrying revolvers and these guys were shooting at them with M-16’s and semiautomatic pistols. It changed the character and makeup of the community.”In a letter that Ms. Clark wrote in March to her supporters, she talked about the victims and their families. In recalling her father, who died after she was imprisoned, she wrote: “Filled with a sense of his importance in my life and the void left by his death, I understood more deeply than ever the incalculable loss suffered by the nine children who had been deprived of their fathers as a result of my crime.”Mr. Friedman said the judge at Ms. Clark’s trial should have appointed standby counsel, especially since Ms. Clark, representing herself, had boycotted some proceedings.“She walked out,” Mr. Friedman said. “She has a right to counsel, and we don’t have trials where there’s no one in the courtroom when the prosecution puts on its case. Even with Saddam Hussein, there has to be a lawyer in the court.”In her recent decision, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan said that Ms. Clark “was without assistance of counsel for her defense, in clear abrogation of her Sixth Amendment right to counsel.”In reversing the conviction, she ordered the state to conduct a new trial within 90 days or release Ms. Clark.Judge Scheindlin’s decision could open a window for another participant in the Brink’s holdup. Like Ms. Clark, David Gilbert represented himself at trial and boycotted some of the proceedings. He is serving a sentence of 75 years to life at Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York.Susan Tipograph, Mr. Gilbert’s lawyer and originally Ms. Clark’s as well, said she had sent him a copy of Judge Scheindlin’s decision but had not heard back from him. Mr. Gilbert married Ms. Boudin at the time of his conviction, but they have since divorced.In an open letter in March that appealed for public support, Ms. Clark’s daughter, Harriet, described a collection of poems that her mother had written for her in prison. The collection “points to the conversations my mom and I have built our relationship and our lives around,” Harriet Clark wrote.“It opens with the poem ‘Why’ and begins, ‘Because I could not live in the world as it was, because I did not want to be what I was born for,’ ” the daughter wrote. “And through the poem, my mom winds her way to answer me in the final sentence, ‘Because I felt weak and afraid and wanted to dare courage into me.’ ”'"
"'06-10-01,'0','The match for the world chess championship was suspended at least temporarily yesterday as the president of the World Chess Federation met with the two players and their representatives to try to resolve the crisis that has engulfed the match.A game was scheduled for yesterday, but Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of the federation, who is also president of Kalmykia, the Russian republic where the match is being held, postponed the game at least until today. He made the announcement in a letter addressed to both players posted on the federation’s Web site.The problems started on Thursday when the manager of one of the players, Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, filed a written protest with the organizers charging that the opponent, Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, was going to his private bathroom — the only place where there are no surveillance cameras — too many times during the games. The insinuation was that Mr. Kramnik might be cheating by consulting a computer.On Friday, the day on which the fifth game of the match was to be played, the committee reviewing the protest ruled that the private bathrooms should be locked and that the players should share a bathroom.When Mr. Kramnik arrived for the game and discovered that his bathroom was locked, he staged a sit-in. After an hour, the federation forfeited the game to Mr. Topalov.'"
"'06-10-01,'0','For the first time in more than 30 years, Notre Dame will make 5,000 season tickets available to football games starting next season, charging a fee to help pay for more than $40 million in repairs to Notre Dame Stadium.The tickets will be offered first to alumni, donors and others affiliated with the university ahead of the general public, Notre Dame’s executive vice president, John Affleck-Graves, said last week.Within hours of announcing the season-ticket sale, the university had received at least 750 requests for applications. Affleck-Graves said if more than 5,000 applications were received from those affiliated with the university, the tickets would be distributed by lottery.In addition to the cost of a season ticket, which is $413 this year, there will be an annual fee of $2,000 for a sideline seat; $1,500 for a seat in the corner of the stadium; and $1,250 for an end-zone seat.The revenue generated through the ticket plan will help pay for the repair and maintenance of the 76-year-old stadium, which was expanded to 80,795 seats before the 1997 season. Extensive work is needed in the concrete seating bowl because of freeze-thaw damage. Major work is expected to begin next summer.'"
"'06-10-01,'0','Control of the nation’s purse strings is one of Congress’s greatest powers and, as such, a core responsibility of lawmakers. But how can a serious obligation compete with political expediency?The new budget year, 2007, starts today. But Congress left town last week without having passed the spending bills needed to pay for about 20 percent of the federal government, basically everything except the military and homeland security, and automatic payments like Social Security and interest on the national debt.Republican legislators could not agree among themselves, let alone with the Democratic minority, on spending levels for matters as vital as education, diplomacy, environmental protection, public transportation and scientific research. Rather than make choices — and leave a record for voters to assess — they fled, promising to act after the election.For now, departments and programs that Congress has not gotten around to funding will operate at last year’s level, or somewhat below. But fallback funding will not necessarily prevent hardship. Take the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, paid for by the states and the federal government to insure four million low-income children. At least 17 states are entering the new budget year without enough money, jeopardizing coverage for 600,000 children. It’s appalling that Congress did not act to avert this, especially since the Census Bureau recently reported that the percentage of uninsured children rose last year for the first time since 1998.Appalling, but not surprising. Congressional Republicans rammed through spending cuts in domestic programs last February, most of them in programs for low-income Americans. The ostensible purpose of the cuts was deficit reduction. But three months later, in May, they worsened the deficit by slashing taxes, which will mostly benefit wealthy households. On top of that, they tried repeatedly this year to gut the estate tax, which would only have benefited America’s richest families.It’s impossible to say what will happen in the lame duck session, or beyond. But if the future Congress bears a strong resemblance to this one, it will not bode well for budget responsibility or basic fairness.'"
"'06-10-01,'0','Drivers should be aware that bicyclists cannot ride on sidewalks, or ride too closely to parked cars in case of suddenly opening doors. Bicyclists should not have to deal with aggressive drivers of half-ton S.U.V.’s who tailgate us while speeding down the street during the morning commute, because they feel that we are riding too slowly and taking up “their” space.If we are to promote alternative ways of commuting, we need to create a safer bicycling culture.As a “Queasy Rider” myself, I am disheartened by the words of Iris Weinshall, the transportation commissioner: “Does it make sense to put a bike lane along Houston Street? Would we have to widen the sidewalks? These are things you consider. Bike riding is not made for everybody.”As they say, “If you build it, they will come,” which is true whether talking about streets, highways or bike lanes. European cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen have committed themselves to getting people out of their cars and onto bikes, and one-third of commuting trips now taken in these cities are by bike. There is no reason why New York cannot make the same commitment.Protected bike lanes, enforcement of laws requiring motorists to share the road and improved roadway surfaces are achievable goals in a city where more people like myself want to ride more, but find daily riding too daunting.Help the Poor. All of Them.“The Mayor’s War on Poverty” (editorial, Sept. 24) appropriately praises the mayor’s Commission for Economic Opportunity for its systematic plan to reduce poverty. However, its limited vision for the nation’s wealthiest and most unequal city is disappointing.The commission’s focus on children under 5, working poor adults and young people out of work and school perpetuates the unfair distinction between “deserving” and “undeserving” poor. Further, this choice includes only half of those living in poverty. This segmentation makes it harder to tackle the real causes of poverty: low wages, insufficient jobs, inadequate schools and poor health.The mayor and City Council can get at poverty’s roots by joining other cities in passing living wage laws. Businesses can increase wages and benefits for low-paid workers. City agencies can reduce the obstacles they erect for people seeking to escape poverty. Schools can make improving completion rates a top priority, and City University can restore affordable tuition.Finally, the city can develop comprehensive plans to help poor people manage the health problems that interfere with employment.The mayor and the City Council should expand the commission’s tentative steps and commit our city to joining the global effort to make poverty history.Nicholas FreudenbergWashington HeightsThe writer is a professor of public health at Hunter College.“The Lonesome Casita” (Sept. 17), about Clinton Street on the Lower East Side, makes it seem as if yuppie business owners are driving out Latino businesses in the neighborhood. Anyone who has spent any time on Clinton Street knows that it is one of the only truly integrated neighborhoods left in this city. Most of the newer businesses that have opened are run by people who live in the neighborhood and who are genuinely invested in making Clinton Street a place for everybody. Mark Foster, the owner of P-13/China House Tonics, is a perfect example of this.Mr. Foster knows everyone who lives on Clinton Street, from the local school kids to the crazy cat lady, and he treats them all with the same affection and respect. He is not some upstart yuppie who wants to sell expensive things to rich people. He’s a creative guy who had an idea and wanted to share it — isn’t that what entrepreneurship is all about?Your editorial about the sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village (“A Battle on the Lower East Side,” Sept. 17) acknowledges that Manhattan is becoming more off-limits to all but the truly wealthy, yet insists that resources be directed only to producing affordable housing in the other four boroughs.I do not share your vision of Manhattan as an enclave for only the richest New Yorkers.In a city that is starved for affordable places to live, we cannot simply allow this limited resource to disappear, particularly when preserving this housing — yes, even in Manhattan — will cost the city substantially less than creating it from scratch elsewhere.When Metropolitan Life constructed Stuyvesant Town, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia said the company had “certain obligations different from and greater than a like project funded entirely by private funds.” The tenants here are not asking for a handout from the city — rather, they expect Metropolitan Life to negotiate fairly with them in their bid to purchase the property and to honor this special relationship with the city.Liz Ureneck says of Tasti D-Lite, “If I close my eyes, I can recite the location of every branch within a 20-block radius of any point in Manhattan,” in her love letter to the low-calorie frozen dessert (“Why They Scream for Not-Quite Ice Cream,” New York Observed, Sept. 24).But I bet that with her eyes closed, she couldn’t taste the difference between chocolate macaroon and bananas Foster. All those flavors; the secret is that they all taste the same.My husband pointed this out to me in a blind taste-test. If you expect black forest cake taste, you get it. But without the psychological priming, it all tastes like one flavor: bland.A Healthier Way to Help Children“This Bud’s for the Children” (Sept. 24) suggests that fund-raising by Washington University alumni and their friends is an appropriate occasion for overdrinking. Using this activity to provide funds for ball teams in Harlem is specious.I live in Harlem. Our needs would be better served if these privileged college graduates would stay sober and find time to tutor our children so they might have a chance to go to college.'"
"'06-10-01,'0','Well, there was plenty of fodder last week for Americans’ favorite parlor game: trying to figure out just where this crazy housing market will bounce next — or, more particularly, what their own house will be worth next month or next year.Until now, even with one report after another suggesting that the long, heady party is really and truly over, prices for existing homes (they’re like used cars, minus the stigma) kept inching up — if they were measured year to year. But in August, for the first time since 1995, prices slipped a bit from the previous August. (New-home sales rose in August, but that counts only the number sold, and economists warned not to read too much into that.)Prices were down in most regions, with the median price in the Northeast going to $271,000 from $282,000, the Midwest to $176,000 from $178,000 and the South to $184,000 from $189,000. Only the perennially wild West showed a gain, to $345,000 from $344,000.But the way things are going, homeowners out West will get theirs, too.'"
"'06-10-01,'0','Fortunately for his driver’s license, that included the local police.During that time, Mr. Washington put 23,000 miles on the car — an amazing feat given that the island has only a few dozen miles of paved roads. The Challenger spent about 15 years outdoors in a town that, on average, has 200 rainy days a year.About five years ago, Mr. Washington found a way to garage his car — not long after he found out how valuable it had become.Prices for Challenger T/A’s, along with a whole generation of Challengers and Plymouth Barracudas, have risen exponentially in recent years, particularly since DaimlerChrysler announced in July that it would bring back the Challenger in 2008.Mr. Washington’s research revealed that the 1970 Challenger T/A was a racing version of Dodge’s belated entry into the muscle car wars. Only 2,518 are known to have been built; Mr. Washington knows this because he has become perhaps the top authority on the cars. He now heads the Challenger T/A Registry (challengertaregistry.com) and is the spiritual leader of a group of owners and aficionados seeking to locate T/A’s or document what happened to all of them. “We’re about halfway there,” he said, having cataloged 1,198 as of last week.As much as the T/A (and the very similar 1970 AAR Plymouth ’Cuda) are worth, they are far from the most valuable of the Chrysler Corporation’s original muscle cars.“The holy grail of the muscle car world is the ’71 Hemi ’Cuda convertible — just because so few of them were made,” said Steve Davis, vice president of the Barrett-Jackson Auction Company. “That’s King Kong. After that, it would be maybe the ’70 Hemi ’Cuda convertible, then the hardtop versions of those cars, the 440 ‘Six Pack’ models (with 3 two-barrel carburetors) and then maybe some of the subsets, like the AAR ’Cudas or Challenger T/A’s.”What does Mr. Davis mean by holy grail? The current auction record for a ’71 Hemi ’Cuda convertible (one of fewer than a dozen made) is “well north of $2 million,” he said. He predicts that this record will be easily and repeatedly broken in January when a bumper crop of Dodge and Plymouth muscle cars go on the block at Barrett-Jackson’s big auction in Scottsdale, Ariz.Galen V. Govier of Eau Claire, Wis., who operates a service that verifies serial numbers, points out that a pristine 1971 Hemi ’Cuda convertible has skyrocketed in value from a range of $15,000 to $25,000 in 1985 to an estimated $3 million this year. Not bad for cars that cost about $5,000 new and were not huge sales successes.Chrysler enthusiasts like to point out that the company was the first with a pony car — its Plymouth Barracuda was introduced on April Fools’ Day, 1964, and was in dealerships a few weeks before the Ford Mustang. But Ford fans scoff, asking how there could have been a pony car before the Mustang, progenitor for the class, even went on sale.In truth, the Barracuda was a pre-emptive strike; the Mustang’s impending arrival was well known, so Chrysler quickly cobbled together a fastback version of its Valiant compact, adding a huge glass rear window (dubbed the fish tank).More than a million Mustangs were sold in just 18 months. Total Barracuda sales over 11 years never topped 400,000. (Its later-arriving cousin, the Challenger, accounted for 200,000 more.)Not until the 1970 model year did Chrysler come up with fresh ground-up designs for pony/muscle cars, and by then the era was winding down. Within four years, Chrysler decided to discontinue them.Yet their lack of marketplace success has helped to make Barracudas and Challengers coveted collectibles. In particular, the high values of Hemi-engine models reflect their scarcity when new. Hemis sold poorly partly because the engine cost nearly $900 extra and partly because buying insurance ranged from expensive to impossible.Relatively few Barracudas or Challengers came with big V-8’s; many had 6-cylinder engines. A cottage industry has evolved of people who convert cars with 6’s and small V-8’s into valuable big-block models. Hence the need for services like Mr. Govier’s and Mr. Washington’s, who verify the original equipment from serial numbers and documents.The first Barracudas were powered by 6-cylinder motors or small 273-cubic-inch V-8’s. In 1967, a better-defined model appeared, styled with more élan than the dowdy Valiant but still sharing the same unexciting engines. Barracudas from this era are worth little more than nice Valiants, perhaps $5,000 in showroom condition.In 1970, Chrysler finally caught up as the Challenger joined the sexy new Barracuda. Each came in six styles with nine engine choices, including the race-ready 340 V-8 in Mr. Washington’s car, a big-block 426-cubic-inch Hemi and even the huge 440.Chrysler sold 83,032 Challengers in 1970, helping to lift Dodge’s market share to 7 percent, its highest ever, and Plymouth sold a record 55,499 Barracudas. But sales tumbled the next year as the novelty wore off. A lackluster ’72 redesign and the elimination of big V-8’s drove sales lower. By 1974, the fat lady was on her last chorus.The cars had already earned a spot in pop culture. The Challenger was a star in films from “Vanishing Point” (1971) to “2Fast 2 Furious” (2003). While the Barracuda had a cleaner, classier design, resurrecting that nameplate would have been problematic, given that Chrysler phased out the Plymouth division four years ago.Instead, Dodge unveiled a design study for a reborn Challenger at the Detroit auto show last January. By summer the car had a green light for production. “We hadn’t seen this kind of spontaneous, passionate response to a car since the introduction of the Viper concept in 1989,” Thomas W. LaSorda, president of the Chrysler Group, said.The only question is whether 2008 will be too late to take advantage of the muscle car renaissance — or will the Challenger be late, once again, to the muscle car party?'"

"'06-10-01,'0','The claim that he spent more than $35,000 per year on average per child for 16 years of education suggests that Michael Wolff, the reviewer of Daniel Golden’s “Price of Admission” (Sept. 17), has lost his mind.We here in the flyover states, with our decent public schools and great state universities, could, only with real effort, spend $12,000 per year on average for our children for 16 years, and that includes all the costs of full fare at Harvard: just to make it clear, this is less than $200,000.

"'06-10-01,'0','As many of the world’s most notable museums raise their admission prices — in New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has followed the Modern’s lead and is now asking for a donation of $20 for an adult — the cultural institutions of Baltimore and a few other cities are going in the opposite direction. Both the Walters Art Museum, left, and the Baltimore Museum of Art will be free to the public as of today.“The museum’s mission is to bring art and people together and we were finding the cost was an impediment to fulfilling that mission,” said Gary Vikan, director of the Walters Art Museum, adding that his institution is following an example set by major museums in Minneapolis, Cincinnati and Dayton, all of whom have stopped charging admission. “Happily, they found it led to a more diverse audience, as well as more community participation.”Mr. Vikan said that that both the city and the county gave “significant funds” to help them achieve their goal.During October and November, more than 72 other cultural institutions in Baltimore will also offer free or reduced admission as part of the Free Fall Baltimore program, organized through a $750,000 mayoral grant by the Baltimore Office of Promotion and the Arts.A full list of the dance, theater and film events taking place this autumn is available at www.freefallbaltimore.com.'"
"'06-10-01,'0','And there are some real concerns about how well equipped the government is to handle the likely crush of passport applications. “If there were to be a rush on passports for people taking a cruise trip in the first quarter of next year, we’re not sure they could keep up with demand,” said Rick Webster, vice president of government affairs at the Travel Industry Association, one of several trade associations pushing to delay the deadline.The State Department estimates that 73 percent of Americans now lack passports. The fee to acquire one is $97 for adults and $82 for children under 16. Demand for passports could increase to 16 million in the 2007 fiscal year, beginning today, from about 12.3 million in the year that ended Sept. 30. To help handle the work, the government has hired about 250 new employees and added some new locations where people can file applications, bringing the total to more than 8,000. (Commonly, these passport acceptance locations are post offices, county clerk offices and libraries.) But the few federal centers where the applications go next — for the actual processing — have already been struggling just to keep up with a steady increase over the last few years.Though the State Department says that applicants ordinarily receive passports within six weeks of applying, it can take longer. René Mack, 47, of Wyckoff, N.J., applied for a passport for his year-old son, Aidan, at a special open house at the Fairlawn, N.J., post office in June. Though he was told the passport would be processed in six to eight weeks, he didn’t receive it until 12 weeks later.“I can only imagine what will happen to people waiting for passports over the holidays in December, when the mail is traditionally at its heaviest volume,” said Mr. Mack, who was aware of the coming changes in the rules because he handles public relations for travel and tourism clients in Canada and the Bahamas.There are shortcuts — for a price. Someone in urgent need of a passport can pay an extra $60 for expedited service, which typically cuts wait time to two weeks. A traveler leaving in less than two weeks can make an appointment to go in person, with proof of travel plans in hand, to one of 14 passport agencies located in major cities, including New York, Boston and Los Angeles, by calling (877) 487-2778. There are also private rush services that specialize in speeding customers through the bureaucracy. For varying fees, these companies can often get passports approved in as little as 24 hours. (A list of expediting services is at www.napvs.org.) But in recent years, some passport agencies have been reducing the number of daily submissions such rush companies are allowed. The New York regional passport agency used to allow them to submit applications in unlimited numbers; in February it limited each company to 20 or fewer a day.WHAT we have here is a situation of clearly increasing demand over the last couple of years,” said Rob Smith, director of the National Association of Passport and Visa Services, a trade group for the expediting companies. “That demand is likely to be heightened by the sea and air requirements coming up this January, followed by the land requirements a year later.”The travel industry, fearing confusion and passport delays, has been pushing for an extension for the new rules. For now, cruise companies and travel agencies are urging travelers not to wait to get their passports. Ada Brown, owner of Seaside Travel in Long Beach, Calif., points out that even on cruises to Hawaii or Alaska passengers may need passports, because many of those ships make foreign stopovers. “The Alaska cruises from Seattle all touch base in Vancouver, and that’s a foreign port,” she said.With tourism dollars at stake, some Caribbean resorts are offering to foot some of the bill for customers who need passports. Ladera Resort in St. Lucia is offering to reimburse any guest staying there next year for the $97 new-passport fee when the guest presents the new passport and a receipt. In Aruba, the Westin and Renaissance resorts are both offering food and beverage credits of $50 to $75 to guests whose first international destination in 2007 is Aruba. SuperClubs will apply the costs of new or renewed passports to a 2007 four-night stay at one of its 10 Caribbean resorts if booked by Nov. 20.Travelers can avoid the need for a passport altogether, of course, by seeking out island getaways that don’t require them — in the United States Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico or Hawaii.“For us, it has already been a reassuring selling point for destination wedding groups,” said Richard Doumeng, managing director at Bolongo Bay Beach Resort in St. Thomas. Brides, he said, “don’t have to worry if their sorority sisters can attend depending on whether or not they have a passport.”'"
"'06-10-01,'0','Another reason is the well-priced housing stock, of which the DeMarco home provides a great example. Built around 1900, it has six bedrooms, two and a half baths and a roomy porch. It cost $375,000 a decade ago, Mrs. DeMarco said; today it would probably sell for more than double that amount.Justin Ramsteck, who works for a bank in nearby Shelton, remembers the response he received upon choosing Stratfield three years ago. “When I first moved here and told people in other towns where I lived, they were like, ‘Where is that?’ ”Even he and his wife, Suzanne (who works for a bank in Stamford), were in the dark when they started looking. At first, they asked brokers to show them houses next to Long Island Sound, in Fairfield Beach. The houses they saw there were small and somewhat shabby, he said.The one they found in Stratfield was a 1,180-square-foot colonial built in 1936, with two bedrooms, a bath and a detached one-car garage. Like so many in its neighborhood, it had been lovingly cared for and was in move-in condition. They paid $350,000, eventually renovating the kitchen and bath, replacing the roof, and adding central air-conditioning.The Ramstecks have recently put the house back on the market, for $424,900; they are expecting a baby and need more space. They are looking in the neighborhood, since they are committed to staying in Stratfield. Yet Mr. Ramsteck cannot help noticing how demand has increased in just a few years. “Stratfield is not a secret anymore,” he said.Stratfield and its 7,000 residents are tucked away in Fairfield’s landlocked northeast corner, flat against the Merritt Parkway and the city of Bridgeport.Unlike many New England communities, Stratfield doesn’t have a clear-cut town-green center or business district. Nor does it have many homes dating from the pre-Civil War period — unlike, say, Easton, the town just to the north.There are, however, quite a few homes from the turn of the last century. The oldest ones line Stratfield Road: Arts and Crafts bungalows, Dutch colonials and Tudors sit on deep half-acre lots — some of the largest in the community.Side streets like Buena Vista and Edgewood Roads, which wind under large oak boughs, have tall wood-sided colonials with stone paths curving to their front steps. The Rooster River gurgles its way under arched stone footbridges down the center of Brooklawn Parkway, one of the more in-demand addresses.Midcentury has left its mark with a collection of ranches, Capes and modernist boxes, mostly on Church Hill Road and Skytop Drive.But it is still unusual to see new homes, the three-story kind with the columned porticos and treeless front lawns found in parts of southern Fairfield County. Condominiums are rare, too. Brokers say they make up 5 percent of housing, despite their prominence on major roads.As demand picked up in Stratfield over the last three years, prices rose 25 percent a year, said Joy Cehovsky, an agent with William Raveis Real Estate, based in Southport, a Fairfield neighborhood along the water.Today, $600,000 is the average price for a single-family house built around 1920, with three bedrooms, one and a half baths, and 2,500 square feet of space, but often no family room.Despite an overall national slowdown, Ms. Cehovsky said, houses in Stratfield are generally selling in three months, and for close to their asking prices.Moreover, homes in Stratfield trade at something of a discount compared with others in nearby neighborhoods. For instance, in Southport, which is close to the shore, that same 2,500-square-foot average home might sell for $800,000. And in Westport, which is nearer to New York, it might sell for $700,000.“People are starting to ask, ‘Can I get more for the same money?’ ” Ms. Cehovsky said. “And then they’re catching on to the charm of this community.”What to DoOn a recent weekend, a Ferris wheel was turning at Our Lady of the Assumption Church as crowds gathered for an annual fall festival. Cars were parked along the road shoulder for a half mile in both directions.The area is also prime golfing ground, given that Stratfield is surrounded by fairways. The D. Fairchild Wheeler Golf Course, for instance, is a public course offering 36 holes. During the week, two can play 18 holes there, with a cart, for $60. Unlike many courses, Wheeler stays open in the winter.The Boston Post Road in Fairfield is a lively spot for drinks and dinner.When parents hit the town, there is a large pool of possible baby sitters at Sacred Heart University in Stratfield’s northeastern corner, which has a student body of 5,600.The schools that serve Stratfield — part of the Fairfield district — have topped recent “best of” lists in national magazines like Money. Parents, too, sing their praises, and especially appreciate the fact that many homes are just a short walk away.Stratfield Elementary School, which teaches kindergarten through Grade 5, offers Spanish starting in fourth grade. It has an enrollment of 465 students this year, according to John J. Boyle, the deputy superintendent, who said this year’s kindergarten class was the school’s largest ever.For Grades 6, 7 and 8, students attend Roger Ludlowe Middle School, which has an enrollment of 842. Then they head to Fairfield Warde High School, one of two public high schools serving Fairfield.This year, the high school’s 1,192 students have the option of studying Spanish, French, Latin or Italian. There are also 18 Advanced Placement courses, in subjects including environmental science, modern European history and computer science.There are 18 varsity-level sports for girls and 16 for boys, with bowling and sailing for both boys and girls. In addition to standard extracurricular activities like the literary magazine and the orchestra, students have more unusual options. They might, for instance, enjoy membership in the animal-rights group.On the SAT exam, the class of 2006 scored an average of 533 on the math portion, 540 on the verbal — now called reading — and 549 on the new writing section, outpacing the state averages of 510 math, 505 reading, and 504 writing.Of the seniors who graduated last year, 75 percent went on to four-year colleges and 14 percent two-year or technical colleges.The two main private schools in the area are Unquowa and Fairfield Country Day. Unquowa, whose enrollment this year is 175 students, teaches prekindergarten through eighth grade, and tuition ranges from $5,950 to $20,250.Fairfield Country Day, a boys’ school, teaches kindergarten through ninth grade; the tuition range is $23,900 to $25,500.There are also four parochial schools: Our Lady of Assumption, Holy Family and St. Thomas Aquinas, which teach kindergarten through Grade 8, and Fairfield College Preparatory School for boys, which teaches Grades 9 through 12.Stratfield Road intersects the Merritt Parkway, one of the two major highways into New York.Fairfield also has a Metro-North Railroad station, about a 12-minute drive from Stratfield (though the wait for an assigned parking spot can be years long). The rush-hour ride to Grand Central Terminal takes almost 70 minutes.Metro-North is to break ground next year on a long-awaited station on Commerce Drive, closer to Stratfield, which will have 1,500 parking spots. Real estate brokers say that anticipation of the new station is already lifting property values.The first large-scale settlement of Stratfield occurred only after trolley tracks were laid along present-day Brooklawn Avenue and Stratfield Road, in the late 19th century.The trolley allowed workers to commute to Bridgeport but live in mansions in the countryside, and the suburban template was thus born. Stratfield’s homes were a healthy distance from the Bridgeport factories that were churning out guns, corsets and pull-chains for lights.What We LikeStratfield is safe enough for children to play outside without direct supervision, parents say, describing an atmosphere in which families are trusted to keep an eye on one another’s children.After buying in Stratfield, residents say, people tend to spread roots and stay for decades. This commitment translates into well-kept properties, trimmed hedges, painted shutters and smooth driveways.Developers are nipping at Stratfield’s edges, hoping to put up large-scale condo projects and office complexes, said Samuel Boyarsky, a 39-year resident who heads Stratfield Improvement Association, a grassroots group fighting growth.“Developers see an open piece of land and want it, which they’re entitled to,” said Mr. Boyarsky, who complained of waiting 15 minutes just to turn right onto Stratfield Road during rush hour. “But they shouldn’t build something that will destroy the culture around it.”'"

"'06-10-02,'0','All but Justice Alito were in attendance Sunday, as were Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales; several other cabinet members; Mayor Anthony A. Williams; and Lt. Gov. Michael Steele of Maryland, a Republican candidate for the Senate.Many non-Catholics attend Red Masses, as a sign of respect. Last year, President Bush came; generally, presidents attend at least one during their terms.A procession of priests and bishops was followed by a police color guard. A Ralph Vaughan Williams hymn was followed by the national anthem.Having earned a reputation as a skilled diplomat in his previous tenure as bishop of Pittsburgh, Archbishop Wuerl did not overtly talk about issues the church has championed, like prohibiting abortion, although the court this session will review the constitutionality of a ban on a type of late-term abortion.Instead, he said the values formed by religion could not be separated from the insight and judgment brought to bear on law and policy.“The two spheres, church and state, while distinct, are always interrelated,” Archbishop Wuerl told the worshipers. “Politics, law, faith are mingled because believers are also citizens. Church and state are home for the same people.”For those who may have been looking for some clue to the archbishop’s approach to political issues, he strode the range of Catholic social teaching without focusing on a particular topic, as he called for “speaking out against racial discrimination, social injustice or threats to the dignity of life.”Advocates on the right and the left have said that, historically, personal religious beliefs have not necessarily directed the way justices vote on a case. But when Justice Alito was confirmed in January, the news media and others noted the Catholic majority on the court.Few may have raised the issue of the justices’ religion if they had all been Methodist, for instance, said John H. Garvey, dean of Boston College Law School, in a telephone interview. But Mr. Garvey said it was valid to discuss the religious composition of the court because some people would assume the justices voted a particular way because of their Catholic faith.“They are not a voting bloc,” Mr. Garvey said. “The Catholic Church is a very big tent with people from the far left and the far right in it. The fact that the Catholic members of the court are center-to-right rather than center-to-left says more about President Bush than about the Catholic Church.”Lucia A. Silecchia, professor of law at Catholic University of America in Washington, said it was too soon to tell whether the Catholic justices held common views. “Where it gets complicated is that all five identify themselves as Catholic, but they aren’t necessarily consistent with one another,” Professor Silecchia said.The Mass ended with “America the Beautiful” and the hymn “O God Beyond All Praising.” The archbishop descended the altar and left smiling and chatting with Chief Justice Roberts.Later, on the steps of the cathedral, two young men approached Archbishop Wuerl to have him bless their rosaries and to take pictures with him.As the archbishop stood with one man, the other, holding the camera, said happily, “Here’s to the union of church and state!”The archbishop laughed, but gently corrected him. “No,” he said, “remember, I said they were two distinct spheres.”'"
"'06-10-02,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 1 — Of all the constituents Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger hoped to please in a recent marathon bout of bill signing, he only petted one. And he had four legs.The object of the governor’s attention — not a voter, unfortunately — was a golden retriever named Tucker, who panted loudly as the governor patted his head.“I’m going to sign a bill for you,” said the governor, beaming. “What do you say?”The bill in question was just one of a series protecting animals and pets signed over the last two weeks by a governor who counts two dogs among his closest friends (a yellow Labrador named Spunky, and a white cockapoo that answers to Sarge).Among the new laws is one forbidding the tethering of a dog unattended for more than three hours, one of the first in the country to set a rigid rule on the amount of time an animal can wait on a leash as a master runs errands.Mr. Schwarzenegger also recently signed a bill that makes it a crime to leave animals unattended in vehicles in hot or cold weather, or without adequate ventilation, food or water. Violators of the law, which also allows the police to break windows and take animals away to safety, face fines and up to six months in jail.'"
"'06-10-02,'0','The reports ask officials to disclose bank accounts, stock transactions, real estate holdings, memberships on corporate boards and significant stock ownership. It was not clear why the disclosure statements were being sought.Paul Shechtman, Ms. Pirro’s lawyer, said, “In my conversations with the government, they have given no indication that the investigation involves anything else than Jeanine’s talking about eavesdropping.”He added, “The only thing that I can guess is that the financial disclosure statements are being sought to ascertain whether Jeanine claimed an ownership interest in the boat.”Ms. Pirro has acknowledged that she had private investigators follow her husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., and that she spoke with Bernard B. Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner, about possibly taping Mr. Pirro. She has said she never carried out the idea.Yesterday, Ms. Pirro attended a campaign rally and a Columbus Day parade on Staten Island, but did not take questions from reporters.In a written statement released by her campaign, Ms. Pirro repeated her criticism of leaks that she said were intended to smear her campaign. She called again for the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to review her case. And she lashed out again at Elliott B. Jacobson, an assistant United States attorney who Ms. Pirro says has a “partisan political agenda.” Mr. Jacobson helped convict Ms. Pirro’s husband of tax evasion in 2000; he served 11 months in prison.“Today’s leak to The New York Post really comes as no surprise,” Ms. Pirro said in the statement. “As long as Elliott Jacobson remains at the head of this case, continuing leaks are unfortunately predictable. In fact, no one will be surprised if there are more leaks before the end of the week.”In calling for a special prosecutor, she added: “I know there is only one way this case will end; I will be cleared. The only question is whether I will be cleared before Election Day or after Election Day.”Michael J. Garcia, who supervises Mr. Jacobson as the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement last week, “We do not take politics into account in deciding either the subject matter or timing of our investigations.”A spokesman for Mr. Garcia said in a statement yesterday: “Because the investigation is ongoing, we are not going to comment further. We stand by the statement we issued last Wednesday.”A spokeswoman for the Justice Department in Washington declined to comment on the matter yesterday.'"
"'06-10-02,'0','Yet beyond a powerful statement, beyond the slim line of the suits, beyond giving ecstatic retail buyers something other than bubble skirts to sell next spring, what did Mr. Simons and his team do, and, more, why should we care? Perhaps the most important thing they did was to look hard at the task before them (Sander has gone off track in recent years) and reduce minimalism to an essence of architectural geometry and cutting and the development of new, lighter fabrics.If we look at a table or a magically floating stairway by the Italian architect Franco Albini, who is the subject of an exhibition here designed by his protégé Renzo Piano, we are amazed by how contemporary these objects seem 60 and 70 years later. That this is so is because the more human elements, like comfort, transparency and craftsmanship, have not been sacrificed to new materials and methods of construction. If anything, those human qualities are made more visible to us by the design.Mr. Simons has done a similar thing at Sander. He used different weaves of kimono silk to give shirts the modern look of an experimental synthetic, yet in the hand they feel light and natural. White neoprene helped give jackets, shown with slim pants, their precise line, but the effect to the face is also incredibly flattering. His many small-shouldered jackets with narrow collars may seem unduly prim. In fact, when worn unbuttoned, the collars make your neck look longer.The dresses were also entrancing, in particular a sheer navy wool number that fell like a cape over one shoulder, and a strapless black wool jersey column whose only detail was a simple fold of fabric below the shoulder wings. These dresses are not just feminine in a way that now seems novel, they also reveal the challenge that Mr. Simons gave to himself when he took on Jil Sander: to do the most with the least possible amount of design. We are now feeling the reverberations of that thinking.A strident Milan season, with collections from Gucci and Prada that were anything but predictable, ended with a full-on glamour stomp by Donatella Versace and a serenely beautiful collection from Angela Missoni, which gave chase to sex kittens.The musical artist Prince, attended by two young women who wore identical dark glasses and hairstyles and whose faces had the creaminess of airbrushed makeup, observed Ms. Versace’s glamorama. He seemed to enjoy it. I know I did. Ms. Versace focused on retro Mod shapes like the shift and minicoat, using nubby textures and colors like chocolate and pistachio as well as beige flesh tones to impart a new energy.There were bubble skirts with little matching jackets over bra tops, some fresh-looking maxidresses in swirling patterns, and slim cuffed shorts with plain silk blouses and often a splashy gold coat. Ms. Versace is always adept at giving her shows a Look. This season it felt especially polished, right down to the two-tone patent-leather platforms.Ms. Missoni has taken something of a risk with her abstract camouflage patterns, patch-pocket cotton skirts and long fluid shapes redolent of a hippie beach wedding. Yet, it should be recalled, she was one of the first designers to go with short layers and leggings, now a trend. So it was time to switch directions.Among her most appealing looks were kimono-style dresses in the family’s signature zigzag pattern, with full matching pants, and in melding shades of pale yellow, green, clay pink and charcoal. There were microdot prints on silk and cotton organza, for scarf-inspired dresses and pretty tops, which looked great with her new, fuller cotton shorts. It’s a nice way to dress when you’re not going with the flow.The Dsquared show was dumb and cute. Dean and Dan Caten reached for the nearest Italian cliché, a seaside village trembling with hotties, and served up some adorable tailored shorts, shrunken navy blazers with brass buttons, snappy striped shirts and a pair of cream-color boulevardier pants that practically came up to Jessica Stam’s breasts.It’s no put-down to say that the Catens know their limits. If they tried any harder, they’d fail.'"
"'06-10-02,'0','Amaranth Advisors, the hedge fund that lost $6.5 billion betting on the price of natural gas, said yesterday that it had hired the Fortress Investment Group to help liquidate its assets.Amaranth said on Friday that it had suspended client redemptions to sell off about $3 billion in investments remaining in its two main funds. The fund prices had tumbled as much as 70 percent from a peak value of $9.5 billion at the end of August.The amount investors eventually get back from Amaranth will depend on how effectively it and Fortress unload the funds’ holdings. Amaranth recently gave up its natural gas trades to the Citadel Investment Group and J. P.Morgan Chase, and sold other investments to avoid being shut down by creditors.Fortress will provide Amaranth with “an independent perspective, as well as potential strategic support,” Amaranth’s chief executive, Nicholas Maounis, said in a statement yesterday.Fortress, based in New York, manages $24 billion, including private equity funds, real estate, hedge funds and distressed debt. It was founded in 1998 by Wesley Edens, Robert Kauffman and Randal Nardone, who previously worked together at BlackRock Asset Investors, a New York-based private equity fund.Amaranth, based in Greenwich, Conn., imploded two weeks ago after making wrong bets on the direction of natural gas prices. Talks to sell some or all of its assets to Citigroup broke down two days ago.'"
"'06-10-02,'0','Nobody with the company will be eligible to compete, Netflix said, so that it does not appear that the contest favors insiders.James Bennett, the vice president for recommendation systems, said the company had taken great pains to preserve the anonymity of the 100 million movie ratings it was making available to researchers, even consulting with privacy experts to make sure that the ratings could not be traced to individual Netflix customers.“The data set is the big deal here,” Mr. Bennett said.Netflix has already used its data set to test the accuracy of its existing recommendation system, so it will be able to gauge the accuracy of each entrant’s set of predictions, executives said.Mr. Hastings said he thought it was important to make the ratings database widely available. “Unless you work at Microsoft research or Yahoo research or for Jim Bennett here at Netflix, you won’t have access to a large data set,” he said. “The beauty of the Netflix prize is you can be a mathematician in Romania or a statistician in Taiwan, and you could be the winner.”John Riedl, a professor of computer science at the University of Minnesota and a pioneer in the field of collaborative filtering, said that Netflix and Amazon now had the most advanced recommendation systems.“Most of the easy stuff has been squeezed out already,” he said, adding that it had become increasingly difficult to make substantial progress in predicting accuracy.“Any time you start working on any of these scientific or engineering problems, there’s a period of dramatic improvement,” Professor Riedl said. “It slows down because in a sense you’re competing with 15 years of really smart people banging away at the problem.”Until now, researchers who have been working to improve recommendation systems have been relying on a much smaller database, a set of one million ratings generated by a Web site called MovieLens, Professor Riedl said. “Having a big data set would be really, really useful,” he said.Francisco Martin, the chief executive of Mystrands.com, a company in Corvallis, Ore., that is developing a recommendation engine based on what people listen to on iTunes, agreed, saying, “With ratings-based systems, you need to rate everything you see in order to get reasonably accurate recommendations.”Cash prizes in other difficult technical areas have been offered in recent years. In 2004, there was the $10 million Ansari X Prize for a reusable spacecraft. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is again running a contest involving robotic vehicles with the first prize $2 million. And NASA is offering prize money ranging from $200,000 to more than $5 million for building equipment including lunar excavators and solar sails — large mirror-based equipment intended to collect solar power and conserve rocket fuel.Mr. Hastings said the Netflix prize was different from some others in that it required a minimal financial investment to compete. “This will be one of the largest truly open prizes that’s ever been done,” he said. “All you need is a PC and some great insight.” He said Netflix would publish a detailed description of the winning approach.If no one wins within a year, Netflix will award $50,000 to whoever makes the most progress above a 1 percent improvement, and will award the same amount each year until someone wins the grand prize.Professor Riedl noted that a big improvement in Netflix’s recommendation system would be a boon to the company’s business. “It could result in a significant rise in sales if the recommendations do a better job of helping people find movies they want to see,” he said.'"

"'06-10-02,'0','John Etchemendy does not mention one of the key reasons that colleges like binding early admissions programs: they allow the colleges to inflate their acceptance percentages — the percentage of admitted students who accept the offer to enroll — a statistic that is often reported in college ratings as a measure of school desirability.It may be easy for highly exclusive schools like Harvard, Princeton and Stanford to give up binding early admissions because their acceptance percentages are not likely to change, but other colleges will be much more reluctant to do so.The reality that students with fewer resources are generally less informed about early-decision programs results in a de facto advantage for the advantaged.Filing for income tax refunds in January is not “an analogous situation” to applying to early admission programs, as John Etchemendy suggests. That is because the outcome of the early tax refunds does not have an effect on the later refunds. The tax filers are not competing for refund amounts.School applicants are, in fact, competing for a limited number of slots; hence the bias in the decisions concerning the early and regular pools of applicants.John Etchemendy, the provost of Stanford University, in arguing for early admissions, claims that this system has worked in the past and will in the future. But he does not discuss the senior class collapse after the applicant attains admission in the fall, since many students then view the remainder of the academic year as essentially meaningless.With the regular admission schedule for most elite universities being in April, the student is forced to maintain academic excellence out of fear of not being admitted. A result is that the applicant and the high school both benefit from the continued emphasis on academics.I have another easy-to-adopt suggestion to improve the quality of the college admissions process. Add this question to the application: Have you taken any test preparation classes or paid for a tutor or independent counselor? If you answered yes, please explain in detail.As the parent of a student who received early acceptance last year to an Ivy League university, I agree with John Etchemendy that non-binding early acceptance gives students the ability to compare financial aid packages and significantly reduces the stress associated with the admission process.The presidents of Harvard and Princeton, however, hide a dirty little admissions secret that would really help eliminate “the advantage of the advantaged.” They could immediately stop the “legacy” program that gives special admission consideration to the children of alumni.Would they be willing to risk the ire of alumni and their alumni-sponsored “nest eggs” to increase diversity and eliminate the advantage of wealth?'"

"'06-10-03,'1','In separate statements, EADS and Airbus said that just one A380 would be delivered next year, to Singapore Airlines in October, down from nine that had been promised in June. Thirteen planes will be delivered in 2008 and 25 in 2009, while 45 planes will be delivered in 2010, the companies said.By 2011, the delivery schedule is expected to be back on track. Airbus has received a total of 159 orders for the $300 million-plane from 16 airlines.Christian Streiff, who took over as Airbus chief executive in July, insisted that the “root cause” of the delays remains in the complexity of installing hundreds of miles of electrical wiring, which drive everything from the plane’s navigation systems to seat-back entertainment consoles.“The amount of work to be done to finalize the installation of the electrical harnesses into the forward and rear section of the fuselage had been underestimated in June,” EADS said in a statement, referring to its announcement in June of a six-month delay. That delay shocked investors and customers and sent EADS shares tumbling 26 percent.In a conference call with journalists and analysts, Mr. Streiff stressed that there was “no other hidden issue” behind the delays. The wiring trouble, he said, “is the only weak link in the production chain.”EADS said the delays will slash earnings by more than double the 2 billion euros, or $2.54 billion, forecasted back in June. Cost overruns and compensation to airlines for late deliveries would reduce earnings by 2.8 billion euros, or $3.6 billion, for the period 2006 to 2010, on top of the 2 billion euros in forecast losses. To counter the financial effect of the delays, Mr. Streiff said he planned to introduce a major cost-cutting initiative to reduce annual expenditures at Airbus by at least 2 billion euros, or $2.54 billion, beginning in 2010.The program, dubbed “Power 8,” is intended to reduce the aircraft development cycle of all planes by two years and to increase productivity on assembly lines by 20 percent. Mr. Streiff said the plan would likely involve some staff reductions, but he would not provide details.Louis Gallois, the French co-chief executive of EADS, said the parent company would give its “full support” to Streiff’s cost-cutting plan and that EADS would freeze hiring at its headquarters and also try to cut overhead costs at the group’s military and aerospace divisions by as much as 30 percent.With regard to possible legal action against former executives, EADS said it reserved “all its rights in the circumstances” as it investigated “potential responsibilities at management level.” The company statement did not name any specific targets of its investigation.The former French co-chief executive of EADS, Noël Forgeard, and Gustav Humbert, Mr. Streiff’s predecessor at Airbus, resigned in July in a management shake-up that followed the disclosure of delivery delays in June. Mr. Forgeard and several other EADS executives who sold company shares two months before the June announcement remain under investigation by French and German market regulators for possible improper insider trading.Meanwhile, Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, issued a terse statement suggesting that it was considering scaling back its order for 45 planes.“This is a very serious issue for Emirates and the company is now reviewing all its options,” said Tim Clark, the president of Emirates. The carrier said that it had been informed by Airbus that its first A380 would be delivered in August 2008, nearly two years behind schedule.Analysts said the latest delay — the third for the A380 in 16 months — increased the chances that Emirates could substantially pare its order, which was valued at around $13.5 billion.“I think Emirates has had enough,” said Doug McVitie, managing director of Arran Aerospace, a consultancy based in Dinan, France. “It’s looking very likely that they are going to cancel as much as half the order and buy the 747-8 instead,” he said, referring to the 467-seat version of Boeing’s popular 747 widebody jet, which Airbus’s U.S. rival expects will enter service in 2009.Emirates could not be reached for further comment late Tuesday. Representatives from Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, which also have large orders for the A380 pending, said Tuesday that while they were disappointed by the new delay, they had no plans to cancel their orders. A spokeswoman for Boeing, Amanda Lenders, said the company does not comment on potential customer orders.“A cancellation does deliver an unambiguous message to Airbus,” said Nick Cunningham, an analyst at the Panmure Gordon brokerage in London. “The A380 is very material to their growth plans,” he said, referring to Emirates, which is aiming to sharply increase capacity in an environment where the number of airport landing slots at major international airports is scarce.'"

"'06-10-03,'1','Mangini reiterated yesterday at the Jets’ practice facility in Hempstead, N.Y., that his team needed touchdowns, not field goals, to defeat the high-scoring Colts. While there is logic in that thought, there is also the math of the final scoreboard, which showed the Jets falling short by 3 points — a field goal.“You’re talking about the most important play of the game,” John Ralston, a former N.F.L. and college head coach, said of fourth-down plays in a telephone interview yesterday. “Those kinds of decisions win or lose for you.”No N.F.L. season is without memorable fourth-down calls. In January 2004, the Green Bay Packers and Coach Mike Sherman passed up a chance to go for a first down while facing a fourth-and-1 late in the fourth quarter against the Philadelphia Eagles. If they would have gone for it and made it, the Packers would have almost certainly won and gone to the National Football Conference championship game. But Green Bay took a delay-of-game penalty and punted. The Eagles rallied to tie the score and won in overtime.One week later, the New England Patriots and Coach Bill Belichick converted two fourth downs in the first half against the Colts in the American Football Conference championship game, plays that helped vault the Patriots to the Super Bowl.Mangini was a member of that Patriots coaching staff, and on Sunday, it was his turn to make the call.“I would do it again,” Mangini said yesterday. “The plan was to be aggressive. That’s why we kicked the onside kick, that’s why we went for it on fourth-and-1. That’s why we’re committed to scoring touchdowns.”It was a sentiment his players echoed yesterday.“I had no problem with it,” guard Pete Kendall said. “I certainly understand that people may question that, but I also understand Indy has a very prolific offense. I understand we were trying to come away with seven instead of three. They did a very good job covering the play.”Receiver Tim Dwight added, “To beat the Colts, we had to score touchdowns.”In looking at Mangini’s decision, Ralston said there were several factors in play, including a likely thought that the Jets’ offensive line was in a dominant rhythm against the Colts’ defense.The Jets had driven 77 yards in 15 plays with a no-huddle offense. Before throwing the interception, Pennington completed 4 of 5 passes for 42 yards on the drive.“He’s thinking, ‘I have to go all the way to the end zone to win the game,’ and he starts to crank it up,” Ralston said of Mangini. “He’s studying the team all the way down the field and thinking, ‘What is going to give us a chance to make a touchdown?’“He’s taking a chance, and you go through some of those things, the trial and error,” Ralston added. “He had a lot of faith in his offensive line and his offense. He was saying, ‘I believe in you guys.’ He is trying to build faith in that part of the football team.”Ralston recalled his own risk taking during the 1972 Rose Bowl, when he was the coach at Stanford. Trailing, 10-3, midway through the fourth quarter against Michigan and Coach Bo Schembechler, Ralston wanted to call for a fake punt on fourth down from the Stanford 33.“I talked to an assistant, and he ran down the sideline; he didn’t want to hear about a fake punt,” Ralston said. “I tried to get some help from the press box.”Ralston then decided to call for the fake, and Jackie Brown ran 31 yards for a first down. Stanford tied the score with a touchdown and earned a 13-12 victory with a 31-yard field goal from Rod Garcia with 12 seconds left.“It was the only way we were going to have a chance to win the game, and we did,” Ralston said of the fake.Tom Flores, who won two Super Bowls as the coach of the Raiders, said his teams often rode the highs and lows of fourth-down plays.“It’s not an easy call to make because if it doesn’t work, you’re a jerk, and if it does work, you’re a genius,” Flores said in a telephone interview yesterday. “You may have the whole day to talk about it, but a coach has about 10 seconds to make that decision.”Flores, a radio analyst on Raiders games, said he monitored the Colts-Jets game from his booth. Asked what he thought of Mangini’s call, Flores said: “He was confident they could make it. You want to put them away. That’s probably what he was thinking.”While the Jets have 12 games remaining in their regular season, a 2-2 record looks a lot different than 3-1. Mangini will have many opportunities to take chances on fourth down.If he is lucky, observers will remember the ones he got right more than the ones that backfired.“Every time I see Bo Schembechler, he says the same thing,” Ralston said. “You and your fake punt.”Eric Mangini said he had no update on running back Cedric Houston, who injured his left knee against the Colts. Mangini said he would meet with team doctors to determine Houston’s status for the rest of the week.'"
"'06-10-03,'1','Mr. Spitzer, the Democratic nominee, and his staff members have met numerous times with the coalition, but he has declined to endorse specific figures on spending or units. Instead, he has said that he will work to increase moderately-priced housing through strategies like using available public land, working with the state comptroller to secure some pension fund money for housing and promoting zoning changes to favor higher-density development.John Faso, the Republican nominee for governor, has a different approach. He said he would try to cut the cost of construction by changing the workers’ compensation system and vetoing legislation that “is intended only to drive up construction and labor costs.”He said he would also consolidate the state’s housing agencies and require that all applications for low-income housing tax credits be posted on the Internet to open the process to scrutiny.Mr. Faso, who said he was aware of the coalition’s platform, has not met with the group. Ms. Shubert said of the Faso campaign, “They’ve not been responsive.”One issue that Housing First! does not address is rent regulation, a topic that is so divisive it is often described as a “third-rail issue” among people interested in housing issues. This year, groups focused primarily on tenants’ issues, including those supporting the coalition’s platform, have centered their own campaigns on strengthening rent regulations to slow the attrition of low-priced units.“Housing First! is an unwieldy coalition,” said Michael McKee, treasurer of the Tenants Political Action Committee, a group he said was devoted to helping Democrats win election to the State Senate. “They can only agree on the lowest common denominator. The banks and the developers are not going to support the position of the community groups on an issue like rent regulation.”He added: “Anything that is tenants’ rights or regulation is off the table. They focus entirely on production.“Certainly, increasing the supply of housing is important,” said Mr. McKee, who says he supports the coalition’s platform but believes it fails to address a large part of the affordability problem. “But I believe that you can’t solve the problem by just adding to the stock without dealing with the hemorrhage that we’re seeing every day — rent-regulated as well as subsidized housing, which we are losing in droves.”Both Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Faso oppose repealing the 1971 state law that bars New York City from adopting rent limitations and tenant protections more restrictive than those set by the state. But Mr. Spitzer has said that he will consider raising the $2,000-a-month rent level at which vacant apartments can be removed from rent regulation and to indexing that top rent to the cost of living.Housing First! was established in 2000, uniting people from institutions ranging from J. P. Morgan Chase and Fannie Mae to the Abyssinian Development Corporation and Acorn, the country’s largest community group for low-income families. The aim was to make housing a top issue with the new mayor after a decade of rising housing costs.Drawing on its members’ expertise, the coalition wrote a platform centered around a demand for a $10 billion city program to create and preserve 180,000 units of low- and moderate-income housing. In late 2002, the Bloomberg administration unveiled its housing plan, which it expanded into a $7.5 billion program for 165,000 units, some 47,000 of which are being worked on, administration officials say.Coalition members said that the Bloomberg administration’s approach — including its use of the city’s Housing Development Corporation, which issues bonds to finance low-cost mortgages for developers of lower-priced housing — has helped the group shape aspects of the new platform.Housing First! says the state budget already includes housing programs that provide about half of the $13 billion that it wants spent on housing. The group wants the state to increase its spending on five existing programs, a new state housing investment fund financed from existing tax surcharge money, and greater emphasis on low-income housing by the State Housing Finance Agency.The coalition also wants the next governor to develop a strategy for encouraging owners of subsidized buildings to remain in public programs like Mitchell-Lama, rather than opt out and raise rents to market rates.And it wants legislation introduced that will encourage towns to adopt policies that promote the development of lower-cost housing — for example, inclusionary zoning, which allows developers to build at higher than usual densities in return for setting aside a portion of their projects for lower-income people.“I think we can get the state to play a significant role and reclaim its place as an important player in affordable housing statewide,” said Mark A. Willis, an executive vice president at J. P. Morgan Chase and co-chairman of the Housing First! coordinating committee.Both Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Faso have said they will streamline and consolidate the state’s housing programs and revise the state’s brownfield laws to make building easier. Mr. Spitzer has agreed with several other coalition proposals, including shifting the emphasis of the Housing Finance Agency onto lower-income housing, taking an inventory of state-owned land that might be used for building and reforming zoning.“We’re very cautiously optimistic with Spitzer,” said Jumaane D. Williams, executive director of Tenants and Neighbors, a member of the coalition. “He’s said some good things, and it’s a good start. But there’s so much more that needs to be done.”'"
"'06-10-03,'1','Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has repaid business friends more than $100,000 in hopes of defusing a scandal, government officials said. They confirmed reports that Mr. Ahern mailed checks on Friday to a dozen friends who had given him cash when he was finance minister, in 1993 and 1994. He did not disclose having received the money — which he called loans from friends who had refused repayment — until the newspaper The Irish Times reported details of the payments. He is to answer questions about the money in Parliament today.'"
"'06-10-03,'1','The sensors, housed in nondescript metal boxes around Grand Central Terminal, are combined with concealed video cameras that let technicians or law enforcement personnel observe the area around the monitors for signs of an attack — or for that telltale bucket and mop. Data is analyzed with software that can predict the direction of a chemical plume, to aid officials in coordinating an evacuation.The system was developed by Argonne National Laboratory after the sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway in 1995. It was first tested in the subway system in Washington in December 2001, and by 2003 it had been installed in several stations there. In the summer of 2004 it was installed by the Department of Homeland Security in Grand Central Terminal and in a transit facility in Boston, where the Democratic National Convention was held.At Grand Central, the system is one of several safeguards, including radiation monitors and sensors that detect biological or germ warfare agents.The biological detectors are checked manually once a day. The chemical sensors, however, are computerized and constantly feed data into a monitoring system that can alert the terminal’s security staff when a problem occurs.Anthony J. Policastro, deputy director of the Infrastructure Assurance Center at Argonne National Laboratory, said that the system at Grand Central Terminal was initially meant to be temporary and that it was not until after the Republican convention that Homeland Security officials decided to leave it in place.That required a good deal of additional work, including improving wired and wireless connections and adapting the system to the terminal’s unique conditions, he said.Technicians discovered that Grand Central was both a dirtier and, in its way, a cleaner place than the Washington subway. People who worked on the system said that brake dust from trains fouled filters, which had to be changed more frequently. Fumes from diesel engines caused other problems.And then there were those janitors. The technicians encountered an array of cleaning products in the terminal, and adjustments were needed in the sensors and software.“It’s a more difficult environment in that terminal, in terms of dust, dirt and chemicals,” Dr. Policastro said.Lewis D. Schiliro, who was hired last January as director of Inter-Agency Preparedness for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said there were other problems to overcome.Technicians had to make the detection system’s software work with computer programs that the authority already had in place for emergency management.And the authority had to develop a plan with its own police force, the city police, the Fire Department and the city health department on how to coordinate their response in the event the sensors actually detected an attack.“It’s not that you have a magic wand and can wave it and make all these things happen,” Mr. Schiliro said.He said that in April or May his staff concluded it was satisfied with the Protect system and that he decided then to expand it to Penn Station.The procurement process took four or five months. The contract did not have to be offered for public bid, since Smiths Detection-LiveWave is the only company that offers the system, but further approvals were required within the authority, Mr. Schiliro said, and it took time to negotiate the deal with the company.Last week, the authority’s board agreed to spend $611,000 to upgrade the system at Grand Central and $1.6 million to install the new system at Penn Station. A three-year maintenance contract covering both facilities, with an option for two additional years, will cost an extra $1.7 million.Mr. Schiliro said that it would take time to manufacture and install the sensors and that he expected the new system to be fully in place in the areas of Penn Station controlled by the authority in six to eight months. (Biological monitors and radiation detectors are already installed there.)Amtrak said that in addition to installing the sensors in Penn Station, it would do so in Union Station in Chicago, 30th Street Station in Philadelphia and Union Station in Washington. The installation at the four sites will take place over the next two years at a cost of $5.5 million, said an Amtrak spokeswoman, Karina Romero.Mr. Schiliro said the Metropolitan Transportation Authority might eventually decide to place chemical detectors in other heavily used stations, such as Jamaica, in Queens, Atlantic Avenue, in Brooklyn, and the 125th Street station that serves the Lexington Avenue subway line and Metro-North in Harlem. But the authority has not put in orders for the equipment, and Mr. Schiliro said there was no timetable for when it might do so.'"

"'06-10-03,'1','WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 (AP) — The Supreme Court began its annual term on Monday, but this year the opening session fell on Yom Kippur, and it was brief.Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, who are Jewish, were observing the day, the holiest on the Jewish calendar, and were not on hand.The court issued an 86-page list made up almost entirely of cases the justices declined to consider. Among the cases were these:¶The justices refused to consider a suit by the conservative Christian Civic League of Maine. The league had tried to run advertisements urging voters to call the state’s two senators in time for a Senate debate on a same-sex-marriage ban. But a court halted the effort. Election law bars corporations or labor unions from paying for any broadcast referring to a candidate for federal office within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. The league is an incorporated ministry, and one of the senators, Olympia J. Snowe, is up for re-election.¶The court declined to hear a challenge brought by a worker at a pornographic bookstore in El Paso who was arrested for violating a state law against promoting sex toys shaped like sex organs. The employee called the law unconstitutional. Courts in three states have tossed out such laws, but Texas is one of three others where judges have upheld them.¶The court refused to consider a fight between Northwest Airlines and a low-cost competitor, a case that could have set some rules for competition between large airlines and smaller, no-frills rivals. The case stemmed from a six-year-old suit in which Spirit Airlines charged that Northwest had engaged in predatory pricing to force Spirit to drop two flights from Detroit. A federal appeals court found for Spirit. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case because of procedural issues related to the timing of an appeal filed by Northwest.'"
"'06-10-03,'1','Lawyers say the new British rules go significantly beyond interpretations by other European countries of a directive from Brussels. While the regulation is intended to protect workers when, say, a janitorial contract changes hands or is outsourced, lawyers say that in Britain the revision adds professional services, including advertising and other marketing disciplines, to the businesses that are covered.A spokeswoman for the Department of Trade and Industry in Britain called the revision a minor technical change, and lawyers say their fears could prove unfounded, depending on how courts interpret the regulation.But that interpretation could take months or years, and in the meantime, at least one account shift already appears to be causing concern. In June, the health care and household products company Reckitt Benckiser consolidated its global advertising account with Euro RSCG, a unit of Havas, moving business out of several agencies, including McCann Erickson, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.Both agencies declined to comment, but people in the advertising field in London say McCann believes that under the new rule, some staff members who worked on the Reckitt account may have the right to transfer to Euro.Ad agencies have often had to lay off employees when losing a large account. While the revised rules appear to bar such layoffs, lawyers say that it puts the burden of employing the workers on the new agency.In theory, the regulation could also affect other professional services like law, accounting and consulting. But the rule specifies that the affected employees must work “wholly or predominantly” for a single client, something that is more likely to happen in marketing than in many other professions. Indeed, in an effort to win more business from multinational marketers or to serve their needs more efficiently, many agencies have set up teams or even stand-alone units dedicated to a specific client.Karen Tickner, senior assistant in the employment group at Mishcon de Reya, a law firm, said agencies with such teams might be able to avoid problems by ensuring that employees spend at least some of their time on other clients. Or the industry could create a system under which agencies are indemnified for liabilities stemming from the rule.But London ad agencies, which typically operate with thin profit margins, worry that this will simply add to the costs of vying for business. Some costs might have to be passed along to clients, which have been trying to squeeze expenses.“If agencies have to employ groups of people they don’t want, or have to pay to make them redundant, that’s going to hurt profitability,” said Kerry Glazer, managing director of AAR, a London-based consulting firm that helps link advertisers with agencies. While agencies in the past might have worried most about losing business, “Now I suppose you have to think, commercially, ‘What would this mean were we to win it?’ ”'"
"'06-10-03,'1','BERLIN, Oct. 2 — The embattled prime minister of Hungary, Ferenc Gyurcsany, called Monday for a parliamentary vote of confidence in his national government after his party was drubbed over the weekend in voting for local offices.Mr. Gyurcsany has been trying to regain the initiative after weeks of growing political crisis, during which opposition parties have held mass rallies to drive him and his Socialist-led coalition from office because of his admission that he repeatedly lied about Hungary’s economic strength.Andrea Szente, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gyurcsany’s office, said the prime minister would hold firm. “He wants to implement his economic reforms,” she said. “He sees no reason to resign. He wants to use this vote to show he has support for his reforms.”Mr. Gyurcsany made the decision to schedule a confidence vote for Friday after his government was swept out of power in 18 of 19 regional councils by Fidesz, the conservative opposition party. It was a devastating result for the Socialists, erasing the gains they made in the 2002 local government elections.The Socialists suffered heavy setbacks in Budapest, the capital, and other cities that had been longtime strongholds for the party and its smaller coalition allies. In Budapest, Fidesz won almost half the city’s seats in the regional council.'"

"'06-10-03,'1','“It’s easy to become curious because there is access to good science today,” said Dr. Tyson, who lives with his wife and two children in downtown Manhattan. His role as host is to walk the viewer from subject to subject. “I’ll provide the connective tissue between the show segments,” he added. “We’ll concentrate on things that work thematically, that work visually. What will show up in the news later on?”The season premiere — there are five one-hour shows this season — has reports on doomsday asteroids, the biology behind the compulsion to eat and the creation of a new element for the periodic table. He can tell what’s intriguing, Dr. Tyson said, just by watching faces. “I’ve spent enough time bringing the universe to the public that I’ve become a repository of facial reactions to draw from,” he said. “What created the brightest eyes and the most astonished looks.”Dr. Tyson thinks science is fun, he says, and he plays against the nerdy scientist stereotype. He is 6-foot-4, well dressed and an agile speaker. He also happens to be athletic and African-American. Reared in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, he attended the Bronx High School of Science before earning degrees in physics from Harvard and a Ph.D. in astrophysics from Columbia.He jokes that he was “star struck” by his first trip to Hayden, at 9, and after that delighted in looking at the sky through a telescope. But on his third-grade report card his teacher commented, “Neil should cultivate a more serious attitude toward his school work.” Dr. Tyson related that story as a visitor perused his 2004 book, “The Sky Is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist.”“Nova” has been around for 34 years, and its programs attract more than five million viewers each week, said Paula S. Apsell, the senior executive producer for “Nova.” “Science Now” is a chance to nab viewers who were getting their science news from the Internet, she said (all the “Science Now” stories will be streamed on the Web), and Dr. Tyson was their top choice for the second season after the host of the first season, Robert Krulwich, left for NPR.“He can talk about the most detailed elements of science in an inviting way,” she said of Dr. Tyson.He also helped bring in high ratings as host of the 2004 “Origins” series on “Nova,” she said, and science-program viewers who contacted the show said that they wanted to see real scientists. “ ‘Nova Science Now’ focuses on current research,” Ms. Apsell said. “The U.S. funds $250 billion annually in science research and most Americans have no idea of what goes on in the labs.”Recalling his own delight in peering at the cosmos from a perch in the Bronx, Dr. Tyson said he was also keen on the notion of making science more accessible. “You take it out of this priesthood and bring it to the people who are funding it,” he said, meaning taxpayers whose money is used for scientific research. Those taxpayers, after all, are involved in many debates with science at their core — abortion, global warming, stem cell research, gender differences, Dr. Tyson said.“What you want is a debate with people with different opinions who are scientifically literate,” he added. “The scientist won’t say ‘I know this with certainty.’ We don’t speak that way. We present evidence that supports an idea. When the evidence is overwhelming, we go on to the next problem.”'"
"'06-10-03,'1','People living below the poverty line are more likely to have very high levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation that increases the risk for heart disease and death, a new study has found.C-reactive protein is produced in response to injury or infection, but some people have chronically high levels of it. The study, published in the September issue of Brain, Behavior and Immunity, found no significant difference by socioeconomic status in those with moderate or high levels of C-reactive protein, but there was a significant difference in very high levels.The researchers used data from a nationally representative group of 7,634 adults who were 20 and older and who enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Only 9.1 percent of participants above the poverty line had C-reactive protein levels above 10 milligrams a liter, compared with 15.7 percent of people below the poverty level.About two-thirds of the high levels could be attributed to acute or chronic illness, obesity and lack of exercise. The explanation for the rest was unknown. Dawn E. Alley, the study’s lead author, said, “People in poverty are more susceptible to infection, and because they lack health care and have other social stresses, they are less likely to recover.”The authors acknowledged that C-reactive protein data were available only at one time point and that some data collection relied on self-reports, which can be biased. It is impossible based on these data, they write, to conclude that poverty itself is a cause of very high levels of the protein.Dr. Alley, who completed the study while at the University of Southern California, is now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania.'"

"'06-10-04,'1','R. W. Apple Jr., who spent more than 40 years as a correspondent and editor at The New York Times, died Oct. 4, 2006. His friends and colleagues share their remembrances online.Among many memories of dear Johnny Apple, one achievement you may have missed. Guess who got the first newspaper interview with the new Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in 1979? Not a British journalist. It was then London New York Times Correspondent, R.W. Apple Jr, of course. Mrs. T had her eye on the U.S. from the start, and believed the NYT would hit the right spot!Irritating for us of course...I met Johnny Apple in 1976 during the Carter/Ford Campaign. He was in Cleveland to cover the campaign and visit his mother in Akron, his hometown.For the next 28 years, he would call every four years and ask what was happening in Ohio. Although he was in Ohio every four years, he always called, we never met.In 2004, his call came in during the Ohio primary. Before he started to ask his first question, I told him, “You know, we have not seen each other in 28 years. Why don’t we have lunch? And I’ll invite Tim Hagan.” He agreed and we had a great time telling war stories and discussing Ohio politics.At the Democratic Convention in Boston, Apple came to the Ohio delegation looking for me. He wanted my assessment of the Kerry campaign for his Sunday column. I gave him my pithy quote, “Clinton under ether can run this campaign better that these guys.”That Sunday, my quote appeared in his column. My phone started to ring. One call came in at 5:18 a.m. and left a message asking if I was a traitor to the Democratic Party. Others came in at more reasonable hours and were more complimentary for “telling it like it is.”A few days later, I called Apple and before I could talk, he asked, “getting a lot of flack for your quote?” I responded, “Actually I was calling for a recommendation for a restaurant in Paris. I am traveling there after the election.” He laughed and said, “I wrote books on Paris restaurants. Buy my books.” And he hung up.A few months later, I received a picture of myself and Johnny Apple taken at the convention. I did not know we were being photographed.This picture is one of my prized possessions. Too bad I will never receive that phone call every four years again.Having savored R. W. Apple, Jr.’s articles on food, wine and travel for many years, my friend, Joe Ledbetter, and I–-after a few glasses of wine at a place mentioned in one of those articles—were inspired to write Johnny inviting him to dinner—anytime, anywhere. After several subsequent entreaties (which probably bordered on stalking), he relented and, together with Betsey, met us in Nashville where he was planning an article. As I recall, the dinner lasted about 5 hours and the conversation ran the gamut, covering everything from favorite restaurants, presidential peccadilloes, Bordeaux futures, to college sports, with a few detours in between each—though the details remain foggy. That was almost 10 years ago and since then I was fortunate to have many more splendid meals with the Apples from NYC to Napa to New Orleans and will always remember those food and conversation laden times.I never travel with out first consulting my well worn copy of Apple’s America or my file of newspaper clippings amassed over the years of his articles as a guide. For those, I will always be grateful to Johnny and for the fact that I was lucky enough to make friends with this extraordinary man and his equally extraordinary wife.Johnny was a glory from the time we first met at Princeton in 1954 until the end. He wolfed down the world with an appetite as vorocious and disriminating as the one that drove him to fine food and drink. He made enemies with apparent gusto, but attracted and held friends over the decades as few other men could.That old cliche, ""I can't believe he's dead,"" recovers its full impact when it comes to Johnny's death. None who ever watched him fill up a room as he walked in can easily accept that no room will ever be as full again.As for his lifetime vocation, I'm glad that we never competed, being a bad loser,but was happy to see him coming when me and mine were his subjects. He got the facts, he got the nuances, he got the context and he got the implications: Then he wrote it all down with inimitable style.As with so many of his friends, my liver will be the better for his passing, but my life will forever be diminished. So will print jornalism, once our shared craft, in this foul season of its growing malaise. He knew how much it mattered to get it right and get it out, knew the republic would sicken without a vigorous press and forever linked what he knew to what he did and how he did it. You knew that as long as Johnny was around, print had a future.Many of us feel that our lives have made whole by our wives. No less so for Johnny, and perhaps quite a bit more. Betsy was forever at his side in all the ways that mattered, sharing enthusiasms but also vkigorously dissenting when she thought he was off base. They made the case for marriage.Ah, Johnny, we knew you well. That's why we hate to see you go.As a reporter for The Washington Post, on loan from the metro staff to the national political team, I travelled across Nebraska in 1976 with Johnny on a bus chartered by Idaho Senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Frank Church.Being with Johnny was like being with a rock star. He never seemed to need time to write, but he always had plenty of time for stories. And he had a cell phone, a huge, clumsy contraption that he did not share with anyone. I marveled at his talent and presence then, and now, as a restaurant critic, I mourn the loss of the reporter all of us would have liked to have been.Born in the same Akron hospital 53 days after me, Johnny Apple and I did not meet until 13 years later when, voices cracking, we matriculated at Western Reserve Academy. He was instantly christened ""Seed"" by our churlish classmates, an inevitable moniker given the combination of his name, Ohio, and boarding school. We both had been sent there by parents intent on improving our seriousness of purpose. Johnny's did not succeed.Years later Johnny would occasionally imply that he had overcome modest German roots in a small third world Midwestern city, but to me he was the epitome of urbane sophistication. He was also an instant star in our dancing class -- the girls loved him -- and a constant source of frustration for the all-male faculty. Impulsive, he was possessed by boundless energy but nonetheless a classic underachiever. His SAT verbal would have been off the charts, had there been charts in 1948.The Academy in those days employed a demerit system with the objective of inhibiting the social behavior of its denizens. It also required all freshmen to take half-credit Industrial Arts. To this day R. W. Apple Jr. is the only student in the annals to have ever received three circled (inexcusable) demerits for ""GBWOC,"" posted on the public bulletin board and later deciphered by us as ""Goosing Boy With Oil Can.""We like to think that in time Johnny outgrew these proclivities. Perhaps, but possibly it required the influence of ""my wife, Betsey."" Though he came to have thousands of friends, many in high places, from every corner of the world, it was Betsey who was by far the best for him and to him. It was Betsey whom the Academy needed on its all-male faculty.Certainly living meagerly, the family enjoyed our visit and inquired as to how we found them, to which we explained that they had been mentioned in the largest newspaper in the United States. We thought about sending them a copy of the article to post on their wall - they were so delighted to hear of their little piece of fame.I had wanted to share with Mr. Apple that his recommendations revealed a little piece of hidden Shanghai to me, helping me to find the pleasures of the humble, daily life that I always seek in my travels.It's sad to see that there will be an end to the supply of ""R.W. Apple guides"" I've been using for the past few years, but as Mr. Apple said, I'm sure his last article Global Gourmet will ""set me soaring"" for the new few years. It's been great fun following in the footsteps (and mouthbites) of R.W. Apple around the world.It is with a very strong feeling of loss to hear about the Apple's passing. I was one very fortunate person to have known him even for just three or four hours in Seattle as he visited our Salumi Factory and Lunch spot.In our awe, he made all of us in our family feel so comfortable with his simplicity of enjoyment, his scribbled notes and of course a couple of glasses of great Lambrusco and devouring of whatever we put on the table. Add to this a great devotion to Betsey and obvious care that she be happy too.A tremendous impact and an astounding career and a great ability to make others feel as comfortable as one can be. One will never forget him.I knew Johnny Apple socially in the early 1970s; his first wife was a colleague of mine at the Voice of America. I was new to reporting and I'm not sure he would have paid much attention to me if we had run into each other while covering a story, but when he discovered I was serious about learning journalism, he offered me the benefit of his already extensive experience.On more than one occasion, after a drink or two, he stared intently at me and tried to explain the realities of the trade. ""That piece of mine on the front page today: no less than six editors mauled it before it was set in type."" None of his best prose ever survived the Times' editing process, he insisted. I was gullible and, on one level, I believed him. On the other hand, everything of his that I read seemed rather colorful compared to what his colleagues were able to publish. C'mon, who but Apple could have snuck ""Brobdingnagian"" into an article for the Times?Inevitably as a high schooler Johnny was appropriately called Seed.Seed was also editor of our weekly school paper. His inspired writing was obvious even at that age.Of special note to me was his opening on what otherwise would have been a dull article about me:""No it's not Santa Clause ----"".A few years ago at the northern Michigan restaurant, Tapawingo, my husbandand I found ourselves sharing a table with Johnny Apple and his wife Betsey.We were intimidated by Apple's fame and luster but in five minutes we wereall best friends. Legend though he was, there wasn't a snobbish bone inthat great, generous body.I met the incredible ""Johnny"" at a private dinner party in Washington, and although the cuisine and wines have faded in memory, the image of this vibrant, hyper-alert and witty fellow is very much alive today. He relished everything--the bonhomie and banter in a pre-Watergate but politically charged D.C. Todd Purdum's extraordinary obituary sent me down a memory trail yesterday, and I searched in vain in your archival collection for Johnny's September 5, 2001 paean to La Pyramide restaurant in Vienne, France. Thanks to Google today, I have that word painting, plus my own memories of Fernand and Mado Point, brightened by the indelible ones of our departed colleague.Beverly Crandall, formerly of the National Desk copy deskI was in the same Sunday School Class as Raymond at Trinity Lutheran Church in Akron, Ohio.My memory is of a very bright, witty, disjointed and somewhat overweight youth who always had an appreciative audience. I knew he had to be born to the ""purple"" because he had the first ball point pen that I had ever seen. It cost $12.00 in the late forties. It was supposed to last a lifetime and came with an aluminum holder shaped like a rocket.Johnny was the only American I knew who understood the Rules of Cricket. I remember sitting in his office in the London Bureau watching the Ashes matches between England and Australia. At the time I ran the Times advertising office for Europe.During the 1976 presidential campaign, exactly two national reporters traveled to Oklahoma City to cover the state's then-obscure precinct caucus process -- myself (then with NBC News) and Johnny Apple. As fate would have it, I came down with some foul stomach flu that kept me within a 10-yard dash of my hotel toilet. Learning of my plight, Johnny saved the day - calling me from the state Democratic headquarters with the results as they trickled in. I managed to cobble together a few radio reports in my room as the evening wore on, and my New York editors must have assumed i was out in the trenches. I never properly thanked my savior for his kindness that night, so I'll just have to find the best restaurant here in Tucson and celebrate RWA Jr.'s life with as much gusto as I can muster.I first encountered R.W. ""Johnny"" Apple, Jr. when we purchased a home next door to Betsey and him in the village of 28th Street in Georgetown, which consisted of the block between P and Q Streets, Northwest. When we met Johnny, every bit as large as his public profile. Although in national politics, I was still in awe of this internationally prominent journalist, yet to everyone on the block, this larger than life figure was simply ""Johnny"". We soon learned that Johnny, along with his lovely wife Betsey,was more than an accomplished journalist and gourmand, quite simply he had learned how to live life, and he lived it well.On those days when he wasn't profiling a would be president, a renowned chef or a fine bottle of claretfar from Washington, D.C., my then young daughters were always mesmerized to see ""Mr. Apple"" emerge from his nightly hibernation in his long English night shirts to claim the morning papers (of which there were many) or put out the trash as they hurried to get to school. Always jovial, 'good morning girls', Johnny could pivot to the issue of day in an instant and put it in historical context, while one was still digesting the current matter. But to Louise and Meredith, he was a towering figure whom they viewed like asome grand character they read about in their children's novels.His love of food, and his gift of writing about it, how it was made and where it came from, was followed closely by the neighborhood. We could track our neighbor's whereabouts by his dispatches, but what I most remember was a piece on Nueske's bacon from the Wisconsin that just happened to be sold by the little bodega across the street. Following its publication, the store's proprietor, a immigrant from South Korea, proudly displayed the R.W. Apple, Jr. article noting that ""my wife Betsey"" occasionally purchased the product from the store for his consumption.Johnny was a journalist to the world, feared by many and respected by all, but in the Village of 28th Street, he was our hometown boy made good. He will be missed.After the 1968 Chicago Convention there were fierce and bitter fights between the right and left wing of the Democratic Party over how it should be reformed. The issues were often arcane having to do with apportionment, nominating procedures, etc. I was very involved on the side of radical reform and wrote an article in a short-lived, pamphlet-sized publication called The New Democrat (published by Stephen Schlesinger) that among the political reporters in Washington only ""R.W. Apple understood the debate."" I thought by identifying him as R.W. I suggested an arms-length relationship, though by then I had gotten to know Johnny fairly well and we had dinners and many long conversations in restaurants in Washington, Chicago, New York and wherever else the battle for the soul of the Democratic Party was being played out.It so happened that the day after the few hundred copies of The New Democrat appeared, Johnny was already scheduled to have lunch with Democratic Party Chairman Robert Strauss. To Johnny's amazement---and mine---as soon as Johnny walked into his office Strauss slammed the article (which Johnny was completely unaware of) on the desk and berated him for being in league with the bomb-throwers. It was a theme he vigorously pursued, to Johnny's discomfort, during their lunch.Later that afternoon Johnny called me and said while he appreciated the recognition, please in the future not to single him out for any special distinction. While I was delighted to have this confirmation that the chairman of the party read our magazine (and our criticisms got to him), it was clear Johnny felt sandbagged. And indeed, I never again portrayed him as a hero in the fights over proportional representation and the composition of standing committees.But I wasn't all together reformed. During research for a book and a documentary in the 1980s I read nearly every issue of the New York Times between 1938-1945. I was struck by the elegance of the writing, the detail of the reporting, and the quality of the analysis. And though I don't want to again get Johnny into any trouble with his contemporaries, I have to confess I sent him a note that I believed only he among practicing journalists wrote, reported and analyzed on a level with the journalists of that astonishing era.I first met Johnny in the early 70’s. I had a date with Bill Rice who was then the Food & Wine writer for the Washington Post. We went to Johnny’s house and he cooked. Boy, did he love to cook!I ran into him during the 1976 presidential campaign in Ohio where he told me that he was going to go visit his parents and then get out of town.We last spoke after I had left a message at the NYT’s Washington Bureau. The phone rang and I saw it was a call from Louisiana. When I answered it Johnny said, Jan when you need to get something to me send it to my home – and he gave me his home fax number.A wonderful man, a true friend and a fabulous reporter who will be sorely missed.In the summer of 2005, some fellow Oklahomans and I were dining in Paris at a restaurant called Chez Georges. Seated next to us at a banquette was, as we soon learned, R. W. Apple and his wife, Betsey. He and my wife had both ordered sweetbreads, and that led to his making the comment that this was his favorite restaurant for sweetbreads. That led to a conversation involving our table and his, which was entirely delightful.I recall his saying that he would no longer do political reporting, expressing some distaste for the whole contemporary political scene. He also told us about his travel book concerning fifty American cities. Before we parted he gave us his business card which still listed him as chief correspondent at the New York Times, not as associate editor (which he was). As soon as got home, I checked his book out of the library, and read the chapter on Portland, Oregon, where I expected to be in the next month or so.After finishing the book, I sent Johnny Apple an e-mail telling him how much I enjoyed the book. The following morning I received a response from him, saying that he hoped his recommendations would not lead us astray in Portland. Then he added, ""When we go tonight to our favorite restaurant in the Cotswolds, I would'nt mind running into that same Oklahoma group.""On a busy Friday night in February 2002, a party of four gourmands converged on my restaurant that consisted of R.W. Apple, his wife Betsey, and Tim and Nina Zagat. They asked for, and I wrote, a menu for them consisting of the best I had to offer that evening. The thought crossed my mind that I had the present-day counterparts to Henry the Eighth and Ali Baba sitting at that table.I let them dine in private until towards the end of their meal when dessert was served, then I went to the table to speak with them. Tim animatedly waved his arms and bellowed, ""Wayne, I give this a 30, 30, 30!"" referring to his famous Zagat Survey rating system for food, service and ambiance. I responded with a big smile and, ""But Tim, I thought it's a reader's survey? Not yours!""We all had a laugh as I sat down and talked with them for the rest of their visit that evening. Johnny Apple lived up to his reputation: a Lucculan, gregarious figure, he truly was bigger than life, and I was happy to have experienced him.Today when I was out walking and listening to NPR, I heard them talking about Johnny Apple; immediately a sinking feeling engulfed me. The past tense verb was spoken in reference to every aspect of Mr. Apple's being. Many of the stories were humorous, yet I knew what I would hear announced at the end of the segment.Immediately upon my home entrance I announced to my husband, ""Johnny Apple died today!""I loved his writing. My first acquaintance came when he was the Washington Bureau Chief, then his wonderful pieces in the food section. I also bought his book, ""Apple's America.""I am feeling just like I lost a close friend.I was very sorry to hear about Johnny's illness a few months ago, he was not only a good friend, but as I used to repeatedly tell him, he was my American godfather, my growth and success in this hospitality business was due to him, the full page article in The New York Times on Oct. 22, 2003 in the column Dining Out (Asian Journey; In South India, No End of Spice, No End of Flavor).I just read in the local Kerala, India newspaper about his demise, and it was very painful.The last I saw him was at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa, Calif. in 2004. Again I was invited to give a presentation on Kerala Cuisine only because of the article he wrote in the NY Times, this article has given me acceptance in many prestigious firms, and many travel agents have approached me.Though he was such a known personality, Johnny always had a humble spirit and mind, if I was happy, depressed, or worried, each time I would mail him, the next morning, there would be a mail from him giving a good piece of advice. It is with tears in my eyes that I am writing this note, though my presence is not there in the States, my whole mind is with him, and this evening I will offer a special prayer for his soul, and of course for Betsey, ask God to give her all the strength to bear with loss. The loss is not only for his family, but for small people like us, who he used to promote, I pray God gives eternal rest to Johnny's soul.I’m sad to hear of his death. Born and raised and living in New York, I first encountered his writing with his coverage of the Vietnam War in the Times. His articles were the only ones I trusted and read about the war. I’m sorry he’s gone.I have lost one of the truly treasured friends in my life. It always was a distinct pleasure to have Johnny and Betsey join me at Laurel, my restaurant in San Diego. When he brought all his Times staff to Laurel during the Republican Convention here, I felt this was the highest honor. Johnny had selected Laurel! I just hope heaven's wine cellar is filled with Williams Selyem and Leonetti reds (I have some put back for you, Johnny, if they run short!)'"
"'06-10-04,'1','“It is an ethical obligation to look for hope; it is an ethical obligation not to despair.”As spoken by the playwright Tony Kushner in a friendly, reasonable voice in “Wrestling With Angels,” Freida Lee Mock’s admiring documentary portrait of Mr. Kushner, those words sound like basic common sense. If we want a better world, we’d better be able to imagine it.Mr. Kushner has the imagination as well as the gumption to put his body where his words are. A brief scene near the end of the film shows him in Miami on the day of the 2004 presidential election helping people vote after being turned away from their polling place.Throughout the film his easygoing buoyancy contradicts the clichéd image of the left-wing intellectual as a grim, preachy commissar of political correctness. He is a welcoming public figure who has a gift for being very funny and serious at the same time. Whatever his subject, his words are usually accompanied by a playfully disarming grin. As much as he knows about history, literature and Jewish culture, he never pontificates like an academic know-it-all.How we live in the world, Mr. Kushner says, depends on our willingness to empathize with others. And empathy seems to come naturally to this gay, Jewish playwright, now 50, who was born in New York, grew up in Lake Charles, La., studied medieval history at Columbia, and won a Pulitzer Prize for “Angels in America,” his epic play about AIDS in the Reagan era.As informative as it is, “Wrestling With Angels” doesn’t have time to do more than scratch the surface of its fascinating subject. If you haven’t seen “Angels in America,” the snippets excerpted from the Mike Nichols-directed HBO movie of this visionary work barely hint at its substance. Mr. Kushner mentions his admiration for Brecht’s epic theater, which inspired his first play, “A Bright Room Called Day,” but not at enough length to establish a deep connection.'"
"'06-10-04,'1','The process of copying and transferring information stored in genes, called transcription, is the key to keeping organisms from yeast to humans alive and functioning. Disturbances in the transcription process are involved in numerous human illnesses like cancer, heart disease and inflammation.Dr. Kornberg said in an interview that his work had already influenced development of new drugs and therapies for various conditions, and that understanding how transcription works is “central to the issue” of research that hopes to use stem cells to cure such diseases as diabetes.“Our work will doubtless spawn many more applications in the future,” Dr. Kornberg said. “All of molecular biology depends on understanding transcription.”Dr. Kornberg, who received an undergraduate degree in chemistry from Harvard in 1967 and his doctorate in chemistry from Stanford in 1972, spent most of his career working in biological chemistry.Much of Dr. Kornberg’s work has focused on an enzyme called RNA-polymerase, which makes messenger-RNA and controls the process of selecting certain genes from the thousands that make up DNA to duplicate at any one time. Dr. Kornberg’s research groups characterized how RNA-polymerase plays a central role in the transcription process by hooking on to certain parts of the DNA chain and making RNA that produced exactly the protein a cell needed at the time.The Nobel committee said that Dr. Kornberg did fundamental work over 20 years on how the information stored in genes is copied and transferred to other parts of the cell and that he was the first to create actually pictures of the process. Using a method called X-ray crystallography, he was able to use X-rays scattering through crystal forms of RNA-polymerase to have a computer assemble “freeze frame” images of the enzyme at work.By manipulating the enzyme’s components, the researcher and colleagues have been able to stop the transcription process midstream to see what is happening on an atomic level. Dr. Kornberg said the next stage of the work is determining the complete process in atomic detail, not just the middle part of the operation.“We’ve completed the central part of the puzzle,” he said, “Now we want to create a moving picture of the process from beginning to end.”“This Nobel Prize also underscores the key role of chemistry in the scientific research into genetics,” said E. Ann Nalley, president of the American Chemical Society. “In order to take the first actual pictures revealing how the genetic information stored in genes is copied so that the body can use it, Dr. Kornberg used a mainstay chemical technology called X-ray crystallography.”Dr. Jeremy M. Berg, director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the National Institutes of Health, said the honor showed the importance of taxpayer-supported basic research that is not aimed at a certain goal. His institute has provided financial support for Dr. Kornberg’s work since 1979, even when it was unclear if the research would be successful, he said.“You support challenging work, even when the endpoint is not obvious,” Dr. Berg said, “Kornberg made slow but steady progress along the way and now his work lays the groundwork for a lot of molecular biology.”Dr. Kornberg, who said he has vivid memories of visiting Stockholm as a 12-year-old to see his father receive his Nobel, said he is looking forward to his family having similar memories. The chemist said he and his wife, Dr. Yahli Lorch, a Stanford biologist and collaborator, and their three children should not see a big change in their lives because of the almost $1.4 million that comes with the prize.“On the salary of a professor, I have mostly debts that will be settled after paying lots of taxes,” he said, “Then I’ll probably replace my 20-year-old automobile. I don’t see much after that.”'"
"'06-10-04,'1','Now that the talks are now finished, two questions now come up: will Mr. Ghosn discuss a partnership with the Ford Motor Company, and what action could the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian take?G.M.’s decision came a day after its board met to hear a status report on the talks, as well as consider a request by Mr. Kerkorian, G.M.’s biggest shareholder, for an independent analysis of the value of a possible alliance.In a statement, Mr. Kerkorian’s Tracinda Corporation said it believed an alliance “would have enabled G.M. to realize substantial synergies and cost savings.”“We regret that the board did not obtain its own independent evaluation of the alliance,” the statement said.On Monday, the G.M. board amended its bylaws in what auto industry analysts said was an effort to fend off any action by Mr. Kerkorian, who has said he wants to buy as many as 12 million more G.M. shares to solidify his position. The board said any shareholder who was planning to seek a consent solicitation, used to corral proxy votes, would have to notify the company.Mr. Kerkorian already owns 56 million shares, but their value fell today on initial reports that the talks were over. Since the announcement this afternoon, G.M.’s shares recovered some of their losses.Mr. Kerkorian suggested the talks this summer after meeting with Mr. Ghosn. Mr. Kerkorian, through his associate, Jerome York, has expressed frustration with G.M. management’s pace on a turnaround plan. Mr. York, who sits on G.M.’s board, called in a January speech for G.M. to eliminate some of its divisions and praised Mr. Ghosn’s turnaround at Nissan.Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Wagoner met for the first time on July 14 and again last week in Paris. But even before the Paris meeting, word emerged that G.M. had severe doubts about an alliance with the French and Japanese companies.G.M. proposed that Renault and Nissan make a multibillion-dollar compensation payment up front, to reflect G.M.’s belief that it brought more value to the merger. Meanwhile, Nissan and Renault executives warned their G.M. counterparts that they needed to be concerned about Toyota, which could pass G.M. this year to become the world’s biggest auto company.Mr. Wagoner and Mr. Ghosn both said last week that the discussions would continue until Oct. 15, the deadline set in July. But their comments to reporters at the Paris Motor Show indicated that the deal was running off the rails.Mr. Wagoner, emphasizing a theme voiced by other G.M. executives, said that the company was making progress with its turnaround efforts in the United States and Europe, and that it did not need an alliance to be successful.Mr. Ghosn, for his part, said he would be interested in pursuing a third partner for his Eurasian alliance if the G.M. talks did not succeed. That presumably is Ford, since the Chrysler Group is part of DaimlerChrysler. Mr. Ghosn later said that he would not actively court another alliance partner but he has previously had conversations with William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman of Ford.'"
"'06-10-04,'1','But in China’s first official reaction to the test announcement, Mr. Liu also made clear that Beijing wants Pyongyang to drop the idea. ""We hope that North Korea will exercise necessary calm and restraint over the nuclear test issue,"" he said.In Seoul, the rhetoric was sterner. President Roh Moo Hyun said: ""We need to let North Korea know very clearly what situation its nuclear test would create.""Other officials, however, declined to specify what actions Seoul was prepared to take, especially whether Seoul would suspend its joint industrial complex and tourism project which provides the impoverished North withmillions of dollars a month in worker wages and tourist fees. The country also today sent a relief shipment to the economically distressed North as planned, news agencies reported.In Tokyo, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, known as a hardliner on North Korea as foreign minister, today called for a united international message to Pyongyang.“It is important that the international community send North Korea a message that it must respond to their concerns,” he said, according to The Associated Press. “The situation will not be resolved until North Korea recognizes this.”After Pyongyang alarmed the region this summer by test firing a long-range missile, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution calling on it to halt missile test, but without the penalties sought by the United States and Japan.Mr. Abe, who took office last week, will travel to China on Sunday and then to South Korea on a trip bound to dominated by the nuclear question.Analysts today said that the problem in deciding how to respond is complicated by suspicions that Pyongang may have issued the threat primarily for leverage in winning American concessions, including the direct negotiations with Washington that the Bush administration has so far rejected. The danger in treating the idea as a bluff is that Pyongyang may feel compelled to carry out a test if Washington does not soften its position, the analysts said.A successful test could trigger a nuclear arms race in Northeast Asia, while skepticism about Washington’s North Korea policy would likely deepen in the region, and perhaps at home as well, they said.Washington’s financial sanctions have hurt Kim Jong Il’s regime by reducing his cash flow from illicit trading and counterfeiting. But the American options are limited, experts say.China and South Korea have opposed broad economic sanctions, fearing the unrest that could follow, and are even more set against military action.The North Korean announcement intensified diplomacy among the United States, China, South Korea, Russia and Japan on Tuesday. Top diplomats exchanged phone consultations on how to address the spike in tensions.Those five nations’ talks with North Korea on its nuclear weapons programs have stalled since last September in a dispute over Washington’s crackdown on offshore North Korean bank accounts.American intelligence officials said they saw no signs that a test was imminent. But they cautioned that two weeks ago, officials who have reviewed recent intelligence reports said American spy satellites had picked up evidence of activity around North Korea’s main suspected test site. It was unclear to them whether that was part of preparations for a test or perhaps a provocation related to the visit at that time to Washington of South Korea’s president, Roh Moo Hyun.At that meeting, Mr. Bush and Mr. Roh discussed the possibility of a test, and Mr. Rohwas quoted as saying said the event would ""change the nature"" of South Korea’s policy ofBut the two leaders did not appear to have a coordinated strategy, and a senior Asian diplomat in Washington said Tuesday ""no one is quite sure how to respond"" if North Korea conducts a test in coming weeks or months.Kim Keun Sik, a North Korea expert in Kyungnam University in Seoul, noted that the North Korean threat came as Seoul and Washington were working on a so-called ""common joint approach,"" a new set of initiatives that Seoul officials hope will break the impasse between Washington and Pyongyang.time for you to make a concession because I might test a bomb,’"" Mr. Kim said. ""But what makes this different from the other North Korean bluffing is that if the United States doesn’t react, North Korea will have no choice but to test a bomb.”""North Korea has chosen to burn the bridge behind it,” he said.A nuclear test could give the Bush administration an opportunity to muster global support for a stronger United Nations Security Council resolution and tighter economic sanctions against the North.American officials, declining to be named because they are not authorized to speak about North Korean policy, have said in recent weeks that the administration assumed that sooner or later, North Korea would conduct a test.""You could argue that it wouldn’t be an all-bad thing,"" one administration hawk said recently, ""because it would finally unify the Chinese, and the Russians and the South Koreans,"" all of whom have been reluctant to pressure North Korea.""There is a high possibility that the United States will earnestly shiftits policy toward a ’regime change’ or ’regime toppling’ in North Korea,""said Paik Hak Soon at Sejong Institute in South Korea.In comments that appeared primarily aimed at China and South Korea, U.S.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice prodded Asian nations on Tuesday to""reassess"" their relationships with the North Koreans. But a nuclear test,experts say, can also highlight a blame game between the United States,which believes that the soft approach by Beijing and Seoul has emboldenedNorth Korea, and the Asian countries, which have been displeased withWashington’s campaign to use sanctions to bring North Korea to heel.""Frankly, I think China will just accept it if North Korea tests a bomb,""said Kim. ""Beijing will side with North Korea with nuclear arms, ratherthan with the United States, because it wants to keep North Korea as abuffer between it and U.S. influence in South Korea and Japan.""Michael Green, who handled North Korea issues for the National Security Council until he left the White House last year, said, ""I think that theevidence has grown, especially with the missile launch, that North Koreahas its own escalation ladder, and they would agree to postpone a test onlyfor the right price.""He thought it unlikely that price would be met, and said he thinks ""theNorth has calculated that they can take the heat from China and Japan, andthey are not losing much from South Korea anyway.""Shen Dingli, executive deputy director of the Institute of InternationalIssues at Fudan University in Shanghai, said that North Korea ""is bound tohold that the advantages of conducting a nuclear test outweigh the""Hence it will proceed with a nuclear test,"" Shen said in an articlecirculated by the California-based Nautilus Institute. He added that Chinaonly needed to ""symbolically take part in the sanctions"" once North Korea""In the choice between limited sanctions that demonstrate our country is aresponsible power and harsh sanctions that forces the DPRK to go toextremes or bring about ’regime change,’ China can only afford to take thelesser evil approach,"" he said.

"'06-10-04,'1','Average prices declined on the West Side of Manhattan by up to 17 percent during the quarter, offset in part by rising prices on the East Side, according to several of the studies.Prudential Douglas Elliman, whose study reported the highest quarterly sales prices, put the average sale price at $1.3 million, down 7 percent from the prior quarter, and 12 percent above the $1.15 million average sales reported a year ago. Another brokerage firm, Brown Harris Stevens, put the average price at $1.1 million, 10 percent below the previous quarter and 4 percent below figures it recorded a year ago.Offsetting the quarterly decline were other figures suggesting the market was essentially stable. The number of sales recorded during the quarter rose, and the number of listings of apartments at Manhattan brokerage firms was flat, after rising 32 percent during the previous year, according to the Elliman study. The average number of days an apartment was on the market increased slightly, from 144 to 150. Rising inventory can indicate a weakening market.Although hundreds of apartment sales are recorded by the city each week throughout the summer, an increase in activity was reported in recent weeks. Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm that prepared a market study for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that many buyers were “sitting on the fence” and unable to make a decision. At the same time, he said, sellers had not significantly dropped prices.“Nobody is making a decision,” he said. “At some point someone has to blink.”Mr. Miller said that in the last few years, prices have declined and sales have slowed in the third quarter, only to regain momentum, as buyers, stirred by bonuses on Wall Street, rushed in to buy expensive apartments.Part of the uncertainty over the direction of the Manhattan market comes from the many ambiguous and contradictory market reports issued by various brokerage firms. They all combine publicly available data on co-op and condo sales, with proprietary information on closed sales that have not yet been filed and recorded. The result is that each report includes a different mix of sales, and may record the same sales in different quarters as information becomes available.Sometimes the information available is incomplete. Mr. Miller, for example, said the increase in reported sales might be the result in part of better data collection, as the city provided public access to sale prices of co-ops that had not previously been available.Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, noted that while the overall market paused in the last few quarters, the prices on smaller apartments had continued to rise, driving up median prices, a measure less influenced by multimillion-dollar sales, making even small apartments more expensive. As a result, some developers of new apartments have been offering concessions, such as covering closing costs, that would reduce the cash outlay needed to buy an apartment.Gregory J. Heym, chief economist for Brown Harris Stevens, who produced the most seemingly pessimistic figures, said the price decline actually captured a market shift. He said the decline in average sales prices reflected a change in the typical apartments sold: the average apartment size dropped and the price per square foot rose.He said he expected the strong local economy, and modest interest rates, to keep the co-op and condominium markets stable.'"
"'06-10-04,'1','Alcan, the aluminum producer, said that it would buy back up to 5 percent of its shares beginning next month. The company currently has 376 million outstanding common shares. If the company follows through on the plan, the purchases are likely to increase the value of its stock, which closed at 43.84 Canadian dollars on Tuesday. The buyback, along with a 33 percent increase in the quarterly dividend announced in August, appears to be a defensive move by the company, which has been the subject of takeover speculation. Like most commodity producers, Alcan is experiencing a boom. In August it reported that its second-quarter profit was $455 million, more than twice the $191 million it recorded a year earlier.Tesco, the British grocery chain, said that first-half profit rose 23 percent as the company cut its prices to increase market share. Net income rose to £788 million ($1.49 billion) in the six months through Aug. 26, from £641 million a year earlier. Second-quarter sales at stores open at least a year, excluding gasoline, were up 6.6 percent, compared with a 4.5 percent increase in the first quarter. Revenue rose 19 percent, the company said. Tesco said it was on track to open its first stores in the United States next year. The company has 100 employees at its offices in El Segundo, Calif., and has acquired land for a distribution center near Los Angeles. (AP)The Nintendo Company raised its profit outlook for the fiscal year ending in March as a result of robust sales of its Nintendo DS hand-held game machine and software. Nintendo, which makes game machines and Mario and Pokémon video games, also expects its new console, Wii, to drive earnings higher in the second half of the year, it said. Nintendo’s group net profit for the fiscal year was expected to jump to 100 billion yen ($847 million) from its previous outlook of 83 billion yen ($703 million). Sales were expected to hit 740 billion yen ($6.27 billion), up from the previously forecast of 640 billion yen ($5.42 billion). The company, which is based in Kyoto, said it was confident its new Wii console, the successor to the GameCube, would also help profits when it is released later this year. (AP)The BenQ Corporation, which took over Siemens’s unprofitable mobile phone business a year ago, estimates it lost at least 840 million euros ($1.1 billion) in the handset business on delays in new models. The loss in the 12 months that ended Sept. 30 included the company’s own-branded business and its contract-manufacturing operations, BenQ’s head of business strategy, Rick Lei, said in a conference call. BenQ, Taiwan’s biggest mobile phone maker, forecast its fourth-quarter loss would decline substantially. The company stopped providing funds for its German unit, which it bought from Siemens last year, last week and that unit filed for bankruptcy. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)U.S. STANDS ON ITS LAST OFFERThe United States is committed to reaching a new world trade deal but its top trade official said that America would not try to revive the talks by being the first to make a new agricultural offer. America’s trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, said in a speech that Washington was still waiting for other countries to match the “bold” proposal the United States made one year ago to cut farm subsidies and tariffs. The European Union, in particular, has urged the United States to make a new offer to cut its domestic farm subsidies to help revive the world trade talks. The negotiations were suspended in July after leading countries again failed to agree on a package of farm trade reforms. “Calls for the U.S. to go first? Been there. Done that. Bought the T-shirt. Didn’t work,” Ms. Schwab said. (REUTERS)'"
"'06-10-04,'1','Five years after 9/11 and a year after Hurricane Katrina, most small and midsize businesses in New York City are unprepared for emergencies, according to a survey to be released today by the American Red Cross and the Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and Response at New York University. Almost half of the 200 businesses surveyed (46 percent) said they lacked information about preparing for a disaster, and 41 percent said they did not have enough money or personnel to devote to devising a plan. Bill Raisch, director of the university’s International Center for Enterprise Preparedness, said business owners tended to focus on the likelihood of each type of disaster, like a blizzard or a terrorist attack, rather than the much greater likelihood that any one of them might occur. He urged the legal, insurance and credit-rating industries to reward businesses for making emergency plans.'"

The election was the first in Montenegro since it gained independence from Serbia.The leadership of Mr. Djukanovic’s Social Democratic Party was to meet Thursday to decide on a new nominee.Mr. Vujanovic emphasized that the prime minister’s decision was “definitive,” adding that Mr. Djukanovic would remain as the head of his party.'"

The measures were put on the ballot by the California Legislature, which is led by Democrats, after lawmakers put partisan disagreements aside and agreed on the plan, which is intended to rebuild the state for the next generation. Opinion polls have shown mixed enthusiasm for the measures, and the Rebuild California Plan umbrella group has bought $4 million in television advertising in the last two weeks of campaigning.

"'06-10-04,'1','Now, even as natural gas prices sag, along with his company’s stock price, and the word glut is on the tip of the tongue among the drilling crowd, Mr. Souki says he is fixed on the longer view.He is convinced the nation will need to import more gas because North American production is declining. That is the same view Mr. Souki held six years ago, when he decided to shake up the company’s business plan. He defiantly changed its stock symbol to LNG in 2003, and devoted himself to scoping out the country’s coastlines for potential terminal sites.The already energy-intensive shoreline along the Gulf of Mexico, he concluded, made the most sense, economically and politically, and he started buying real estate in uninhabited harbors close to existing pipelines and gas-thirsty refineries and petrochemical plants.“People were actually amused that we would be thinking about importing natural gas,” dryly giggled Mr. Souki, 53, a man with a taste for double-breasted suits. “Nobody took us very seriously.”Cheniere was so unprofitable and utterly spurned by investors in 2002 that Mr. Souki had to borrow $30,000 from his company’s president just to meet a payroll. But over the last four years, Mr. Souki has managed to arrange financing, sign up long-term buyers and master the regulatory process.Two of the four terminals he has permits for are under construction: one in Freeport, Tex., which Cheniere partly owns, and a second here in Sabine Pass, which it owns outright.When completed, 6 huge storage tanks, 24 vaporizer modules and docking operations big enough to handle 400 cargo ships a year will help the Sabine Pass terminal process more gas than any existing terminal in the United States.That could amount to four billion cubic feet of gas a day — or more than 5 percent of what Americans now consume. The company has not made any money yet, but its stock price soared from less than $1 a share when Mr. Souki started his liquefied natural gas strategy at the beginning of the decade to more than $40 this spring, including a split. The stock has been dropping lately, though, and hit a 52-week low yesterday. It closed at $25.59, a decline of $2.30, or 8.25 percent.Cheniere hopes to build two more terminals along the gulf to gain more fees from big companies but also to sell spot cargo and short-term contracts for higher profit. Those terminals may be in doubt or at least delayed because suddenly and quite unexpectedly there may be too many terminals coming online to meet demand for imported gas in the next few years.Ever since natural gas prices spiked from 2001 to 2005, Cheniere has been joined by many others in the buildup. Even as prices of natural gas futures have fallen this summer to four-year lows, companies are spending up to $9 billion on building new terminals or upgrading old ones, with the nexus of activity decidedly along Texas and Louisiana shores.More than a dozen new liquefied natural gas terminal projects have been approved by the federal government in the last four years, all but one in the gulf region. Within a few years, there could be six terminals within 30 miles of the Sabine River alone.“The gulf is where the United States consumes 25 percent of its natural gas,” Mr. Souki said in an interview in his undecorated Houston office where charts of monthly world natural gas trends are taped on the wall. “The gulf is also the only coastal area that is connected by pipeline to the Midwest.”Liquefied natural gas represents only a 3 percent share of total American natural gas consumption, which is mostly used for industrial purposes and home heating. Cambridge Energy Research Associates estimates that imported liquefied natural gas will account for 10 percent of American use by 2010, and potentially as much as 25 percent by 2020.The steps to import liquefied natural gas into the United States are taking off at a time when some big multinational oil companies have shrinking reserves of oil but rising reserves of gas around the world. Such companies often want the gas to fuel their own petrochemical plants and refineries — many in the gulf region.“L.N.G. is going to have a growing importance,” predicted Donald E. Felsinger, chairman of Sempra Energy, another early embracer of liquefied natural gas. “The gas that we find here in North America is getting more and more expensive to produce. And because there is so much stranded gas around the world, L.N.G. can be shipped here and compete very effectively with traditional supplies.”Sempra has millions of electricity customers in California. But because of local resistance, Mr. Felsinger said, “we thought we could never in a reasonable time frame get a facility sited along California’s coast.” So Sempra has looked to Louisiana and Texas for sites for new terminals, areas where an extensive natural gas infrastructure already exists to process and ship gas from wells offshore. It is also building a terminal in Baja California, Mexico.But while most experts agree that importing natural gas satisfies a growing demand for cleaner energy sources, some are skeptical about how wise it is to put one more major component of the country’s energy grid around the stormy waters of the gulf.“The concern is for the potential for supply interruptions,” said Robert Ineson, director for North American natural gas at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, noting that a major storm like Hurricane Katrina or Rita could move a seabed or sink a ship that would block the way into a liquefied natural gas terminal.The terminals themselves are highly durable and most pipelines onshore are underground, he said, but the control operations above ground are vulnerable when storms hit. Moreover, skilled workers would have to navigate washed-out roads and other obstacles to reach damaged areas and make repairs.Industry insiders largely dismiss the threat, noting that Hurricane Rita last year directly hit an existing liquefied natural gas terminal in Lake Charles, La., which was largely unscathed. They say the growing number of terminals in the coming years will increase storage supplies to help minimize disruptions.There are few alternatives to building in the gulf. Several sites on the East and West Coasts are on energy company wish lists. But a variety of groups and coalitions opposed to liquefied natural gas have formed to stop them.Opponents argue that liquefied natural gas terminals are prone to accident or terrorist attack, they produce air pollution, they damage ocean ecosystems and they harm indigenous peoples in countries that pump the gas in the first place.Defenders dismiss the arguments as narrow-minded. “Nimby people have made their choice,” said Byron S. Wright, vice president for corporate development at the El Paso Corporation, using the acronym for “Not in my backyard.” “But the people on the Gulf Coast view energy infrastructure differently.”Indeed, for Carrol Trahan, 61, the owner of the Bayou Convenience Store in nearby Johnson Bayou, the fact that six liquefied natural gas docking terminals are being constructed or are on the drawing boards near his home is no big deal.“People around here are used to the energy business and we need the jobs, the tax base,” he said at his roadside store that stocks Cajun pickled quail eggs, Confederate flag necklaces and refrigerator magnets displaying “the Louisiana state bird” — the mosquito.“When you can be wiped out at any time by a storm,” he sighed, “you can only live worrying so much.”There is hardly a dissenting word in this coastal region of trailer parks, mangled sheds from last year’s hurricanes and lonely roads built on top of canals that separate one swamp from another and gas rigs from streams full of crabs.When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission held a public hearing in September 2004, a hundred people showed up. They voted unanimously in favor of the Sabine Pass, La., terminal.Only one man, a charter fishing captain named Jerry Norris, stood up to express a few words of skepticism and worry that dredging for the Cheniere project would disturb the local fishery. Concerned about any opposition, Cheniere employees went on his charter boat with him to address his concerns. Now he is a fan.“People around here are grounded in the refinery business,” Mr. Norris said. “We’re not going to stop what we’re doing because of terrorists around here. That’s just not going to happen.”Liquefied natural gas executives say their terminals are as safe or safer than other energy plants. They explain that natural gas in liquid form is not particularly explosive or flammable.But even in the gulf region, liquefied natural gas is not a business free of risk. The biggest fear is the chance that natural gas prices could collapse from excess supplies.Within the industry, some also worry that too many liquefied natural gas terminals will be built, cutting into operating profits.“There’s not going to be enough gas imported into this country to fill them all up,” Mr. Wright, the El Paso vice president, warned.Mr. Souki, though, has exactly the opposite concern. “At the moment we are setting ourselves up for a very nasty surprise,” he said. “I don’t know if it will happen in a year or two or five, but one winter we are not going to have enough gas.”'"
"'06-10-04,'1','BRUSSELS, Oct. 3 — European officials investigating the chip maker Intel have presented what they say they believe is a watertight argument for pursuing antitrust charges to an internal panel of so-called devil’s advocates, a person briefed on the investigation said late Tuesday.The move by antitrust officials is seen as an indication that the case is strong enough to proceed.The panel was recently introduced into the review process to prevent poorly prepared antitrust cases from becoming formal legal proceedings.The European Commission has been investigating Intel for five years.With about an 80 percent share of the global computer chip market, Intel dwarfs its nearest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, which accounts for most of the remaining chip sales.Officials from Intel and the European Commission were not immediately available to comment.A.M.D.’s executive vice president for legal affairs, Thomas M. McCoy, said recently in an interview that he was confident the European Commission would move to stop Intel from abusing its dominance in the market.“The Intel investigation is coming to a close,” he said, adding that he was confident it would result in Neelie Kroes, the European competition commissioner, issuing a charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, to the company.'"
"'06-10-04,'1','Mr. Howards said he then went on his way. About 10 minutes later, he said, he was walking back through the area when Agent Reichle handcuffed him and said he would be charged with assaulting the vice president. Local police officers, acting on information from the Secret Service, according to the suit, ultimately filed misdemeanor harassment charges that could have resulted in up to a year in jail.A June 16 article in The Vail Daily quoted a spokesman for the Secret Service, Eric Zahren, as saying that Mr. Howards “wasn’t acting like other folks in the area,” and that he became “argumentative and combative” when agents tried to question him. Mr. Howards said Tuesday that he was never threatening and did not become upset until his arrest.“This was not about anything I did — this is about what I said,” he said.Mr. Zahren declined to comment on the suit or on his original description of the event.Mr. Howards said he was released on $500 bond after about three hours in jail. A state judge dismissed the charge about three weeks later at the request of the Eagle County district attorney, Mark Hurlbert.“It was our understanding that the vice president did not want to prosecute,” Mr. Hurlbert said in a telephone interview. “The original indication was that he had pushed the vice president. Later it looked to be that he had just spoken to him.”Mr. Hurlbert said the initial information on the incident came from the Secret Service agents at Beaver Creek. A later communication from Mr. Cheney’s office or the Secret Service — Mr. Hurlbert said he did not remember which — said the government wanted to drop the matter.The suit joins two others — in West Virginia and another in Denver — charging that Secret Service agents or White House staff members violated the law in keeping people with opposing political views away from President Bush or Mr. Cheney.In the other Colorado suit, two people said they were ejected from a taxpayer-financed appearance by Mr. Bush in Denver in March 2005 because of an antiwar bumper sticker. The case is awaiting a ruling from the judge on a motion by the government to dismiss the case.In the West Virginia case, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of Jeff and Nicole Rank, who said they were arrested on July 4, 2004, at an appearance by Mr. Bush in Charleston. The Ranks had proper tickets but were wearing anti-Bush T-shirts, the suit says. The government has an Oct. 10 deadline to respond to the suit, said Chris Hansen, a senior staff counsel at the A.C.L.U. in New York.Mr. Howards said that he had had no intent to test the limits of free speech when he approached Mr. Cheney, but that the government’s actions in the aftermath only deepened his convictions and opposition.“This administration has a history of intimidating folks,” he said.'"
"'06-10-04,'1','McALLEN, Tex., Oct. 3 (AP) — The company that operated a bus that exploded and killed 23 people outside of Dallas during the Hurricane Rita evacuation was convicted Tuesday on charges of conspiring to falsify logs and two other safety violations.James Maples, the owner of the company, Global Limo Inc., was found not guilty of conspiracy but convicted of poorly maintaining his fleet and not requiring drivers to fill out vehicle inspection reports. Global Limo was convicted on those charges.None of the charges were directly related to the bus explosion, which was only vaguely mentioned in testimony. Judge Ricardo Hinojosa of Federal District Court prohibited prosecutors from mentioning the accident, saying it fell outside the scope of the charges and would prejudice the jury.Global Limo faces a $500,000 fine on the conspiracy count and a $200,000 fine on each of the two other convictions. Mr. Maples faces up to a year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine on each of his two convictions. Sentencing is set for Dec. 14.The trial stemmed from a federal investigation into the Global Limo bus that exploded and burned while stuck in traffic on Sept. 23, 2005, killing 23 elderly patients too frail to escape. The patients’ oxygen tanks exploded as the flames engulfed the bus.The trial was held in McAllen, in the Rio Grande Valley, near Global Limo’s headquarters.Victims and relatives of victims reached an $11 million settlement in May with Global Limo and BusBank, the travel broker that hired it.'"
"'06-10-04,'1','SHANGHAI, Oct. 3 — A group of foreign academics, lawyers and human rights activists sent a open letter to President Hu Jintao on Tuesday urging him to “reverse a worsening crackdown on voices of dissent” in China.The petition letter, organized by Human Rights Watch, called on Mr. Hu to take steps to enforce China’s public commitment to the rule of law and rein in officials who pursue retaliatory policies against lawyers, journalists and rights advocates.“We note with concern the sharp increase in official retaliation against such advocates and their families through persistent harassment, banishment, detention, arrest and imprisonment,” the letter said. “We note, too, the frequent use of state secrets charges to discourage social activism.”The joint letter by an array of prominent China watchers signaled an unusual level of concern about a sharp deterioration in political freedoms under Mr. Hu.The letter was also signed by Richard Goldstone, the former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.'"
"'06-10-04,'1','“Through this law, we will establish additional protections for communities across New York State,” Mr. Pataki said in a statement released by his office. “These new restrictions help to clarify the rights of a community and its residents and will uphold their interests with regard to certain projects involving eminent domain.”Jonathan Pierce, a spokesman for the project, declined to comment on the new law. In a statement, the company called the proposed transmission line “a beneficial project for all the people of New York State” and urged New Yorkers to “further study N.Y.R.I. and learn the truth about the many positives this project will bring.”The company estimates that the project would save consumers more than $500 million a year, although it concedes that decreases in downstate electricity prices would be accompanied by energy price increases upstate.Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement that he was disappointed that the governor had signed the legislation because it undermined the normal review process. He said it would also send a signal to energy investors that “local opposition could be used to stop a potentially beneficial project even before it has an opportunity to be considered on the merits.”The measure signed by Mr. Pataki prohibits private transmission companies from using eminent domain to condemn land. But the criteria in the law are so specific that they appear to apply only to the N.Y.R.I. project.Paul D. Tonko, an upstate Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly’s Standing Committee on Energy, said the new law would open the door to a legal challenge because it singled out one company. Mr. Tonko, who does not have a position on the project, also criticized the governor for signing the measure after pushing for energy deregulation.“He decided to deregulate and privatize the model and now, as soon as we go down that road, he has taken us on a 180-degree turn,” Mr. Tonko said.Since the transmission line project was announced earlier this year, several public officials throughout the state have opposed it, claiming that building hundreds of large metal towers would lower property values and harm the tourism and fishing industries on which many small, rural communities rely.The project drew criticism in many towns of the Delaware Valley because both proposed routes touched on or passed through the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River corridor, a picturesque 73-mile stretch of the Delaware River that is home to nesting bald eagles.In the state’s rural upstate region, local officials banded together to oppose the project, enlisting the help of several state legislators including Senators John Bonacic of Mount Hope, who sponsored the eminent domain bill, and Raymond A. Meier of Utica, one of several co-sponsors.In a break with legislative custom, Mr. Pataki did not sign the bill in the sponsor’s district, but traveled to Utica, where Mr. Meier, a Republican, is in a tight race for Congress.Peter Constantakes, a Pataki spokesman, said yesterday that the governor did not oppose large energy projects but he wanted to ensure that they were sufficiently well planned before being presented to the State Public Service Commission, which is reviewing the company’s application.But because of a new federal law, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a rejection by the commission would not necessarily halt the project. Under that law, federal authorities have authority to overturn local decisions if the proposed projects are considered essential to national energy policy.Mr. Pataki’s staff believes that the new state law prohibiting the use of eminent domain would be trumped by the federal law, although any federal action could be subject to a legal challenge.'"

"'06-10-04,'1','In many ways, their past on Wall Street and their presence in the State House provides a window into how Mr. Corzine makes important decisions and what he prizes most in governing. The three are investment bankers by training, as opposed to their boss’s roots as a bond trader, but they share his belief in the primacy of numbers, data analysis and long-term planning. They appear to be detail-oriented managers focused mostly on policy, not politics, and are accustomed to quick action.At first, their status as outsiders, coupled with their Ivy League pedigrees, sowed resentment among some officials here.“Some people were given the impression that these were city slickers and everyone else was a country bumpkin, so they had this attitude of, ‘Who are these people coming in from Wall Street thinking they know everything?’ ” said one senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. “It was certainly prevalent in the early days of the administration, but I think it’s subsiding.”In fact, they have worked hard to try to acclimate themselves to New Jersey’s unusual political culture.“I think they’re going through the same thing that I went through four years ago,” said Andrew M. Alper, a former Goldman Sachs partner who was chosen in 2002 by another businessman-turned-politician, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, to be president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. “In the private sector, A to B is more of a straight line, and people are motivated by economics, or economic rationale. In politics, people can often block something because they want something else, and that’s the kind of three-dimensional chess that takes a while to get used to.”Goldman Sachs has long been a training ground for top executives before they go into public service after attaining financial security, often to the highest ranks: Robert E. Rubin, treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton; John C. Whitehead, the former chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation; Stephen Friedman, the former director of the National Economic Council; and Joshua B. Bolten, President Bush’s current chief of staff, all worked at Goldman first.The Corzine crew, until this year, mainly expressed their political preferences with their checkbooks, donating a combined $250,000 to political candidates since 2002, mostly to Democrats in other states. Mr. Zubrow has been especially active in New Jersey, giving more than $56,000 to Democratic candidates or organizations since 2001.When their former colleague articulated what he hoped would be a fiscally responsible and socially progressive agenda as governor of New Jersey, Mr. Zubrow (who had been the firm’s chief administrative officer), Mr. Rose (who had worked on some of the firm’s biggest accounts, like Ford and United Technologies) and Mr. Abelow (who for a time was in Hong Kong for the firm and then headed its operations division) — all multimillionaires — agreed to come out of retirement to work for Mr. Corzine.Mr. Abelow, 48, is the state treasurer, and is responsible for collecting taxes, budgeting and spending money and issuing debt. Mr. Rose, 61, directs the Office of Economic Growth, which was created by Mr. Corzine to oversee economic development. Mr. Zubrow, 53, is chairman of the Schools Construction Corporation, which is responsible for building court-ordered schools, primarily in the poorest districts. A fourth Goldman émigré, Nancy B. Feldman, 46, who did not know Mr. Corzine while at the firm, is director of the Office of Public Finance.“We’re all here because of what the governor is trying to do,” Mr. Zubrow, a New Vernon resident, said during an interview this summer in Mr. Abelow’s office with all four Goldman colleagues. “Not only do we have great confidence in his ability to be successful, at this very special point in time in New Jersey’s history, we’re really at a point of reflection where the state can dramatically change.”In the interview, they echoed what Mr. Corzine has long said about an approach that may seem more mundane than magical: gather all the facts, solicit opinion and ideas and arrive at a consensus.“We are not so smart as to think we know all the right answers to all the questions,” said Mr. Abelow, who moved from the Upper West Side to Montclair this summer because of residency requirements for cabinet officials.Whether they succeed, they said, depends on the quality of the information they receive, as well as having enough time.“One thing about running Goldman Sachs is that most areas are working fairly successfully,” said Noreen Harrington, who used to run Goldman’s global hedge fund business and is now a managing partner of another firm, Alternative Institutional Partners. “But there are a lot of things that are broken in New Jersey, and that’s a tougher task.”Legislators and lobbyists here say the former Goldman people are less partisan than typical appointees, and they often use words like “refreshing” and “open-minded” to describe them. State Senator William L. Gormley, a Republican from Atlantic County, said dealing with them on the budget and on the economic growth plan was akin to watching people prepare a business prospectus rather than a political document.“They’re not like an insecure politician who’s failed at another career,” Mr. Gormley said. “They’re long-term thinkers, and they’re not driven by that week’s press release — that’s just not their style. It might be boring, but it’s substantive.”Others have a more qualified view.Senate President Richard J. Codey, for instance, said he was a bit wary of Mr. Rose, the head of the Office of Economic Growth, who has taken on issues from negotiating a new stadium deal with the Jets and Giants to the fate of the troubled entertainment complex rising in the Meadowlands and the failed utilities merger between Public Service Enterprise Group and Exelon Corporation. Mr. Rose’s responsibilities expanded even more last week, when Mr. Corzine signed an executive order requiring New Jersey’s quasi-independent authorities to submit their capital plans to Mr. Rose’s office.“He has a portfolio of everything, he can go wherever he wants, he’s like the governor-in-waiting,” Mr. Codey said. “Nobody knows who he is, or where he gets his clout from, but he’s able to facilitate policy matters that are very significant without being elected or airing them in public, and that’s very powerful.”Labor unions remain skittish about the administration’s plan to shift about a quarter of the state’s $72 billion pension fund from the control of state employees to private money managers, especially in light of the recent collapse of the Amaranth Advisors, a hedge fund, which cost New Jersey $16 million. While labor officials say that they have found Mr. Abelow to be forthright and gentlemanly, they are troubled that Goldman Sachs is handling $450 million in alternative investments, which could include hedge funds, real estate and nontraded stocks known as private equities.“The fact that we’re dealing with all these Goldman people — there’s a certain discomfort level,” said Joseph A. Golowski, a retired state auditor who is a consultant to the Communications Workers of America. “It allows a shadow to be put in there.”For their part, the former Goldman officials say they have no intention of following the common practice of parlaying their positions into high-paying lobbying or government jobs after they leave the State House.“This is my shot at it, and I hope that I help to contribute to something that’s bigger than me,” said Mr. Rose, who, like Mr. Corzine, is accepting a token salary of $1 a year. “It’s not like I’m going to go out into the private sector, and make money off of this. I’m going to disappear.”'"
"'06-10-04,'1','There are aspects of the representative-page relationship that can unfortunately provide ample opportunities for sexual predators. Pedophiles often assume fatherly roles, reassuring pages living far from their parents. The subordinate position of pages also fulfills power fantasies for some pedophiles.What is at risk is something truly unique. Since the 1820’s, pages have been an official part of Congress, but there were probably pages even in the first Congress, in the 1790’s. For these young men and women, being a page is an experience that will resonate with them for the rest of their lives. (It is therefore particularly galling that, as in 1983, the misconduct of members often leads to calls to abolish the page service — removing the temptations rather than deterring the abuses.)As a 16-year-old page, I served such iconic figures as Barbara Jordan and heard addresses from leaders like Hubert Humphrey. I still remember the first time I had to hoist the flag on top of the House of Representatives, walking over a narrow plank of rotted wood that was probably 200 years old. I stood on top of the windy Capitol holding that flag and having my own “Titanic” moment: I felt as if there was no limit to this country or its promise. When I sat to catch my breath I noticed a spot near the door where pages had recorded their names for over a century. You could feel a connection that ran for generations, as if pages were part of the Capitol itself.Pages also serve as reminders to members of Congress of the idealism that first drove them to choose public service. In the hallways of the Capitol they seem like antidotes to the Abramoffs, the Cunninghams and the general stifling cynicism that has taken over government. That is why many of us are so angry with the failure, yet again, to protect our pages.The 1980’s scandals led to some important reforms on housing and schooling (including the creation of a page dormitory). These reforms, however, fell short of the needed changes.The most glaring problem is that the House Page Board, which supervises the pages, is made up mostly of members of Congress (the Senate Page Board is composed of only two Senate officials, with no members). The representatives on the board have built-in conflicts of interests in moving against members accused of harassment. Political and social alliances complicate the process and many members would prefer to remain in blissful ignorance when rumors arise. Indeed, some (including the House speaker, Dennis Hastert) are accused of having known about Mr. Foley’s inappropriate messages months ago but allowing the matter to be addressed only informally and without serious action.The solution is simple: the alumni of the page program need to protect their own ranks. Some of Washington’s most powerful figures in politics, media, business and the law are former pages. They are neither intimidated by members of Congress nor hesitant to drag a member to account. They are protective of pages and have the clout to match their concern.Congress should create a Congressional Page Board composed of former pages. This board would have the ability to report infractions directly to the respective Ethics Committees for each house, which would be required to investigate and act upon any complaint submitted by the board.One of the benefits of such a board is that former pages are likely to have a greater connection and rapport with current pages. Indeed, what is unusual about this case is that the page actually came forward — reports suggest that other pages had known of Mr. Foley’s conduct for years. They were wrong in not coming forward with the information. But that’s a difficult thing to do. It might have been easier if the voice on the other end of a telephone line was a former page.If members are truly outraged, they will help us protect pages from predators in their own ranks. Power and pedophilia are by no means inevitable allies, but it is ridiculous and reckless to ignore their historical relationship. As former pages, we are happy to leave the Foleys, Cranes and Studdses to Congress. But Congress should leave the welfare of the pages to us.'"
"'06-10-04,'1','Terrorists with roadside bombs have the world’s attention at the moment, but once upon a time a different breed of killer stalked the earth. It wasn’t so long ago, and for those who remember the strange death of the Bulgarian writer Georgi Ivanov Markov in 1978, tonight’s revisiting of the case on PBS’s “Secrets of the Dead” series will tickle some brain cells. For those new to the tale, the episode, titled “Umbrella Assassin,” will be even more compelling. It turns out that those James Bond movies were not fiction after all.Mr. Markov wrote novels and plays that displeased the hard-line Communist president of Bulgaria, Todor Zhivkov, and in 1969 he defected to the West, eventually ending up in England doing commentary for the BBC and Radio Free Europe. The Bulgarian Communist machine, it appears, had a long memory and a long reach to go with it: while waiting for a bus on a London bridge in September 1978, Mr. Markov felt a sting on his thigh. He guessed what had happened — he had been injected with a poison pellet — but had trouble convincing doctors that the illness he quickly developed was not a mere flu.“No one was taking him seriously,” Bernard Riley, a doctor who saw him, recalls on the program. “In fact, I remember the look in his eyes. He was desperate for someone to listen to him and believe him.”Within days Mr. Markov was dead, and a lethal umbrella was believed to be the cause. “Poison Brolly Riddle,” one newspaper headline read. No arrest was ever made.The details of the case are vividly recalled by numerous people involved, not just doctors and investigators, but Vladimir Kostov, another Bulgarian dissident who had been similarly attacked in Paris two weeks earlier but lived. The program analyzes the crime “CSI” style, and from Bulgarian and Soviet files picks out some likely culprits.It eventually runs out of cinematic material, resorting to images of a dripping needle and file folders far too often, but it’s fascinating nonetheless. And against today’s headlines, the tale feels like something from, well, a century ago.'"
"'06-10-04,'1','GREEN apple is what wine experts often taste in a good chardonnay. It is also a flavor that can bring out the best in a dry riesling, especially one that may not offer the rich complexity characteristic of the grape in Germany.About a year ago, to complement an array of Austrian rieslings, I added diced green apple to the broth for mussels steamed in wine. I turned to green apple again recently for a dish to go with rieslings, Australian this time, not Austrian. I felt that the grassy, tart-sweet fruit would elicit more balance from these somewhat one-dimensional wines.Here, the apple is put to subtler use, as a component in a stuffing for roasted poussins. Celery and sage ramped up the herbal qualities, while pancetta, which has a delicious affinity for sage, contributed a satisfying meatiness to enhance the lean birds. I used stalks of celery to line the roasting pan, creating a kind of rack to support the birds and keep them from sticking. The juices of the cooked celery then added flavor to the simple pan sauce that moistened the poussins.None of these elements overwhelmed the Australian rieslings. And the acidity and hints of tropical fruit in the best of them made them appealing enough to savor throughout dinner.Each poussin will provide a generous serving, ample for those with good appetites, further whetted by the wine. Considering the addition of the stuffing, some people may want to eat only a half, which is why I split the poussins before arranging them on a big platter, instead of putting whole poussins on individual plates. Splitting them also makes them easier for guests to manage.Add a bowl of buttered fresh green beans and another of potatoes, either roasted or mashed, and you have the makings of an old-fashioned Sunday dinner. It is one that could be shared by friends or family any night of the week, with a wine that is easy to drink.'"

"'06-10-05,'1','“We will have to agree on how much, how soon and how we distribute it among the member countries,” Mr. Daukoru said about a possible production cut.Mr. Daukoru’s comments signal that OPEC has decided to step in more forcefully to stop the decline in prices, which has begun to rankle some of the group’s members. If endorsed, this would be OPEC’s first production cut since 2004.“OPEC is touting its defensive strategy early on, when they have a chance to impact oil stocks before the winter starts,” said Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, an oil consultancy in Washington. “They are putting fear back into the market.”This afternoon, crude oil for November delivery rose 69 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $60.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after trading as high as $60.97 a barrel earlier in the day. Oil futures had dropped 25 percent since their highest close of $77 a barrel in mid-July, briefly falling below $58 a barrel yesterday.“One thing they are trying to accomplish is to give traders a reason to slow down the selling,” said Adam Sieminski, the chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank. “Prices would have kept sinking if OPEC didn’t step in.”A move by OPEC to curb oil production is certain to draw angry reactions in Washington, where falling oil and gasoline prices had been seen as a rare bit of good news for the Bush administration less than five weeks before the midterm elections. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said he would be in touch with OPEC representatives to drive that point home.“We still need oil for sure,” he told Reuters. “We still need all the oil we can get.”In recent weeks, the leading OPEC producers, including Saudi Arabia, had been discreetly reducing oil supplies to prevent prices from falling too steeply, in line with a new strategy not to publicize output cuts or clearly state what price OPEC intends to defend.Some analysts believe that OPEC producers have reduced their output by 380,000 barrels a day from August through September, with the bulk of the cuts coming from Saudi Arabia.But traders, investors and hedge funds have discounted these cuts, either failing to read the signs of OPEC’s intentions or simply not believing that OPEC had the capacity to prop up prices anymore.As a result, with bulging inventories and a much milder hurricane season than anticipated, oil prices have fallen. In addition, hedge funds have been shorting the market, betting oil prices will go down rather than up, reversing a bet that helped propel prices to their recent records.Mr. Diwan of PFC Energy said it was time for OPEC to make its intentions felt more clearly by the market.“I don’t think it’s surprising that Saudi Arabia accepted the strategy,” he said. “There is a strong need for revenue in the kingdom given the investment plan they have going. The hush-hush, very subtle strategy was too subtle for the hedge funds. OPEC needed to communicate their intentions more clearly to get their attention.”'"

"'06-10-05,'1','If bull markets make geniuses, uncertainty unmasks them. Volatile energy markets decimated Amaranth, and bad bond bets and administrative issues sideswiped Archeus. The turnaround in the stock market — the major indexes fell sharply in the late spring and have since climbed back — has also tripped up hedge fund giants as well as some big-name start-ups that have struggled to meet already-diminished investor expectations.Returns for many hedge funds, which are supposed to be the market beaters, have paled in comparison with stocks. Hedge Fund Research’s weighted composite index is up 7.23 percent through September, according to a preliminary estimate, compared with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, which, with dividends, has a total return of 12.4 percent over the same period.And yet investors have hardly blinked. Eager for the rich, if not always predictable, returns that hedge funds promise, they continue to pour money into them and hope the next fund with a big problem will not be one of theirs.“In the hedge fund world, everybody is looking at their portfolio and asking themselves: ‘Do I have another Amaranth in my portfolio?’ ” said Tim Cook, the president of Kailas Capital, an investor in hedge funds.The rise of hedge funds’ fame and fortune happened quickly. In 2000, the stock market began to slide, and almost overnight, a band of obscure money managers became the new millennium’s masters of the universe. Soon, huge buckets of money rained on these stars — $99 billion flooded into hedge funds in 2002, according to Hedge Fund Research. Since the beginning of 2001, nearly 7,000 hedge funds have been started.With eye-popping compensation — the top manager took home $1.5 billion last year — hedge-fund performance, and the pay derived from it, redefined everything from job prestige on Wall Street to the price for art and real estate.So while there has been nothing like a sweeping shakeout in the business or a market crisis like the near collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, some hedge funds, including some of the high-profile “safe” names, have failed to show any Midas-like magic.Many of the big-name debuts of 2004, 2005 and even 2006 have produced lackluster results. Eton Park, with $5.5 billion in assets, was up about 6 percent through mid- September and 7 percent through the end of the month. Several top executives have left, including its chief operating officer, Stu Hendel, who will return to Morgan Stanley, and Scott Prince, former head of derivatives and trading.TPG-Axon, which was started with $2 billion to $4 billion in 2005 by a Goldman Sachs star, Dinakar Singh, was up just 2.6 percent through August, although it rebounded to show a return of 5.6 percent through the end of September. Old Lane, begun by two former top Morgan Stanley executives, John P. Havens and Vikram S. Pandit, was down 1.7 percent through August, a person briefed on the results said.Big funds have also suffered, including Ritchie Capital and Vega, the Madrid hedge fund that in 2004 was the ninth-largest fund in the world, with $10.7 billion, according to Institutional Investor magazine. Vega Asset Management fell more than 11.5 percent for September, leaving it down 17.5 percent for the year so far.A Vega representative did not return calls for comment.A few activist funds, those that take pride in ridiculing poor corporate management, have also stumbled. Pirate Capital, a $1.7 billion fund, sent a letter to investors at the end of September explaining that half its investment team had quit. The fund is up 3 percent for the year.Not all managers are suffering. The Citadel Investment Group and Highbridge Capital, both of which had tough years in 2005, are shining: Citadel is up 4.7 percent for September and about 18 percent for the year. Highbridge is up 14 percent for the year. And SAC Capital, run by Steven A. Cohen, was up 18 percent though August.Hedge funds are Darwinian by nature: when returns are good, money flows in and when they are bad, investors scramble to get their money out as soon as possible.So the spigot of new money into hedge funds has run hot and cold. After tapering off in 2005, with $46.9 billion flowing in, there has been a revival this year, with more than $66 billion poured into hedge funds in the first half of 2006 alone. That flood of money is not likely to end even amid the recent stumbles by hedge funds.“The pace has not changed. It is still fast,"" said Amy Hirsch, chief executive of Paradigm Consulting Services. ""You might see a slight pause as they evaluate what happened. The question is not, Should we invest in hedge funds? but, In what manner should we invest in hedge funds?""Pension funds, seeking to make up for years of being underfunded, have increasingly turned to hedge funds. Many funds that cater to such institutions boast they can deliver consistent medium-range returns — 8 to 12 percent — that permit institutions to better manage their liabilities.And endowments, which were among the earliest adopters of hedge fund investing, do not appear to be backing away. Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., with a $240 million endowment, has almost 30 percent of its assets in hedge funds. For the fiscal year ended June 30, the endowment at Scripps was up 17.7 percent.“Hedge funds were a big contributor to that,” said Patricia S. Callan, former chairwoman of the investment committee at Scripps and a member of the investment committee at the Huntington Library in San Marino. Calif. She said neither Scripps nor Huntington, which has a $200 million endowment, will change its allocation to hedge funds.Yet Ms. Callan acknowledged that blow-ups like the one at Amaranth might lead investment committee members to give greater scrutiny to hedge funds.""Situations like this make people read documents much more closely,"" she said.Indeed, the changes that are likely to come in the wake of Amaranth will be in the form of increased vigilance by investors. Managers of funds of funds and consultants say investors may now temporarily delay their investments in hedge funds as they try to negotiate better terms to redeem their funds in the case of a crisis. And there may be calls from investors for greater disclosure, especially regarding how the funds are using leverage and derivatives.In the case of Archeus, its marketing pitch, like that of most hedge funds, was its grasp of some of Wall Street’s more abstruse trading strategies. In one of its first letters in 2003, Mr. Kilberg and his partner claimed profits from engaging in European rate skew trading, macro-oriented curve reshaping transactions and zero-coupon principal curve arbitrage.To all but the most sophisticated trader, this is eye-glazing jargon. Which, as the hedge fund boom took form in 2001 and 2002, was precisely the point. Mr. Kilberg and other stars from Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley were able to present themselves as trading savants who could marry the technical expertise of the investment bank’s proprietary trading desk with their own reserves of entrepreneurial energy.But as the Archeus case shows, a fund’s fortunes can change ever so quickly once the market turns. It shows, too, that beyond the flashy public implosions, many funds are struggling to survive, just a few years after successful starts.For Mr. Kilberg and his former Salomon traders, 2005 started out well as assets peaked at $3 billion. But within months, the fund began to suffer sharp losses as its main trading strategy, taking positions in bonds with an underlying portfolio of debt or derivatives, fell out of favor. Suddenly, investors were taking their money out and criticizing Mr. Kilberg for not taking on more risk. Hedge funds like Amaranth, with its focus on hot markets like natural gas, became in vogue, and Archeus’s assets plunged. Compounding its problems was a failure of the fund’s administrator to keep proper records, leading to more redemptions.Archeus is paring down. It has closed its London office, laid off workers and refocused its investment strategy. So far, results are less than promising. The fund was up only 1 percent in September. Now the founding partners are asking investors for a second chance.""We have learned a great deal from the various circumstances, events and issues we have encountered and, admittedly, some of the mistakes we have made,"" they wrote in a letter to investors.What remains to be seen is whether investors, chastened by the events of the last month, will give them one.'"
"'06-10-05,'1','By doing so, it joined more than 100 companies that have announced investigations into their options practices.At the time, Apple said it was examining a grant made to Mr. Jobs that may have been improper. Mr. Dowling would not discuss the specifics of that grant on Wednesday.Apple also announced that Fred D. Anderson, an Apple director who was chief financial officer from 1996 to 2004, the period when the questionable grants were made, had resigned from the board, and said he had told the company that “he believes it is in Apple’s best interests” that he leave.Mr. Anderson is now managing director of Elevation Partners, a high-profile private equity company he helped found after leaving Apple.Roger McNamee, Elevation’s chief executive, said in an e-mailed statement that he had confidence in Mr. Anderson, whom he considered to have “uncompromising character,” and that he would remain part of the company.Apple’s statement said the financial investigation “raised serious concerns” about the activities of two other former Apple officers, but did not name them. The company said it would share details with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Apple said the investigation found no misconduct by anyone on the company’s current management team. Mr. Dowling said the company was not required to discuss Mr. Jobs’s role in the options grants, but was doing so in the interest of full disclosure. He said Mr. Jobs was not available for an interview.Apple shares fell 66 cents, or 0.9 percent, in after-hours trading, after rising $1.30 in regular trading to close at $75.38.Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Needham & Company, said that investors were likely to respond favorably in the long term, and that he did not expect Apple’s restatement of earnings to be significant or to hurt its future performance.“The major risk in the backdating of options was that somehow Steve Jobs was actively involved,” Mr. Wolf said. “The announcement today eliminated that possibility.”Mr. Wolf said it was within reason that Mr. Jobs would not have paid attention to the backdating, particularly given that it was common and legal. “I don’t think he’d know an asset from a liability,” Mr. Wolf said of Mr. Jobs. “That’s not his game.”One unusually large grant to Mr. Jobs had been under scrutiny. Apple disclosed on Jan. 19, 2000, that he had received options to buy 10 million shares, effective Jan. 12. Those options carried a strike price of $87.19, the stock’s lowest closing price in the two months up to that date; by Jan. 19, the stock had risen to $106.56.The options later became worthless as Apple’s stock price declined. Mr. Jobs canceled most of his options in 2003 and was given restricted stock instead.A week after Apple disclosed its investigation, two shareholder lawsuits filed in California charged current and former Apple executives and directors with manipulating stock grants. Those suits are still pending.Apple said on Wednesday that stock option grants made on 15 dates between 1997 and 2002 appeared to have grant dates that preceded the approval of those grants. The company said the last one came in January 2002. Mr. Dowling said that the 15 dates represented 6 percent of all stock grants during the period.At the time of the options grants, it was not uncommon for companies to disclose stock option awards days or weeks after a grant was made. But the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which addresses corporate accountability, now requires companies to report option grants within two days.Apple reported the findings after a special committee of outside directors, lawyers and accountants completed a three-month investigation, examining more than 650,000 documents.'"
"'06-10-05,'1','All the victims had a virulent strain of E. coli bacteria, O157:H7.With the focus of the investigation narrowing to spinach grown in the Salinas Valley, the agency told consumers last week that they could again eat fresh spinach.Eleven bags of fresh spinach have tested positive for E. coli O157:H7, the agency reported yesterday. The United States attorney for the Northern District of California, Kevin V. Ryan, said investigators had no evidence that the contamination was deliberate or that it continued.“We are investigating allegations that certain spinach growers and distributors may not have taken all necessary or appropriate steps to ensure that their spinach was safe before it was placed into interstate commerce,” Mr. Ryan said.Investigators have also visited Primus Labs of Santa Maria, Calif., which performs routine testing for E. coli among growers, Juan Muniz, Primus operations manager, said.Mr. Muniz refused to discuss the specifics of the inquiry but said one challenge is the lack of definitive rules on what is an unacceptable E. coli level.“I can eat something where my immune system is not affected, but my son or my father — one or two colonies could affect them,” Mr. Muniz said.Growers usually ask Primus to test for general E. coli levels, Mr. Muniz said. If the results are a problem, growers may ask for follow-up tests that look specifically at O157:H7, Mr. Muniz said. But there is no definitive guideline for the level of general E. coli that would initiate the second test, he added.Farm practices are governed by a voluntary code of good practices that tells growers to “maximize their efforts to minimize contamination,” Mr. Muniz said.“What does that mean?” he added. “It’s complicated.”On Tuesday, a top California food safety official announced that eight fecal samples from cattle pastures near the affected spinach fields had tested positive for O157:H7.“This is not really an unexpected finding,” the official, Kevin Reilly of the Health Services Department, said. “We do know that E. coli O157:H7 can be found in healthy cattle, and that it is something that if we look, we are able to find it. The real thing here is to see if the strain type matches up with the outbreak strain.”Five companies have voluntarily recalled their spinach products since the outbreak was reported nearly three weeks ago. Natural Selection was first, recalling on Sept. 15 all products containing spinach. The company processes and packages spinach for more than 20 brands, including Dole, Nature’s Basket, Trader Joe’s, Ready Pac and Riverside Farms.Another company in Salinas, River Ranch, followed two days later, having obtained some of its spinach from Natural Selection. In the next week, companies in Portland, Ore.; Seattle; and West Caldwell, N.J., recalled spinach products.Some grocery chains began re-stocking fresh spinach last week, taking pains to show that the spinach was grown in places like Colorado and Canada. In the last 11 years, 20 E. coli outbreaks have been linked to “leafy products” grown in the region, including two related to spinach, Dr. Reilly said.'"
"'06-10-05,'1','Kevin Mansell, the president of Kohl’s, said the changes were a response to interviews with customers who said, in short: “You are easy to shop, but not exciting.”The physical changes to the store mirror a transformation under way in Kohl’s clothing aisles, which look increasingly contemporary. The same focus group interviews that revealed that Kohl’s stores needed to feel more intimate revealed that shoppers could not find enough fashionable clothing.So the chain’s once-steadfast focus on the classic, traditional consumer — who had a family and bought snowflake mock turtleneck sweaters and plaid button-down shirts — has expanded to include clothing like white fur vests from Daisy Fuentes, a brand exclusive to Kohl’s.In a coup, Kohl’s wooed the designer Vera Wang — a name associated more with Sak’s and Bloomingdale’s than discount retailers — to design a line of contemporary clothing, handbags, shoes and home goods. The products will reach stores in autumn 2007.The company has said it will make women without children, who typically have more disposable income and crave more fashionable merchandise than the average Kohl’s shopper, a priority in its merchandise and marketing.Kohl’s is not under pressure from Wall Street to make the changes. The company’s financial picture is the envy of the retailing industry, analysts said. Revenue is up, to $13.4 billion last year, from $6.2 billion in 2000, during which time profits rose to $842 million, from $372 million. Shares of Kohl’s rose $1.61, to $69.14 on Wednesday.And on Thursday, when the nation’s retailers report September sales for stores open at least a year, a closely watched industry measure, Kohl’s is expected to report a 16 percent increase, above the industry average, which is in the single digits.Kohl’s executives said they were motivated in part by the changes at rival stores, which have undergone a series of mergers and consolidations recently. They said they thought that the changes had bewildered consumers with new names.In particular, the elimination of May stores like Marshall Field’s in Chicago and Filene’s in Boston, which have been renamed Macy’s, has created a chance for Kohl’s to win over middle-income consumers who rang up what Kohl’s says is estimated sales of $40 million per May store annually.R. Lawrence Montgomery, the chief executive of Kohl’s, said “the customer is confused by the name changes. What is I.N.C.?,” referring to a private-label brand at Macy’s. “If you have not been in a Macy’s store, you have no idea.”Myron E. Ullman, the chief executive of J. C. Penney, a Kohl’s rival, has spoken frequently about successfully snatching former May Department Store shoppers who have not switched to the more upscale Macy’s brand.Kohl’s has also set its sights on specialty stores at the mall. “Gap has certainly given up some market share,” said Mr. Mansell, referring to a decline in Gap’s individual store sales.Unlike J. C. Penney, which has developed one of the retail industry’s biggest in-store clothing brand businesses, Kohl’s is focused on exclusive national brands to ensure its products cannot be found at rival clothing stores.Kohl’s, which has 817 stores, has struck a deal with the clothing supplier Liz Claiborne to introduce a less expensive version of Claiborne’s popular youth clothing brand Lucky, which Kohl’s calls Stamp 10. And it will design cookware with the Food Network under terms of a deal announced last week.By the end of the year, executives said, exclusive national brands will represent 8 percent of the chain’s sales, and perhaps 10 percent in 2007, up from nearly zero several years ago.For consumers, however, the most noticeable changes at Kohl’s are likely to be to the stores themselves. At the newly designed stores like the one near Tampa — one of 65 to open Thursday — the appearance from the street has changed from a fortress-looking beige and brown exterior to a modern facade combining a 16-foot glass entrance with a three-tone stucco.At both of the store’s entrances, music is played under an exterior canopy to set the mood before shoppers enter. And inside, the clothes are grouped more clearly by style — with mannequins outfitted with various products from brands like Daisy Fuentes and the classic Chaps by Polo Ralph Lauren, and large, floor-to-ceiling photos that capture each brand’s identity.Small embellishments abound. In one Ikea-inspired display, several kitchen chairs with colorful cushions are suspended high in the air. Inside the restrooms of the store in Brandon, glass vases contained orchids and bamboo stalks.Mr. Montgomery, the chief executive, said the touches make the store “more feminine. Before, we had a pretty masculine store, to be frank.”How important the more modern, feminine shopping experience will be to Kohl’s consumers, who appear to be largely motivated by the 30-, 40- and 50-percent-off sales signs that pepper the store, remains unclear.'"

The population officially hit another peak after the Census Bureau revised its most recent count and added 49,100 New Yorkers — or about as many people as yesterday’s crowd at Shea Stadium.Responding to a challenge from city officials, the bureau estimated the population as of July 1, 2005, at 8,213,839, an increase of nearly 1 percent over the figure a year earlier and another record high. Last spring, the bureau estimated the midyear 2005 population at 8,143,200, which would have represented a 21,000-person decline from the year before.The new numbers mean that the city found 70,600 people whom the census had apparently missed.Joseph J. Salvo, director of the Department of City Planning’s population division, said he expected the 2006 estimate to reflect continued growth, either when it is released next spring or after the city challenges it.City officials won their challenge this time by marshaling evidence that the housing boom has not abated, reasoning that if more homes and apartments were being built, someone must be moving into them.The officials said 6,631 conversions of housing units from commercial to residential, two-thirds of them in Lower Manhattan, plus an increase in new construction led to a 4.5 percent increase in Manhattan’s population since 2000, or 69,100 residents.Last year alone, the city granted permits for 18,157 completed homes or apartments.“We have been tracking new construction this year,” Mr. Salvo said. “We keep waiting for it to peak, and it hasn’t.”'"
"'06-10-05,'1','SEATTLE, Oct. 4 (AP) — In its forthcoming Windows Vista product, Microsoft will take much harsher steps to curtail piracy than in previous versions of its operating system, including crippling the usefulness of computers found to be running unlicensed copies of the new software.Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, said Wednesday that people running a version of Windows Vista that it thought was pirated would initially be denied access to some Vista features. That includes Windows Aero, an improved graphics technology.If a legitimate copy is not purchased within 30 days, the system will curtail functionality much further by restricting users to just the Web browser for an hour at a time, said Thomas Lindeman, Microsoft senior product manager.In that situation, a person could use the browser to surf the Web, gain access to documents on the hard drive or log onto Web-based e-mail. But the user would not be able to open documents directly from the computer desktop or run other programs like Outlook e-mail software, Mr. Lindeman said.Microsoft said that it would not stop a computer running pirated Vista software from working completely and that it would continue to deliver critical security updates.The company said it had added more sophisticated technology for monitoring whether a system is pirated.'"
"'06-10-05,'1','WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 (AP) — Changing nearly 30 years of election policy, federal regulators said Wednesday that money used to pay for vote recounts and legal challenges was subject to campaign finance restrictions on contributions and expenditures.The 4-to-2 decision by the Federal Election Commission affects House and Senate candidates as well as state parties. It could be especially significant this year when both political parties are bracing for potential postelection challenges to results in tight Congressional races.“This is going to make them work a little harder to raise the money,” said Ellen L. Weintraub, a commissioner and a Democrat, who offered a compromise to break a 3-to-3 deadlock. “But it’s doable.”At issue was whether a 2002 campaign finance law that did away with unrestricted and unlimited giving to the political parties altered regulations adopted in 1977. The decision redefined those regulations.The commission’s chairman, Michael E. Toner, the commission chairman, and Hans von Spakovsky, a commissioner, both Republicans, voted against the compromise, saying that the campaign finance law applied only to the election, not recounts. Mr. Toner also objected to the timing of the change, noting that it came only five weeks before the Nov. 7 elections.'"
"'06-10-05,'1','Qwest Communications International said yesterday that its board had approved a two-year plan to repurchase up to $2 billion in shares as a gesture to investors who remained loyal during several difficult years.The repurchase plan represents about 12 percent of the company’s equity capitalization, the chief executive, Richard C. Notebaert, said. About 1.9 billion shares of common stock are outstanding.Qwest, a regional Bell company, has reported profits in two consecutive quarters after working its way out of an accounting scandal that required it to restate billions of dollars in results. Mr. Notebaert said previously that the board was considering a dividend, a share-buyback program or a combination of the two.The announcement was made after the close of regular stock market trading yesterday. Before the bell, shares of Qwest, based in Denver, closed up 16 cents, at $8.70.Qwest is the primary provider of telephone service in 14 states, mostly in the Midwest and the Great Plains.'"
"'06-10-05,'1','In East Harlem for example, where asthma rates are three times higher than in the rest of the city, Ascione Pharmacy charged $6.95 for a container of Albuterol, according to a price list the store provided to investigators. In the same ZIP code, a Duane Reade store charged $28.99, while other pharmacies nearby charged between $15 and $28.94.In Brooklyn, the price of 28 tablets of Ortho Tri-Cyclen, a one-month supply of birth control pills, ranged from $41 in Coney Island to $79 on Myrtle Avenue a few blocks north of Tompkins Park.In the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, some prices appeared to fluctuate with neighborhood income. The survey found that pharmacies in wealthier ZIP codes of the three boroughs often charged a middle range of prices, within a few dollars of each other, while prices at some pharmacies in lower-income areas were higher.In the wealthiest areas of the Bronx, no drug store surveyed charged more than $35.99 for 60 tablets of Metformin, the report said. Meanwhile in the poorest areas, one store — B & P Pharmacy on Southern Boulevard — charged $54.25 for the same prescription, and five other pharmacies charged $45 or more.When called for comment, a woman at B & P hung up. In a company statement, Duane Reade did not explain why prices at some of its stores vary, but claimed that publishing prices on a Web site would not help, since the comparisons might confuse the public and simply be inaccurate.Indeed, the survey mixed information from published price lists and telephone interviews. Prices can change weekly and in some cases it was not clear if the prices relied upon were correct.Yet the effects of high prices are not in dispute. Several studies have shown that rising costs prevent some patients from buying the medication they need. More than one in five New Yorkers failed to fill prescriptions last year primarily because they could not afford them, according to the Community Service Society, a social service agency that has been tracking the issue since 2002.Mr. Gioia and other members of the Council — including the speaker, Christine C. Quinn — stopped short of blaming individual stores or the pharmaceutical industry for the wide range in prices. Higher than average prices were found at both chain stories and independent pharmacies, and council members argued that customers’ lack of awareness about prices has allowed the problem to persist.“If people don’t know how much it should cost, or that they could be saving money, or they don’t have access to transportation, they are prisoners to whatever the pharmacy wants to charge,” Mr. Gioia said at a press conference on the City Hall steps.After the Council’s first report in 2004, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer started a Web site that tracks some drug prices, www.nyagrx.org. Ms. Quinn said the site was a good start, but was not comprehensive, lacking information on many of the city’s ZIP codes.She demanded that the state immediately comply with a 2005 law requiring the creation of a Web site with every pharmacy’s prices, searchable by ZIP code.“The bottom line of this report is that knowledge is power and that when consumers have knowledge, they are empowered,” Ms. Quinn said. “And that drives the market every single time.”Marc E. Carey, a Health Department spokesman, said the state was still trying ensure the privacy of people using the Web site. Without giving a specific date, he promised that the site would be up “sooner rather than later.”'"
"'06-10-05,'1','DETROIT, Oct. 4 — A driver’s risk of being killed in a side-impact crash decreases by more than a third if the vehicle has head-protecting side-curtain air bags, a study of accident data by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows.That type of air bag is particularly effective in sport utility vehicles, cutting the chances of a fatality by 52 percent, according to the study.“They can make the difference between life and death,” said Anne McCartt, the insurance institute’s vice president for research and an author of the study. “There’s very little else to protect an occupant in a side-impact crash.”In comparison, side air bags that protect a driver’s chest and abdomen, but not the head, reduced the risk of dying by about one-quarter for all vehicles and 30 percent for S.U.V.’s, the study found.Automakers have agreed to make side-curtain air bags standard equipment in all vehicles by 2010. For the 2006 model year, some type of side air bag is available on 79 percent of models. But in many cases, it is optional equipment that costs $300 to $700.Only one pickup truck in 2006, the Honda Ridgeline, included side air bags as standard.“Pickups have a ways to go,” Ms. McCartt said.'"
"'06-10-05,'1','The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine issued a plan today for how it would spend the $3 billion assigned by the state’s voters to finance stem cell research.Navigating between scientists who say that much basic research remains to be done and patients’ advocates who want the focus to be on new treatments, the institute says it will spend $823 million on basic stem cell research, $899 million on applied or preclinical research and $656 million on taking new treatments through clinical trials.A further $273 million is allocated for universities to construct “N.I.H-free” buildings, meaning laboratories in which none of the equipment has been bought with money from the National Institutes of Health. In this way, researchers can be sure of not violating the rules that restrict federal money to research using government-approved stem cell lines.The plans must be approved by the institute’s board and are subject to favorable resolution of the legal problems that have tied up the institute’s money. But court decisions so far have been going the institute’s way. In July, after President Bush’s veto of a bill to widen stem cell research, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger lent the institute $150 million from the state to begin awarding grants.The new plan does not earmark money for specific diseases. Patients’ advocates may also be disappointed at the long horizon held out for the promised cures.“It is unlikely that CIRM will be able to fully develop stem cell therapy for routine clinical use during the 10 years of the plan,” the institute warned.'"
"'06-10-05,'1','LONDON, Oct. 4 — The Irish Republican Army has all but ceased its terrorist operations and is no longer sponsoring criminal enterprises, the independent group monitoring the cease-fire in Northern Ireland said in a report on Wednesday.The report by the group, the Independent Monitoring Commission, potentially removes an obstacle to the eventual restoration of Northern Ireland’s legislature, which was suspended in 2003. The British and Irish governments, along with the province’s rival Roman Catholic and Protestant groups, are scheduled to hold talks in Scotland next week aimed at breaking the impasse.Until now, the Democratic Unionists, the largest Protestant party, led by the Rev. Ian Paisley, have refused to meet with Sinn Fein, the political arm of the I.R.A. and the province’s largest Catholic party. If the various groups are unable to reach an agreement by Nov. 24, the legislature and Northern Ireland’s brief experiment in self-government risk being disbanded indefinitely.Mr. Paisley responded to the report with customary caution. If the I.R.A. had improved — and he was not conceding that it had, exactly — it had done so only because of pressure from Protestant, or unionist, groups, which want to retain Britain’s control of Northern Ireland, he said.“The days of pushover unionists are gone, and Sinn Fein/I.R.A. know that they can no longer expect to be engaged in terrorist and criminal activity and be in government in Northern Ireland,” he said Wednesday.'"
"'06-10-05,'1','The feel-good environment she has created on her show — when combined with her soothing turns as host of the Emmy Awards ceremonies after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina — made her an ideal candidate to host the Oscars. She could prove the perfect tonic for an entertainment industry generally despondent over the year’s box-office returns, as well as the state of affairs in Washington and abroad. “She’s got the best laugh in show business,” Robin Williams, a periodic guest on Ms. DeGeneres’s show and an Academy Award-winner himself (for “Good Will Hunting”), said in a telephone interview. “I think she’s genuinely having a good time. If it felt fake, or put on, I think people would pick up on it.”“She picks stuff that’s silly and fun,” he added, citing appearances on her show in which she had him ride a bike onstage. “You feel like you’re with a really brilliant 12-year-old.”In that vein, on this season of “Ellen” (officially “The Ellen DeGeneres Show”), Ms. DeGeneres, 48, has been goading celebrity guests and audience members alike to write “life lists,” compilations of all those things they have always wanted to accomplish, but never have. In a running bit, she has been crossing off the entries on her own ledger, like learning Spanish, which she did — on camera and to comedic effect of course — at a nearby middle school.“I have a certain philosophy,” she said in an interview, this time sitting cross-legged on a comfy, olive couch in a bright office down the hall from her studio, “that if it feels good, that if I feel good doing it, then it will just feel good to watch.”At the least she has demonstrated that her show’s stock-in-trade routines — whether it’s dancing through the audience with the abandon of someone in her kitchen with the blinds drawn or showing slow-motion replays of her inadvertent falls — have fueled a mini cottage industry.During the last year or so, her representatives said, she has sold more than 10,000 pairs of boxer briefs with the name Ellen emblazoned on the waistband ($24.95) mostly through the show’s Web site, ellen.warnerbros.com. And, since being released in early September, the DVD of highlights from her first three seasons (titled “DVD-licious” and priced at $24.98) has been a top-seller at Target, where it is available exclusively through November.So far this season “Ellen” has drawn an average daily audience of about 2.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. During the last 12 months the show ranked among the top 15 daytime talk and game shows, below “The View,” but above “Martha.” While up by an average of nearly 350,000 viewers a day when compared with her first season, Ms. DeGeneres’s audience has fallen a bit since last season, at least partly because NBC stations in New York and Los Angeles are pitting her, for the first time, against the top-ranked “Oprah Winfrey Show.”Since NBC announced in 2004 that Conan O’Brien would succeed Jay Leno as host of “The Tonight Show” in 2009, Ms. DeGeneres’s name has occasionally been floated by industry executives as someone ABC might hire to develop her own late-night show.When asked about that possibility, Ms. DeGeneres, whose contract with Warner Brothers and Telepictures, which produces her daytime show, does not expire until 2010, did not rule out relocating to nighttime.“I’ll see what I feel like in three years and what the show is doing in three years,” she said.A moment later, though, she said: “There’s no reason for me to move to late night. It’s not like I would do anything differently than during the day. Most people think you could do more at night, get away with more, but I don’t really do that.”Perhaps the most obvious contrast to how Ms. DeGeneres conducts her daytime talk show can be found on ABC, where Rosie O’Donnell — a fellow stand-up comic whose Warner Brothers show preceded Ms. DeGeneres’s — has taken up residence this season on “The View.” On that show Ms. O’Donnell has been overtly political (her views are decidedly liberal), provocative and open about her relationship with her longtime partner, Kelli Carpenter O’Donnell.By contrast Ms. DeGeneres almost never discusses politics. “It’s not because I have these strong opinions that I hold back talking about,” she said. “I’m just not a political person.” She added, “I really am aware that no matter how strongly I feel about something, there’s someone else who feels just as strongly about the exact opposite.”Unlike Ms. O’Donnell, Ms. DeGeneres makes only rare references to her romantic life on her show — she shares a home with the actress Portia de Rossi — mindful that the way she came out as a lesbian (with a Time magazine cover featuring the headline “Yep, I’m Gay”) drew much criticism in some circles and concerned some station managers who now carry her show..“Maybe because I was penalized in a way when I came out, there are certain areas that I am aware would get me in trouble,” she said. “I talk about my life and I talk about Portia and it’s not a big deal if it comes up. But it really doesn’t come up.”In recent weeks, for example, Ms. DeGeneres omitted any reference to Ms. de Rossi from two stories she told during her monologue, one about a car accident (she was driving and Ms. de Rossi was a passenger) and another in which their French bulldog, Pig, who is prone to flatulence, devoured a bowl of Parmesan cheese. (Ms. de Rossi had been cooking pasta and inadvertently left the bowl within Pig’s reach.) That Ms. DeGeneres may be holding back a few details from her daily life does not seem to bother her show’s core audience, particularly those who began lining up as early as 5:30 a.m. with hopes of getting a good seat (and perhaps the chance to dance on camera with the host) on a recent day.“She’s like us, real people,” said Esther Perez, 47, a school cafeteria worker from San Diego whose husband left home at 3:45 a.m. to hold a spot in line for her. “And she’s very clean with her jokes.”“It’s that positivity,” said Nan Einarson, a life coach who had traveled to the show from Toronto as a 58th birthday present from her daughter. “Ellen’s always upbeat.”'"
"'06-10-05,'1','To the end of his life, Mr. Apple kept a small black bag packed with essentials, including a personal pepper mill, ready to be whisked away on a moment’s notice for a big story, or for a little one that caught his fancy. Even when his knees began to wear out from years of carrying the surplus pounds that were a byproduct of his adventures, Mr. Apple lost none of the “legs” that define the best reporters.In a message to the Times staff yesterday, Bill Keller, the executive editor, said of Mr. Apple: “From his sickbed he hammered out his last words to readers (see a list of some of his favorite restaurants on the Web at nytimes.com/obituaries), negotiated details of the menu and music for his memorial service, followed the baseball playoffs and the latest Congressional scandal with relish, and cheered up the friends who came by to cheer him up. He was himself to the last.”Mr. Apple once told Lear’s magazine: “Newspaper people love impossible dreams. I suppose we’re reckless sentimentalists. If we didn’t love impossible dreams, we would not still be working in an industry whose basic technology was developed in the 16th and 17th centuries.”Mr. Apple was no manager, and he could be cruelly short-tempered with hotel clerks, copy editors and political aides. In his days as Washington Bureau chief, in the mid-1990’s, his editing might involve bursting out of his corner office to declare that one reporter had “misspelled fettuccine Alfredo!” or that another had referred to Ann D. Jordan, the consultant, corporate director and wife of the Washington super-lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr., as a “socialite.”But he was a natural role model. His colleagues and competitors all watched what he asked, what he wrote and what and where and when he ate and drank, and they did their best to follow suit, though with much less apparent ease, capacity or zest. When, in an Indian restaurant in Uganda, he warned his dining companions, “No prawns at this altitude!” they listened.“I used to say that Johnny grew into the person he was pretending to be when we were young,” Joseph Lelyveld, a contemporary who rose to become executive editor of The Times, told the writer Calvin Trillin in a 2003 profile of Mr. Apple in The New Yorker. “Now I wonder whether he actually was that person then, and the rest of us didn’t know enough to realize it.”Drama, and a lot of dash, followed Mr. Apple as night follows day. He was the pool reporter sent to the deck of the U.S.S. Forrestal in 1967 when a fiery accident nearly killed one of the ship’s pilots, Lt. Cmdr. John S. McCain 3d. From that incident he formed a lifelong friendship with the pilot, who went on to become a United States senator.It was Mr. Apple, or so the legend goes, who told Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot. It was Mr. Apple whose relentless questioning elicited from Ronald L. Ziegler, Richard M. Nixon’s press secretary, the admission that his previous explanations about the Watergate affair were “inoperative.”Mr. Apple’s dinner guests — at his Georgetown house, his farm near Gettysburg, Pa., or his English cottage in the Cotswolds — were apt to include not only leading politicians but also prominent figures in architecture, cuisine and the arts. He thought nothing of beginning a sentence by saying, “The first time I made lunch for Julia Child ... .”Mr. Apple joined The Times as a brash and ambitious recruit from The Wall Street Journal and NBC News. He quickly became one of the highest-paid reporters on the local staff. In his first year at the paper, his byline appeared 73 times on the front page. A citation for an early publisher’s award, an in-house prize, described his impact:“In the interests of efficiency, The New York Times recently equipped its main office with automatic elevators, a Centrex switchboard, a two-faced Universal Jump clock, a Goss press with magnetic amplifier drive, a jam-proof Jampool conveyor belt and a 185-pound, water-cooled, self-propelled, semi-automatic machine called R. W. Apple Jr.”Mr. Apple was always the hero of his own life, especially in his younger days. His colleagues swapped so many outraged stories about his bumptious behavior that they eventually began charging each other for the privilege, with the proceeds going to a kitty for their bar tabs. In “The Boys on the Bus,” his 1973 book about the 1972 presidential campaign, Timothy Crouse painted a portrait of Mr. Apple that was at once flattering about his talents and unsparing about his flaws.“There was a reason why reporters told stories about Apple,” Mr. Crouse wrote. “They recognized many of their own traits in him, grotesquely magnified. The shock of recognition frightened them. Apple was like them, only more blatant. He openly displayed the faults they tried to hide: the insecurity, the ambitiousness, the name-dropping” and “the weakness for powerful men.”He added: “When they talked about him, they were really saying: ‘I hope it doesn’t show that much in me.’ ”Raymond Walter Apple Jr. was born Nov. 20, 1934, in Akron, Ohio. His father, also known as Johnny — nicknamed for Johnny Appleseed — ran a chain of grocery stores that had been founded by the family of Mr. Apple’s mother, the former Julia Albrecht. The senior Apple had hoped his only son would take over the business, but an early encounter with The New York Times in the Akron public library gave Mr. Apple other ideas.Mr. Apple once told Current Biography that in the pages of The Times he had found “wonderful, romantic” bylines like Osgood Carruthers and Drew Middleton, reporters writing from faraway places. “It seeped into my consciousness that these people were actually being paid to do this,” he said.At Western Reserve Academy, a private prep school in Hudson, Ohio, Mr. Apple was sports editor of the student newspaper and editor in chief of the yearbook. He continued his journalistic training in college, on The Daily Princetonian at Princeton. Twice expelled for neglecting his studies at Princeton, he eventually earned a B.A. in history — magna cum laude — from the Columbia University School of General Studies in 1961.By then, he had already become a working journalist, first at The Wall Street Journal, then at The Newport News Daily Press, where he moonlighted while stationed at Fort Monroe, Va., during a two-year hitch as an Army speechwriter. In 1961, he was hired as a writer on the overnight shift at NBC News in New York. He eventually became a writer and correspondent for the NBC nightly newscast “The Huntley-Brinkley Report,” covering civil rights and other stories, and winning an Emmy Award in 1963.But all that was pale prologue to his career at The Times, where he rose rapidly and never looked back. He soon became Albany bureau chief and covered Robert Kennedy’s 1964 Senate campaign in New York. By 1966, he was bureau chief in Saigon as the Vietnam War escalated. He mastered the art of hitching rides to battle zones on military transport and dictating his dispatches over balky field telephones, and he brought a keen truth-detector to the daily American military briefings known as the Five O’Clock Follies.In his 1991 memoir, “Deadline,” James B. Reston, the longtime Times columnist and editor, recalled that Mr. Apple “didn’t invent the war but taught a whole generation how to cover it.” In 1968, he won George Polk and Overseas Press Club awards for his coverage before plunging into the war-fueled turmoil of the 1968 presidential campaign at home.Mr. Apple would cover other wars and conflicts with distinction and panache, but it was as a political reporter that he cemented his reputation. He was in constant touch with scores of county chairmen, governors and mayors when they still dominated politics, and he was almost unrivaled at counting noses, canvassing convention delegates and predicting election results.“Nineteen seventy-six was a spectacular performance on his part by any measure, but particularly those of us at The Washington Post felt he was on his game and making it really hard for us in Iowa,” David S. Broder, the longtime Post columnist and reporter, said in an interview last year. “And it wasn’t just what Johnny saw in Iowa and the Carter campaign, but that he had enough confidence in his own judgment to write it really hard when nobody else was doing it.”Many of Mr. Apple’s colleagues believed he deserved print journalism’s highest prize, the Pulitzer, for his work that year. It was one of the few honors that eluded him, though he was nominated for it many times. All the same, the journalism magazine MORE pronounced Mr. Apple “America’s most powerful political reporter” in 1976, a distinction he accepted with some trepidation.“I am frightened by it,” he told the magazine, “or perhaps awed is a better word. And I am very reluctant to throw it around in the newspaper.” He added: “I’m very ambivalent about the power I have and the way it’s used. Yet I would be transparently uncandid if I didn’t say I do enjoy it enormously.”At the end of the 1976 campaign, Mr. Apple was named London bureau chief, a job he held until 1985. In that post he covered not only British politics but also the Falklands war, elections in France and Spain, the Iranian revolution and the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. He traveled widely through Europe, exploring and writing about his interests in food, wine and architecture, and amassing a wine cellar whose contents would animate dinner parties 25 years later.On his return to Washington, he produced “Apple’s Europe,” an elegant, idiosyncratic, critically praised book of travel and restaurant tips that would become the model for “Apple’s America,” a similar guide to American cities published in 2005.Mr. Apple’s first marriage, to Edith Smith, a former American vice-consul in Saigon, ended in divorce. In 1982, he married the former Betsey Pinckney Brown, and she became his traveling companion, driver and partner at table, often introduced in his first-person food and travel articles as “my wife, Betsey.” She survives him, as do two stepchildren from her first marriage, Catherine Brown Collins of Washington and John Brown of Virginia, and a sister, Barbara, of Rockford, Ill.Mr. Apple continued to cover politics through the 2004 election, first as chief Washington correspondent, then as Washington bureau chief, later as chief correspondent of The Times and, beginning in 2002, as associate editor, a title that reflected his unique status at the paper. But more and more often, he wrote about the topics that really compelled him — bourbon and bacon, potatoes and tomatoes, langoustines and mangosteens, barbecue and bouillabaisse, New Orleans and New Zealand.For his 70th birthday, he gathered friends at the Paris bistro Chez L’Ami Louis, which he often described as his favorite restaurant, for heaping plates of foie gras, roast chicken, escargots, scallops and pommes Anna, washed down with gallons of burgundy and magnums of Calvados.Mr. Trillin, who later wrote about the evening for Gourmet Magazine, quoted one guest who summed up Mr. Apple’s attitude toward the party, and toward the rich, long life and career that produced it: “It’s my understanding that Apple has simplified what could be a terribly difficult choice by telling them to bring everything.”'"

""It's not because I have these strong opinions that I hold back talking about,"" she said. ""I'm just not a political person."" She added, ""I really am aware that no matter how strongly I feel about something, there's someone else who feels just as strongly about the exact opposite.""Unlike Ms. O'Donnell, Ms. DeGeneres makes only rare references to her romantic life on her show -- she shares a home with the actress Portia de Rossi -- mindful that the way she came out as a lesbian (with a Time magazine cover featuring the headline ""Yep, I'm Gay"") drew much criticism in some circles and concerned some station managers who now carry her show..""Maybe because I was penalized in a way when I came out, there are certain areas that I am aware would get me in trouble,"" she said. ""I talk about my life and I talk about Portia and it's not a big deal if it comes up. But it really doesn't come up.""In recent weeks, for example, Ms. DeGeneres omitted any reference to Ms. de Rossi from two stories she told during her monologue, one about a car accident (she was driving and Ms. de Rossi was a passenger) and another in which their French bulldog, Pig, who is prone to flatulence, devoured a bowl of Parmesan cheese. (Ms. de Rossi had been cooking pasta and inadvertently left the bowl within Pig's reach.) That Ms. DeGeneres may be holding back a few details from her daily life does not seem to bother her show's core audience, particularly those who began lining up as early as 5:30 a.m. with hopes of getting a good seat (and perhaps the chance to dance on camera with the host) on a recent day.""She's like us, real people,"" said Esther Perez, 47, a school cafeteria worker from San Diego whose husband left home at 3:45 a.m. to hold a spot in line for her. ""And she's very clean with her jokes.""""It's that positivity,"" said Nan Einarson, a life coach who had traveled to the show from Toronto as a 58th birthday present from her daughter. ""Ellen's always upbeat.""Correction: October 7, 2006, Saturday An article in The Arts on Thursday about the talk show host Ellen DeGeneres included an erroneous description of a routine involving an apparently unwitting Robin Williams in April.

"'06-10-06,'0','A minimum-wage comedy with minimum-talent stars, “Employee of the Month” chronicles the rocky romance of two drones working for a Costco-like megastore. Zack (Dane Cook) is a slacker box boy who lives with his potty-mouthed grandmother (Barbara Dodd Ramsen) and plays Texas hold ’em instead of, well, boxing things. Amy (Jessica Simpson) is the bodacious new cashier whose virtue is reputedly available only to employee-of-the-month title holders. And they say there are no good roles for women these days.Directed by Greg Coolidge with the flair of a training video, “Employee of the Month” turns work into a game and love into a sporting event. Competing against Zack for both the coveted title and Amy’s affections is the store’s odious head cashier, Vince (Dax Shepard), a k a “the fastest hands in the Southwest” (a moniker guaranteed to pique the interest of any young woman). As Zack and Amy bond over their physical idiosyncrasies — he has a tongue that could audition for Cirque du Soleil, she has ears like an African elephant — Vince and his faithful sidekick (Efren Ramirez) bicker like Gable and Lombard. Movies like this tend to believe a villain with repressed homosexual urges is much funnier than one without.Replete with loser buddies, limp subplots and a dwarf named Glen Ross (Danny Woodburn), “Employee of the Month” is more tired than a Wal-Mart greeter at the end of a Saturday shift. One can only hope its halfhearted suggestion that winning isn’t everything is some comfort if the movie’s grosses are as disappointing as its jokes.“Employee of the Month” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has bad words, bad acting and bad worker attitudes.Directed by Greg Coolidge; written by Don Calame, Chris Conroy and Mr. Coolidge, based on a story by Mr. Calame and Mr. Conroy; director of photography, Anthony B.

"'06-10-06,'0','But about ten minutes later he he reappeared and resumed the speech. “Our bodies may get tired, but our souls will not,” Mr. Haniya said, as the crowd roared.His spell of weakness apparently was caused by the dawn-to-dusk fast that Mr. Haniya, like many Muslims, observes daily during the holy month of Ramadan.Mr. Haniya’s speech and the large Hamas rally were seen as a rebuttal to Mr. Abbas, who said on Wednesday that the current political stalemate could not go on indefinitely. At that time, Mr. Abbas said he was prepared to invoke his presidential powers, including dismissing the current Palestinian government, which is dominated by Hamas.Mr. Abbas made his remarks on the same day that he met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who expressed support for Mr. Abbas.On Sept. 11, Mr. Abbas and Mr. Haniya agreed in principle to form a unity government in an attempt to find a way out of the worsening political and economic crisis facing the Palestinians. The deal would bring Fatah and other political factions into a government that has been controlled by Hamas since the radical Islamic movement won Palestinian elections in January.Western countries cut off aid to the Palestinian Authority when Hamas assumed power because they regard Hamas as a terrorist group, and they are now demanding that the Palestinian government take three steps before aid will be resumed: Recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements.In the talks between Fatah and Hamas, negotiators have sought some way for a new government to take those positions that still allowed Hamas as a political party to avoid explicitly endorsing them.But Hamas has repeatedly rejected the Western demands, and Fatah leaders say they see no rationale for joining a unity government that would continue to be ostracized by the Western countries and much of the international community.Israel, which is withholding more than $50 million a month in taxes that it collects on the Palestinian Authority’s behalf, refuses to deal with the Hamas government. Israel’s Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, says he is willing to meet with Mr. Abbas, but he says there is no prospect for progress until the Palestinians release an Israeli soldier seized by Palestinian militants and taken to Gaza on June 25.Mr. Haniya, meanwhile, said that the Palestinians faced an “unethical and unjust siege led by the United States administration.”“Many parties, internal and external, colluded in an attempt to force us to surrender,” the prime minister added. He noted that, aside from Qatar, even the governments of Arab states had not invited him to visit.The Fatah-Hamas friction boiled over into street fighting in Gaza on Sunday and Monday, leaving 10 Palestinians dead and more than 100 injured in some of the worst internal fighting in recent years. The violence has subsided, but the tension remains.'"
"'06-10-06,'0','Jagr’s being named captain was not much of a surprise — he and Coach Tom Renney had been talking about it since the start of training camp. But it still gave the evening a bit of drama when Jagr skated onto the darkened rink through a cloud of dry ice as the last player introduced. He appeared humbled by the response as he lifted his stick to the crowd. He looked as if he could not wait for the game to start.“It’s special,” Jagr said. “It’s special in New York. It’s special to be a captain on this team. It’s a different team. I’m proud to be a captain on this team.”Jagr laughed when asked about scoring so quickly. “The first game is always different,” he said. “The excitement is there, the big ceremony. It’s not easy to skate. I was happy to score right away. I was getting tired after that.”The boost it gave the Rangers was immeasurable as the crowd celebrated raucously. Kolzig was left shaking his head because none of his teammates had so much as challenged Jagr while he carried the puck. The Rangers were left amazed by the talent of a player they watched score an incredible team-record 54 goals last season.“The whole game was a great atmosphere and especially the start,” said goalie Henrik Lundqvist, who finished with 25 saves. “Jags goes out there and scores a really great goal and it felt like the roof was going to lift off.”The Rangers rode that start through the first period, holding Washington to only a few chances until the Capitals tied the score on a shot by Alexander Semin that trickled between Lundqvist’s pads 2 minutes 58 seconds into the second.From there, though, the Rangers turned their opener into a show. They took a 2-1 lead on a goal by Blair Betts at 12:53 of the period. Adam Hall fed him the puck off a turnover by Washington defenseman Bryan Muir.A minute and a half later, Shanahan sent the crowd into a new frenzy with his first goal. It came on a breakaway when his linemate Petr Prucha found him ahead of the Capitals’ defense with a long pass up the middle of the ice. Shanahan waited until the last second to shoot, and his shot went between Kolzig’s pads. He received a standing ovation from the crowd for that one.Shanahan scored his next goal 2:58 into the third period, on a rebound of a shot by Prucha.When it was announced as Shanahan’s 600th career goal, the fans stood and cheered for several minutes. Jagr went and grabbed the puck and presented it to Shanahan.“Wow,” Shanahan said. “That’s part of the reason I chose New York. All these years playing in Madison Square Garden, to get that reception. I mean honestly, to be in my 19th N.H.L. season and to get chills from the response and reaction from the fans is just amazing to me. They were just fantastic.”The Capitals mustered very little in response, scoring in the final two minutes before Straka’s empty-net goal accounted for the final score. The Rangers had almost completely stifled the Capitals’ star scorer, Alexander Ovechkin, who had three shots and little impact on the game. He was shadowed for much of the time by another player the Rangers added in the off-season, defenseman Aaron Ward.But it was the Rangers’ offensive stars who made opening night what it was. Afterward, each was busy passing the credit to the other for a special game.During the game, though, the Garden crowd had plenty of celebrations to go around.'"

"'06-10-06,'0','In Mr. Cuomo’s case, one of the hedge fund’s three founders, his wife and officers of the fund — known as EnTrust Capital Partners L.P. — have donated nearly $175,000 to the last two Cuomo campaigns.Mr. Cuomo’s campaign said that the EnTrust fund was “low volatility,” adding that Mr. Cuomo had not received any guarantee of positive returns.Wendy Katz, a spokeswoman for the campaign, wrote in an e-mail message to The New York Times, “The rationale for investing campaign funds in a hedge fund is the same rationale employed by nonprofits, universities (for example, Harvard and Columbia), state and city public pension funds and charitable foundations for investing in hedge funds, which is to grow the asset and maximize returns.”The Cuomo campaign, however, was given special consideration by EnTrust. It gave the campaign one of 35 slots in the fund that federal regulations allow for investors who do not meet minimum total asset requirements, which in the case of the campaign would generally be $5 million. EnTrust also waived its usual minimum investment requirement of $1 million.There are no city, state or federal election laws or regulations that prevent candidates from investing campaign money with hedge funds or other speculative vehicles, according to regulatory agencies.Several campaign finance experts said in interviews that they had never heard of a campaign that had invested in a hedge fund before. But in the go-go stock market of the late 1990’s, a few state and national politicians did dip campaign funds into other speculative investments, like stocks and mutual funds.The rarity of taking such risks is evident in New York State’s campaign finance database. Only seven candidates or committees have declared losses on campaign fund investments in any reporting period since 1999.“You want to make sure it’s available in case you need it in the future,” Bob Farmer, who served as national treasurer for four presidential campaigns and the Democratic National Committee, said of campaign money.Among the New York politicians who have invested in securities is State Senator George D. Maziarz, an upstate Republican whose campaign lost $63,815 in the second half of 2001 on stock brokerage investments.State Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Republican from Binghamton, has done better, earning $125,300 since 1999 on investments in mutual funds.Mr. Cuomo also fared well. In March 2004, his campaign invested $750,000 of the roughly $1.2 million it had in its treasury with EnTrust, according to Ms. Katz. By the time the campaign closed the account, in February 2005, it had recorded gains of $143,047, a gross return of 19 percent during a period when the Dow Jones industrial average rose less than 1 percent. Management fees of $28,517 cut into the campaign’s gains.One of the three partners who own EnTrust, Gregg S. Hymowitz, said the Cuomo campaign had put its money into a conservative hedge fund, one that invests in stocks, seeks to preserve capital and has rarely suffered losses.Mr. Cuomo has also invested personally with EnTrust. His 2004 tax filings show a $174,973 gain from money placed in the company’s Capital Diversified Fund, according to The Associated Press. Ms. Katz declined to address whether EnTrust granted Mr. Cuomo’s personal investments the same considerations as it did to his campaign money.Mr. Hymowitz and his wife, Deborah, have donated to Mr. Cuomo’s campaigns, contributing $133,578 to his two runs for public office as individuals or through entities that Mr. Hymowitz controls. Other EnTrust officials have given the Cuomo campaign another $40,000.“I have known Andrew as a close personal friend for over five years, and believe that he would have made a great governor and strongly believe he will be a great attorney general,” Mr. Hymowitz wrote in an e-mail message to The Times.Mr. Hymowitz was so involved in Mr. Cuomo’s 2002 campaign for governor that he was paid a $1,000 professional services fee, which Ms. Katz described as a reimbursement for his expenses to attend a policy conference.Hedge funds hold great attraction because they can offer types of investments that mutual funds and other institutions cannot. And those mechanisms, typically closely held secrets and often intricate matrixes designed by mathematicians, offer average investors the potential for bigger gains. With that upside potential, however, comes risk. Last month, Amaranth Advisors, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn., told investors that it was shutting down because it had lost $6 billion trading on natural gas prices.In New York, Senator Libous’s campaign did not invest in hedge funds, but decided that it could invest prudently in mutual funds. His campaign’s treasurer, Robert N. Nielsen Jr., said that once the campaign decided it was raising enough money each year to meet its annual budget, it determined it could invest a separate pot of money more boldly.“Our philosophy is that we’re really no different than any other business,” Mr. Nielsen said, speaking of himself and the senator. “We sort of looked at each other one day and said, ‘We really should be able to do better with the money that’s been entrusted to us.’ ”The Federal Election Commission has rarely addressed the issue of investing campaign money beyond a 1999 advisory opinion. In that case, the campaign treasurer for United States Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, asked if the committee could invest in the Vanguard Group’s mutual and bond funds.The committee was willing to accept greater risk because its next election was years away, the opinion said. To avoid a potential conflict of interest, Mr. Specter’s campaign told the federal regulators that neither he nor his staff would know in which Vanguard funds the money was kept. The commission approved the request.In the case of Mr. Cuomo’s campaign, Rachel Leon, executive director of Common Cause New York, an organization that monitors campaign finance, said that the hedge fund investment was troubling, given that hedge funds are run privately, pick and choose their investors, and can be run by political supporters who benefit financially from the campaign’s investment.“It raises multiple questions on multiple levels,” she said.Ms. Katz, Mr. Cuomo’s spokeswoman, said that the investment did not represent any potential conflict of interest.Mr. Farmer said that, on the most basic level, there was a danger to risky campaign investments that goes beyond simply losing dollars.“If you were to speculate with it,” he said, “and it was unsuccessful, people quite rightly would say, ‘If he can’t manage his own money, why should he be trusted with the public’s money?’ ”'"
"'06-10-06,'0','“Most of the animals that are bred at the game farm are prized for their meat and are perfect canned hunt targets,” said Kirsti Gholson, who lives in Woodstock and helped form a local coalition, Advocates for Game Farm Animals, to find homes for the animals. “We are extremely worried about them ending up in those types of facilities.” Canned hunts have drawn harsh criticism from animal rights groups and some prominent hunting organizations because the animals have little chance to escape, and are sometimes drugged.Allegations that the Catskill Game Farm has sold animals to hunting ranches have dogged the operation for several years now. At least two major zoos have refused to send animals to the game farm for that reason.Now the possibility that some of the farm’s tame, hand-fed animals could end up as easy targets for hunters has drawn the attention of local residents, some lawmakers and animal advocates.They have pleaded with the owner of the farm to donate the animals to more than a dozen sanctuaries that have offered to take them. And they have urged the federal government to oversee the auction on Oct. 18.“These are exotic animals that are accustomed to people,” said Brian Shapiro, a member of the Ulster County Legislature and chairman of its Environmental Committee. “They have brought a lot of joy to families and to children. It just doesn’t seem right for these animals that have been eating biscuits from our hands for years to be sent off to slaughter or to a hunting ranch.”More than a thousand people have signed a petition urging the state to subsidize the operation or designate the 1,000-acre farm a state park. One group is planning a protest on the road outside the park tomorrow.A few potential buyers have made private offers to Kathie Schulz, the owner of the farm, a family-run business for 73 years. But none of those buyers were taken seriously, she said, adding that the cost of operating the farm have grown so steeply that at this point its fate is sealed.She said every precaution would be taken to see that the animals are sold to licensed dealers who will treat them humanely.“We are trying to do everything possible to ensure that these animals go to good homes,” she said. “That’s very important to us. It took us years to collect these animals, and we don’t want them hanging on somebody’s wall either.”But many who are concerned about the future of the animals say those assurances mean little. While dealers generally must have licenses to purchase animals at an auction, there are no laws forbidding a buyer from turning around and selling animals to hunting ranches.Started in 1933 by Ms. Schulz’s father, Roland Lindemann, the game farm was once known around the world for the rare and exotic animals it imported.But to generations of upstate New Yorkers, the game farm was the mountainside hideaway that was unlike any other zoo, a place where visitors could step beyond fences to feed or play with gentle animals.On a recent warm afternoon, a tree-size giraffe strolled toward a fence to greet a visitor and open its mouth, hoping for a biscuit. Pygmy goats climbed on rocks and jostled for attention. Small deer followed children through the petting zoo.For many people, like Stacey Ulrich, visiting the farm is a tradition. Ms. Ulrich, who lives nearby in the town of Owego and has been going to the farm with her family since she was a child, said she now takes her 5- and 10-year-old daughters every year.“I’m heartbroken,” she said. “This has been such a mainstay of the community that a lot of people are sad. My kids are just devastated.”The farm, however, has had its share of notoriety. In recent years, animal advocates complained that as the zoo was running low on money, it was falling into a state of disrepair and its animals were suffering. On several occasions, the farm was cited by federal inspectors for things like exposing animals to “significant injury hazards” and failing to provide medical care to a lame giraffe and an injured elephant.The farm also came under fire from the San Francisco Zoo and the Toronto Zoo, which stopped doing business with the game farm because, officials at those zoos said, they had discovered that it was selling animals to canned hunt operations in Texas.Inspection records from the Texas Animal Health Commission show that about 150 animals including zebra, deer and bison were shipped to Texas from the game farm between 2001 and 2004.Where those animals ended up once they entered Texas is unclear, but records show that only five camels and two zebras were later shipped out of the Texas.Don Elroy, the director of Wildlife Advocacy for the Humane Society of the United States, said it was no mystery where the rest of those animals went. “They are invariably going to canned hunts,” he said.But Ms. Schulz said the records were confusing because she shares an operating permit with her ex-husband, Jurgen C. Schulz, who owns an exotic-animal import business of his own in Texas.“Unfortunately, our permits were run together as one instead of separately, and that made it look like Bambi was coming out of the zoo and going to canned hunts,” she said.When the park closes on Monday, some animals will remain behind, possibly for a breeding business, and some others, like a group of cougars and some horses, will go to sanctuaries. But a vast majority will be sold off.“Nobody is sorrier than I am to have to close it,” Ms. Schulz said. “But I have to make a decision with my head, not my heart, and it’s just not financially feasible to keep it open.”'"
"'06-10-06,'0','It could have been more. While searching for a music director to replace Daniel Barenboim, who left the Chicago Symphony in the spring, Deborah R. Card, the orchestra’s president, approached Mr. Haitink. The most unassuming of maestros, he demurred.“I said, ‘Listen: music director, no, no, no, no,’ ” Mr. Haitink said in July at a home provided for him near Tanglewood, in a setting worthy of Beethoven’s “Pastoral” Symphony. “ ‘Far too old. It will be a scandal.’“I told her, ‘If you need time to find a music director, I would really be interested to be your principal guest conductor.’ ‘No, that’s not what we want,’ she said. ‘We want you to have the title,’ et cetera. So we compromised at principal conductor.”In Chicago, beginning on Oct. 19, Mr. Haitink will conduct Mahler’s Third Symphony. It is one of his calling cards, and a magnificent 1990 performance of it with the Berlin Philharmonic has just been released on DVD by Philips.But first he has to get Beethoven out of his system.Why Beethoven, and why now? Why would a conductor who has heard it all and done it all, too often to count, choose to immerse himself yet again in Beethoven at this late stage in his career? One can imagine all sorts of grand pronouncements on a wisdom acquired over the years that allows for a new perspective on these gnarly and stupendous creations, suggesting a meeting of minds between masters, if not an equivalence.But Mr. Haitink, who aptly said that he is “quite known for not talking that much,” is not given to pronouncements, grand or otherwise.“Well, you know, these things nearly always start on a commercial basis,” he said. Clive Gillinson, then the managing director of the London Symphony and now the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, Mr. Haitink explained, wanted a Beethoven cycle for the orchestra’s series of recordings on its LSO Live label. The Beethoven recordings were made in 2005 and 2006 at the Barbican.“The L.S.O. is famous for its big 20th-century pieces,” Mr. Haitink said, “and they are not known for their Beethoven. Not at all. Clive wanted to repair that, and thought that I would be the right man for it. And so it started.“And the L.S.O. has a line to Avery Fisher Hall” — more accurately, to the Great Performers series at Lincoln Center — “and so it went on and on and on, and they wanted a Beethoven cycle.”And so too, Mr. Gillinson, from his perch at Carnegie Hall, ends up as a mere onlooker at the final stage of the project he set in motion. But he remains gracious and proud of what he started.Referring to the two schools of Beethoven interpretation, the conventional modern view and the antiquarian early-music approach, Mr. Gillinson, who used to be a cellist in the London Symphony, said that “Bernard draws all the threads together.”“He has utter integrity,” Mr. Gillinson added, “and his career is at its absolute peak.” Whatever the role of commerce at the outset of the project, Beethoven quickly became a consuming passion for Mr. Haitink. He steeped himself in a recent edition of the symphonies by Norman Del Mar, published by the German firm Bärenreiter. In particular, he paid more attention to Beethoven’s metronome markings than before, as a guide not only to tempos but also — just as important, he says — to the relationships among them.In this respect and others, his concerns touched on those of the early-music movement in recent decades. “And yes,” he said, “I am not ashamed to say, I listened to some of the newer approaches, you know, because they are there. And sometimes I was deeply impressed, and sometimes I said, ‘Well, for that symphony that man should be in prison for a year.’ But that’s the thing. I learned a lot from this.”Mr. Haitink — who is not easily amused, or at least does not show it — seemed tickled when told that this interviewer had been listening to some of the new recordings on the drive from New York, had got caught up in the animated tempos and had received a speeding ticket. He wanted to know which symphony was the culprit. It was the Second.And the discussion led to the Sixth, the “Pastoral,” on the same disc as the Second. The timpani playing Mr. Haitink elicits in the storm movement is positively fierce and terrifying.“Yes, maybe we overdid the timpani,” Mr. Haitink said, “but I think the storm is not just a picture. It has reality, this frightened anxiety. I have always loved the ‘Pastoral’ and always found it one of the most difficult of the symphonies, but what a wonderful piece.”The difficulty, he said, lies in keeping the energy going, especially in the babbling brook of the second movement. “I really try to move it on,” he added. “It’s not only a matter of tempo that’s important, it’s a matter of ... is momentum the right word? It’s pretty close.”Mr. Haitink sidesteps his inherent modesty only far enough to indicate that he is happy with the Beethoven recordings. “There are moments that I don’t recognize myself,” he said, “and I’m very pleased with that.”Now he takes up his new duties in Chicago in what he calls the autumnal period of his life, and it is clear that he does not see this as a long-term proposition. “Every conductor,” he said, “including myself, has a sell-by date.”'"
"'06-10-06,'0','By now, David Walker’s sets from 1987 — even though “acquired in mint condition,” in the words of a news release — look a little dowdy, drab and old-fashioned, despite some nice touches, like the rising scrims to reveal each of the seasonal Fairies. The Fairy Godmother’s coach, which drew oohs and aahs from the audience, was tacky. But the Walker costumes are still vivid and, when called for, amusing.The ballet has been staged for the Joffrey by a double-barreled Royal Ballet team consisting of Wendy Ellis Somes, a former dancer who now owns the intellectual rights to the choreography, and Christopher Carr, the Royal Ballet’s rehearsal director and senior ballet master. Mr. Carr is credited for additional staging; too bad he omitted the bit in which a Stepsister stamps at a loose wig as if it were a rat.Unlike most companies, the Joffrey dispenses with rankings (principal, soloist, corps). Everyone is listed alphabetically, except for the apprentices and two billed as “seasonal dancers for ‘Cinderella.’ ”The company is presenting nine performances with four sets of leads, and, given the considerable but not dazzling strengths of the opening-night cast, one has to wonder about the depth of the roster, compared to other regional ballet troupes.That groused, Maia Wilkins made a pert and appealing Cinderella, ably partnered by the graceful Willy Shives (the Joffrey’s assistant ballet master), who neatly matched her small stature. Their duets, especially at the end, were touching. Julianne Kepley, in other performances a Cinderella herself, danced the Fairy Godmother brightly, and Calvin Kitten won cheers for his hard-working leaps and determined cheerfulness as the Jester.Still, all eyes were on Mr. Chryst and Mr. Holder, scheduled as the Stepsisters in seven of the performances. There is always the danger of over-the-top campiness in these parts, and there was some of that here. But Mr. Holder’s imperious height (he looked like an elongated Oprah) and Mr. Chryst’s sweet deference made a charming pair.Leslie B. Dunner conducted the Chicago Sinfonietta, which played solidly but a little roughly. Perhaps the musicians were still recovering from their labors last Sunday in David N. Baker’s Concertino for Cellular Phones and Symphony Orchestra.The Joffrey Ballet’s “Cinderella” is at the Auditorium Theater, 50 East Congress Parkway, Chicago, through Sunday, and next Friday through Sunday, (312) 902-1500 or ticketmaster.com.A dance review in Weekend on Friday about the Joffrey Ballet’s new production of Frederick Ashton’s “Cinderella,” at the Auditorium Theater in Chicago, referred incorrectly to Christopher Carr’s work. He is credited with additional staging, not additional choreography. It also misidentified the site of the premiere of “Cinderella” in 1948 by the company now called the Royal Ballet. It was the Royal Opera House in London, not the Sadler’s Wells Theater. (The Royal Ballet was then called the Sadler’s Wells Ballet.)The review also misstated the number of décors the London company has used for the work since its premiere and misidentified the one used by the Joffrey. There have been four décors, not three; the one in Chicago was No. 3, not No. 2.'"

"'06-10-07,'0','The Giants (1-2) have their own issues on defense. They are 27th over all defensively, and 29th in pass defense. When last seen, the Giants were being steamrolled by the Seattle Seahawks, giving up 42 points and allowing Seattle’s receivers to run seemingly unimpeded through the secondary.But why have the Redskins struggled defensively? Like the Giants, some of their off-season personnel changes have led to more confusion than consistency.Washington has two new starters in its secondary — Carlos Rogers, a second-year cornerback out of Auburn, and Archuleta — and some mental mistakes have led to receivers being left open. The Redskins have also missed cornerback Shawn Springs, who has not played this season because of a groin injury and will not play Sunday against the Giants.Archuleta said the Redskins should not seek excuses.“We can’t really sit here and say, ‘We’re new, we’re getting to know each other,’ ” Archuleta said. “It’s showtime now. We’ve just got to stop giving up big plays.”The Redskins hope to be motivated by last year’s visit to Giants Stadium, when they were pounded, 36-0. It was Washington’s largest margin of defeat since 2001. Tiki Barber rushed for 206 yards in that game, and the Redskins’ defensive game plan on Sunday will focus on containing him.“He’s a great football player,” Williams said. “The thing I marvel about is that he’s gotten better with age. Everybody thinks their offense centers around Eli; it centers around Tiki Barber.”The Redskins fared far better against the Giants at home last December, winning by 35-20, when they held Barber to 80 yards and forced quarterback Eli Manning to throw 41 times. But even if the Redskins control Barber, Williams believes Manning has become more capable of carrying New York’s offense.“Each time we play against him, it’s going to be harder to trick him,” Williams said of Manning. “You can see that he and Peyton talk quite a bit during the off-season. Some of the things I see him emulating from his older brother is helpful to him.”Peyton Manning is the star quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts.The Redskins expect the Giants to test their pass defense, hoping to spring Plaxico Burress, Amani Toomer and Jeremy Shockey. Given Washington’s penchant for surrendering big plays, why wouldn’t the Giants throw?Washington made the playoffs last season and entered this season with high expectations, especially after acquiring such talented free agents as Archuleta and wide receivers Antwaan Randle El and Brandon Lloyd. Just two weeks ago, some Redskins fans were in a panic, with the team 0-2 and the offense looking anemic. But the back-to-back wins have changed the mood.“You start off with two losses, and you combine that with the four preseason losses, it was a miserable six weeks for us,” Coach Joe Gibbs said earlier this week. “A lot of guys could have got down, a lot of teams could have got down. This team didn’t.”It is no coincidence that the Redskins’ two-game winning streak has coincided with the return of running back Clinton Portis. After sustaining a separated shoulder during the preseason, Portis was not 100 percent during the season-opening loss to Minnesota, and he did not play the next week during a loss to Dallas. However, Portis is back, both in ability and in humor.After his normal Thursday routine of dressing up in costume, Portis wore a brown wig and black boots as he portrayed a character he called “Dolemite Jenkins.”“I’m trying to ignore him,” Williams said, smiling, as Portis stood behind him, attempting to break his concentration.Despite Portis’s clowning, the play of Washington’s defense has been no laughing matter. The team that loses Sunday will occupy last place in the National Football Conference East, and the Redskins expect the Giants to attack their defense aggressively.“I think that’s great,” Washington’s secondary coach, Jerry Gray, said. “They’re going to throw the ball. Our job is to stop it. Once we start defending the pass as well as we defend the run, we’re going to be a really good defense.”For the Redskins, defensive improvement could not happen too quickly.'"

For nearly a year, the Church’s International Theological Commission has been working on a document expected to recommend that he formally abolish limbo, the place to which centuries of Catholic tradition held that babies who die without baptism and worthy pagans went. The Pope said a Mass with members of the commission, but, contrary to some news reports, he did not mention the concept in his homily and announced no decision. A commission member, Archbishop Bruno Forte, said the commission was still fine-tuning its document. “I think nothing will be ready to hand up to him until 2007,” he said.'"
"'06-10-07,'0','Democrats placed advertisements linking embattled Republican incumbents to Mr. Foley, including spots in Ohio and Indiana that began broadcasting Friday. Democratic House and Senate candidates pressed Republican incumbents to say whether they thought Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, who along with other senior members of the Republican leadership has come under fire as failing to act on early signals that Mr. Foley was sexually harassing teenagers, should stay in power.In New Jersey, Thomas H. Kean Jr., the Republican Senate candidate, called on Mr. Hastert to step down.The Democratic response to President Bush’s radio address on Saturday features a Democratic House candidate, Patty Wetterling of Minnesota, attacking House Republican leaders as ignoring warnings about Mr. Foley’s behavior, according to excerpts released Friday.“Foley sent obvious predatory signals, received loud and clear by members of Congressional leadership, who swept them under the rug to protect their political power,” says Ms. Wetterling, a Democrat whose 11-year-old son was kidnapped 17 years ago and has not been found.Republicans and their allies, including conservative talk radio hosts, have responded by rallying around Mr. Hastert and blaming Democrats and the news media for the frenzy.Talk radio hosts, working off a list of talking points distributed by Republican Party officials, recounted how two decades ago, House Democrats stood behind Representative Gerry E. Studds, Democrat of Massachusetts, after he engaged in sex with a male page.In upstate New York, Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, who is trailing his Democratic challenger according to two new polls, planned to go on television to defend himself after a labor union began broadcasting a 30-second radio advertisement questioning whether he had done all he could after hearing a complaint that Mr. Foley was harassing teenagers.“Nobody’s angrier and more disappointed than me that I didn’t catch his lies,” Mr. Reynolds said in advertisements scheduled to begin over the weekend. “I trusted that others had investigated. Looking back, more should have been done, and for that I am sorry.”George Rasley, an aide to Representative Deborah Pryce, Republican of Ohio, who was linked to Mr. Foley in a Democratic advertisement that began running Friday, said the Foley investigation further soured an already tough environment for Republicans in Ohio, a state hammered by corruption investigations this year.“This is one more thing that makes people wonder about politicians and politics,” Mr. Rasley said. “It reinforces this notion of Washington being a place that bears no resemblance to real America.”The page scandal is part of a run of difficult tidings for Republicans, including a stream of bad news out of Iraq, disclosure of an intelligence report that found that the invasion might have worsened the threat of terrorism and Mr. Bush’s continued unpopularity.In the White House, aides have watched with frustration as campaign appearances by Mr. Bush, in which he hammers Democrats on national security, receive little coverage, subsumed by the Foley case.Ken Mehlman, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said he believed that Republicans turned a corner when Mr. Hastert accepted responsibility for the mishandling of the page scandal after days of being pressed to take action by restive Republicans.“I’m looking at every single bit of public and private data,” Mr. Mehlman said. “So far, I have seen a minimal effect of this particular situation, which is not to say that I don’t take it seriously.”Democrats need to capture 15 House seats to take control of Congress; until the last week or two, about 40 Republican seats had been judged in play, of which 20 had been considered highly competitive. But analysts said at least five more Republican seats, and as many as eight, that had once been considered relative long shots for Democrats had now swung firmly into play.At least two of those seats are directly related to the Foley scandal. One is held by Mr. Reynolds, who as chairman of the House Republican campaign committee had entered this election cycle as a prohibitive favorite for re-election. Republicans in Florida do not plan to spend any money to defend the seat once held by Mr. Foley, effectively conceding it to the Democratic challenger, Tim Mahoney, who, not taking any chances, is running advertisements in which he pledges to return “moral values” to Congress.In other races, the Foley case has created an unfavorable backdrop for Republicans. In Pennsylvania this week, Representative Don Sherwood, a suddenly endangered Republican, bought time on television to offer an apology in response to allegations that he had abused his mistress. Analysts for both parties said the sweep of outrage over Congressional misbehavior had weakened Mr. Sherwood and forced him to deal directly with the issue.Beyond that, analysts said the page scandal had raised new concerns about ethics in Congress, an unwanted focus for Republicans in races where Democrats have sought to make an issue of what they have called a Republican culture of corruption.Those include re-election races by Representatives Richard W. Pombo and John T. Doolittle, both of California, who have been touched by the fallout from the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, as well as the contests to fill two seats vacated by Republicans who have quit the race, Tom DeLay of Texas and Bob Ney of Ohio.“I would think the Ney seat is more of a problem because of another round of ethics problems,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent analyst who studies Congressional races.Amy Walter, an analyst who follows Congressional races for The Cook Political Report, said the Foley inquiry was having an indirect effect on races in which corruption might be an issue. “When the spotlight is where the spotlight sits right now,” Ms. Walter said, “on scandal and dysfunction in Congress, then people like Pombo and Doolittle suffer.”Mr. Pombo has also been the target of advertisements by the Sierra Club and the League of Women Voters criticizing his record on environmental issues.Other races that have become increasingly competitive are the one to replace Representative Katherine Harris, a Florida Republican running for the Senate, and the challenge to Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., also a Florida Republican. Party officials said polls showed the two races were tight.Officials in both parties said it was not the Foley scandal alone as much as the accumulated weight of problems for Republicans these past two weeks that was giving them concern.“We’re working to redirect the debate back to national security and lower taxes,” said Brian Jones, the communications director for the Republican National Committee. “But this week that’s proved to be a difficult task.”Republican pollsters said their first concern was that the page scandal could discourage Republican voters from turning out.“We’re not seeing it affecting voter behavior; we are seeing it affect voter intensity,” said Glenn Bolger, a Republican pollster. “It’s more of a deflation effect among Republicans than it is a motivator for Democrats. Does that change in the next 34 days? That’s part of our job.”Meanwhile, Democrats were pushing hard to make sure the Republicans’ troubles stayed in the public consciousness. On Saturday, Democrats plan to run an advertisement against Mike Whalen, a Republican running for an open House seat in Iowa, picturing him alongside Mr. Hastert.Democratic advertisements are linking Mr. Foley to both Ms. Pryce of Ohio and Representative Mike Sodrel of Indiana. Ms. Pryce once described Mr. Foley as a friend, one advertisement says, while Mr. Sodrel is criticized as taking a campaign contribution “from the House leadership, who knew about it but did nothing to stop sexual predator Congressman Foley.”A fund-raiser for Mr. Sodrel headlined by Mr. Hastert was postponed this week. Mr. Sodrel’s campaign manager, Cam Savage, said that was only because of a scheduling conflict.Mr. Savage described the Foley scandal as an issue in Mr. Sodrel’s district, but not an overwhelming one. “It’s not the No. 1 priority on people’s minds,” he said, “but it does have some resonance to it.”'"
"'06-10-07,'0','Dr. Mortimer Ostow, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist who studied the psychological sources of anti-Semitism and other expressions of religious and racial fanaticism, died on Sept. 23 at his home in Riverdale, N.Y. He was 88.The cause was cancer, his family said.Dr. Ostow, who was in private practice in Riverdale and Manhattan, was the author of a 1996 book, “Myth and Madness: The Psychodynamics of Anti-Semitism,” in which he explored the origins and overt manifestations of racial prejudices.In the 1980’s, he led a group of psychologists and psychoanalysts in a study that investigated the root causes of anti-Semitism. In reviewing case histories of patients, the group found that negative feelings and a resentment of Jews could sometimes be traced to early childhood.Dr. Ostow and his colleagues suggested that such feelings might be linked to troubles in toilet training or even an Oedipal rivalry, in which a son’s negative impressions of his controlling father could be projected onto Jews.In later studies, Dr. Ostow and others looked at fanaticism and the psychological motivations behind terrorism. His conclusions included the theory that terrorists often experience childhoods marked by anger or hopelessness.'"
"'06-10-07,'0','APEX, N.C., Oct. 6 — Fire at a building that stored industrial chemicals produced toxic fumes that drove thousands of people from their homes in this Raleigh suburb early Friday.The fire, which touched off explosions that caused the plant to collapse, continued burning for most of the day. Hot spots persisted, and the town’s fire chief, Mark Haraway, said an evacuation order issued by the authorities would not be lifted until the fire was completely extinguished or burned itself out.Nor will everyone go home at once, Mayor Keith Weatherly said. Instead, they will return in stages, beginning with those whose homes are farthest from the site of the fire. As of Friday night, no one had been permitted back.No employees were in the building, operated by EQ Industrial Services of Wayne, Mich., when the fire broke out Thursday night. The blaze, whose cause remains under investigation, quickly generated a stinging cloud of smoke that, Mr. Weatherly said, sent 13 police officers and a firefighter to hospitals for treatment of breathing trouble and chemical burns; all were released. An undetermined number of civilians also sought treatment.The plant is used to store industrial waste like paint, solvents, pesticides and herbicides before they can be shipped elsewhere for disposal. Uncertain which chemicals were in the cloud of fumes, the authorities ordered the evacuation of a six-square-mile area around the plant. Initially they said that as many as 17,000 people had been displaced, but later said the actual number was probably smaller.The evacuation covered the west side of Apex, a largely residential town about 10 miles southwest of Raleigh. Several schools were closed to students and were pressed into service as emergency shelters, some for overnight stays. A haze with a chlorine-like smell hung over the downtown business district, and roads leading into it were blocked to keep out the public.'"
"'06-10-07,'0','Analysts said there were two likely possibilities for what Mr. Kerkorian might do next: Mr. Kerkorian could sell his shares and be done with the company altogether, or he could start a proxy battle to unseat some G.M. directors and install his own slate.Such a battle, which would echo similar actions by dissident shareholders at the H. J. Heinz Company, Hewlett-Packard and Time Warner, presumably could increase pressure on G.M.’s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, beyond what Mr. Kerkorian has already applied.Either way, Mr. York’s resignation means Mr. Kerkorian is “throwing in the towel” on trying to effect change in G.M. from the inside, said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.Each option has its downside. The first would cause Mr. Kerkorian to lose both face and money; the second one would be difficult without the support of other major shareholders, none of whom has yet joined Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. York in publicly criticizing Mr. Wagoner.Mr. York laid out a series of steps he wanted G.M. to take in a speech last January, one month before joining the board, where he served on the public policy and investment funds committee.Mr. Wagoner, who at the time said G.M. was pleased to welcome Mr. York to its board, followed some of those suggestions, like halving the G.M. dividend and initiating salary cuts for a handful of top managers.But he resisted other steps, like Mr. York’s suggestion that G.M. dump some of its underperforming brands. And in March, G.M.’s board issued a statement in support of Mr. Wagoner after reports that suggested his job was in jeopardy and that Mr. York would be a candidate to succeed him as chairman.Mr. York, in his resignation letter, said he reached the conclusion that the company’s other directors were not willing to challenge executives on the company’s strategies.In the letter, sent to G.M.’s lead outside director, George Fisher, Mr. York said the company was being too timid in confronting its problems.Although he acknowledged that G.M. did not face any threat of a near-term bankruptcy filing, “I have grave reservations concerning the ability of the company’s current business model to successfully compete in the marketplace with those of the Asian producers,” Mr. York wrote.He criticized G.M. for failing to obtain an independent analysis of the potential value of the Renault-Nissan alliance before backing out of the talks on Wednesday.More than that, however, Mr. York said he had not found “an environment in the boardroom that is very receptive to probing much beyond” data provided by management.But Mr. York always faced the risk of being the board’s odd man out. Early on in his tenure as a G.M. board member, management experts suggested he would probably be isolated, given that every other G.M. director was chosen while Mr. Wagoner was chief executive or a top company manager.In fact, Mr. York’s comments echoed those of another dissident G.M. board member, H. Ross Perot, who parted ways with the company nearly two decades ago after a brief but bitter stint on the board.In 1988, Mr. Perot, who became a G.M. director after the automaker bought his Electronic Data Services, ridiculed other board members as “pet rocks” to the chief executive at the time, Roger B. Smith.G.M., which lost $10.6 billion last year but posted an operating profit in the second quarter of this year, has said repeatedly that Mr. Wagoner’s turnaround plan was gaining traction.In a statement Friday, the company said, “We are making real progress, progress that is well ahead of what some skeptics thought possible.”As long as G.M. can damp any shareholder dissent, Mr. Kerkorian’s effort “is going to go nowhere if investors believe that Rick Wagoner does have a turnaround strategy,” Professor Useem said.If Mr. Kerkorian does indeed have a plan of attack, Mr. York’s letter, which was sent privately to Mr. Fisher but made public almost immediately, could be part of a strategic effort to shake shareholders’ confidence that the board was working in their interests.G.M.’s statement did not directly comment on Mr. York’s resignation. But it said that the decision to end talks with Nissan and Renault was approved by all 12 board members, which would include Mr. York, and it pointed out that 11 board members are not company executives.Mr. York’s resignation had been predicted after the alliance talks fell apart. If he remained on the board, he would be restricted in any part he could play in hostile moves by Mr. Kerkorian.A week ago, Mr. Kerkorian said that he was interested in buying 6 million to 12 million more G.M. shares, increasing his stake in the company to about 12 percent.He backed off that statement Friday in a regulatory filing, but noted that his investment company, the Tracinda Corporation, “will continue to review their investment” in G.M., and may buy or sell additional shares based on the company’s performance and other factors.Said Professor Useem: “The future really rests in Rick Wagoner’s hands. If he can pull off a turnaround, then Kerkorian will probably fade into history.”'"

"'06-10-07,'0','Yuri Dzhibladze, an ethnic Georgian and president of the Center for the Development of Democracy and Human Rights in Moscow, described the authorities’ actions as an unjustified overreaction to political disputes with Georgia’s president, Mikheil Saakashvili.“It smacks of racism and xenophobia,” he said in a telephone interview.Russian officials have cited legal or procedural violations as justifications for their actions, accusing the casinos and restaurants of violating health or other regulatory standards and the deportees of breaking immigration laws. “Everything that is taking place today is exclusively within the framework of the law,” the prosecutor general, Yuri Y. Chaika, said on Friday, according to Interfax.Officials’ remarks, however, have left little doubt that they have singled out Georgians for enforcement.Mikhail L. Tyurkin, the head of the country’s migration service, said on Thursday that all future work visas for Georgians would be eliminated. “Our analyses showed that today we do not need to attract Georgian citizens,” he said.In the wake of last week’s arrests, which provoked an ominous war of words between the countries, Russia severed transportation links to Georgia, effective Tuesday, and has vowed to restrict postal service and money transfers.The steps against Georgians in Russia have coincided with two new campaigns announced this week by President Vladimir V. Putin. On Wednesday, he proposed sweeping new restrictions on gambling. A day later, he called for new regulations of migrant workers, especially those in wholesale and retail markets, which he said were controlled by “semigangs, some of them ethnic.”Using some of the most strikingly nationalistic language of his presidency, Mr. Putin said that markets should be regulated “with a view to protect the interests of Russian producers and population, the native Russian population,” according to the Kremlin’s transcript of his remarks.It is not clear exactly how many Georgian citizens live in Russia, though some estimates run as high as 1 million. Like many citizens of former Soviet republics, they come to Russia to work, often temporarily, sending money home to support their families.The Georgians deported on Friday were detained over the last several days in what officials have described as a sweep of illegal migrants. Viktor P. Beltsov, a spokesman for the Emergency Services Ministry, said that 153 deportees were flown to Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi, aboard a ministry airplane from an airfield outside of Moscow.The campaign against Georgians has been echoed in television and newspaper reports that have indulged in stereotypes and lurid descriptions of Georgian mafias and criminality. At the same time, however, the authorities have come under unusually sharp criticism in other parts of the news media.“Searches in restaurants, closed casinos, threats of deportations looming over hundreds of thousands of people,” a commentator, Demis Polandov, wrote in the newspaper Gazeta on Friday. “If this is not an ethnic cleansing, then I do not have a word to name it.”'"

"'06-10-07,'0','WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 — A report on whether a convicted former member of the House Intelligence Committee abused his position has remained under wraps for nearly four months, largely because of a battle between the committee’s leaders over issuing a subpoena in the matter, members of Congress say.Representative Jane Harman of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, complained about the delay in a letter sent Thursday to the chairman, Representative Peter Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan. Ms. Harman protested what she said had been Mr. Hoekstra’s refusal to subpoena the former lawmaker, Randy Cunningham, a California Republican.Mr. Cunningham resigned from Congress in November and is serving an eight-year sentence in federal prison for accepting more than $2 million from supporters and military contractors in return for helping them obtain government business.Mr. Cunningham’s guilty plea centered mainly on his actions as a member of the House Appropriations Committee. He was also a member of the intelligence panel, and its investigation examined whether he tried to improperly influence decisions on classified spending proposals. Mr. Cunningham first sat on the Intelligence Committee in 2001 and for part of last year was chairman of its subcommittee on terrorism and human intelligence.The committee hired an outside counsel, Michael Stern, to carry out the Cunningham inquiry. Mr. Stern’s specific findings are not known, although some Congressional officials have suggested that his report, which was completed in June, is critical of Mr. Cunningham for using the committee’s secrecy to conceal his efforts on behalf of friends to insert spending items into classified bills.'"
"'06-10-07,'0','Without that aid the Palestinian Authority has been unable to pay salaries, provide services or govern in any meaningful way.But the blunt public remarks by Mr. Abbas on Wednesday and Mr. Haniya on Friday reflected what seems to be an increasingly bitter power struggle that could dim the prospects for a compromise.Still, Mr. Haniya called on Mr. Abbas, who works in the West Bank city of Ramallah, to return to Gaza to resume talks on a broad-based government. “Come down to Gaza to protect our people and declare our commitment to a national unity government,” Mr. Haniya said.But Mr. Abbas has given no indication that he plans to accept the invitation any time soon. Mr. Haniya and other senior Hamas officials are based in Gaza, and Israel does not permit them to travel to the West Bank.During the lengthy speech on a sweltering afternoon, Mr. Haniya appeared on the verge of collapse at one point and could not continue his remarks. Bodyguards rushed to physically support him and whisked him off the stage. During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Mr. Haniya, like many Muslims, observes a dawn-to-dusk fast, which apparently caused his weakness.He re-emerged about 10 minutes later and continued. “Our bodies may get tired, but our souls will not,” Mr. Haniya said as the crowd roared.The United States and the European Union are demanding that the Palestinian government recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept previous Israeli-Palestinian accords.In negotiations, Fatah and Hamas have sought a formula under which a new government would accept such positions, though Hamas as a political party would not be forced to endorse them. But Hamas has repeatedly rejected the Western demands, and Fatah leaders say they see no rationale for joining a unity government that will continue to be ostracized by the Western countries and much of the international community.Israel, which is withholding more than $50 million a month in taxes and customs duties it collects for the Palestinians, refuses to deal with the Hamas government. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert says he is willing to meet with Mr. Abbas, but stresses that there is no prospect for progress until the Palestinians release an Israeli soldier seized by Palestinian militants and taken to Gaza on June 25.Mr. Haniya, meanwhile, said that the Palestinians faced an “unethical and unjust siege led by the United States administration,” and that “many parties, internal and external, colluded in an attempt to force us to surrender.” He noted that even Arab governments had not invited him to visit, aside from Qatar.The Fatah-Hamas friction boiled over into street fighting in Gaza on Sunday and Monday, leaving 10 Palestinians dead and more than 100 wounded in some of the worst internal fighting in recent years. The violence has subsided, but the tension remains.'"
"'06-10-07,'0','Scratched, battered, mottled and sometimes blurred, most of the Saul Levine films showing in the Views From the Avant-Garde series, as part of the New York Film Festival, look as if the artist had dragged them across cement before sharing them with the world. The films have been gathered together in the program “Saul Levine: Notes From the Underground,” a title that plays on twinned ideas: the underlying sense of protest and subversion that animates the work, as well as its historic, symbolic and sometimes even physical place in the larger culture. These are films that proudly sing the subterranean blues.The program includes four films shot over a number of years, beginning in the late 1960’s; the fifth, “Note to Poli,” dates from the early 1980’s. All are silent and short, and were shot on eight-millimeter film, a small-gauge film stock introduced for the home market by Kodak in 1932 and appropriated by artists for many of the same reasons that would have appealed to your grandparents: its relatively inexpensive price, its accessibility and its ease of use. The film frame might have strained the eye when it came time to edit (one frame is about as big as a child’s fingernail), but the small size and light weight of the cameras was liberating and put the tools of production directly into the hands of the artists.The longest Levine film here, at 26 minutes, “New Left Note” (1968-82), opens with the printed words “Less talk more action” and the image of a clenched fist. Mr. Levine was the editor of the radical student newspaper New Left Notes, the national paper of the Students for a Democratic Society, when he shot these images (the date 1982 refers to when he went back to edit), and you feel the urgency of the era pulsing through them from start to finish. With stuttering, lurching rhythms and a hand-held camera, Mr. Levine rushes from one tableau to the next — Richard M. Nixon talking on television; people massed in the streets, raising fists and political placards — as if there were something at stake, and there was.Among Mr. Levine’s most striking strategies is to turn the plastic editing tape that holds or splices the images together into an aesthetic gesture. Commercial film editing is usually meant to go unnoticed, to serve an illusion of seamlessness that in turn serves the narrative. In this work the bubbled and ragged bits of editing tape, which look very much like scraps of hastily applied cellophane, contribute to the artisanal aspect of the individual shots and the work as a whole, as well as its maker’s outsider status. You feel his presence, his body and emotional engagement, in each jagged edit and tremulous shake of the camera: this is truly handmade art, created outside the realm of industrial film production.The ever-ambitious Views From the Avant-Garde includes nine separate programs this year, four dedicated to individual filmmakers, including the always essential Ernie Gehr, and, if this lineup is representative, the less-than-essential Paolo Gioli. If you have never seen any films by the avant-garde pioneer Kenneth Anger, now is the time, since some of his major works were recently restored by the preservation department of the Film and Television Archives of the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Anger shot his landmark film “Fireworks” (1947) in the Los Angeles home of his vacationing parents when, the filmmaker has said, he was 17. Precocious doesn’t begin to describe this beautiful fever dream, which charts both a sexual and an aesthetic awakening by way of some brawny sailors and a sparkler that lights the scene with deeply poetic resonance.Capping Views From the Avant-Garde is Guy Maddin’s latest astonishment, “Brand Upon the Brain!,” which had its world premiere at the recent Toronto International Film Festival. Once again, Mr. Maddin has ransacked film history and his own delirious imagination to create a work like none other: a silently shot film about a man who, on revisiting his childhood home, hurtles into a past where orphan children, coy lesbian lovers and a mad scientist converge. The film features off-screen live music, sound effects and narration (from Isabella Rossellini), as well as the ethereal singing of a man who Mr. Maddin claims is a castrato. Alas, both screenings of the film are sold out, but the stand-by line awaits you.'"
"'06-10-07,'0','THE Bernsteins of Greenburgh paid $46.95 last month for their cable television package and $17.40 for their cable box. HBO was an extra $11.95, and the digital video recorder service rang in at $10. Add $45 for an Internet connection, and taxes and fees, and the family sent exactly $136.85 to Cablevision.For Robert Bernstein, a fan of the New York Giants and of Jon Stewart, it was well worth the price. But Mr. Bernstein, 51, a lawyer and longtime Cablevision customer, has had trouble with reception from time to time. Customer service has not been what he would like, he said, and he could always use a rate cut.Now, relief could be on the way. The Greenburgh Town Council unanimously approved an agreement with Verizon on Sep. 27 that would allow the company to offer cable television service in the unincorporated part of the town, injecting a little competition into the local market.“Having two billion-dollar companies competing for our business, I think, should be a good thing,” Mr. Bernstein said.Cablevision and Verizon are each charging about $40 a month for what they call their standard package of cable service.'"

Pop-Tarts, ice cream and trans-fat-laden chicken nuggets. What’s in? Roasted tofu, whole wheat pizza and Naked 100% Juice Smoothies.And yet the first item to tempt students was not so newfangled after all: milk. Half-pint cartons came in skim, low fat and soy. But t hat all-time favorite, low-fat chocolate milk, had been swept from the lineup. Many children grabbed a bottle of spring water or organic mango juice instead.As the students pushed their plastic foam trays along, a salad bar beckoned with chopped romaine, steamed broccoli, tomato wedges, sweet red pepper, carrots, cucumbers, garbanzo beans, cottage cheese and cold macaroni (made by Barilla Plus, a brand rich in protein and omega-3’s). Perhaps because they loved manipulating the stainless steel tongs, most children helped themselves to at least one item there.'"

But patrons lining up by the hundreds?Only if the food is being served here at the Brien McMahon High School, a closed campus where leaving the grounds to eat is not permitted and a bagged lunch is the only alternative for the school’s 1,600 students.Catering to their captive clientele, the cafeteria’s six food stations offer something for nearly every kind of taste. Unless, that is, the student has a taste for soda and high-calorie desserts.Responding to federal and state school-nutrition requirements, the school’s lunch program is offering more balanced, wholesome meals. Juices are in, sodas are out; fresh fruit in, ice cream and cookies out; low-fat corn chips and baked potato chips in, greasier versions out.Still, you are what you choose to eat. On a recent afternoon, more teenagers were lined up at the pizza and pasta stand than at the soup and salad bar just a few feet away. The barbecued pork and baked ziti pies were the popular items, the one with a broccoli topping much less so. The soup of the day, pasta fagioli, sat virtually untouched, as did a build-your-own salad arrangement in which students can dress up a mix of romaine, iceberg and red cabbage with carrots, celery, sliced cucumber, broccoli, cauliflower, boiled eggs, olives, ham, turkey and American cheese. But at the deli station, a number of students queued up for the Caesar wrap, made of strips of marinated chicken breast, tomato slices, lettuce and Caesar salad dressing wound together in a large white flour tortilla.Whole wheat flour is used in making some pizza crusts, but not on the day I visited; the rolls and buns, though, while predictably spongy, were made in part from whole wheat flour and used for items like the grilled ham and American cheese and the vegetarian burgers.'"

Teachers at the district’s Harley Avenue School took the policy a step further, limiting birthday parties to one a month for first and second graders. Cupcakes are still allowed but must be balanced with healthier treats, like fruit kabobs.On a recent morning, Keri McKenna, a second-grade teacher, held a birthday celebration for three pupils that included a buffet of mini-cupcakes, fruit salad, bagels and cream cheese, orange slices and juice. “The kids are excited to have a big celebration on one day,” she said.In the past, if one child had a birthday on Monday and another on Tuesday, “we would celebrate both days,” Ms. McKenna said. Now, she said, the students “are not eating as much junk so many days in a row.”To take the emphasis off food, Ms. McKenna gives each celebrant a pencil, a birthday certificate and a sticker. On their actual birthdays, the children receive a homework pass.In Patchogue, on Long Island, cupcakes have been banned from birthday parties. But when the Scotch Plains-Fanwood Board of Education, in New Jersey, tried to follow suit, parents complained.'"
"'06-10-07,'0','The wood-pressed cider at Hacklebarney Farm Cider Mill in Chester is like a perfect fall day: clear and crisp. (It’s also pasteurized.)A cup of hot, mulled cider ($1.50) goes well with cider doughnuts, which are made in the bakery housed in the farm’s big red barn. The doughnuts — plain, powdered, cinnamon and pumpkin, when in season — are dense, yet airy and delicious ($6.95 a dozen).The bakery also sells apple dumplings ($2.50), cider twists sprinkled with cinnamon (90 cents) and an assortment of homemade pies: apple, praline pumpkin and pecan, among others. (Prices range from $16.95 to $17.95.) Brownies, breads and other cakes are also available.But before dessert, head outside, where a stand sells hot dogs cooked in cider with apples and served with cider sauerkraut ($3). Open only on weekends, the stand also sells tangy cider baked beans ($1.50) and a pork barbecue sandwich with a cider-vinegar sauce ($5). Grab what you like and head to the lawn, where you can sit and enjoy the foliage.Weekends are busy at this farm and mill, operated by the Jacobson family and now in its sixth generation. On Sundays during the fall, there is often a cider-pressing demonstration in the afternoon (but call to confirm).Apples, both the farm’s own and those from other growers, are sold by the basket ($5.95 for around four pounds, $8.95 for around eight pounds). Although there are hundreds of apple trees, there is no apple picking here. But there is a pick-your-own pumpkin patch and a three-and-a-half-acre corn maze ($7 for adults, $5 for children ages 5 to 12); both are big draws. The farm is open from early September through December.'"

(Hold that thought.) Last yearthe prototype of Hadid’s Aqua Table for Established &Sons fetched a dizzying $296,000 at auction, which may bechump change when Hadid presents her first full line offurniture, which will also be made by Established & Sons,next month. The collection is called Seamless, but it’s aword that could just as easily refer to the relationshipbetween Hadid and the Phillips de Pury & Companyauction house, which is not only showing and selling thelimited-edition work but also commissioned it in the firstplace — casting itself in the role of agent as well. TheSeamless exhibition, from Nov. 27 to Dec. 15 at Phillips’sChelsea headquarters, represents the most ambitiousexample yet of its recent foray into this new hybrid form:events that the auction house likens to art-market comingoutparties or mini-retrospectives. Until now it has featureda mix of exclusive albeit existing work by artists like RonArad, Ettore Sottsass, Mario Testino and Rolf Sachs. ‘‘Thisis part of a very thought-out and concerted effort to offermore services to our clients,’’ Alexander Payne, Phillips’sdirector of design, says, referring to the insatiable collectors of contemporary art and design whom the house has been cultivating for more than a decade. The Seamless collection promises to take full-scale advantage of Phillips’s massive gallery space while indulging in the fast-and-fluid curves that characterize Hadid’s buildings. A super-high-gloss chair, shelf system, cabinet, lounger and stool will each beavailable in editions of 8 to 12 and carry price tags that will no doubt reflect Hadid’s starchitect status. ‘‘She’s at the forefront of her architecture career,’’ Payne says. ‘‘But if one looks at her furniture output, this is really the beginning of her game.’’ After the sale, Established & Sons will likely work with Hadid on future projects, but Phillips will shift its focus to expanding into yet another business role: that of an agency. It plans to announce an initial roster of artists and designers early next year.She’s a Pritzker-prize-winning architect who’s designedGrinning stick-on monsters, pixelated landscapes from video games, naughty toiles: youngdesigners are embracing wallpaper as a medium for unbridled graphic experimentation,and no subject matter is too strange.

"'06-10-08,'0','JAKARTA, Indonesia, Oct. 7 — The acquittal of an Indonesian pilot convicted in the murder of one of the country’s most respected human rights advocates has unleashed a storm of protest from critics of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his government.The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that there was insufficient evidence to support a lower court’s verdict that the pilot, Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto, had murdered Munir Said Thalib, a human rights lawyer who investigated abuses by the Indonesian military.Mr. Munir, 38, died from an arsenic overdose when he flew on the national airline, Garuda, from Jakarta to Amsterdam in September 2004.Mr. Pollycarpus, a pilot with Garuda, was a passenger in business class during the first leg of the flight, from Jakarta to Singapore, and had arranged an upgrade for Mr. Munir, so that they sat in the same cabin for 90 minutes. An autopsy found that Mr. Munir, who died when the plane was over Europe, had swallowed three times more arsenic than his body could tolerate.The criticisms of the government’s handling of the case were directed in an unusually personal way at President Yudhoyono, who has been mentioned among the news media here as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize because of his work promoting a peace accord between the Indonesian Army and separatists in Aceh Province. Mr. Yudhoyono, the first directly elected president of Indonesia since the fall of ex-President Suharto, a dictator, in 1998, took office two years ago.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','Other towns have not been as loyal to the welcome arches they built way back when. Though they sprang up around the country with the advent of motor travel, most have been razed or moved away from traffic, according to the book “Arch Rivals: Ninety Years of Welcome Arches in Small-Town America,” by Bernard Winn.An arch built in Columbus, Neb., topped with “City of Power and Progress,” is gone, as is one in Rock Springs, Wyo., that said “Home of Rock Springs Coal.” But Modesto, Calif., still welcomes visitors with an arch that says “Water, Wealth, Contentment, Health,” and Afton, Wyo., has an arch made of 2,500 elk antlers.But back to Stuart, whose arch never witnessed much glory after the Depression set in, the canal plan languished and the humbled town drew in its boundaries. Though the arch spanned what had been the main route to Miami and myriad travelers passed under it in the 1920’s and 30’s, that changed when Route 1 and Interstate 95 were built.The cross-state canal became more bane than boon when the state started using it to flush polluted overflow from Lake Okeechobee out to sea.“Everyone wanted that canal,” said Sandra Thurlow, a local historian, “and yet it has caused so many problems.”Stuart remained unheralded, and the neighborhood where the arch sits, now an unincorporated patch of Martin County called Rio, became a landscape of mobile homes and snowbirds, with a smattering of peacocks from the nearby estate of Frances Langford, an actress known for singing “I’m in the Mood for Love.”But locals continued to care for the arch, painting it red, white and blue in 1976 and hot pink in 1994. Mrs. Preast and others fought successfully to get it on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. In a letter supporting the application, one resident wrote, “My heart leaps every time I see the arch.”To see the arch today is not quite to understand why its creator, an architect named Nat Hodgdon, promised it would “tell the traveler of the beauties which this part of the country holds in store for him.” It is pale and plain. It stands near a shuttered Twistee Treat stand shaped like an ice cream cone, a barbershop advertising “senior haircuts” for $5 and an audiologist’s office.Mrs. Preast is hoping that like the arch, the Rio neighborhood will get a fresh start. There are plans for new housing and commercial space, for more sidewalks and a town center where a ragged trailer park now stands. But since the arch will force the road, only 30 feet wide, to stay small, the area will never be overdeveloped, she said.Unlike its neighboring counties to the north and south — St. Lucie, one of the fastest growing in the country, and Palm Beach, already teeming — Martin County has remained relatively uncluttered. Buildings cannot exceed four stories and there are fewer than two housing units per acre on average, said Doug Smith, a county commissioner.“We are different and we’ll stay that way,” Mr. Smith said.Mr. Smith said the Florida Department of Transportation had wanted to move the arch so it could widen the road. But a few years ago, the agency agreed to swap the stretch of road the arch is on for a piece of county road nearby.The restoration, overseen by an architectural firm in Key West, should be done late this month. David Salay, one of the architects, said the arch would be stronger than before, but with the same type of bronze lettering, terra cotta tiles and twin flagpoles on top. The arch will be painted its original uncatchy beige, but at night, new floodlights will make it glow.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','In the Kelo case, the Supreme Court ruled that government could transfer private land from one owner to another for the sake of economic development. But the court made a point of saying states were free to change their laws.Even opponents of the ballot measures concede that support for them appears strong in public opinion polls. They predict years of court fights if the measures pass.“This thing is an abomination, the way it’s written, the way it’s being sold,” Nils Ribi, a City Council member in nearby Sun Valley who opposes the Idaho measure.Supporters of the ballot efforts in the West — often called “Kelo-plus” — say they want to stop so-called regulatory takings, the idea that government effectively takes private property when zoning laws limit how it can be used.Opponents say the regulatory-takings initiatives are essentially a ruse, that they are trying to exploit anger over the Kelo decision and eminent domain to roll back zoning regulations that are critical to controlling growth, protecting the environment and preserving property values.The more far-reaching proposals in the West — in Idaho, Arizona, California and Washington State — are citizens’ initiatives supported by signature petitions, and they are often supported financially and logistically by national libertarian groups.This House Is My Home, a group based in Boise that is sponsoring the Idaho measure, Proposition 2, is among groups in several states that have received strong financial help from Fund for Democracy, headed by Howard S. Rich, the New York real estate investor who is chairman of the libertarian group Americans for Limited Government. As of late June, Fund for Democracy had given at least $237,000 to This House Is My Home, about two-thirds of the money raised by the group. The next filing deadline is Oct. 10.“We are essentially a ‘networking station’ that brings together grass-roots activists, donors and community leaders who share a common interest,” John Tillman, president of Americans for Limited Government, said in an e-mail message. “In this case, that common interest is in restoring property rights for the average citizen.”Affluent outsiders have been drawn to Idaho in recent decades, lured by technology jobs, mountain recreation and abundant sunshine. Boise, the capital, has boomed, as has Sun Valley, where newcomers from California build second homes not far from ranchers who herd sheep over the Sawtooth Mountains. About two-thirds of Idaho land is under federal control, and frustration runs deep in rural areas with newcomers who, after buying their piece of paradise, try to restrict land use further in the name of preservation and environmentalism.“Katie’s family, my family, they did this great job of developing this country,” said Rob Struthers, 59, Ms. Breckenridge’s partner in life and work. “Now all these people come in and say, ‘Wow, what a beautiful place.’ But they don’t trust us to keep it that way. Instead of rewarding us, they’re penalizing us.”In an era of sun-splashed subdivisions, land here can be a farmer’s greatest asset. Mr. Ribi, the councilman, expressed some sympathy for farmers who have been “down-zoned” under a new county plan.But Mr. Ribi, a venture capitalist, is trying to galvanize opposition to the initiative by tapping the same independent streak that may make some anti-government Idahoans interested in the measure.“These are guys on the right wing who always want local control and all of a sudden they’re saying let’s let these guys from Washington, D.C., and outside think tanks have control,” Mr. Ribi said. “That’s why I think we’ve lost perspective.”If the Supreme Court ruling in the Connecticut case inflamed passions for property rights, the initiatives in the Western states are more directly rooted in events in Oregon. In 2004, Oregon voters passed a measure that allowed property owners to file claims that zoning restrictions had hurt their property value. That law, known as Measure 37, requires government to either pay for the lost value or waive the zoning rules if an owner makes a successful claim.About 2,400 claims totaling more than $5.6 billion have been filed since the measure was upheld in court this spring, according to the Oregon Department of Land and Conservation Development. “Not a penny” has been paid to property owners, said Sheila A. Martin, director of the Institute of Portland Metropolitan Studies at Portland State University. Local governments, lacking money to pay, have simply waived the zoning rules.But while Measure 37 grew out of frustration with Oregon’s famously strict zoning rules, Idaho does not have such comprehensive restrictions. Even if some rural landowners are frustrated with new zoning rules, said Stephanie Witt, director of the Center for Public Policy at Boise State University, “It’s not like people are rebelling against this really restrictive growth management law.”The Castle Coalition, a property rights group that has fought for eminent domain overhauls, does not list a single “eminent domain abuse” case in Idaho on its Web site. It calls Idaho “one of the best states in the country for protecting owners from eminent domain abuse.”John Eaton, government affairs director for the Idaho Association of Realtors, said the initiative “blows up the stability that we have right now.”“We’re the property rights people but we’re not going to support this,” he said. “This is crazy.”Ms. Breckenridge, dusty boots on the mat by the door, was not ready to predict how the vote might go up in swank Sun Valley or down in urban Boise. Closer to home, however, she was confident.“Everybody that’s connected to the land is going to vote for it,” she said, “because there’s an anger, a rising anger.”'"
"'06-10-08,'0','At a bar, they usually have one band or one D.J. doing one thing. They won’t have, like, stilt walkers breathing fire in a courtyard. Clubs have a $25 entrance and $9 drinks and thugs trying to dance with pretty girls.That’s not what my parties are about at all. There’s no V.I.P. room. Everyone just gets sweaty on the dance floor. And we go much later, to 10 in the morning. I build concepts into events that comment on who we are in the city: political, poetic, deeply engaged and having wickedly good times.In 2000 in the middle of summer, I paid $5,000 for a one-night rental of a 15,000-square-foot brick loft on the ninth floor of a building in Dumbo. There were 86 artists involved. There were hundreds of people in the street sending up fireworks and dancing with this kind of anarchist marching band.Then imagine going up nine floors in a massive freight elevator, crushed in with 40 people, hearing music get louder and louder as you rise. The doors open, and it’s this huge, gaping space with a D.J. playing over a massive sound system for 1,500 people, and everyone in the elevator bursts out, cheering and screaming and running. There was this manic, anything-can-happen energy. I was in completely over my head, but somehow it worked.We hadn’t seen parties of that scale very often at that time within the underground. There had been large raves, but this wasn’t a rave. It was something else. In New York, something that’s novel and interesting and tight gets rewarded.Little did I know that you can only fly so close to the sun. In July 2002, I somehow stumbled onto renting the power plant in Long Island City, Queens. It was a historic building — the first coal power plant in New York — and a famous icon of the Long Island City skyline. It had 30,000 feet on each of three floors, and these 20-story huge black smokestacks coming off the top. This space was epic — and a complete death trap.Somehow I convinced myself and some other people that this was a place where we could do the biggest event, like, ever. Why not? We had a $70,000 budget, all on credit cards. It was going to be Friday and Saturday night for two weekends. We had dozens and dozens of underground artists from all over the country.The night of the first event, the police came and said, “This isn’t going to happen.” We’re like, “Look, we have all our permits, blah, blah.” At this point, we were so drained. Five days straight of no sleep to set up the space, trying to get it ready to have thousands of people coming through, getting the word out on the streets — and word was out. The police came back with the Fire Department, the cabaret office, the Buildings Department, the mayor’s office, everybody in suits, full regalia, gold badges. And everybody was screaming, “Where’s this permit, that permit?”What happened was not only that that event was insanely beyond us, but New York had changed. It used to take an incredible amount of energy to get a landlord to rent you a space, and once you got past that hump, you could just throw a party. But there was a cultural turn where these events weren’t supposed to be happening anymore.Now, we look for potentially legal spaces where you can get a temporary permit. We’re still underground. We’re not looking for clubs, bars, things with a license, because we want to create our own atmosphere and do it our way. So you look for a place with proper fire exits, sprinkler systems, where no neighbors are going to complain and a friendly police precinct we can communicate with, to get our liquor permits approved and make it as safe as we can. Or something that’s going to be really under the radar.'"

To be sure, the Republican leadership under George Bush is so bad that Democrats might be able to win majorities in both the House and the Senate with nothing more than this simple refrain. But such a victory would be hollow and short-lived.The incredible opportunity before us is to build a new majority for change. This is not a matter of pushing the party to the left or right so much as it is one of embracing the evident hunger among the American people to set the nation on a new course. President Bush and the Republicans represent staying the course; Democrats represent changing the course.Bold change on Iraq, energy policy and health care will carry the day for Democrats in November.

"'06-10-08,'0','Is Not the SolutionThe ban on cellphones in public schools is unsafe and counterproductive. Many students travel long distances to and from school every day. During their commutes, students need to be able to contact their parents or someone who could assist them in an emergency.Contrary to certain claims, the cellphone ban will not create a better learning environment in schools. In fact, when students feel that School Safety Agents are there to confiscate the very items that give students a sense of security, students may be reluctant to go to them when there really is an emergency.Students who irresponsibly use their cellphones in school should face serious consequences. However, it is not right to punish students who keep their cellphones off and out of sight. This is one issue we at the New York City Student Union, a coalition of students from public high schools all over the city, are working to address.By neglecting to enforce laws against illegal advertising, we are selling New York’s soul. Quality-of-life advocates have long labored to maintain a balance between commercial elements and more desirable ones like quality architecture, landmarks, thoughtfully designed street furniture, public plazas and sculpture. This branding trend negates all that, as the gods of marketing win the contest for our visual attention, and the taxpayers lose.Allowing advertisers to claim territory like feral cats sends the message that nothing in the public panorama is sacred, and the precedent is dangerous. Where there is no room for a large ad today, there are bound to be stickers, graffiti or scratchiti, and even City Council members have begun to plaster their own names on municipal garbage cans.'"

I am afraid that assured destruction may not dissuade radical Islamic militants from using a nuclear weapon or device. The focus must remain on preventing Iran from ever obtaining such a weapon.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','Q. Most chief executives’ compensation is linked to share price. Is that the wrong criterion?A. It could be. Or it could be that it’s not based on long-enough-term results. In our case, the midterm incentive was new to us. It is a payment on the absolute creation of shareholder value. That is based on a sustained four-year performance, and our company has a long history of sometimes doing well for a short period of time and then losing it all. For example, we lost more than $2 billion in shareholder value from 1999 to 2003. That was more than twice what we had earned in the entire 1990’s.Now the new program says that if we lose a lot of shareholder value, then we never get the pay, even though it was fully approved. It’s not paid out until we earn it over a rolling four-year period. This helps us think about doing the right thing for the long term.Q. If your compensation were at risk of declining, would you go to the board and say: “Keep me whole. Don’t let me get hurt”?A. No. First of all, I don’t go to the board and ask them or talk to them about my compensation. I do not know what is presented to the compensation committee in advance. I don’t meet with them. They decide and tell me.Q. How has Deere withstood the erosion of Midwest manufacturing?A. We made the decision to invest over $100 million in our Waterloo, Iowa, operations, specifically to allow us to dramatically improve the performance of that operation. Otherwise it couldn’t have met the targets we had in mind. I’m talking about bringing down the flow-through, in terms of what is needed to get a tractor completed, from, say, 45 days to 7 days, to cut the amount of space that’s involved in half and to improve the quality. We’ve invested additionally in Davenport and Dubuque, Iowa.At the same time, we’ve also broadened our presence around the world. We now own a complete factory in India where we make transmissions, diesel engines and complete tractors, which we sell in India and other parts of the world as well as the United States. We have factories in China that we now own 100 percent of. We’re building a new tractor factory in Brazil right now. We moved diesel engine production from Dubuque down to Mexico. Where we can’t be competitive here, we will move operations, after rigorous analysis, to where we can be competitive.Q. Do those investments offshore really support your domestic operations and the overall American standard of living?A. The answer unequivocally is yes. We talk about this a lot. Our customers’ standards of living and that of the people in our communities — it’s not just our employees that we talk about, or just our customers, it’s all our communities — their lives are enhanced as global trade improves. The wonderful thing about business is that it is not necessarily a win-lose proposition. It can be win-win. In our case, if we just served people here in this country, we would not be able to do it economically. We wouldn’t deliver the finest in technology.Our customers end up exporting a great deal. So by investing worldwide, we improve the lives of people in other parts of the world, which in turn helps us improve our lives. Q. But isn’t it true that on an emotional level, a majority of Americans probably don’t buy that argument?A. That may be true. But just take the people who make combine harvesters in East Moline, Ill., or tractors in Waterloo, Iowa. Many of those products are being exported to other parts of the world. They realize how important that is.'"

Seniors who indulge, a Yale study finds, are healthier than those who don’t because they’re engaging in social activity.Even getting angry has been getting some good press lately, at least in Finland. One self-styled therapist there is offering “anger venting” classes to offset repressed emotions in a country that suffers from a high level of depression and suicide.On television, meanwhile, Showtime has two series that are adding to the good-bad confusion. One show, “Weeds,” is about a lovable pot-dealing mother. The other, “Dexter,” is about a lovable serial killer. He only kills bad people, of course.Nothing is black and white anymore. And the solid ground about what’s good for you has become as wobbly as mercury, which we now know makes healthy tuna and swordfish as much a risk as farmed salmon — frequently contaminated, but rich in omega oils.You may as well have a steak. Maybe Woody Allen had it right in “Sleeper.” After being frozen for 200 years, he wakes up to find that steak, among other things, has become a health food. Sounds a lot like what Atkins dieters have already discovered.What else? Bicycling (exercise!) is good unless you’re a man worried about the increased incidence of prostate cancer and impotence among cyclists. Surfing, so meditative and aerobic, can be bad if you surf in California after heavy rains, when the ocean is polluted with fecal bacteria that cause eye infections, liver damage and diarrhea.What about being a congressional page? That used to be good. What is it now?Perhaps all this is why the title of Steven Johnson’s “Everything Bad Is Good For You” struck a note when it was published last spring. Around the same time that the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that the overweight (but not obese) actually outlive the thin, Mr. Johnson was convincingly hypothesizing that video games and TV — both increasingly complex and conceptual in their scope — help rather than hinder mental development in children. He suggests that what parents always thought of as “cognitive junk food” may be more like the equivalent of green vegetables.But that was before spinach became a menace. It’s enough to drive any well-meaning educator or mother mad.Especially after they had to hear, not long before the spinach scare, that even seemingly salubrious fruit juice is contributing to the national obesity epidemic.“We have healthy snacks at our school,” said Joy Franjola, who teaches the fourth grade at Public School 87 in Manhattan. “But today I gave out apples and wondered if they’re safe. Who’s to say what’s good anymore? At least we know French fries aren’t made with trans fats.”Joanna Molloy, who writes the Rush & Molloy column in The Daily News and who has an 8-year-old son, said: “When chicken fingers are safer than spinach, you know the kids have won.” Her son defends chocolate by saying it’s an antioxidant.“The irony is inescapable,” added Kim Chirles, an Upper West Side mother who used to make her own baby food. “So I’ve decided to feed my children at McDonald’s.”Follow it up with some TV and chocolate and call it a healthy night.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','The bunion display inspired Ms. Cortez, 28, to bemoan her shin splints — a new phenomenon generated by the flat tennis shoes she wears as Diana Morales, the struggling actress who cannot summon the talent to portray an ice cream cone in her acting class. Not to be out-ailmented, Mr. Tam, 24, who plays Paul, the actor afraid to tell his parents he performs in drag, said his quads were “holding on for dear life.”The waitress appeared with appetizers: chicken satay, a cheese plate, smoked salmon and Vietnamese spring rolls. The dancers grazed.While Mr. Tam and Ms. Cortez discussed their affinity for video games, Ms. Goldyn yawned and checked her eye makeup in the mirrored walls. Onstage, her black eyeliner and slinky confidence make her seem older than her 20 years, and this carried over to her offstage persona. Until she mentioned that she still lived with her mother, in New Jersey.After drinks, she’d be heading off to a rendezvous with the 9:30 bus to Parsippany. Mr. Tam had plans for a late dinner downtown. Ms. Cortez wore a flirtatious skirt and sparkly heels for a date with her husband at home. (He had been out of town.)The three commiserated over every performer’s between-jobs dilemma: do some traveling or sit by the phone and wait? “It’s like an abusive relationship,” Ms. Cortez said. “They don’t call you, then the minute you leave, they call.” These days, their lives are basically performing and recuperating.During rehearsals, they were given a secret memo written years ago by Michael Bennett, the show’s original choreographer. The memo has 15 points, the first of which is to make audience members forget they are at a show. Accordingly, “Chorus Line” has no intermission, the orchestra members are unseen (they play in the basement), all to convey the sense that the performers are merely auditioning.Just as the actors onstage reveal their secrets and fantasies, in between bites the actors shared their dreams ... of being taller.“I always wanted to be Cyd Charisse,” said Ms. Cortez, who wears heels for a reason. “I had long arms, but it never happened.”Mr. Tam, who is petite, said: “I always thought I’d be taller than I am. I’m the tallest in my family.”“I’m the shortest in my family.” Ms. Goldyn said. “Am I 5-4? I’ve lied so many times on my résumé.”'"

"'06-10-08,'0','Q I am a shareholder in a co-op in Bergen County, N.J. Our board recently set up an executive committee that excluded just one board member. This director differs with the others about converting our building from a co-op to a condo. As a shareholder, I want people of differing views to have a say. Are the board’s actions legal?A Donald M. Onorato, a co-op and condo lawyer in Hackensack, N.J., said that while the board has the legal right under the nonprofit corporation statute to appoint an executive committee, it appears that the board is punishing the one member who, the writer says, disagrees with the rest of the members.To that extent, Mr. Onorato said, the board’s actions may not be in the best interests of the co-op. At the same time, he said, an executive committee has no power of its own to set policy for the co-op.“The activities of a corporation are governed by its entire board, not a select group of board members,” Mr. Onorato said. So, he said, from a practical perspective, the board member who is being excluded from the executive committee is still going to have a voice, and a vote, at board meetings.And, he added, the conversion from co-op to condo will most likely require a vote of at least two-thirds of the shareholders, so eventually every owner will have a say.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','Alternatively, you can easily work your way through college, since a clerical worker can earn $25,000 and blue-collar workers even more; it just takes longer to graduate. And if you are a member of this oppressed class, upon graduation, whenever it occurs, you will have proven both to yourself and prospective employers that you have the tenacity to succeed.It is not a deficient educated talent pool that drives employers from New York, but outrageous taxes, which compound the burden of living here for both employers and employees, driving both jobs and our children out of New York.Our clear and present danger is not North Carolina or China; it’s the politicians in Albany and their spending habits.Who Should Serve on School Boards?A letter regarding the District 15 school board posited that one of the requisites for running for a seat on the board should be having a child in the public schools (“Bitter Disagreement Over School Boards,” Sept. 24).Not only is the writer proposing a prohibition keeping parents of private school children from holding a seat on the school boards, but he is also eliminating parents of future public school students as well as past public school children from sitting on the board.If we all must pay taxes to support the work of each school board, we should all be entitled to participate in the school board’s work if we win election to that board.Michael Winerip’s Oct. 1 article about his parenting experience, “Dr. Spock He’s Not, but He’s Willing to Listen,” is an amusing article by a layman. But most of us need all the wisdom, patience and understanding we can get in order to deal with our parenting responsibilities and the challenges of family life.In light of the magnitude and number of concerns that beset families, articles with advice from professionals experienced in child development would be a valuable addition to The Times. Let’s not forget the limited availability of placements for children who would benefit from pre-K and pre-school education; the rapidly growing number of children with developmental disabilities, especially the 1 out of 166 children with autism; the challenge to include children with disabilities in regular classes; the need for both parents to work; and the recent killings and use of corporal punishment in some schools, just to name a few.The dedicated teachers and administrators highlighted in “Testing, Testing ... but What?” (Oct. 1) are committed to their students, but by spending enormous amounts of energy focused on coaching to raise test levels, the true essence of education — fostering a lifelong love of learning, knowledge acquisition, inquiry and questioning, logical thinking and imagination — seems all but lost.Laura AltshulNew HavenThe writer is admissions director at the Foote School.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','To watch the way Democrats in New Jersey simply sloughed off a recent Republican package of ethics proposals, one would think official wrongdoing in the state was nothing to be alarmed about.Citing the state’s reputation for corruption in government, Assembly Republicans unveiled a reform package and asked that the Legislature vote on it before the end of this month. Democrats retorted that the Republicans were motivated by politics.Of course they were. But in a state rocked by one scandal after another, who cares? The important thing is to enact meaningful reforms, regardless of who or what inspired them. The pressure of an upcoming election may be exactly what is needed to get legislators to vote for tough measures.Among the proposals were a flat-out ban on pay-to-play — the system in which people make campaign contributions in the hope of getting government contracts or jobs. The package would also ban dual office holding, require jail time for public officials convicted of wrongdoing and impose a tougher ethics code for public officials.All these measures are needed as well as one other: a prohibition against “wheeling” — a practice that allows a contributor in one town or county to evade rules against pay-to-play by channeling money to an organization or candidate in another part of the state.Assembly Majority Leader Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat, described the Republicans’ proposals as a “warmed-over stew of existing legislative measures,” and maybe they are. But that’s only because the Democratic majority has failed to approve them. Just because a measure has been around a while does not mean it lacks merit.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','With all the noise about Connecticut’s races for United States senator and governor, it is hard to remember that there are four other significant statewide contests this year: for state comptroller, secretary of the state, treasurer and attorney general. The campaigns thus far have been low-key, and because the incumbents are all well known, the challengers are not given much chance of winning. They must fight for serious attention, not just votes.That is regrettable. This is still a democracy, after all. Nobody should be anointed to serve in public office. Elections should be earned after vigorous debate that tests issues and ideas, which in turn makes for more responsive officials and more thoughtful public policies. But that is not happening as it should this year.Consider the race for attorney general. Important issues that have been raised in this campaign are not getting the attention they deserve because everyone is taking the outcome for granted.Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic incumbent, is running for a fifth term. He is popular and is seen as the odds-on favorite. But his Republican opponent, State Representative Robert Farr, is waging a good campaign. A lawyer whose practice has focused on family law, and a 25-year veteran of the legislature, Mr. Farr has focused on the need to make parents accountable when they owe child support payments.Mr. Farr points out that when Connecticut overhauled its welfare laws, many single parents, nearly all of them women, had to get jobs and could no longer depend on the state for support. But the state did not do enough to ensure that fathers supported their children financially. Mr. Farr says that there is an incredible $1.6 billion in uncollected child support here, more than the amount collected annually in state corporate taxes. The issue involves 110,000 cases, although, he says, parents in about 70,000 cases have made some payment.Mr. Blumenthal disputes these figures, saying that many of those cases are inactive and some go back to the 1970’s. He says the issue is complicated because it involves three state bureaucracies, and he has over the years proposed laws to make it easier to collect child support payments.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','With regard to your review of Charles Wright’s new volume of poems, “Scar Tissue” (Sept. 17): I cannot bring myself to believe that I am the only serious follower of contemporary poetry who is getting sick of reading reviews by young literary nonentities posing as Randall Jarrell, and with cheap and superficial sarcasm standing in for genuine wit quoting out of context and generally manipulating the work of a master like Wright for the purpose of proving some artistic or prosodic theory of their own, usually one that has little or nothing to do with the book under discussion.Wright is one of a very small handful of poets widely considered to have made, over decades, a significant contribution to the body of American literature in our time, and he long ago earned the right — regardless of any particular reviewer’s aesthetics — to be discussed, even to be disliked, with some degree of thoughtful reverence, as opposed to the still stylishly ironical and arrogant condescension to which even The New York Times Book Review unfortunately remains far too hospitable. Taking up space in a relatively brief discussion of a serious book to speculate, for example, on the state of the author’s keyboard (“I picture his comma key worn down to a nub and the period filmed with dust”) is simply pathetic, and makes me wish I could take that sharp stick the reviewer fantasizes poking Charles Wright with and giving him a good spanking — proof, perhaps, that stupid writing produces a stupid state of mind, in this reader and I suspect in others, just as surely as fair and profound writing tends to produce a serious and objective one.I have a suggestion: Why not assign beginners to review other beginners, and when dealing with the work of proven contemporary masters like Wright, take the trouble to enlist the mind of someone capable of writing intelligent prose?The writer won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 2004.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','A couple of years later, Jerry McMorris, the Rockies’ managing partner at the time, acknowledged that the team had made a mistake by dismissing Baylor. In the eight seasons since his dismissal, the Rockies have finished in fourth or fifth place every year.When Baylor moved on to the Cubs, they finished in last place his first season, then improved by 23 victories and finished in third place, five games short of tying for first, but they won the same number of games (88) as the N.L. East champion, Atlanta. The Cubs, however, started poorly in Baylor’s third season, and he was fired with a 34-49 record that put the Cubs in fifth place.Baker was hired the next year to replace Baylor, and the Cubs won the division title. They backslid in each subsequent season, finishing third, fourth and this season, sixth.In other words, the team that fired Baylor haven’t exactly enjoyed raging success since.Baylor last worked in baseball in 2005 as the hitting coach of the Seattle Mariners. He has also served as a coach with Milwaukee, Atlanta, St. Louis and the Mets. He interviewed for the Philadelphia job two years ago, but it went to Charlie Manuel.“I had an opportunity, I thought, to be Frank Robinson’s bench coach this year,” Baylor said, “but it didn’t happen. I don’t know why.”Three years ago, Baylor suffered from multiple myeloma, or cancer of the blood plasma cells, but he underwent a stem cell transplant and is completely healthy.“The past year, I traveled around the country with Eric Davis for cancer awareness,” he said. “We went to some ballparks and I saw some old friends.”Now he will wait for calls from clubs seeking a manager. If someone wants to hire him as a coach, he will consider that job, too.It was mentioned to Baylor that he is competing with his friend, Baker, for a job. “I’m in competition with a lot of guys,” he said.This concept may be difficult to comprehend from this distance, and even the team it involves would most likely be skeptical. But the Texas Rangers will win the World Series next year.This is not based on the kind of reasoning that pegged the Chicago Cubs a year in advance as the winner of this year’s World Series. In that one, the Cubs (1908) were going to follow the Boston Red Sox (1918 to 2004) and the Chicago White Sox (1917 to 2005) as teams that won the World Series after many decades of not winning it.No, there is a much more solid basis for saying the Rangers will win a year from now. They ensured that development by firing their manager, Buck Showalter, last week.In 1995, the Yankees fired Showalter (he has maintained he quit). The next year they won the World Series. In 2000, the Arizona Diamondbacks fired Showalter, the only manager they had had. The next year, they won the World Series.Teams should be lining up to hire Showalter as their next manager so they can fire him and win the World Series.With slightly more than three weeks left in the season, Ryan Howard, Philadelphia’s sensation, seemed a cinch to become the sixth player in history to reach the 60-homer plateau.Howard, a left-hand-hitting 26-year-old, was going to join Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Roger Maris and Babe Ruth.But the season is over, and Howard doesn’t have 60 home runs. The final numbers show that Howard hit 58 home runs, tying the 10th-highest season total. What happened to 60?After he slugged 24 home runs in a 42-game stretch from July 28 through Sept. 8 and raising his total to an eye-opening 56, Howard hit only 2 home runs in his last 20 games.In that 42-game period, Howard went no more than three consecutive games without hitting a homer. In the 20-game stretch, though, he had a drought of seven games between Nos. 56 and 57 and hit no home runs in his last eight games.The slowdown was not the result of a hitting slump. In that same 20-game stretch, he batted .328 and raised his season average to .313 from .311. The biggest difference was probably the way he was pitched. He was walked 27 times in the last 20 games, compared with the 17 walks he received in his previous 20 games.Frank Robinson’s dismissal as manager of the Washington Nationals was the most bizarre firing in memory. On the day the Nationals fired him, they also honored him. The highlight of the ceremony before the Nationals’ final game was a lengthy farewell speech by Robinson.“No matter what people think, I’m not retiring,” the 71-year-old Robinson said in his valedictory. He acknowledged, “I’m past my time for managing,” but added, “There’s a lot I want to accomplish for those who come after me. I’m looking for people who are qualified for skilled positions in other organizations in baseball. I have a lot of work to do.”He was talking about minority hiring, about which he has long been outspoken. “I’ve always tried to give back,” he said. “I’ve always tried to help people in baseball; I’m going to continue to do that.”Robinson played and managed more than 5,000 games in his 51-year career. He said he had no regrets, didn’t feel cheated that he retired as a player shy of 3,000 hits (2,943) and 600 home runs (586), and got the chance he asked for.“I’ve never done anything harder than what I have to do now, that’s to say goodbye,” he concluded.A woman in the stands held up a sign: “Here’s to you Mr. Robinson.”The Mets surrounded Robinson, shook his hand, embraced him. Then they went out and hit him with the 1,176th loss of his career.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','MUTUAL funds have been accused of creating big problems for investors by using out-of-date stock prices when calculating their per-share asset values. Perhaps the most serious of the contentions is that, because of stale prices, day traders have the chance to buy and sell mutual funds profitably, at the expense of long-term shareholders.A new study, however, finds that these profits have little to do with stale pricing. Instead, the culprit appears to be the tendency for individual stocks, on any given day, to move in the same direction they moved the previous day. For the most part, the funds themselves are innocent victims of this short-term stock momentum.The study, “Stale or Sticky Stock Prices? Non-Trading, Predictability and Mutual Fund Returns,” was written by Marshall E. Blume and Donald B. Keim, both of whom are finance professors at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. It has been circulating as an academic working paper since early September; a version is at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=928480.Mutual funds are attractive to day traders because of the funds’ short-term predictability. After all, there is sometimes a high probability that a particular fund will go up or down the next trading day. This likelihood has existed for many funds in many different years, Professor Keim said in an interview.Many analysts have assumed that stale prices cause this pattern. With rare exceptions, a mutual fund will base its per-share value at the end of a particular trading day on the prices at which each of its holdings last traded. If some of those last trades occurred several hours before the market’s close, that fund’s per-share value wouldn’t reflect all of that day’s news — which would be fully reflected only in the fund’s price the next day. That would mean that a fund that goes up today has an above-average chance of going up tomorrow, too; by the same token, a loser today is more likely than not to be a loser tomorrow as well.'"
"'06-10-08,'0','What gives? Clearly, there is an emerging consensus among economists — right and left — that the nation would be better off, geopolitically and economically, if Americans used less gasoline. “Given the role that imported oil plays today, you can’t continue to be a responsible economist and not talk about ways to reduce that dependence,” Mr. Samwick said. “If you are concerned about the external consequences of imported oil, then you should raise the cost of it.” And free-market economists view a higher gas tax as a more elegant solution than, for example, raising auto efficiency standards.Others chalk up the rising chorus for a higher gas tax to a growing unity among economists across the political spectrum on the deleterious effects of global warming. “The U.S. has reasonable arguments for not signing the Kyoto treaty, but we need to propose some other measure that will help reduce emissions,” said Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and professor of economics at Harvard. A sharply higher tax on gas would help reduce consumption, and hence emissions.But as much as Republican-leaning economists like Messrs. Greenspan, Mankiw and Samwick may think that it’s a good idea, the Republican politicians who control the levers of power in Washington think that it’s an awfully bad one, even though gas taxes in the United States are far lower than those in other industrialized countries. According to the International Energy Agency, American gas taxes in August were a mere 40 cents a gallon on average, compared with $4.24 a gallon in Britain and $3.99 in Germany.The last increase in the federal gas tax was enacted as part of the so-called deficit reduction act of 1993, a package of spending cuts and tax hikes that didn’t receive a single Republican vote in Congress. And because President Bush and his top political advisers are known to be adamantly opposed to any increase in the gas tax, economic advisers haven’t pushed it much. “We didn’t have policy discussions about raising the gas tax,” Mr. Samwick recalls of his time in the White House.THIS highlights a professional hazard faced by academic economists who serve in presidential administrations. They must act as team players who value the overall success of the administration — even if they don’t agree with all of its policies. As a result, economists must often stow some of their policy ideas in an intellectual coat check at the White House gates, where they can be reclaimed upon return to private life.In the 1990’s, during the less-disciplined Clinton years, it was relatively common for economic policy makers and advisers to publicly disagree — sometimes loudly — about issues ranging from health care to welfare reform.“We were allowed to advocate for our ideas, both inside and to some degree outside,” said Brad DeLong, who served as deputy assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department from 1993 to 1995 and is now a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. “But that’s not the way the current system works.”When it comes to economic policy, the Bush administration has proved itself to be an intellectually regimented environment, less like the Harvard economics department and more like the Harvard crew team.'"

"'06-10-09,'1','A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers on Monday.JOURNALIST, GOVERNMENT CRITIC MURDERED: The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, possibly the strongest journalistic voice in opposition to the government of President Vladimir V. Putin and Russia’s war in Chechnya led all the major newspapers today. Ms. Politkovskaya, a contributor to the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, was shot three or four times in the stairwell of her apartment in Moscow on Saturday afternoon. Novaya Gazeta’s front page today displayed a simple photograph of Ms. Politkovskaya framed in thick black borders with Anya, the diminutive of her name, printed in block letters above.It is most likely that Ms. Politkovskaya’s journalistic endeavors led to her murder, today’s papers wrote. Novaya Gazeta devoted three full pages to excerpts from some of her most controversial pieces of 2006. Most are critical of the Russian military’s continued operations in Chechnya and of the leadership of the Chechen prime minister, Ramzan A. Kadyrov. In her last public appearance on Oct. 5, Kommersant reported, she told Radio Liberty that her wish was to see Mr. Kadyrov on the defendant’s bench in court. If investigators did link the murder to the current leadership in Chechnya, Kommersant wrote, the region’s government officials and military officers could lose their positions. Chechnya’s president, Alu Alkhanov, along with Mr. Kadyrov strongly condemned the murder, Kommersant reported.One of Ms. Politkovskaya’s colleagues at Novaya Gazeta told Kommersant that anyone could have been behind the murder: members of Russia’s intelligence services, Chechens associated with Mr. Kadyrov, the police, or pseudo-patriots and fascists.A few newspapers provided speculations, seemingly without basis in fact. Izvestia suggested that one of Russia’s high-profile exiles, like Boris A. Berezovsky, could have arranged Ms. Politkovskaya’s murder as a way to destabilize Russia. Komsomolskaya Pravda wrote that the liberal opposition in Russia — which, incidentally, Ms. Politkovskaya vocally supported — could have carried out the murder as a way to undermine the Kremlin and spark public protests.Government officials have been largely silent on the case. Rossiiskaya Gazeta, Russia’s government-run newspaper, wrote that the prosecutor general had taken personal control of the investigation, but said little else beyond a straightforward recounting of the details. Novaya Gazeta said that it will conduct its own investigation, wrote Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Its editor in chief said that his newspaper will have greater access to useful information than law enforcement agencies. The newspaper wrote that Ms. Politkovskaya had no connections to “political intrigues” or “financial interests.” It said that either Mr. Kadyrov or someone hoping to replace him was probably behind the murder.'"
"'06-10-09,'1','So is Mr. Morgenthau planning to run again? “I think he wants to keep his options open,” Ms. Nadel said. “He didn’t confide in me one way or the other.”Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, left, was notably absent at the Empire State Pride Agenda’s election-year banquet on Thursday night — a scheduling conflict that did not surprise or particularly disappoint leaders of the group, a gay rights organization.The executive director of the group, Alan Van Capelle, is one of the few progressive leaders in New York who have publicly criticized Mrs. Clinton over her opposition to same-sex marriage, which the group supports.Mr. Van Capelle has urged his board members to withhold donations to Mrs. Clinton. And at the Thursday gala, which raised $1 million, hers was one of several faces of politicians flashed in a video presentation that was accompanied by these words from Mr. Van Capelle: “The time has come now to tell our friends it’s either time to put up or shut up, because we want the right to marry.”Usually in an election year, Democratic officeholders on the ballot drop by the gala, but Mrs. Clinton’s schedule took her to a Salute to Freedom gala that evening at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum. The Pride Agenda event lasted until 11 p.m. and drew Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic candidate for governor, and Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic candidate for attorney general.At least one person there was sticking up for Mrs. Clinton, at least a little: Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, who is considering a bid for the presidency in 2008, which might pit him against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Feingold, who supports gay marriage, took a pass when asked if Mrs. Clinton’s opposition to gay marriage would hurt or help her politically. But he said he was nonetheless impressed with her political and policy smarts.“I admire Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Feingold said. “She’s very talented. She’s ready to be president.”Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has become effusive in his praise for Adolfo Carrión Jr., the Bronx borough president, calling him, at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Tuesday, “the No. 1 Yankees fan and the greatest advocate for the Bronx — and in all fairness, the person who’s made the most difference, in my memory, in this borough.”Mr. Carrión, right, who endorsed Fernando Ferrer, the mayor’s Democratic challenger, last year, returned the favor by jokingly referring to the mayor twice that day as “Mr. President.”But the mayor’s warm words could complicate matters if Mr. Carrión decides to run for mayor in 2009. Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who came in second to Mr. Ferrer in the primary, and William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller, are also considering running.“My reading in ’09 is there’s a high likelihood of another Democratic fratricide, in the sense that every major voting bloc will put someone up,” said John H. Mollenkopf, a political scientist at the City University of New York Graduate Center. “There’ll be clearly strong candidates, and they’ll succeed in alienating each other’s constituencies. Whoever is nominated is going to be weakened and will have to do a good bit of fence-mending.”Of course, that could make it easier for a Republican candidate to sweep into office, as Mr. Bloomberg did in 2001.'"
"'06-10-09,'1','BERLIN, Oct. 8 — Reacting to the assassination of a veteran journalist in Moscow, German politicians on Sunday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss Russia’s human rights situation in a forceful way when she meets President Vladimir V. Putin in Dresden on Tuesday.“We have to keep raising human rights with Russia,” said Herta Däubler-Gmelin, a Social Democrat and head of the human rights committee in Parliament. “We do raise it, but we have to do more.”The assassinated journalist, Anna Politkovskaya, who was repeatedly criticized by the Russian authorities for her reporting on the war in Chechnya, had received several awards in Germany.“Obviously, the situation in Russia is deteriorating, and also Russian foreign policy,” said Rheinhard Bütikofer, a leader of the opposition Greens.Elmar Brok, a leading member of Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, said, “Europe and Germany together need a strategic partnership with Russia, but in parallel to focusing on human rights, too.”'"
"'06-10-09,'1','Legislators and regulators are not the only people in government who have drafted special rules for religious organizations. Judges, too, have carved out or preserved safe havens that shield religious employers of all faiths from most employee lawsuits, from laws protecting pensions and providing unemployment benefits, and from laws that give employees the right to form unions to negotiate with their employers.Some of these exemptions are rooted in long traditions, while others have grown from court decisions over the last 15 years. Together, they are expanding the ability of religious organizations — especially religious schools — to manage their affairs with less interference from the government and their own employees.The most sweeping of these judicial protections, and the one that confronted the novice nun in Toledo, is called the ministerial exception. Judges have been applying this exception, sometimes called the church autonomy doctrine, to religious employment disputes for more than 100 years.As a rule, state and federal judges will handle any lawsuit that is filed in the right place in an appropriate, timely manner. But judges will almost never agree to hear a controversy that would require them to delve into the doctrines, governance, discipline or hiring preferences of any religious faith. Citing the protections of the First Amendment, they have ruled with great consistency that congregations cannot fully express their faith and exercise their religious freedom unless they are free to select their own spiritual leaders without any interference from government agencies or second-guessing by the courts.To do otherwise would be an intolerable government intrusion into employment relationships that courts have called “the lifeblood” of religious life and the bedrock of religious liberty, explained Edward R. McNicholas, co-chairman of the national religious institutions practice in the Washington, D.C., office of Sidley Austin, a law firm with some of the country’s largest religious organizations among its clients.Judges have routinely invoked the ministerial exception to dismiss lawsuits against religious employers by rabbis, ministers, cantors, nuns and priests — those “whose ministry is a core expression of religious belief for that congregation,” as Mr. McNicholas put it.But judges also have applied the exception to dismiss cases filed by the press secretary at a Roman Catholic church, a writer for The Christian Science Monitor, administrators at religious colleges, the disgruntled beneficiaries of a Lutheran pension fund, the overseer of the kosher kitchen at a Jewish nursing home and a co-founder of Focus on the Family, run by the conservative religious leader James C. Dobson. Court files show that some of these people were surprised to learn that their work had been considered a “core expression of religious belief” by their employer.Religious employers have long been shielded from all complaints of religious discrimination by an exemption that was built into the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and expanded in 1972. That historic exemption allows them to give preference in hiring to candidates who share their faith. In recent years, some judges have also refused to interfere when religious groups have dismissed lesbians, unwed mothers and adulterous couples, even if they profess the same faith, because they have violated their employers’ religious codes.A federal court decision has given religious broadcasters an exemption from some of the fair-hiring requirements of the Federal Communications Commission, even when they are hiring secretaries and receptionists. Two other decisions, one in federal court affecting a Mormon church and the other in a state court of appeals case involving a Roman Catholic nursing home, affirmed the right of religious employers to dismiss employees whose faith changed after they were hired.“These are very difficult cases because they pull at some very fundamental heartstrings,” said Steven C. Sheinberg, a lawyer at Outten & Golden, specializing in employment law. “There’s our belief that employees should be free of discrimination in their work, versus our belief that religious organizations should be free to hire people who best help them fulfill their religious mission, without the intrusion of government.”Employees at religious institutions face other risks as well, thanks to pension law exemptions granted by Congress and upheld by the courts. Religious employers are exempt from Erisa, the federal pension law that establishes disclosure requirements and conflict-of-interest restrictions for employee pension plans. That exemption has given rise to several cases in which workers at religious hospitals found that their pensions had vanished because of practices that would not have been allowed under Erisa’s rules.A related exemption frees religious employers from participating in the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government-run insurance program that provides a safety net for corporate pension plans. And some significant court decisions in labor disputes in the last several years have made it easier for religious schools and colleges to resist collective bargaining efforts.But for Mr. Heck, the question of whether these workplace exemptions are fair to religious employees was crystallized by the case of Ms. Rosati, the novice nun in Toledo.He said the doctor involved in her case had been prepared to testify under oath on Ms. Rosati’s behalf. The doctor “had quite a vivid memory about these events.” In fact, Mr. Heck said, the doctor had cautioned the nuns who accompanied Ms. Rosati that it would be virtually impossible for the ailing novice to get affordable insurance anywhere else if she were dropped from the diocesan health.Lawyers for the diocese disputed Ms. Rosati’s account of that visit and denied that health reasons were the causes of her rejection by the order, the Sisters of the Visitation of Holy Mary, which is covered by the diocesan health plan. For the court “to even begin to inquire into that decision-making process, we believe, crosses the line set by the First Amendment,” said Gregory T. Lodge, a lawyer for both the Toledo diocese and the order, which operates under papal authority.“I understand and absolutely appreciate that in matters of religion, the state has no business meddling,” Mr. Heck said. “It would be unthinkable for a judge to be able to say, ‘Hey, I don’t like the way you’re interpreting the Book of Luke.’ ”But what religious principle is offended when an employee simply grows old or becomes ill, he asked. If the answer is “none,” he continued, judges should be more willing to “look behind the curtain.”For 28 days last May, Lynette M. Petruska, a former nun who now lives in St. Louis, thought she had finally found judges willing to listen to her complaint against Gannon University, a coeducational Catholic college in downtown Erie, Pa. As it turned out, she was wrong.Ms. Petruska was educated in Catholic schools from kindergarten to college commencement, graduated at the top of her law school class and practiced law for several years before deciding to become a nun. In 1999, as she was working toward taking her final vows, she became the first woman to serve as Gannon’s chaplain.Three years later she was demoted and, according to her complaint, effectively forced out. In her lawsuit, she said this action was in response to her having notified the administration of a case of sexual misconduct by a senior university official, resisted efforts to cover up that case and opposed proposals to weaken campus policies on sexual harassment. In 2004, she sued, accusing the university administration of forcing her out simply because she was a woman and because she had opposed the sexual harassment others experienced on campus.Gender bias claims against religious employers have generally been dismissed under the ministerial exception. But some judges across the country have been less quick to dismiss cases where sexual harassment or abuse of an employee is involved. And unlike many other plaintiffs, Ms. Petruska claimed that her supervisor had actually acknowledged to her that she was being demoted solely because of her sex, not because of any religious doctrine.Judge Sean J. McLaughlin of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania nevertheless ruled that Gannon was protected by the First Amendment and the ministerial exception from any court interference in its choice of chaplain. Gannon itself argued that it had many women in leadership positions and that Ms. Petruska had resigned simply because she was unhappy with a staff reorganization. But its fundamental argument was that it would be unconstitutional for the court to second-guess these disputed decisions.“You may ask, ‘Why should these decisions go unquestioned?’ The reason is plain and simple: The First Amendment protects a church’s right to freely exercise its religion,” said Evan C. Rudert, a lawyer for the university. “And that includes organizing itself as it chooses and selecting those who it believes will serve best as its leaders — without interference from the courts.”Then, last May, in a decision that caused considerable comment in legal circles around the country, a federal appeals court panel reversed the trial judge’s decision.For four weeks, the prevailing law in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands — the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit — was that “employment discrimination unconnected to religious belief, religious doctrine, or the internal regulations of a church is simply the exercise of intolerance, not the free exercise of religion.”Appellate Judge Edward R. Becker wrote that opinion, but he died several days before it was formally issued. Judge Becker’s colleague on the three-judge panel, Judge D. Brooks Smith, filed a stinging dissent. On June 20, in a rare move, the Third Circuit granted Gannon’s routine request to have the case reconsidered and named Judge Smith to the new three-judge panel that would do so.On Sept. 6, the new panel swept the earlier decision away, unequivocally restoring the protections for religious employers that it had put in doubt. As Judge Smith put it, the ministerial exception “applies to any claim, the resolution of which would limit a religious institution’s right to choose who will perform particular spiritual functions.”Ms. Petruska, who has left her order and returned home to work at her old law firm, describes herself as a feminist who is “committed to peace and freedom.” She has a long history of putting her words into action — she has been arrested at protest marches, most recently at an antiwar rally the day before the Iraq war began, she said. She plans to appeal the ruling against her.“I think this issue needs to be decided by the Supreme Court,” she said. And she has hopes that the justices will agree with Judge Becker that, absent some grounding in religious doctrine, sex discrimination by religious employers is wrong.Add age discrimination to that wish list, the Rev. John Paul Hankins says.At 73, Mr. Hankins can look back on 50 years in a loving marriage, 40 years as a minister in the United Methodist Church — and 3 years as the plaintiff in an uphill court fight over his denomination’s mandatory retirement policy.Eight months after he turned 70, that policy forced Mr. Hankins to leave his pulpit in the historic Stony Brook Community Church in Stony Brook, N.Y., where he had served for 37 years. He loved his flock and the feeling was mutual: the congregation withheld part of its annual contribution to the regional church that year to express its dismay.“He had served for many, many years and wanted to continue to serve, and his congregation wanted that, too,” said David S. Warren, a professor of computer science at Stony Brook University who had been a member of the congregation for more than 25 years but who left because of how Mr. Hankins was treated.Mr. Hankins said he was suing because age discrimination is almost as hateful and senseless to him as the racial segregation and bias against women that used to be “mandatory policies” of his church.“I feel, and have long felt, that discrimination in any form has no place in the life of a faith community,” he said.Under the federal age discrimination law, most employees of all but the smallest businesses can sue if they are forced to retire for no other reason than that they reached a certain birthday; increasingly, government and academic employees have the same protection. But Mr. Hankins knows his complaint will probably never come to trial simply because he is a clergy member trying to sue his church. Indeed, court rulings around the country suggest that if he had been forced out at any age and for almost any reason — for a deceptive reason, or even for no reason at all — he would face the same judicial roadblock.“I never, ever thought that the last years of my ministry would be involved in a fight like this,” Mr. Hankins said.Lawrence H. McGaughey, the lawyer for the regional Methodist governing body and its bishop, acknowledged that there is a movement in the church to eliminate the retirement rule opposed by Rev. Hankins. But if the rule is ultimately changed, it should be the church’s decision, not a court’s, he said.“Any private employer would feel the same way — they’d like to be able to make these decisions without having to face the courts,” Mr. McGaughey said. “But the difference is the First Amendment.”He continued: “We’re talking about worship here. Are you going to go into church and have someone standing there who was ordered to be there by the courts? There are certain things a government just cannot do in this country.”In September 2003, a federal trial judge on Long Island ruled that Mr. Hankins’s complaint was barred by the ministerial exception. Last February, a federal appeals court panel sent the case back, directing the trial judge to decide the case by applying a 1993 federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, rather than the ministerial exception doctrine. But there was little in the instructions to the trial court to encourage Mr. Hankins.He nevertheless thinks his complaint will eventually help his church see that its mandatory retirement rule is unfair.“I don’t need to win the case,” Mr. Hankins said. “I feel the movement of history at work here, I really do. Ideas find their feet, and start to walk.”State judges have been equally reluctant to interfere in disputes between religious employers and their staff members — to the sad frustration of Rabbi Isaac H. Celnik of Albuquerque.Rabbi Celnik, one of the youngest men ever ordained in Conservative Judaism, was just 30 when he was hired in 1971 as the spiritual leader of Congregation B’nai Israel. Eight years later, he entered into a 30-year contract with the synagogue, an arrangement his congregation endorsed by a margin of almost nine to one, he said.Then the medical problems began. In 1996, Rabbi Celnik was told he was in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease; in April 2000, his wife, Peggy, was told she had breast cancer. In October 2000, he said, the president of the congregation’s governing board at the time suggested he retire on disability.But the rabbi did not consider himself disabled and did not want to retire, he said. He had two young children and a wife whose treatment required continuing health insurance. He “loved the work, and loved the congregation,” he said. Indeed, when the synagogue’s cantor resigned a month after the retirement discussion, Rabbi Celnik proposed, and the board agreed, that he would take on the cantor’s duties as well, he said.But the relationship deteriorated as he tried to negotiate retirement terms that would provide him and his family with adequate financial security. In January 2002, after those negotiations faltered, he was dismissed; in 2003, he sued. But last February, the state’s court of appeals dismissed his case, based on the ministerial exception, also called the church autonomy doctrine.“We are sympathetic to Rabbi Celnik’s struggles with Parkinson’s and the manifestation of the disease after so many years of service,” the chief judge wrote. But he ruled that the dispute “is precisely the type of religious debate that the church autonomy doctrine is intended to protect from judicial review.”The congregation’s current president, Alan M. Chodorow, declined to discuss the details of the dispute. “I do not want to talk about anything that might impair our search for reconciliation and forgiveness” with Rabbi Celnik, he said. “But I will say that we believe strongly in the separation of church and state, and that the state should not have any part in choosing our spiritual leaders.”But Mr. Chodorow said that he was sympathetic to the situation that this freedom for congregations created for employees and that he believed that religious institutions have to provide other protections by contract. Although clergy members in many faiths work without formal contracts, the model contract in wide use within Conservative Judaism provides that rabbis and cantors can terminate the agreement without cause and seek binding arbitration to resolve disputes, he said.The church autonomy doctrine “takes away certain rights and this is put in specifically for the purpose of preserving rights,” Mr. Chodorow said.Rabbi Celnik and his wife continue to struggle with the financial and physical burdens of his deteriorating health and her second episode of cancer. “They don’t teach this in rabbinical school,” the rabbi said in a recent interview. Teach what? Mrs. Celnik answered before he could: “Don’t get old. Don’t get sick.”Mr. McNicholas, the Sidley Austin lawyer, acknowledged that some “unjust and sinful” treatment has been protected from litigation by the ministerial exception. But he argued that “the openness of the religious process” would remedy those situations, making it possible for a clergy member dismissed by one congregation to find a home in another.But what if they are sick? “That’s harder — and very troubling,” Mr. McNicholas said. “But if you have a judge deciding it, that’s just too much intervention in the process of deciding the hiring issues” at religious institutions. “There’s no easy answer.”The University of Great Falls, in Montana, has a tidy urban campus, a bold crucifix-topped chapel, a master’s program in criminal justice and, according to one student’s Internet posting, a cafeteria that serves pretty good spaghetti.What the small Roman Catholic college doesn’t have is a faculty union.It wasn’t for lack of trying. In 1995, the Montana Federation of Teachers, which had unionized most of the public universities in Montana, asked the National Labor Relations Board to recognize it as the collective bargaining agent for the teaching staff at Great Falls.“Some of the faculty members there traveled in circles that included professors at the other schools,” recalled James McGarvey, who was president of the Montana Federation of Teachers at the time. (It has since merged with the Montana Education Association.) Teachers at those other campuses had better pay and more favorable work rules, and some professors at Great Falls had expressed interest in seeing whether the federation could help them as well, according to Mr. McGarvey. “We felt we had a pretty strong showing,” he said.J. C. Weingartner, a union lawyer who worked on the campaign, said that while “pay did come into it, it wasn’t what got it started.” That spark was discontent among some professors over the president’s appointing members to an important advisory council who “did not reflect the views of the majority of the faculty” in negotiations with the administration, he said. “So they felt their interests would be better served with collective bargaining.”The university, which has a new management team today, declined to comment on the long legal battle.But when the labor board held a hearing on the union’s request, the university’s lawyers argued that the board had no jurisdiction because the university was a religious institution, and to force it to negotiate with the union would violate its religious liberty.The university based its case largely on a 1979 decision in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that the labor board’s jurisdiction did not extend to religious schools. After that decision, which resulted in what is called the Catholic Bishop doctrine, the board began case-by-case examinations to determine whether the schools that came before it were sufficiently religious — whatever their faith — to be exempt from its jurisdiction.The University of Great Falls did not qualify, the board concluded in February 1996.For the next seven years, the little Catholic college fought both the federal labor board and the faculty union, keeping lots of lawyers busy and incurring official charges of unfair labor practices in the process. In 2002, it won.The federal appeals court panel in Washington ruled that a three-prong test should be the labor board’s only standard for determining which schools were religious enough to be exempt from the nation’s collective bargaining laws under the Catholic Bishop decision.Any school that is nonprofit, has a religious affiliation and presents itself to the public as a religious institution must be exempted from jurisdiction, the court said. And that included the University of Great Falls.And the court ruled that the labor board’s old case-by-case approach had to stop immediately. For the board even to conduct such inquiries raised serious issues of religious freedom, the judges said.Of course, some casually faithful or broadly tolerant schools that might previously have failed to win a labor board exemption would easily pass the court’s new test.The appellate judges anticipated that complaint, and dismissed it. “If the university is ecumenical and open-minded, that does not make it any less religious, nor N.L.R.B. interference any less a potential infringement of religious liberty,” they said.David Strom, general counsel of the American Federation of Teachers in Washington, doesn’t mince words about the impact of the Great Falls decision. “It means that the difficulty of organizing a religiously affiliated college has become enormous.”Although federal statistics show that one of every seven colleges in the country describes itself as a religious institution, it is not clear how far-reaching the Great Falls decision will be. On its face, it would seem likely to reduce any union-driven salary pressures on exempt religious schools, allowing them to maintain more competitive tuition levels. However, some colleges that might be eligible for an exemption under the new rules may already have collective bargaining in place or may not oppose unions as fiercely as the Montana university did.And the decision limits only the protections of the National Labor Relations Act. But last fall, in a case involving teachers at Catholic schools in Boston, a federal district judge in Massachusetts ruled that part of another federal labor statute called the Taft-Hartley Act could not be applied to church-operated schools without raising First Amendment issues.Notwithstanding the protracted battle in Great Falls, Catholic institutions are not doctrinally opposed to collective bargaining, said Julie N. Secviar, senior vice president for strategic resources for the Franciscan Sisters of Chicago Service Corporation, which manages Catholic hospitals, nursing homes and retirement communities.In fact, the ethical health care directives of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops require “recognition of the rights of employees to organize and bargain collectively without prejudice to the common good.”At the other end of the spectrum stand the Seventh Day Adventists, a Christian denomination with more than 14 million members worldwide. Like many denominations, it provides global humanitarian relief and maintains a large network of church schools and colleges, including Loma Linda University in California. But it also operates the largest Protestant nonprofit health care system in the country, with 38 hospitals in 10 states, 23 nursing homes and 44,000 employees.And not one of those employees is in a union, for a very simple reason: The church believes that collective bargaining “defies Christ’s admonitions that behavior must be directed by individual conscience” and “is inherently disruptive” of the church’s healing mission, as lawyers for the denomination first explained to the national labor board in 1998.The lawyers were responding to a petition by the California Nurses Association to represent the nonsupervisory nurses employed at Ukiah Valley Medical Center.As in the Great Falls case, the lawyers argued that the labor board had no jurisdiction because the hospital was a religious institution and to force it to recognize or bargain with a union would violate its freedom under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.As in the Great Falls case, the labor board ruled otherwise. The next step should have been union balloting, explained Jeffrey A. Berman, the Sidley Austin lawyer who represented the hospital in the case. But the nursing association withdrew its petition and the case ended, he said.According to the American Hospital Association, about one of every four of its members has a religious affiliation. But the Adventists’ problem before the labor board was that hospitals, unlike religious schools, were specifically included in the board’s jurisdiction by Congress. The only labor-law accommodation that Adventists have been able to win from Congress was a provision in 1974 allowing church members to pay the equivalent of their union dues to one of several agreed-upon secular charities, according to Mr. Berman.Adventist hospitals are still waiting for their own Great Falls moment. As Mr. Berman put it, “We’re not asking for carte blanche, for the ability to be exempt from all laws — just with respect to what is unique about these hospitals.”'"
"'06-10-09,'1','Mr. Allen’s office said he had sold his Xybernaut stock at a loss and had not cashed in his Commonwealth options because they cost more than the stock is now worth. The senator also said he saw no conflict in going to work for companies shortly after assisting them as governor.“I actually got no money out of Xybernaut,” he said. “I got paid in stock options, which were worthless.”Mr. Allen’s office said he did not report his Commonwealth options because their purchase price was higher than the current market value. Mr. Allen viewed them as worthless and believed he did not have to report them, aides said.Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, a former prosecutor and a former Democratic Congressional aide, said, “As an ethical matter, it’s irrelevant whether the exercise price of those stock options is above or below the current market price.”“If he owns stock options,” Ms. Clark added, “he does have such a financial stake.”Mr. Allen’s office acknowledged that he had met socially over the years with company executives and that his office had granted “routine courtesy meetings” to company lobbyists “to hear their opinion on legislation and issues before the federal government.”John Reid, a spokesman for Mr. Allen, said he was aware of only one instance in which Mr. Allen’s office had helped a former company. That came in December 2001 when Mr. Allen asked the Army to resolve a lingering issue with Xybernaut. The company asked Mr. Allen to intervene, and he urged the Army to give Xybernaut an answer, Mr. Reid said. At the time, Mr. Allen still owned options to buy 110,000 shares of Xybernaut stock, which could have been affected by new federal contracts.The Army answered but did not give Xybernaut what it wanted, and Mr. Allen did nothing more, Mr. Reid said.As governor, Mr. Allen took representatives of Xybernaut and Ericsson on trade missions. He helped steer $4 million in tax-exempt bonds to Commonwealth for a new headquarters and announced an $800,000 state grant to help Lynchburg prepare a site for an Ericsson expansion.'"
"'06-10-09,'1','And with this season crossing its halfway point on Saturday, there is the potential for a slew of high-profile jobs to open. Last season, only four jobs changed hands among the 65 in the six major conferences. Only one of those, Colorado, came from a university firing its coach.In this short-fuse world of college athletics, where instant results are not quick enough, that low job turnover led to predictions last off-season of an avalanche of job openings.Most of the speculation will revolve around Bobby Bowden at Florida State and Larry Coker at Miami. Both programs are mired in relative mediocrity.It is unlikely both of those jobs will open. But if one does, those universities will probably be competing with several others for the top available coaches. Topping the list of jobs likely to be open are North Carolina, Michigan State and Arizona State. None of those jobs are the caliber of Miami and F.S.U., but they offer good tradition, salaries in excess of a million dollars a year and good facilities.“I think what Foley did was astute and showed clearly there was a strategy,” said Neil Cornrich, a lawyer and agent who represents numerous college coaches, including Iowa’s Kirk Ferentz and Oklahoma’s Bob Stoops. “I think that’s the trend. The smart athletic directors will follow Foley.”What the early firing of Zook did was give Foley five weeks to thoroughly research Meyer, who was coaching at Utah, and other candidates. While Foley did not contact Meyer until after Utah’s regular season ended in late November, he did talk to Meyer’s former bosses and players and his friends. Foley said he ended up with a notebook full of material he would not have gotten had he waited to fire Zook.“How do I make calls about Urban Meyer when I still have a coach?” Foley said.The week that Florida hired Meyer, three other programs — Illinois, Washington and Notre Dame — were trying to do the same. Representatives from Washington and Notre Dame ended up in his living room.But Foley had an advantage when his turn came to try to lure Meyer to Gainesville. Through his research, Foley knew exactly what Meyer wanted.Instead of dropping off clunky piles of books with generic information about the University of Florida, Foley gave him an itemized book with sections on everything he knew Meyer cared about.“It was very succinct, very clear,” Meyer said. “It was about how the athletic department worked, the academic structure and where my kids would go to school and where we’d live.”Foley knew from his research how important family was to Meyer. So Foley had Florida’s basketball coach, Billy Donovan, call Meyer and Donovan’s wife, Christine, call Meyer’s wife, Shelley. They talked about schools, neighborhoods and living environment.If those interactions and early research had not happened, Foley is not sure things would have worked out the way they did.“To be honest with you, I don’t think he’d be here,” Foley said of Meyer. “Urban is a thorough guy who doesn’t leave many stones unturned. One reason among many he’s here now and not in South Bend is because we did our research and established a relationship as soon as the season was over.”Meyer has long loathed the way coaching searches are handled, saying they can be a distraction to a team and often force a coach to make a momentous decision with little time to research. Meyer did not even have a chance to visit Gainesville before taking the Florida job.“You’re making career decisions and decisions that affect a bunch of young people and universities and you basically have 24 hours to do it,” he said.With the college coaching landscape appearing ripe for an overhaul this off-season, it will be interesting to see who strikes first.“The timing allowed us to do our job and allowed us to be where we are today,” Foley said.And No. 2 in the country two years later shows that a quick hook can yield big results.MISSOURI IS CONFIDENT With Saturday’s 38-21 road victory against Texas Tech, No. 19 Missouri (6-0, 2-0) surprised many in the Big 12. Its triumph in Lubbock, a notoriously difficult accomplishment, snapped the Red Raiders’ 11-game home winning streak.Missouri is off to its best start since 1973 and travels this Saturday to play shaky Texas A&M (5-1, 1-1), which lost to Texas Tech, 31-27, at home a week ago.“Are we a great team?” Missouri Coach Gary Pinkel said to reporters after Saturday’s game. “No, we’re not a great team. We’ve won six games and feel very good about that, but we have a half of a season left. I think we’re a good football team and I think we can get a lot better, but I don’t think there was ever any doubt in our players.”The sophomore quarterback Chase Daniel, a Texas native, continues to impress for the Tigers. A first-year starter, he has completed 64.3 percent of his passes for 1,446 yards and 14 touchdowns.Missouri is averaging 34.2 points a game and ranks 11th nationally in total defense, allowing only 255 yards a game. The Tigers are giving up an average of 11.8 points a game, eighth best in the nation. THAYER EVANS (NYT)'"
"'06-10-09,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8 (AP) — Less than a week after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its warning on fresh spinach grown in the Salinas Valley in California, a popular brand of lettuce grown there was recalled on Sunday over concerns about E. coli contamination.The lettuce does not appear to have caused any illnesses, said the president of the grower, the Nunes Company.The recall comes amid warnings that some brands of spinach, bottled carrot juice and recent shipments of beef could cause health risks.Executives ordered the recall after learning that irrigation water may have been contaminated with E. coli, said Tom Nunes Jr., president of the company. The company has not found E. coli bacteria in the lettuce itself, Mr. Nunes said.“We’re just reacting to a water test only,” he said. “We know there’s generic E. coli on it, but we’re not sure what that means.”'"

Nightclubs and bars that sell tobacco would have until Jan. 1, 2008, at the latest, to comply with the rules, he said.Public places include railroad stations, museums, government offices and shops, but the ban will not extend to the streets or to hotel rooms.Mr. de Villepin said the government would cover one-third of the costs of antismoking treatments, like patches. “That would represent the first month of treatment,” he said.'"
"'06-10-09,'1','A consensus among OPEC members began to form over the weekend about cuts in oil production to help stem the recent decline in price, but the group’s members have not yet agreed on how to share the reduced output.While more of OPEC’s members have lined up behind a proposal to pare the group’s formal ceiling by one million barrels a day, significant hurdles remain before the cuts can be put in place. It would be the first time OPEC had cut its quotas in two years.OPEC, which accounts for about 40 percent of the world’s oil exports, may call an emergency meeting later this month to hammer out the deal, according to the oil ministers from Iran and Algeria. Nigeria, which holds the presidency this year, did not rule out an emergency meeting ahead of OPEC’s next scheduled gathering on Dec. 14 in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has not formally reduced its output ceiling since the second quarter of 2004, and any talk of how to divide the lower production may lead to bitter negotiations as countries fight for their market share.But concerns over slumping prices may force OPEC to act.Crude oil futures in New York are down 24 percent since touching a record trading price of $78.40 a barrel in mid-July. Last week, even as OPEC considered reducing its output, prices fell 5 percent as traders doubted the group’s resolve. Oil closed at $59.76 a barrel on Friday, near its lowest levels in seven months.'"
"'06-10-09,'1','At a meeting on Sept. 29, Mr. Streiff proposed sweeping changes at Airbus, including job cuts.He also urged that all production of the A380 be shifted to Airbus’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, while single-aisle jet programs, including the A320, be concentrated in Hamburg. When his ideas were rejected, Mr. Streiff threatened to resign in protest, one person with knowledge of the proceedings said.On Tuesday, managers agreed to allow him to present a broad outline of the plan to the news media with the understanding that negotiations about its process would continue.In meetings last week with European government officials, it became clear that Mr. Streiff’s proposals had raised alarm among politicians, particularly in Germany, where Airbus employs more than 12,000 people.But Thomas Enders, the German co-chief executive sought to allay those fears, saying that Hamburg was “our second-most-important production site, and we are committed to it.” Mr. Streiff reports directly to Mr. Enders. Louis Gallois, a Frenchman, is the other EADS chief.[The French prime minister said on Sunday that he saw no reason for Mr. Streiff to resign but that certain decisions about the structure of Airbus needed to be taken, Reuters reported. “I have no indication at all of that, he is doing a formidable job and there is no reason for Christian Streiff’s resignation.” the prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, said in a televised interview, according to Reuters.]The main problem for Airbus is its repeated postponement of the A380, which is now two years behind schedule. EADS also warned that persistent assembly-line problems would cut earnings over the next four years by 4.8 billion euros ($6.1 billion), more than double the amount forecast in June.According to one executive inside the company, Mr. Enders and Mr. Gallois have grown frustrated by Mr. Streiff’s perceived indifference to political concerns. Mr. Streiff did not respond to an e-mail request for comment.If he did step down, it was not immediately clear who would succeed him. Mr. Streiff was brought in from the industrial materials group Saint Gobain to fill the top job at Airbus, after the dismissal of his predecessor, Gustav Humbert, and the Airbus chairman, Noël Forgeard.But given the urgency and the fact that Airbus and EADS are eager to move forward, it appears likely that any new chief executive will be chosen internally. French media reports have suggested that Mr. Gallois could step in as interim chief.Some Airbus observers speculated that John Leahy, Airbus’s chief operating officer for customers, might step in to take over for Mr. Streiff. Mr. Leahy is believed to have volunteered for the job amid the management turmoil in June, but was passed over because EADS managers felt a fresh pair of hands was needed.EADS, which owns 80 percent of Airbus, is poised to assume full ownership this week after shareholders of BAE Systems, the British defense company, agree to sell back its 20 percent stake in Airbus.'"
"'06-10-09,'1','“France really pushed forward the debate over protection measures,” said Ted Shapiro, general counsel for Europe of the Motion Picture Association, the international arm of the Motion Picture Association of America.In the end, the French law strengthened the hand of studios and record labels by prohibiting a person’s ability to circumvent protection measures; it never required songs to be transferred from one format to the others.Similar regulations were laid out in the United States by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.In mounting their protest, members of the group in Paris saw themselves as foot soldiers of the digital generation battling against ever-tighter controls over songs, film and all digitized culture.Greeted at the police station by almost as many armed riot police officers as there were protesters, they explained their infractions to passers-by.“Not only did I not use an iPod to listen to an iTunes song, but I transferred the film ‘Blade Runner’ onto my hand-held movie player,” Mr. Martinez, 28, said. “I am willing to face the consequences of what they consider an offense.”By his own calculation, Mr. Martinez could face a fine of as much as 41,250 euros, or about $52,000, and six months in prison.Mr. Martinez patiently laid out the case he built against himself, offering details about his infractions, which included switching music from one format to another and transferring the DVD’s to different players.“They say the law is intended to stop piracy, but I am not a pirate,” Mr. Martinez said. “I support artists with legally purchased works, but I do not want to be forced to use a particular device to play them.”The process of switching the music from the Apple or Microsoft formats to the MP3 format removes all copying restrictions. Transferring the DVD also requires bypassing protection measures.Mr. Martinez figured he could face fines of 3,750 euros ($4,663) for each transfer and 30,000 euros ($37,809) plus as much as to six months in prison for telling others how to do the same thing.At that point a policeman, dressed in plain clothes, came out from behind the line of riot police to escort the three inside the station, where they could register their offenses.While the impact of the law’s push for compatibility across devices remains unclear, Mr. Shapiro argued against legislating technical standards. “The studios do not want to control culture,” he said. “They want to get a return on investment.”More than a week later, Mr. Martinez said, he took the additional step of sending registered letters to Microsoft and Apple informing them of his actions, but he still did not know whether a prosecution would take place.“It is a complicated and new issue, so I am not surprised at the slow reaction,” he said. “Or maybe the police realize that there are more important things for the government than forcing me to use an iPod when listening to ‘Les Lacs du Connemara.’ ”'"

"'06-10-09,'1','Stephen F. Quinn, senior vice president for marketing at Wal-Mart Stores, the nation’s largest retailer, echoed Mr. Lafley.“Today, the customer is in charge,” Mr. Quinn said, “and whoever is best at putting the customer in charge makes all the money.”Wal-Mart, struggling to stimulate sluggish sales growth, is “in transformation” and looking beyond its traditional base of rural, low-income customers, Mr. Quinn said. It is aiming to woo a more affluent and suburban “selective shopper” who must be convinced that Wal-Mart has merchandise “up to their quality and taste standards,” he said.Although “it’s safe to say we have a long way to go,” Mr. Quinn said, “you’ll see a different Wal-Mart in 2007.” For instance, more stores will be customized by location, following a model store in the upscale Dallas suburb of Plano, Tex., which is “proving Wal-Mart can appeal to the Cadillac set,” he added.“We can sell a $200 bottle of wine,” Mr. Quinn said, adding: “And by the way, the savings on that bottle of wine is $65. Just because you’re affluent doesn’t mean you want to pay more for everything.”At Mini USA, part of BMW of North America, the fact that so many customers choose to customize their cars showed executives that “we’d never have complete control over the brand,” said James L. McDowell, managing director at Mini USA. About 60 percent of the estimated 40,000 Minis the company sells each year are customized.For instance, Mr. McDowell said, some Mini owners dress their cars in naughty costumes for Halloween, and two investment bankers mounted mock shark fins atop the roofs of their Minis.“It’s a great thing every day to wake up and see what consumers have done to the brand,” Mr. McDowell said, even though “it’s not a culture we necessarily would have come up with on our own.”One brand that has long cultivated a naughty, playful persona is Burger King, with brash campaigns involving new media like YouTube, MySpace, video games and iPods.That is deliberate, said Russ Klein, president for global marketing, strategy and innovation at Burger King, because with a principal competitor, McDonald’s, owning the family-friendly image, “it’s more important for us to be provocative than pleasant.”“If you have a global brand promise, ‘Have it your way,’ ” Mr. Klein said, quoting the Burger King ad theme, “it’s about putting the customer in charge,” even if they say “bad things” about the brand.As consumers “wrest control away from brand-management control freaks,” he advised his peers, “get over it,” because “turning your brand over to the consumer is taking control — and in fact, if you do, they’ll return it to you in better shape.”• Mr. Klein’s “que será, será” attitude was endorsed by a speaker from MasterCard, whose “Priceless” campaign has been ardently adopted — and adapted — by consumers.“We can’t manage what happens out there,” said Lawrence Flanagan, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at MasterCard Worldwide. “It has taken on a life of its own.”When “you’re tapping into that consumer desire to have a piece of it,” he added, referring to a brand or product, “you have to take the good with the bad.” MasterCard, for instance, has tolerated and, arguably, benefited from the spate of profane or off-color parodies of the “Priceless” campaign.One way to minimize the problem, said Cammie Dunaway, chief marketing officer at Yahoo, is to reach out to consumers who already like a particular brand rather than to a wider audience that may create “something you’re really uncomfortable with.”For example, Yahoo Music asked fans of the singer Shakira to contribute video clips of them performing her song “Hips Don’t Lie,” and the submissions were culled to produce a fans’ version of her music video.“I call it participation marketing,” Ms. Dunaway said. “Allow them to help you shape the brand experience.“Content is no longer something you push out. Content is an invitation to engage with your brand.”'"
"'06-10-09,'1','Willie Randolph, the Mets’ manager, who until last year had spent most of his baseball life with the Yankees, was a little more candid.Yes, he said, at times he thought about the possibility of a Subway Series but added: “No matter what people say about juggernauts or Murderers’ Row and all that stuff, you have to play the game. I’m sure they’re very disappointed, but I’m happy for my guys. We’re New Yorkers and we have a piece of the pie also. We want to be able to bring our fans something very special.”And in the flush of victory, Omar Minaya, the general manager who so adeptly put together the Mets, allowed himself a moment’s expression of proprietary geography.“The only thing you’re going to talk about in New York is National League baseball,” he said. “The only baseball being played in New York is National League baseball. The last time that happened was 1988.”Minaya was wrong on one count. There will be plenty of talk in New York about the Yankees, as there always is when they lose unexpectedly: what happened and what are they going to do about it?When the Yankees fail to win, George Steinbrenner can always be counted on to react severely. Speculation has already begun that he will fire Manager Joe Torre, and chances are Steinbrenner himself ignited the speculation in a postgame tirade. It’s likely that he said some things he would think better of in the light of day.Steinbrenner may very well fire Torre — who has no reason to resign and seven million reasons not to — but by yesterday Steinbrenner had not informed his baseball people of such a plan.If he were to make a change, would Steinbrenner want to hire Lou Piniella to replace Torre? Very likely, but after he managed for Steinbrenner twice in the late 80’s, Piniella said he wouldn’t do it a third time. He could change his mind, but he has other managerial opportunities without subjecting himself once more to the maelstrom named Steinbrenner.It was not Torre, of course, whom the Tigers’ pitching shut down in the division series.“You have to give credit to the scouting report, the preparation they did for the series,” Tony Bernazard, one of Minaya’s assistants, said of the Tigers. “They are a team set up for the playoffs because of the pitching they have. Their pitching can shut down a very good hitting team. Their pitching did a hell of a job. That lineup the Yankees have is awesome.”From the fifth inning of Game 2 through the sixth inning of Game 4, a span of 20 innings, the Yankees did not score a run against the Tigers.“That’s very surprising,” Minaya said. “The baseball world was surprised. I thought on paper they were the best team in the playoffs. It’s the best lineup I’ve ever seen. It might be the best lineup in the history of the game.”But what was the lineup? Was it the one that had Alex Rodriguez batting sixth? The one that had him hitting fourth? The one that had him hitting eighth? Not even Torre knew.•Torre uncharacteristically shuffled his lineup, presumably trying to find a spot where the beleaguered Rodriguez would hit. But Torre made a farce of it, and when he batted Rodriguez eighth in Game 4, it was almost as if he were punishing the game’s highest-paid player for not hitting, perhaps even wanting to humiliate A-Rod for his failures.The best managers always try to display an air of calmness in situations in which even a look of panic could negatively affect the players. Torre is usually the epitome of calm; what he did with Rodriguez created a smell of panic.The Mets, meanwhile, are having fun and demonstrating, as they did during the season, that they are the best team in the National League. And Randolph, whom many teams ignored because they felt he lacked managing experience, calmly confronted the Mets’ pitching adversity and didn’t panic.'"
"'06-10-09,'1','Apple’s board began looking into options practices in June, joining more than 100 other companies, including many in the technology industry, that were investigating the backdating of stock options to inflate their value.Apple said last week that Mr. Jobs knew of some instances of backdating of options, though he did not benefit from those grants. The committee cleared all current employees, including Mr. Jobs, of any impropriety.The absence of details in the company’s announcement left it unclear how the instances of backdating occurred, or what role Mr. Anderson or the Apple board may have played. Some Wall Street analysts expressed confidence that the internal investigation would put an end to concerns that Mr. Jobs might be in jeopardy. But the announcement is not likely to be the last word on Apple’s options problems, analysts said.Charles M. Elson, the director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that the board’s conclusions, while interesting, held no real authority. “In the end, it will be up to the S.E.C. to decide,” he said.Federal prosecutors were briefed last Tuesday on the Apple board’s findings by legal representatives for the company, according to a person who had been briefed on the situation. It is unclear who the prosecutors are focusing on, or whether Mr. Jobs is a member of that group.Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said its review found that backdated options were granted on 15 dates.“You don’t know what the scope of the problem really is,” said Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant in White Plains. “They told you the number of grant dates, but not the number of grants. They told you that he was in the know on a few instances, but those could be a huge number of shares.”The company reiterated that it expected to restate its financial results to account for the extra compensation expense related to the options. Mr. Foley questioned why the company had not yet quantified the potential impact for investors.“After three months, you don’t know what the number is,” he said. “Come on.”Apple said its investigation also “raised serious concerns” about the activities of two other former Apple officers, but a company statement released last week did not name them. An Apple spokesman declined to comment further on Friday.Apple’s shares closed at $74.22 on Friday, down $1.16 from their closing price on Wednesday, before the news was announced.In the backdating of stock options, a company typically selects a grant date when its stock price was lower, increasing the value of the options for employees who sell them later for a higher price.'"

"'06-10-10,'1','One of the pleasures of a Streisand concert is hearing this diva of divas live, her voice unembellished by “improvements” carried out in the recording studio.In her drive for technical perfection, Ms. Streisand has a longstanding tendency to apply too many coats of aural varnish to her records.She should realize that sounding like an imperfect human being is more expressive than trying to sound like God, and her singing last night was frequently magnificent. Her voice is fuller than it used to be and still drips with the juice most singers begin to lose at 50. (Ms. Streisand is 64).Another misstep was the choice of Il Divo, the operatic boy band, as her musical guests. While this multilingual, multinational quartet of singing mannequins, assembled by the diabolically market-savvy impresario Simon Cowell, belts in tune, they have the emotional spontaneity of robots in tuxedos.An early low point of the show was their arrival on stage to bombard Ms. Streisand with smarmy flattery. Let’s hope she never records with these pretenders to the kitsch pop throne of Andrea Bocelli.Befitting an event that suggested a one-woman Super Bowl in which the star competed with her legend, the concert was packed with distracting bells and whistles. A useless question-and-answer session in which she responded to randomly selected audience questions wasted precious time. During the Bush impersonation, a solitary heckler so annoyed Ms. Streisand that she lost her temper and hurled an obscenity.A Barbra Streisand concert should be about singing. That’s what people really want. The rest they tolerate out of respect for her gigantic talent. And when she stuck to music, there were many magnificent moments. “Starting Here, Starting Now,” the “Funny Girl” suite, “When the Sun Comes Out,” “Children Will Listen,” “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life,” and “My Shining Hour” were the musical high points of a concert that was further dampened by the lack of a pre-performance sound check because Ms. Streisand was stuck in traffic. As a result, the acoustics of the first half of the concert were muddy.True to her show business instincts, she saved the best for last. In her final sprint, she might have a scored a winning touchdown had she not interrupted it with the Bush impersonator. And near the end sabotaged her own glorious performance of “Somewhere” by bringing Il Divo as a robotic harmony chorus.A poignant moment for those who have followed Ms. Streisand’s career from the beginning was her rendition of (“Have I Stayed) Too Long at the Fair?” a Billy Barnes ballad that she recorded in 1964. Way back then, it was the reflection of an insecure ingénue feeling her first intimations of ennui after too much partying.Sung four decades later, with just as much passion but an entirely different outlook, Ms. Streisand made it a rhetorical question about her own future. Has she stayed too long at the fair? Despite all the evening’s missteps, the answer is a resounding no.'"

"'06-10-10,'1','The city will not seek to recoup pay from the families of Firefighter Christian P. Engeldrum and Police Officer James D. McNaughton, who were killed while on military service in Iraq, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday. City employees called to duty as reservists were allowed to keep both their military and city pay and benefits, as long as they repaid the city the lesser of the two salaries upon their return. But with many of the workers being hit with higher bills than they expected, city officials are re-examining the terms of the program. The issue was resolved at least for the families of Firefighter Engeldrum, who was 39 and married with two sons, and Officer McNaughton, 27, who was engaged. “There’s no intention to try to collect monies,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “They’ve paid enough price already.”'"
"'06-10-10,'1','A seventh grader in Joplin, Mo., arrived at his school yesterday wearing a mask and armed with an assault rifle, and fired a round before being arrested, the authorities said. No one was injured.Once the boy was in custody, a drawing of the school’s layout, unidentified chemicals and notes about bomb-making material were found in his duffel bag. The school was then evacuated, and bomb-sniffing dogs searched it for most of the day but did not turn up any explosives, said Lt. Geoff Jones, a spokesman for the Joplin police.The 13-year-old youth, whose name was not disclosed, arrived at Memorial Middle School just before 8 a.m. in camouflage pants, a green trench coat and the mask, and was carrying a MAC-90 rifle, similar to an AK-47, Lieutenant Jones said.When a school administrator tried to talk him into giving up the gun, the youth shouted, “Don’t make me do it!” He then fired at the ceiling, Lieutenant Jones said, and tried to fire additional shots as he left the building. But the gun jammed after the initial round.The police arrested the student about a half-block from the school, Lieutenant Jones said. He said the motive for the shooting was unknown, and school administrators said they had not considered the youth a disciplinary problem.The shooting was the fourth at an American school in less than two weeks. On Oct. 2, a Pennsylvania man burst into a rural school and shot 10 Amish girls, 6 fatally, before killing himself. Earlier, a 15-year-old student fatally shot his high school principal in Wisconsin, and a Colorado man took several students hostage at a school before killing a 16-year-old girl and himself.'"
"'06-10-10,'1','WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 — Time was when it seemed safe to regard the works of Plato as intellectually superior to the racy romance novels of, say, Nora Roberts. In underground Washington, those days are over.Consider the hoo-ha over new subway posters that try to capitalize on the percentage of people with advanced degrees living in the region.The Greater Washington Initiative, a business group devoted to attracting investment to the area, put up the posters, which feature side-by-side photographs: of a man reading Plato’s “Republic,” under the caption “Greater Washington Subway Reading,” and of the same man poring over a romance novel, under the caption “Average Subway Reading.”The reaction from romance writers — and readers — was as fast and heated as a steamy sex scene.“I’m an erotic romance/romance publisher, and I live in your marketing area,” Stephanie V. Kelsey, editor in chief and chief operations officer of Mojocastle Press, wrote to the group. “Despite the erroneous position many take that romance is ‘easy money,’ it requires the same hard work, honing of skill and commitment as any other genre. To insinuate otherwise in a media representation of your company is not recommended, and we are not amused.”Neither was Ms. Roberts, a Maryland resident and best-selling author eager to defend the genre and its fans. “The fact that Romance novels make up about 50 percent of sales of all mass market fiction should be an indication of how many passengers are reading a Romance novel on the D.C. Metro,” she wrote, “and how many might be insulted by this ad.”'"
"'06-10-10,'1','Martin Mackay, Pfizer’s global head of research and technology, said the deal “is our first foray into vaccines and it won’t be our last.” In an interview, he said that “obviously there is quite a medical need” for new vaccines and that Pfizer, which does sell animal vaccines, wanted to enter the human vaccine business with a technology like PowderMed’s that leapfrogs what is currently available.Most vaccines are made either from a killed or weakened virus or from proteins from the virus. PowderMed’s vaccine is made of DNA from the virus.Such DNA vaccines can be manufactured more quickly and in larger amounts than conventional vaccines, said Clive Dix, chief executive of PowderMed, which is based in Oxford, England.Flu vaccines are now made by growing the virus in eggs, which takes six to nine months. That would slow the response to a pandemic as only a small fraction of the necessary number of shots could be made in that time.By contrast, DNA can be quickly multiplied in cultures of bacteria and then extracted. “Within six weeks of knowing the strain of virus, we can produce enough DNA to vaccinate the whole world,” Mr. Dix said.Despite their promise, however, DNA vaccines tested in the past have not stimulated adequate immune responses. PowderMed said it can overcome that problem with a novel delivery method. Instead of injecting the DNA, it uses compressed helium gas to shoot microscopic gold particles coated with DNA into the skin’s outer layer, where they interact with immune cells.The company has done some early clinical trials of a seasonal flu vaccine that demonstrated an immune response. Mr. Dix and Mr. Mackay of Pfizer said a seasonal flu vaccine could reach the market in four or five years. Mr. Mackay said a pandemic vaccine might take a bit longer and Mr. Dix said it might take less time.PowderMed is also developing vaccines for herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and other diseases.Vijay B. Samant, chief executive of Vical, another developer of DNA vaccines, said Pfizer’s move was “an important validation of the DNA vaccine technology platform.” Mr. Samant predicted, however, that PowderMed’s combination of a new vaccine technology with a new delivery device would make it harder to win regulatory approval. Vical, based in San Diego, uses injections of DNA inside lipids.PowderMed was spun out of PowderJect Pharmaceuticals, a company acquired in 2003 by Chiron, which was mainly interested in PowderJect’s conventional flu shot factory in Liverpool, England.The following year, British regulators shut the Liverpool factory because of contamination, causing a big flu shot shortage in the United States. For this winter’s flu season, federal authorities expect record amounts of vaccine to be available because the Liverpool factory, now owned by Novartis, is back in production and Glaxo has entered the American market.After its spinout, PowderMed attracted an investment of £20 million, worth $34.5 million at the time, from venture capitalists. Mr. Dix said Pfizer did not want the price of its acquisition disclosed, but said, “It was certainly an extremely good return for our investors.”'"
"'06-10-10,'1','The A’s swept the Minnesota Twins to erase an aggravating statistic that had hovered over their franchise: 0 for 9 in playoff clinching games. But General Manager Billy Beane, who has long said the regular season determines the best teams while the postseason is a “crapshoot,” still feels the same way.“The beauty of baseball is the best eight teams get to the playoffs,” Beane said. “The tough part is, if you’re the best, it’s all for naught in a short series.”The Tigers tamed the Yankees because their pitchers attacked a formidable lineup known for power and patience. The Yankees usually drain pitchers by extending at-bats, increasing pitch counts, and forcing teams to go to the bullpen early. But the Tigers, who had a 2.11 earned run average in the series, eliminated one of the Yankees’ strengths by throwing first-pitch strikes and challenging them.“They were aggressive with the fastball,” said Don Mattingly, the Yankees’ batting coach. “They didn’t try to pick, pick, pick. The teams that have success against us are the teams that attack us.”Obviously, the A’s scouted the Tigers and saw how they succeeded, so they will likely tell their batters to be prepared to attack early in the count. The Tigers have sturdy starters with Nate Robertson, Justin Verlander, Kenny Rogers and Jeremy Bonderman and, if they get to the seventh inning with a lead, batters should insert their contact lenses. That is when Joel Zumaya, the setup man with the 102-mile per hour fastball, usually marches into the game.“You pick the six batters you want him to get,” said Reggie Jackson, the Hall of Fame hitter, who played for the A’s when they faced the Tigers in the 1972 A.L.C.S. “Would you want to be one of the six?”Beane said the best way to counter good pitching is “by pitching as well as they do.” The A’s are capable, as evidenced by the seven runs they allowed the Twins in three games. But Beane also noted that the Yankees had the bases loaded against Verlander in the first inning of Game 2 and did not capitalize. If the Yankees had scored there, the series might have taken a different turn.“We’re not a high scoring team, so we have to continue to be effective when we get opportunities,” Beane said. “And we also have to match what their guys do on the mound.”While the A’s cannot match the Yankees’ offense, they have proven to be a resilient bunch. Eric Chavez, the third baseman, meant it as a compliment to his teammates when he said they are the “least talented” team he has played on in the postseason. Somehow, the A’s, who were 4-5 against Detroit this season, devise ways to win.With Barry Zito starting at home, the A’s have confidence in Game 1. Zito pitched eight sterling innings to foil Johan Santana and the Twins in the opener of the first round. He is shrewd, he has a devastating curveball, and he can be a free agent after the season, so each dazzling outing should boost his value.Other than Frank Thomas (39 home runs, 114 runs batted in) and Nick Swisher (35, 95), the A’s did not have another player who knocked in more than 72 runs. The A’s have a bunch of nice players, not superstars. But that combination has moved them within four victories of advancing to the World Series.“I feel as good about our chances as the other three teams feel about theirs,” Beane said. “No better, no worse.”'"
"'06-10-10,'1','PITTSBURGH, Oct. 9 (AP) — The PNC Financial Services Group, one of the nation’s largest regional banks, announced Monday that it was buying the Mercantile Bankshares Corporation of Baltimore for about $6 billion as part of an expansion plan aiming at wealthy, fast-growing markets on the East Coast.PNC, which is based in Pittsburgh, said the cash-and-stock deal would further its growth along the affluent New Jersey-to-Washington corridor, adding hundreds of new branches in Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia and Delaware.“I think it’s fairly self-evident that the combination of Mercantile and PNC will be a mid-Atlantic powerhouse,” said James E.

"'06-10-10,'1','As many wonder how Mr. Smiley will continue to leverage his cultural capital, he says that his motives are simple. “I am tired of seeing black people live beneath our privilege,” he said in a recent interview in New York, where he caught up with President Chávez after his controversial remarks at the United Nations critical of President Bush. “I am not trying to create another organization and I’m not trying to be Mr. Black America,” he said.“Do I cop to trying to motivate people, trying to inspire people, trying to uplift people through my symposiums, my books, my radio, my speeches?” he asked. “Yes, I cop to that. But it’s all born of love.”Mr. Smiley also says that some of his frenetic pace is born of pain. In his memoir he recalls how a brutal beating by his stepfather one Sunday morning in seventh grade changed his life.“In a very real way, I think to this day that the work I do, the level at which I attempt to do it, the time I dedicate to it, is really trying to put as much distance between me and that moment as I can,” Mr. Smiley said quietly in the interview. The memoir, he said, is the first time he has written in detail about the abuse.His stepfather beat him and his sister Phyllis with an electrical cord until their skin hung in ribbons because he believed erroneous reports that they had misbehaved in church, Mr. Smiley writes. The beating put both children in the hospital; afterward they were placed in foster care. Mr. Smiley said that he had reconciled with his parents and is very close to his mother. But Phyllis Smiley never returned home and spent years fighting drug addiction and other demons. He dedicated the memoir to her.“There is not a day in my life I do not wish I could have traded places with her,” Mr. Smiley said, adding that his sister is now doing well and poised to enter nursing school.His life lessons keep him humble, Mr. Smiley said, though some profiles over the years have portrayed him as controlling and ego-driven. He admits to past arrogance in his memoir but says he is also simply self-confident and that he continues to belong to a Pentecostal church and prays every day.But with his own power bases and years of chatting up an eclectic range of stars — Fidel Castro, Newt Gingrich, Halle Berry, Nora Ephron, Prince and Bill Clinton among them— Mr. Smiley is a celebrity in his own right.“You have Oprah and you have Tavis — they are the king and queen, they have great access, they are advocates for the underserved,” Amy Alexander, a media critic and author of a forthcoming book on African-Americans and media, said. “He’s very much in the mold of a long line of black journalists who were very upfront about being advocate journalists.” He also fills a void, she said.“There’s no black version of Harper’s or The New Yorker for African-Americans seeking meaningful commentary on politics or raising our children,” Ms. Alexander said. “ ‘The Covenant’ pulls it together.”Mr. Smiley’s media saturation in service of his message echoes the same approach used by white conservatives like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, Ms. Alexander said. In a recent column in The Nation Ms. Alexander wrote that Mr. Smiley could certainly sound like someone running for political office and questioned whether he could turn “The Covenant” “into lasting, on-the-ground action.”Henry Louis Gates Jr., director of the W. E. B. DuBois Institute at Harvard, said that Mr. Smiley had served as a conduit between the black intelligentsia and everyday African-Americans. “He’s reaching people emotionally and intellectually with a level of discourse that does not talk down to people,” Mr. Gates said.“If DuBois has two descendants, Cornel West is the scholar, and Tavis Smiley is the journalist-activist,” he added. Mr. West, the writer and Princeton professor of religion whom Mr. Smiley considers “a big brother,” wrote an essay for “The Covenant” titled “Call to Action.”For the past several years Mr. Smiley has presided over an annual State of the Black Union meeting, which has been broadcast on C-Span and brings together a broad swath of African-Americans to discuss their concerns. “It’s when the King legacy interacts with postmodern mass media,” Mr. West said of Mr. Smiley’s impact.Mr. Smiley, who said his hero was the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., knows how to make things happen. In 10 years on Mr. Joyner’s show, the two have led numerous campaigns, from getting Christie’s, the auction house, to donate slave artifacts to a museum instead of putting them up for bid, to persuading Congress to award Rosa Parks the Congressional Gold Medal.Mr. Smiley does not get a free pass because of his advocacy. For instance, an article in May in The Black Commentator, an Internet magazine (blackcommentator.com), was headlined “Being the Covenant Watchdog: Does Tavis Smiley Need Watching?” Among other things, the article chided Mr. Smiley for discussing the idea that 2006 would be the year of the black Republican and for having Wal-Mart Stores underwrite his television show.Some of that criticism is really the desire of people for a perfect savior, Mr. Smiley said. “They want some messianic figure to come back and crack the clouds and take them to the Promised Land,” Mr. Smiley said. “That’s not who I am trying to be.”Of his 10-year association with Wal-Mart, Mr. Smiley said that “if I were looking for a perfect partner, I wouldn’t be doing any of the work that I’m doing.” The company, which has been accused of discrimination and exploiting its workers, has never tried to influence him, he said.Mona Williams, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, rejected the criticism of the company. “Wal-Mart creates tens of thousands of American jobs each year,” she said, “jobs with competitive wages and affordable health benefits.”Mr. Smiley’s favorite expressions are “love wins” and “keep the faith.” And he is not just preaching to blacks, he said. “You don’t survive on public television with just a black audience,” he said.There was no racial breakdown available for Mr. Smiley’s show on Public Radio International, which is carried on 73 stations and in all of the top 10 markets. During the last year more than 400,000 households, according to Nielsen figures provided by PBS, watched each nightly episode of “Tavis Smiley.” Among all PBS prime-time and late-night series, the audience had the highest percentage of “top-level occupations,” at 28 percent, and, at 32 percent, the highest rate of African-American viewers.Mr. Smiley said he was confident that “The Covenant” would remain influential through the 2008 election cycle.“There is an awakening happening around the world, born of a hunger and thirst people have to turn this mess we are in around,” Mr. Smiley said. “I tell people, ‘It’s not about me. It is about you making yourself a committee of one, of not surrendering our authority to people who don’t always have our best interests at heart.’ My friends hear me say it all the time — in the end, love wins.”'"
"'06-10-10,'1','But trans fats, experts have found, skew the ratio in the worst possible way by increasing the bad and lowering the good.This has made partially hydrogenated oils a piñata for public health officials worldwide. Trans fats have essentially been banned in Denmark. Authorities in Canada, the first country to require food labeling of trans fats, are taking steps to follow suit.In the United States, the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine has concluded that the optimal intake of trans fats is zero. Earlier this year, Dr. Walter Willett, a leading nutrition researcher, and his colleagues at Harvard University estimated that if artificially produced trans fats were removed from the American diet, up to 228,000 heart attacks could be prevented each year.By Dr. Willett’s calculation, diners are consuming one-third to one-half of their trans fats in restaurants. New York’s proposed ban, he argues, could prevent 500 deaths a year.“It would be like putting the whole population on a mild cholesterol-lowering statin,” Dr. Willett said. “Probably nothing else you could do would have such a great impact on mortality.”But other researchers, if not enthusiastic about trans fats, are more sanguine about their use in restaurants.For one thing, they say, it’s likely that Americans are eating less already. One widely used estimate — that the average American takes in 2.6 percent of his or her calories in trans fats — is “old data,” said Dr. Alice Lichtenstein, a nutritionist at Tufts University.Because trans fats are already disappearing from foods on grocery store shelves, Dr. Lichtenstein says, the current average intake is probably lower — more like 1.5 percent to 2 percent. Much of the interventional research into dietary trans fats has been done with subjects who consumed much greater amounts, often as much as 10 percent of their calories. At much lower levels, experts say, it’s hard to gauge with accuracy what further benefits can be gained by eliminating trans fats altogether.The most vocal critics of trans fats believe that the relationship between their intake and heart disease is linear. Even tiny amounts pose some threat, they say. But an interesting study by Dr. Lichtenstein suggests that it’s more complicated than that.She and her colleagues put 36 volunteers on diets with various amounts of trans fats, then measured blood levels of L.D.L. and H.D.L. cholesterol.Increased trans fats were associated with increased blood levels of bad cholesterol in a linear fashion, she found. But good cholesterol was significantly diminished only in subjects who consumed trans fats in the greatest amounts — nearly 7 percent of their daily calories — and even then just barely. H.D.L. was not affected in subjects consuming less.This finding and others like it suggest that for consumers eating modest amounts of trans fat, the gain from reduced intake may not be as great as some might hope. In any event, the benefit is likely to accrue mostly for people who have elevated cholesterol to begin with. That’s one in four New Yorkers, according to the city’s health department.“Cumulatively, this small step could have a beneficial effect,” Dr. Lichtenstein said. “But it’s not going to be a panacea.”Starting in January, the Food and Drug Administration began requiring food labels to list quantities of trans fats per serving. But citing a lack of scientific data, the agency has declined to establish a daily value for trans fats, as it has for saturated fats and dietary cholesterol. Indeed, the agency still classifies partially hydrogenated oils as G.R.A.S., or generally regarded as safe.Still, even at low levels, trans fats do raise bad cholesterol, and no matter how you slice it, that’s bad news. There are other concerns, too. Though the research is still evolving, some studies suggest that trans fats increase levels of certain other blood fats and promote inflammation throughout the body, another risk for heart trouble.Banning them may not save 500 lives a year in New York, but it may well save some. Whether you turn out to be one of the lucky ones would depend not just on the heart risks you bring to the table, but also on what replacements the cooks use.For many foods requiring hard fats, particularly baked goods, the tastiest alternatives to partially hydrogenated oils are tropical oils, like palm oil and coconut oil, or butter. Loaded with artery-blocking saturated fat, they are the very ingredients health advocates shooed us away from not so long ago.Saturated fat is at least a natural constituent of our diets, according to officials, whereas trans fats are essentially chemical abominations that can no longer be countenanced.For restaurant patrons who long ago learned to avoid butter and skip the bacon, all this amounts to a Hobbesian dilemma. Better saturated fat, the heart-stopping devil you know? Or trans fat, the heart-stopping devil you’ve just been introduced to?No surprise, then, that many people are cynical about the proposed ban. Grand public health gestures make for perilous public relations. Not so long ago, remember, eggs were causing heart attacks. Vegetable oils were causing cancer.And the saturated fats that we’re supposed to be using again — whose idea was it to avoid those? Oh. Right.'"
"'06-10-10,'1','If a patient has aches, pains and fever and has just been to India or an Indian Ocean resort, doctors are being urged to check for a viral disease that even they may have never heard of: chikungunya.Spread by mosquitoes, the virus has been sweeping through southern India and islands in the Indian Ocean, and late last month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said travelers had carried it to Europe and the United States.But epidemics outside the tropics seem unlikely, scientists say, because the mosquitoes that carry the virus thrive mainly in hot, humid regions.In East Africa, where the disease was first identified in the 1950’s, chikungunya (pronounced chick-en-GUN-ya) means “that which bends up” — an apt description of the victims, who are often doubled up with severe muscle and joint pain and suffering from fever, headaches, a rash, nausea and fatigue.The disease is rarely fatal, but the joint pain can last for weeks or months.There is no treatment, and the only way to avoid the disease is to avoid mosquito bites. Since 2004, about 300,000 cases have been reported from islands in the Indian Ocean, including 264,000 from Réunion. Madagascar, Mauritius, the Seychelles and other islands have also had outbreaks. Southern India has had at least 180,000 suspected cases.'"

(BLOOMBERG NEWS)The environmental committee of the European Parliament approved new rules regulating industrial chemicals, foreshadowing a showdown between the European Union and the world’s biggest chemical companies, which argue that the regulations could damage business and hurt global trade. Proposed legislation would require the registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals, which would shift from regulators to businesses the burden of evaluating the safety of 30,000 commonly used chemicals. The rules, intended to protect consumers from potentially hazardous effects of chemicals found in everyday products, are subject to approval by the Parliament as a whole and by member governments. The United States has raised concerns about the costs of adhering to the regulations, and Germany, Britain and France have raised concerns about competitive issues. DAN BILEFSKY (IHT)Goldman Sachs bought a stake in a Russian debt collection agency, Sequoia Credit Consolidation, for an undisclosed sum, the Russian company said. The agency’s chief executive, Yelena Dokuchayeva, said the stake was significant but not controlling; she declined to elaborate. Sequoia said it would use the money to expand in Russia and acquire portfolios of bad debts. “Goldman Sachs has a vast experience of dealing with nonperforming loans in both developed and emerging markets worldwide,” Sequoia’s chairman, Eugene Bernshtam, said in a statement.

Genzyme bid $13.50 a share, up from the bid of $8.55 it made in August, the company said. Millennium won Anormed’s cooperation last month for a buyout at $12 a share, or $515 million. The two companies, both based in Cambridge, Mass., are vying for Anormed’s Mozobil, an experimental treatment for patients with blood cancer. Anormed is based in British Columbia. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)The Jean Coutu Group, a Canadian drugstore chain, posted a first-quarter loss of $108.8 million dollars, mostly as a result of the sale in August of its Brooks and Eckerd drugstore chains in the United States. Jean Coutu, which sold the stores in the United States to the Rite Aid Corporation for $2.6 billion, said the loss came to 42 cents a share and compared with a profit of $11.1 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter included an after-tax impairment loss of $120 million. (REUTERS)'"
"'06-10-11,'0','State laws that make it easy for children to skip school vaccinations may be contributing to whooping cough outbreaks, a study suggests. Forty-eight states allow exemptions for personal or religious beliefs, but they vary as to how much documentation they require. Those with loose policies had about 50 percent more whooping cough cases than stricter states, the study says. And about 50 percent more people got whooping cough in states that allowed personal-belief exemptions compared with those allowing only religious exemptions. The study appears in The Journal of the American Medical Association.'"
"'06-10-11,'0','Mr. Brown is accused in the lawsuit and in supporting documents of paying and organizing notaries, some of whom illegally marked absentee ballots or influenced how the ballots were voted; of publishing a list of voters, all white, accompanied by a warning that they would be challenged at the polls; of importing black voters into the county; and of altering racial percentages in districts by manipulating the registration rolls.To run against the county prosecutor — one of two white officeholders in Noxubee — Mr. Brown brought in a black lawyer from outside the county, according to the supporting documents, who never even bothered to turn on the gas or electricity at his rented apartment. That candidate was disqualified.Whites, who make up just under 30 percent of the population here, are circumspect when discussing Mr. Brown, though he remains a hero to many blacks. When he drove off to federal prison to serve a sentence for tax fraud in 1995, he received a grand farewell from his political supporters and friends, including local elected officials; whites, on the other hand, for years have seen him as a kind of occult force in determining the affairs of the county.Still, many whites said privately they welcomed the Justice Department’s lawsuit, which is scheduled for trial early next year.“In my opinion, it puts the focus on fair play,” said Roderick Walker, the county prosecutor Mr. Brown tried to oust, in 2003. “They were doing something wrong.”Up and down South Jefferson Street, though, in the old brick commercial district, the white merchants refused to be quoted, for fear of alienating black customers. “There’s a lot of voting irregularities, but that’s all I’m going to say,” one woman said, ending the conversation abruptly.The Justice Department’s voting rights expert is less reserved. “Virtually every election provides a multitude of examples of these illegal activities organized by Ike Brown and other defendants, and those who act in concert with them,” the expert, Theodore S. Arrington, chairman of the political science department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, wrote in a report filed with the court.Mr. Brown is coolly dismissive of the case against him. He has no office at the white-columned Noxubee County Courthouse, but that is where he casually greets visitors, in a chair near the entrance. A loquacious man, he both minimizes his own role and portrays himself as a central target. Far from being the vital orchestrator portrayed by the government, “when I was in Maxwell prison in ’95 and ’96, the show went right on,” he said.There are so few whites in the county, Mr. Brown suggests, that the tactics he is accused of are unnecessary to keep blacks in office.“They can’t win anyway unless we choose to vote for them,” he said with a smile. “If I was doing something wrong — that’s like closing the barn door when the horse is already gone.”He sees the lawsuit against him as merely the embittered reaction of whites who feel disenfranchised, and he scoffs at a consent decree signed last year in which county officials agreed not to harass or intimidate white candidates or voters, manipulate absentee ballots, or let poll workers coach voters, among other things. “I wouldn’t sign my name,” Mr. Brown said.But the Justice Department is pressing ahead with its suit, and wants to force Mr. Brown to agree to the same cease-and-desist conditions as his fellow county officials.The state’s Democratic establishment has hardly rallied around Mr. Brown; privately some Democrats here express disdain for his tactics. Instead, he is being defended by a maverick Republican lawyer who sees the suit as an example of undue interference in the affairs of a political party.“To do what they want to do, they would virtually have to take over the Democratic Party,” said the lawyer, Wilbur Colom, adding that Mr. Brown’s notoriety had made him the focus of the investigation. “I believe they were under so much pressure because of Ike’s very sophisticated election operation. He is a Karl Rove genius on the Noxubee County level.”In Jackson, though, a leading light in Mr. Brown’s own party, Mississippi Secretary of State Eric Clark, a longtime moderate in state politics, refused to endorse him.“Anybody who tries to prevent people from voting is breaking the law,” Mr. Clark said. “I certainly suspect some of that has been going on.”Back in Macon, in the shadow of the courthouse green’s standard-issue Confederate monument, Mr. Brown spoke of history: “They had their way all the time. They no longer have their way. That’s what it’s all about.” The case is “all about politics,” he said, “all about them trying to keep me from picking the lock.”But Mr. Walker, the county prosecutor, insisted the past had nothing to do with the case against Mr. Brown. “I wouldn’t sit here and pretend black people haven’t been mistreated,” he said. “I hate what happened in the past. But I can’t do anything about it.”'"
"'06-10-11,'0','ALBANY, Oct. 10 — A federal jury on Tuesday convicted two Muslim immigrants of participating in a plot with a man who said he was helping plan a missile attack on a Pakistani diplomat in New York City in 2004.The man to whom the immigrants were linked was actually an informant working with the F.B.I. in a sting operation against the two defendants, Yassin M. Aref, 36, an Iraqi refugee and the imam at an Albany mosque, and Mohammed M. Hossain, 51, a Bangladeshi immigrant and the owner of a pizzeria here. The gestation of the case, with the government’s informant ingratiating himself with the men and initiating all the conversations about a shoulder-fired rocket launcher, led to claims of entrapment from Mr. Hossain’s lawyers during the three-week trial in Federal District Court.“Obviously we had a couple of individuals that were prone to supporting terrorism,” United States Attorney Glenn T. Suddaby said after the verdict.Mr. Aref, the imam, smiled at his lawyers Tuesday as he left the courtroom in custody. He has been in jail for the past year awaiting trial in the case. Mr. Hossain, who had been free on bail, turned to address the handful of supporters from the Masjid as-Salam Mosque where he and Mr. Aref met several years ago. “Peace is my victory,” he shouted. “God is great. He is watching who is right and who is wrong. Thank you so much to everyone.” He, too, was led away in shackles.Prosecutors argued that he was driven by greed to enter a money-laundering scheme, and the imam by ideology. The defense argued that both men were duped into taking part in a deal they never understood. The garbled words supporting both versions played out before the jury in several hours of surveillance tapes.A lawyer for Mr. Hossain, Kevin A. Luibrand, said that the defendants would appeal, and that the entrapment theory would again be raised. “Before the government arrived on the scene, they were not committing any crimes and were not thinking about committing any crimes,” he said.'"
"'06-10-11,'0','Any decision that limits the rights of workers to have a true voice in the workplace, especially in the health care field, is a bad one and could have a devastating effect on employees in the private and public sector.In rendering this decision, the National Labor Relations Board, which is dominated by Bush appointees, has found an underhanded way to trample on the rights and livelihoods of up to eight million workers.Nurses are on the front lines of the health care system and need a strong voice in the workplace to ensure that patients receive the best quality care.But the board’s decision flies in the face of this logic and punishes nurses for doing their jobs and stepping up when needed.The board, by denying private-sector employees collective bargaining rights, is destroying worker rights instead of protecting them, the exact opposite of what it was created to do.'"
"'06-10-11,'0','“It made me rethink what we do,” Ms. Jones said. “Am I an educator or am I a businessperson?”Her daughter’s college search also persuaded Ms. Jones to begin campaigning among colleagues and parents for new ways to think about the ever more frenzied competition for admission to elite colleges and universities. She describes her goal with simplicity: to lower the flame.An essential part of the effort is a new book, “Less Stress, More Success: A New Approach to Guiding Your Teen Through College Admissions and Beyond.” Published in September, by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the book was written by Ms. Jones and Dr. Kenneth R. Ginsburg, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.Their central theme is that the race to get into the nation’s most selective colleges has produced a stressed-out generation, overscheduled with too many demanding high school courses and myriad extracurricular activities, and burdened by unrealistic parental expectations. The stress is making teenagers ill, physically and emotionally, Ms. Jones and Dr. Ginsburg say.“We are raising children to please adults, and that’s unprecedented,” Ms. Jones said in an interview in her spacious, high-ceilinged office at M.I.T. “I have real fears that this generation is being trained by us to not be creative. We’re training them to put their focus outside of themselves, to make them measure up to everybody else’s standards, and that’s a huge mistake.”“The solution is to give kids more freedom, teach them how to create, set up systems for them to fail and to bounce back,” she added.Her crusade is markedly different from the mission that first brought her to M.I.T.’s admissions office in 1979. She was hired to recruit young women, who at the time made up only 17 percent of the university’s undergraduates. Today, about 45 percent are women.Ms. Jones brought a varied background to the task. She received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in chemistry and biology from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., not far up the Hudson River from her childhood home in Albany. She had worked, as well, as an emergency medical technician and as a torch singer in local clubs, performing Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday songs.She was already living on the M.I.T. campus with her husband, Steve Bussolari, who was then a graduate student, when she was hired as an admissions officer, in what she described as “the lowest job in the office.”The work appealed to her, though, and she clearly had a feel for it. Ms. Jones is enthusiastic about admissions and passionate about working with teenagers. Over time, she said, she performed virtually every job in the office, from overseeing transfer applications to applications from international students. Ms. Jones, who is 55, was appointed dean in 1999.Among her peers, Ms. Jones has developed a reputation as an outspoken advocate for change. She tends to be admired for her boldness, though not every colleague shares her conviction that the competition has become too intense and that it must — or even can— be restrained.“She is a wonderful professional and a good friend, and she has made an enormous contribution at M.I.T.,” said Lee Stetson, dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania. “I don’t really disagree that the situation has become frenzied.”But Mr. Stetson said he was not certain that the hypercompetition could be easily tamed. “I’m not convinced that it’s all our fault,” he said.Ms. Jones said small steps could produce broader shifts in tone and attitude. Like the admissions officers she encountered with her daughter, she used to tell students and parents that M.I.T. rejected lots of applicants with 800 SAT scores. The idea was to indicate how many bright people were at the university, she said, but the message heard by her audiences was quite different.“I learned that the language we speak, admissions speak, adds to the stress,” she said. “The message is not received as it is intended.”She now tells students that they do not need scores of 800 to get into M.I.T.Ms. Jones also oversaw a redesign of M.I.T.’s application form. It used to provide 10 lines for a teenager to list extracurricular activities. But when a high school student asked her why M.I.T. required 10 activities, she realized for the first time that the application was sending an unintended message. The form now provides less space for activities, to convey that the admissions office is looking for involvement, not quantity.The university also began asking applicants to write essays on unusual topics, like what they do simply for pleasure or what they learned from a disappointment or failure. M.I.T. rewrote the internal guidelines it uses to evaluate applicants, putting new emphasis on qualities like resilience and initiative.By themselves, these changes will not diminish the remarkably stiff competition to gain admission to top-ranked universities. Last spring, M.I.T. accepted only 13 percent of 11,373 applicants; at least 85 percent of the applicants were qualified academically, Ms. Jones said. When she first went to work there 27 years ago, M.I.T. admitted about 40 percent of applicants.“I need to do what I can do,” she said. “It’s not everything, but I can do what I can do.”“We’ve been talking about this in the business for a good three years now,” she added. “What are we doing? Why are we so hard-charging? Why are we competing like this? Is it good for students?”Many people in higher education are cheering her on, as are countless high school guidance counselors. “I like what she’s doing, in terms of kids really feeling the stress of this whole process,” said Bob Sweeney, a counselor at Mamaroneck High School in Westchester.“I see too many kids spending all their waking moments throughout high school trying to make themselves into the image and likeness of what they perceive M.I.T. and the other elite schools expect,” Mr. Sweeney said. “That thinking takes its toll on kids, doesn’t leave them much room for error or to enjoy high school.”'"
"'06-10-11,'0','The conclusions drawn by Republicans and Democrats alike sounded a similar theme: People craved substance and not rhetoric, wanting to hear about the nuts and bolts of national issues like health care, local ones like a proposed light rail system and international concerns like a better strategy for the war in Iraq.Anoka, which sits at the confluence of the Rum and Mississippi Rivers, is in the Sixth Congressional District, and voters here take their elections seriously. In 2004, 84 percent of eligible residents in the city voted, well above the national average. Its competitive House race between the Republican Michele Bachmann and the Democrat Patty Wetterling, as well as the United States Senate race between Mark Kennedy, a Republican, and Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, factor heavily in both political parties’ national strategies.President Bush won 52 percent of the vote in Anoka County two years ago. But the county was also an important base of support for Jesse Ventura, who was elected governor as an independent in 1998. The political mix here, and more broadly across the state, led Republicans in September to select the Twin Cities for their 2008 national convention.Randi Barbour is one of the independent-minded voters who have made the state fertile ground for both parties. A waitress at Billy’s Bar and Grill and onetime supporter of Mr. Ventura, Ms. Barbour said she planned to vote Democratic in November because health care was her top concern. She voted for John Kerry, the Democrat, and Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee, in the last two presidential races.Divorced with three adult children, Ms. Barbour, 51, lost her health insurance in 2003, when requirements were tightened for MinnesotaCare, the state insurance program for low-income workers. She said that she now put money away to pay for one comprehensive medical examination a year, and that she kept her fingers crossed for continued good health.“Everybody wants lower taxes and that’s all they care about, when what we really need to be doing is making sure Americans have insurance,” Ms. Barbour said.She said that she was disheartened that the Republican Party had chosen her state for their 2008 convention and that she planned to make a bumper sticker by then that read, “Save Our Blue State.”At Billy’s, political views among the happy-hour crowd ran the gamut.Doug Scanlon, 61, a Vietnam veteran and political independent who recently retired from a career laying floors, said he believed the state was going to lean Democratic in coming elections because of the quagmire in Iraq. Ron Langer, 65, a business owner, said he thought critics of the war had too quickly forgotten the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.“I’d rather see the war over there than over here,” Mr. Langer said.A short walk from Billy’s in the old post office building on Main Street, Carol Thompson said she was thrilled that Republicans chose her state for their next convention. Next to the cash register in her educational supply store, Teacher’s Pet, she keeps a picture of herself standing with President Bush.It was taken in 2004 when Mr. Bush stopped for a chicken salad sandwich at the deli that shares basement space with her store. Without question, said Ms. Thompson, 53, she would vote Republican in next month’s elections because she believes the party is uniquely committed to doing whatever it takes to protect the country.She said she was paying little attention to the Congressional page scandal. But she said she was somewhat troubled that Republican leaders might have known about Representative Mark Foley’s sexually graphic messages to pages and done nothing to remove him from office.Ms. Thompson, a born-again Christian, said she could never support a gay politician or anyone who knowingly covered up his identity. But she would also never skip voting, she said. She trusted that her candidates in Minnesota were far removed from the taint of the scandal.“I’ll be praying a lot about it between now and the vote,” she said. “If the party leaders tried to hide things about Mr. Foley, they will have to answer to the Lord.”Tom Kobelinski, 52, said that at times he felt like a member of a minority in Anoka. Mr. Kobelinski is a Roman Catholic and committed to social justice advocacy; his political philosophy can be easily gleaned from the assortment of books scattered across the dining room table of the modest three-bedroom Cape Cod where he and his wife, Christine, have raised four children.In addition to “Homegrown Democrat” by Garrison Keillor, who was born in Anoka, there is a book commemorating the life of Paul Wellstone, the progressive Democratic senator from Minnesota who was killed in a plane crash in 2002.Mr. Kobelinski, a physical education instructor for developmentally disabled children, said he supported Senator Mark Dayton, a Democrat who is retiring, because he pushed for increased educational spending for students with disabilities. He said he believed that Ms. Klobuchar would continue that commitment and work to bring balance to an educational system that now leans too heavily toward standardized testing.“Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts,” he said, paraphrasing a quote from Albert Einstein. “Testing alone is not enough.”Many Anokans find themselves somewhere in between Ms. Thompson and Mr. Kobelinski.Vickie Wendel, 50, who has worked for the Anoka County Historical Society for 17 years, said she was intensely focused on state and local issues like a proposed new sales tax to finance construction of a stadium for the Minnesota Vikings in Anoka County. She is critical of the sales tax but supportive of a plan that would build a light rail system through the county, easing access to the Twin Cities.Ms. Wendel said she had yet to make a decision in the governor’s race, where the Republican incumbent, Tim Pawlenty, is in a close contest with his Democratic challenger, Mike Hatch, the state’s attorney general. She is also undecided in the Senate race.“I still am looking at the issues one by one,” she said. “Honestly, I am looking for the box marked ‘none of the above.’ ”'"
"'06-10-11,'0','“Gisha calls upon Israel not to prevent Palestinian students from studying just because they are Palestinian,” said the group’s director, Sari Bashi. “No one should be denied access to education based on his or her national identity.”The practice of reviewing student permits has been in effect since 2001, the last time any new Palestinian student was granted a permit, officials said. But before the outright ban began this summer, the army reviewed requests case by case, something it says it will not do now. Gisha is asking that individual reviews be restored.The official ban comes before the beginning of the Israeli academic year at the end of October. But in effect it dates from the Palestinian uprising that began in the fall of 2000, when the security situation began to deteriorate, said Lt. Adam Avidan, a spokesman for civil administration in the West Bank.Hebrew University was the scene of a suicide bombing in July 2002, when a Palestinian blew himself up in a student cafeteria, killing seven people.The Defense Ministry said it was giving the student permit matter special attention, and Israeli officials said they needed to balance the country’s security needs with what they described as the understandable desire of Palestinians to receive an education.Currently 14 Palestinians, all of whom received permits during or before 2001, are students at Israeli universities, Lieutenant Avidan said. They will be allowed to continue their studies. And university records suggest that a small number of students may have been allowed to trickle in beyond that number, Ms. Bashi said.Like Ms. Salameh, most of the students came to Israel seeking doctorates because there are no doctoral programs at Palestinian universities.Palestinians who have money or receive fellowships tend to study abroad for doctorates. But for those without financial support it is an impossible dream, and women who come from traditional Muslim homes are often forbidden by their families to live abroad alone.No figures are available for how many Palestinians studied in Israel in past years, but Israeli officials and Palestinian rights advocates say there appear to have been a higher number before the mid-1990’s, when travel restrictions began to be imposed.Dr. Suheil Ayesh, 43, from the Gaza Strip is among the Palestinians who received a master’s degree and a Ph.D. at Hebrew University. He is now a visiting professor of molecular biology and gene therapy there and divides his time between Jerusalem and Gaza.He is authorized to enter Israel only by permit, which he must renew every month.He is the only Palestinian professor teaching at an Israeli university, he said. Like many other Israeli and Palestinian academics, he is disheartened by the ban, which will make it difficult for future generations of Palestinians to do what he has been able to accomplish: get a quality education, forge ties with Israelis and contribute to a future Palestinian state.“It’s difficult and confusing,” Dr. Ayesh said. “The physical distance between us is a very small one, and cooperation can be so helpful.”Dr. Raphael Levine, the Hebrew University chemistry professor who accepted Ms. Salameh as his student, said he understood Israel’s security concerns but was baffled by the ban. “I think it is in Israel’s interest to strengthen the Palestinian middle class, and strengthening academic institutions in Palestinian areas is one sure way of achieving that,” he said.“There is a Jewish tradition in which value is put on learning; Mr. Ben-Gurion said he wanted Israel to be a shining light to all nations,” he said, referring to Israel’s first prime minister. “You have to deliver on these things.”“Both by sentiment and cold practicality, it is not in our interest to act like this,” Dr. Levine said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where he is teaching at the University of California.Meanwhile, Ms. Salameh, a high school science teacher, continues her life in Anata. She attends meetings as an elected member of the municipal council and is working to set up the village’s first women’s center.She longs to begin work on her doctorate and one day become a role model for other Palestinian women and girls as the first woman to be a Palestinian professor of chemistry in the West Bank.She compared her quest to chemistry. “You have to look for a long time to get answers,” she said. “It is not a direct process. You have to be patient, and therefore I will be patient. I won’t give up.”'"
"'06-10-11,'0','“This state killed Anna Politkovskaya,” Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a once-prominent democratic leader, declared bluntly as the mourners filed out into a cold, gray afternoon.Russia is unquestionably a dangerous place for journalists — less so than only Iraq and Algeria, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Thirteen of them have been killed since Mr. Putin came to power in 2000, a little more than two a year on average.The killings — and the failure to solve them — have created an atmosphere of impunity and violence that extends beyond those whose writings or broadcasts anger those in government or business. That was also lamented here, inside an airy white-stone hall at Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.Ms. Politkovskaya’s killing was the third mob-style assassination of prominence in the last month alone. Andrei Kozlov, the first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, who led efforts to clean up the dirty money of the country’s banking system, was killed as he left a soccer game on Sept. 13. Less than two weeks later, Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of Kovytka, a potentially lucrative gas field in Siberia at the center of a dispute with the government, was shot in the back and head at his bathhouse in the countryside.None of the victims were radicals or revolutionaries, or, to use an old word, dissidents; that is, fringe figures operating outside the established law of the land. They were of the mainstream — representatives of the news media, the government, a major energy company — working at careers in the newly free, democratic and market-oriented country that the collapse of the Soviet Union promised.After each death the ritual of mourning resumes, and little changes. The chief prosecutor, Yuri Y. Chaika, announced this week that he had taken the investigation of Ms. Politkovskaya’s murder under his “personal control,” fulfilling his own part of the ritual, as other prosecutors once took control of other killings, like that of the American journalist Paul Klebnikov in 2004, that nonetheless remain unsolved.Russia’s ombudsman for human rights, Vladimir V. Lukin, noted Tuesday that three years ago he organized the funeral for one of Ms. Politkovskaya’s colleagues, the editor of Novaya Gazeta, Yuri Shchekochikhin, who suffered a fatal allergic reaction to an unknown substance assumed to be a poison.“Now, it happens again,” said Mr. Lukin, one of the few government officials to attend the funeral on Tuesday, though he is hardly one of the highest rank.Ms. Politkovskaya’s funeral, in fact, displayed the deep divisions in today’s Russia between those in power and those not. The mourners included her family and friends, colleagues and politicians, though almost all from outside the center of power, and several foreign diplomats, including Ambassador William J. Burns of the United States, whose governments have denounced her killing far more forcefully than Mr. Putin or any other senior government leaders here.Mr. Putin, traveling in Germany, spoke about her death publicly for the first time on Tuesday, a day after the Kremlin reported that he assured President Bush in a telephone conversation that there would be a thorough investigation. He called her killing “a crime of loathsome brutality.”Then he went on. “I think that journalists should be aware that her influence on political life was extremely insignificant in scale,” Mr. Putin said, according to the news agency Interfax. “She was known in journalist and human rights circles, but her influence on political life in Russia was minimal.”Some of those at the cemetery agreed, though hardly in the sense that Mr. Putin intended. “Our press long ago lost any influence over society,” said Obdurashid Saidov, a journalist from Dagestan, a troubled southern republic.Ms. Politkovskaya became famous for her investigations of the war in Chechnya and its messy, bloody consequences across the Northern Caucasus. Her reports — in Novaya Gazeta and in a book published in 2002 and called “The Second Chechen War” in Russian and “A Small Corner of Hell: Dispatches from Chechnya” in its English translation — served like few others in Russia to challenge the official view of the conflict.And yet, as the war ground on, as Russia moved on, and as some Chechen separatists carried out terrorist acts, attacking theatergoers in Moscow and school children in Beslan, fewer Russians seemed interested in reading about the brutalities of the federal forces that she exposed.The motive for her killing remains a mystery, though few doubt it was related to her work. Alternative theories have emerged. Some have suggested a dark conspiracy by the Kremlin’s opponents to kill her in order to provoke public protests, like those that followed the killing of a prominent journalist in Ukraine, Georgy Gongadze, whose murder in 2000 became a rallying cry of the “Orange Revolution” that swept that country in 2004.One proponent of that line of thinking seems to be Mr. Putin himself. “We have information, and it is reliable,” he said in Dresden on Tuesday, “that many people hiding from Russian justice have long been nurturing the idea of sacrificing somebody in order to create a wave of anti-Russian feeling in the world.”The hall where Ms. Politkovskaya’s coffin lay Tuesday had a capacity of 1,000; hundreds more lined up outside. After a few short eulogies, they filed past, laying flowers in piles that grew high and higher, and then dispersed in the rain.'"
"'06-10-11,'0','New York’s industrial companies provide about 466,000 jobs, but space has become increasingly scarce, especially with the recent rezoning of large swaths of industrial neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Greenpoint in Brooklyn to permit the more lucrative residential development.In Sunset Park, for example, the vacancy rate in industrial buildings was less than 1 percent, said Phaedra Thomas, the executive director of the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation, a nonprofit economic development group.The Bloomberg administration has been aggressively trying to nurture light manufacturing in New York by upgrading city-owned industrial real estate, like the three Bush Terminal buildings; offering tax credits and other incentives; and creating 16 protective zones, where residential conversions are banned, in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx.But the possibility that several hundred jobs may be lost when the city sells the three Bush Terminal buildings has drawn criticism from economic development advocates who otherwise praise the administration’s industrial policy as the best in decades.Jonathan Bowles, the director of the Center for an Urban Future, a New York research organization, said the administration should have given the tenants an opportunity to buy the building or renegotiate their leases before putting the complex on the market.“It doesn’t seem right, what the city is doing,” he said. “It doesn’t seem to jibe with the recent policies to try to help industrial businesses.” But Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the city Economic Development Corporation, said that it would be illegal for the city to negotiate with one group before issuing a request for proposals.Carl Hum, director of the mayor’s 21-month-old Office of Industrial and Manufacturing Businesses, said tenants in the Bush Terminal buildings were paying rents “that you cannot find anywhere else in the city.”Mr. Hum said the city should not be propping up businesses that would not exist if not for the below-market rent. “Our focus is to support businesses that are viable, not businesses with operating costs that are artificially low,” he said. The prospective buyers have all assured the city that they would offer help to the existing tenants, Mr. Hum said.The tenants acknowledge that some of them are paying rents that are well below market rate. Fox Paper, a distributor of plastic and paper party items, moved into Building C 21 years ago, when Sunset Park was plagued by drug dealers and prostitutes. The owner, Larry Fox, said he pays an annual rent of less than $4 a square foot for 35,000 feet on the ground floor.The market rate for such space in older loft buildings is $10 to $12 a square foot, while space on higher floors may go for $6 or $7 a foot, industrial brokers say.Upper-floor tenants, including companies that make high-end furniture, kitchen cabinet doors and lingerie, say they pay $5 or more a square foot for substandard space. The elevator continually breaks down and a power failure can disrupt their business for days, they said.For several years, the business owners in Building C have been month-to-month tenants, frustrated by the city’s unwillingness to grant them leases. But they said the city had never told them it planned to sell the buildings. They say they were shocked when the city Economic Development Corporation informed them by letter on June 26 that it would issue a request for proposals for the building that very day.Undaunted, Mr. Shomer, who has been in his building for six years, decided to take action. “I got a crazy idea. I got the guys together and said, ‘Let’s buy the building.’ ”But a group of tenants would not have met the city’s criteria for prospective buyers. So instead, the tenants sought help from local politicians and business assistance groups. Ms. Thomas’s group, Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Corporation, steered them to several potential buyers, including the Fifth Avenue Committee, a local nonprofit developer with extensive experience in low-cost housing. The tenants selected Fifth Avenue, which agreed to offer each tenant a 10-year lease with an option to buy.“It was smart to get the Fifth Avenue Committee involved,” Ms. Thomas said. “They have access to creative financing tools.”The Fifth Avenue bid includes Building C and the better-maintained Building B, where a manufacturing company called Fixture Hardware has been a tenant since 1947. “If I have to move, I’d close the business,” said the owner, Kenneth L. Weiss. (A plastics company that is the lone tenant in the third building filed a separate proposal to buy that property.)State Senator Martin J. Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, said he was a strong supporter of the Fifth Avenue bid. “It’s unusual to see businesses organizing for their own self-preservation,” he said.Mr. Golden also helped persuade the city Economic Development Corporation to buy a long-vacant 1.1-million-square-foot building on Third Avenue at 30th Street in Sunset Park from the federal government to create more space for local industrial businesses. With its partner, the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit business assistance group, the city is selecting a developer for the building.Construction on the Third Avenue site is not expected to begin until 2008. But the administration can already point to some successes in its campaign to help light industry. Since April 2005, the city has stepped up its enforcement against illegal conversions of industrial buildings to other uses, Mr. Hum said. The city Buildings Department has issued 470 violations involving more than 70 buildings, said Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman. Sixteen stop-work orders have been issued, she said.Ross F. Moskowitz, a real estate partner at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, said he advised clients not to bother seeking variances in the 16 areas designated as industrial business zones, “where the administration has clearly articulated a policy of maintaining a manufacturing base.”There is no question that the new policies have “thrown a bit of cold water on the market” for conversions, said Brian T. Coleman, chief executive of the Greenpoint Manufacturing Design Center, a nonprofit real estate company that develops industrial space. But he and other advocates for industrial businesses said they worried that the new industrial business zones might not outlast the Bloomberg administration.“At least for the time being,” Mr. Coleman said, “the Wild West conditions that existed before I.B.Z.’s will no longer be tolerated.”'"
"'06-10-11,'0','He was a gourmand, but he was not a snob, at least when it came to matters of food and wine. He loved it all, and he loved it in enormous amounts — and never more so than when he was sharing a table with his wife, Betsey, who shared his tastes, his sense of humor and his adventurous approach to food.He was as happy eating chicken gizzards at a dusty dive he found in Nashville as he was slurping down dumplings stuffed with foie gras and shiitakes at Blue Ginger in Wellesley, Mass. He loved his oysters raw and he loved them stewed and he loved them deep-fried. When he was the Washington bureau chief for The Times he had lunch with a few colleagues and Barbra Streisand at a suite at the Jefferson Hotel near the White House. Ms. Streisand has always had a strong interest in politics and in Johnny’s writing, and knowing of his reputation she arrived with a bottle of a California cabernet.As the story was later told, Ms. Streisand said, “When should we open it?”“Any time before you drink it!” Johnny replied with a loud chortle.In a business in which reporters tend to guard their personal opinions when writing about politics, Johnny compensated by having, and sharing, strong views on all matters having to do with food and wine.Dining at the Summer Shack in Boston? One had to order Jasper’s pan-roasted lobster. (Upon sitting for dinner he made clear that this was being attended to by Jasper White himself, and that it was not open to discussion.) In Cancún? There is only one place to eat: a pizzeria on the roundabout on the main drag.In Des Moines, Iowa, during the 2004 caucuses, we had dinner at the 801 Steak & Chop House, where Johnny ordered pork chops. A young Times reporter, out to impress the boss, ordered a dozen oysters. Johnny shot him a withering, “what are you thinking of, ordering oysters at an Iowa steakhouse” look. The judgment was borne out with the delivery of a bland and watery plate of Wellfleets.He scoffed at the notion that one should drink the best of the wine first. Save it for last, he said, and savor it like a dessert. So it was that he brought a 1964 Burgundy, a Vosne-Romanée, I believe, from his extraordinary collection (a bottle that he no doubt bought in the 1960’s) to an engagement dinner of some friends — noting, but not bragging, that he had seen this same wine go for auction that week for about $650. He instructed the waiter to open it and put it aside until we had finished our meal. Never had I enjoyed a glass of wine as much as I did that night.His very last e-mail message, sent the night before he died, was a response to a Times food writer looking for suggestions on pancake recipes for a magazine feature. “Just very quickly since I don’t have my files here,” Johnny wrote. “1. American pancakes — Overrated, as you say. You might try the Bongo Room, in Wicker Park, north of Chicago. 2. Don’t forget Breton buckwheat crepes. 3. From South Asia (states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in India): they make great dosas.”Johnny was the person to call for a restaurant recommendation when heading anywhere around the globe. To his eternal credit, he never kept secrets; he wrote about the places he discovered and loved. I soon learned a trick to find his recommendations without pestering him: I would search Nexis using three elements: his byline, the name of a city and the phrase “my wife, Betsey.”Dining with Johnny had advantages beyond his elastic expense account. A newspaper restaurant critic strains not to be recognized. But Johnny made no secret of who he was (as if that were possible); he loved being recognized and feted as a celebrity. That was always a treat for his dinner companions: it meant a personal visit by the chef, the most intricate discussion with the sommelier about the most obscure wines, then a shower of dishes from the kitchen, most of them unavailable to the civilians in the house.As a student working on my college newspaper I avidly followed Johnny’s coverage of the 1976 campaign, during which he established himself as one of his generation’s great political reporters. After I found myself working with him at the same newspaper, improbably enough, I could never decide what I found more unnerving: working at a desk next to him on election night, sitting next to him at a restaurant or, eventually, cooking for him in my kitchen.But the last proved easy and immensely pleasurable; in truth, having Johnny to dinner proved to be a more profitable experience for the host than the guest. Johnny and Betsey came over a few months back, after he was ill but when he was weathering it well. He offered to bring wine, and, not having been born yesterday, I readily agreed. Johnny showed up not with one bottle of wine but 10. And not any wine but a 1982 Bordeaux, one of the best vintages of the past century, a Château Haut-Bages Averous Pauillac that he plucked from his extensive collection. “You can’t take it with you,” he said, cheerfully.Nine of us managed to get through most of that wine that night. I put one bottle aside, for the next time Johnny and Betsey came to dinner. That was, as it turned out, his last night in our dining room. But one evening before the end of the 2008 presidential campaign — an election that we will, sadly, have to chronicle without the presence of R. W. Apple Jr. — I will uncork that 1982 Bordeaux from the Apple cellar and raise a toast to a man who taught us all about writing and reporting, yes, but also about living. And living very well.'"
"'06-10-11,'0','Barbara Ehrenreich’s voyage into the world of the working poor made headlines when her book about her low-wage service jobs came out in 2001. A best seller, “Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America” was adapted in 2002 into a play that is only now being given its New York premiere, by the 3Graces Theater Company.There is nothing dated about the subject, when Congress has not raised the federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour since 1997, or, as a character in the play says about looking for an apartment, “There’s just no place left in this town for working people to live.”In her book Ms. Ehrenreich, a writer and academic, says about America in the age of the bottom line and welfare reform, “The poor have disappeared from the culture at large, from its political rhetoric and intellectual endeavors.”The play, with its exhausted fast-food cooks, waitresses, house cleaners, big-box-store saleswomen, and their striving managers happy to withhold the last penny from those they supervise, should offer one way into that missing public dialogue. But despite several excellent performances by the cast and a live band that is fitfully effective, the production at the Bank Street Theater is less promising than it might be.In basing the play on Ms. Ehrenreich’s work, Joan Holden, a former longtime dramatist with the San Francisco Mime Troupe, by necessity has condensed the material, but the individuals the reader meets in the book tend to emerge as familiar types on the stage: the wives bullied by husbands at home and male bosses at work; a wealthy woman who looks down on her help.The 11 cast members play various characters, with the exception of Margot Avery, who portrays Barbara, identified in the program as “a social critic and journalist.” Tossing her chic, steel-gray curtain of hair, Ms. Avery’s narrator came across on a recent night as somewhat pompous and self-involved, and though quick to side with the victims of “management by stress,” a bit of a bore.'"

"'06-10-12,'1','A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers on Thursday.RUSSIAN I.P.O.’s WRESTLE WITH MARKET: The Russian I.P.O., Uralkaly, on Wednesday cancelled distribution of the company’s shares to the London and Moscow stock exchanges after refusing to sell stocks at what company managers said was an undervalued market price. The boom period for Russian I.P.O.’s, when companies could sell shares for huge returns, has passed, traders said. According to traders and analysts, investor relations with Russian I.P.O.’s have soured; investors have stopped purchasing Russian stocks solely on the basis of their novelty.ANTIFASCIST ACTIVIST’S KILLERS CHARGED: The St. Petersburg prosecutor’s office announced on Wednesday the completion of an investigation into the murder in 2005 of a member of the antifascist group, Antifa, by supposed skinheads. The prosecutor’s office has charged at least seven people with hooliganism and committing hate crimes. A 19-year-old St. Petersburg resident has also been charged with murder and attempted murder. In November 2005, several young people attacked Timur Kacharava, a well-known antifascist activist. He was stabbed six times.RUSSIAN ‘SPY’ IN VILNIUS NAMED: Lithuanian media on Wednesday released the name of a Russian diplomat accused of spying. Oleg Ryabchikov, the first secretary at the Russian embassy in Vilnius, is accused of trying to pressure Lithuania for its support of Georgia and may be expelled from the country, Latvian media reported. The newspaper wrote that the Lithuanian government officially notified Moscow of its position on Wednesday, but officials in Vilnius have released few details. Russian diplomats called Lithuania’s behavior strange: countries normally settle such issues privately, without the involvement of the media. In this case, Lithuanian media broke the story on Sunday.KADYROV NOT READY FOR PRESIDENCY: Ramzan A. Kadyrov, Chechnya’s prime minister, announced Wednesday that he was not yet ready to become the republic’s president. Mr. Kadyrov, the newspaper wrote, is Chechnya’s “number one man,” though officially the president has more powers. In the days before Mr. Kadyrov’s 30th birthday, the minimum age for becoming president, rumors spread that the prime minister would quickly replace Alu Alkhanov, Chechnya’s president, with the Kremlin’s support.NO ROOM FOR TWO PARTIES OF POWER? United Russia pounced on its new, pro-Kremlin rivals for the first time on Wednesday, the newspaper said. Party deputies filed an appeal with the Prosecutor General’s office accusing Sergei Mironov, the Federation Council speaker and head of the newly formed “actual left” party bloc, of pressuring local officials in the run-up to elections in Sverdlovsk Oblast. According to the newspaper, “both wings of power” have exhibited a lack of patience in forming a two-party system.PUTIN PUSHES FOR VISA REPEAL: President Vladimir V. Putin raised the “burning question” of annulling the visa requirement between Russia and the European Union on Wednesday in Dresden. If successful, the newspaper wrote, Mr. Putin would probably become the “hero of our day.” Mr. Putin promised that Russia would do everything necessary to secure an open border for Russian and European Union citizens. Nevertheless, even Germany, Russia’s closest partner in Europe, appeared unprepared to take this step.CRITICAL GROUPS TO RECEIVE GOVERNMENT FUNDING: The newspaper reported that newly released government information undermined claims by “opposition media” that officials bypassed critical nongovernmental organizations for federal funding. Though well-known human rights groups like Memorial and For Human Rights were excluded, government officials did select for funding an organization headed by Maria Gaidar, a Kremlin critic. Many professional civic organizations were unwilling to accept government funding according to an unnamed source in the government.'"

"'06-10-12,'1','Sequoia Capital, the marquee Silicon Valley venture capital firm, is not the only investor that is poised to score big when Google completes its $1.65 billion buyout of the Internet video-sharing site YouTube.Artis Capital Management, a hedge fund based in San Francisco, invested alongside Sequoia in the second round of financing in April 2006, when YouTube received $8 million, according to regulatory filings. Individuals also received small stakes in the company, said Roelof Botha, a South African and the Sequoia partner who led its investments in YouTube.Previously, YouTube had identified only Sequoia as an investor. In a news release in April that is still on its Web site, YouTube said it had “received $8 million in Series B funding from Sequoia Capital.”“They are a family business,” Mr. Botha said of Artis. “They didn’t have a desire to be in the limelight.” He would not say how much Artis had invested.A spokeswoman for YouTube, Julie Supan, said Artis “chose to remain behind the scenes.”John Milani, chief operating officer at Artis, declined to comment on Tuesday. Regulatory filings show that at the end of June, Artis managed more than $1.2 billion in investments. Its backing of YouTube was reported in PE Week, a newsletter and online service owned by Thomson Financial.Mr. Botha described Artis as “primarily a hedge fund that also invests in private companies as a passive investor.”'"

"'06-10-12,'1','Visa held about a 60 percent share of credit and debit purchases in 2005 compared with 27 percent for MasterCard, according to The Nilson Report, a newsletter for the credit card industry. As of June 30, Visa reported $771 billion in transactions in 2006, compared with $411 billion for MasterCard.“By any measurement, Visa looks more desirable than MasterCard as an I.P.O.,” said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report. “It has a better, more advanced network, and it sees a lot more traffic on that network.”The most immediate beneficiaries of a Visa stock offering could be its large member banks — including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and J. P. Morgan Chase — which could recognize hundreds of millions in capital gains if they sell part of their Visa ownership stake, even as the overall card industry continues to slow. For example, both Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, two of the largest MasterCard member banks, recognized one-time gains worth more than $100 million in the second quarter from stock sales related to the MasterCard offering.By retaining public ownership, the payment associations’ members might also be seeking to mitigate their liability in future suits. Retailers have filed suit against both Visa and MasterCard, accusing them and their member banks of illegally fixing the transaction fees that merchants pay with every purchase.Visa and MasterCard settled one such suit, led by Wal-Mart Stores, in 2003, paying about $3 billion. Another, filed by Kroger and other grocery and convenience store companies, is still pending.Eric E. Wasserstrom, an analyst with UBS, wrote in a research note yesterday that Visa’s move, like MasterCard’s, was driven in part by an effort to “improve its future legal posture.”Visa said it intended to sell a majority of shares to the public, but offered no specific figure, nor how much it intended to raise. The initial public offering, which the company said should happen in the next 12 to 18 months, will follow a reorganization that will centralize its North American and most of its international operations in one company, Visa Inc., but leave its Western Europe businesses in the hands of its member banks.The decision to go public highlights the intense rivalry between Visa and MasterCard. Visa began as BankAmericard, started in 1958 by Bank of America in California. Bank of America began licensing the card nationally eight years later, about the time that a group of banks created what later became MasterCard.Visa, which processes more than half of all credit card transactions in the United States, is solely owned by its members, from small credit unions to well-known global banks. With increased pressure from Wall Street to increase profit margins and less influence from its members, the “banks may have to pay a little more from their services,” said Mr. Posner of Morgan Stanley.Over the next 12 to 18 months, Visa will need to gain approval for the offering from its member banks, and find a new chief executive officer and independent directors. It must also legally merge its regional boards and decide on which exchange it will publicly trade.'"

The doors opened at 8 a.m. and the crowd ignored officers’ instructions to stay calm, the police said. One passer-by said he had seen fights break out among the crowd. The federal housing program, known as Section 8, provides subsidies that low-income people can use to rent market-rate housing.

Some of those inquiries came from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has demanded a thorough review of operations at the plant, which has been plagued by underground leaks of radioactive water and failures of its emergency siren system. Yesterday, Mrs. Clinton said she was not completely satisfied with the commission’s announcement. “I continue to believe that a full and independent safety assessment is necessary to address public concerns about the plant,” she said.

"'06-10-12,'1','WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 — The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said his office contacted the Senate ethics committee on Wednesday and offered to correct his financial disclosure statements if they misrepresented his ties to a land deal in his home state in which his family made a profit of about $700,000.In a statement, Mr. Reid did not acknowledge errors in the disclosure forms but said he was ready to make a “technical correction” if the ethics committee determined that adjustments were needed.The contact with the committee was prompted by an article released Wednesday by The Associated Press that suggested Mr. Reid might have violated Congressional ethics rules by failing to disclose financial transactions involving two adjoining land parcels on the outskirts of Las Vegas that he and his family bought in 1998 for about $400,000.According to a timeline provided by the senator’s staff, Mr. Reid’s family owned one of the properties outright and the second with a friend, Jay Brown, a prominent Las Vegas lawyer who had worked in the casino industry.In 2001, the timeline showed, ownership of the land was transferred to a holding company, Patrick Lane LLC, named for a street near the properties, as part of effort to rezone the area for development of a shopping center. Mr. Reid became a partner in the holding company. After the rezoning was approved, the land was sold for $1.6 million, with $1.1 million directed to Mr. Reid as his share, a return of about $700,000 on the investment.'"

He said Yum could eventually have as many as 10,000 restaurants in China, “so there’s a lot of room to run.” Yum now has more than 2,400 locations in China.International operating profit rose 22 percent. The company forecast annual profit of at least $2.89 a share, raising it from a previous estimate of as much as $2.83.'"
"'06-10-12,'1','The illnesses are a price of success. Nearly 80 percent of children and teenagers with cancer now live at least five years, and many are cured. Before the 1970’s, few survived. Today, there are about 270,000 long-term survivors of childhood cancer in the United States. But the strong measures needed to kill cancer can eventually take their toll on normal cells and organs as well, especially when added to the usual declines that occur with aging.It may seem cruel to give more bad news to people who have already been through one dreadful ordeal, but cancer experts say the picture is not all bleak. Many of the later conditions are treatable, especially if found early, so patients can help themselves by realizing they are at risk, finding out what therapies they received (some are riskier) and having regular checkups with doctors who understand the delayed effects of chemotherapy and radiation.“I think there is much we can do to maximize their health,” Dr. Oeffinger said. “There is a silver lining.”But he also said that relatively few patients received the care they needed, especially when they stopped seeing cancer specialists and switched to internists or family doctors.“Most are not followed on a regular basis,” Dr. Oeffinger said. “Most clinicians are not aware of the risks.”The report, from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, is not the first to blame cancer treatments for later illnesses. But it is the most comprehensive, including 10,397 young people treated at 26 hospitals in the United States and Canada from 1970 to 1986 and, for comparison, 3,034 of their healthy siblings.The patients had cancer before age 21 and survived for at least five years. When studied, they ranged in age from 18 to 48, and the siblings from 18 to 56.“This is the first time that anybody has been able to quantify the overall incidence of chronic illness, and it did surprise me that it was this high,” said Dr. Leslie L. Robison, another author of the study and the chairman of epidemiology and cancer control at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis.Among the cancer survivors, 62 percent had at least one chronic health problem, compared with 37 percent of their siblings. About 28 percent of survivors had illnesses that were severe, life-threatening or disabling, compared with 5 percent of siblings. Almost 24 percent of survivors but only 5 percent of siblings had three or more ailments.Despite the high rates of illness, many survivors are upbeat.“Even though 60-some percent had problems, the majority said, ‘We’re doing fantastic,’ ” said Dr. Ann C. Mertens, an author of the study and an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. “I’d say it’s the resiliency factor. They’ve had a brush with a very serious disease, and they come out the other side and say life is good.”Sometimes the damage from chemotherapy can set in quickly. Samantha Eisenstein, 28, had surgery and intensive chemotherapy for a large tumor in her shinbone in 2000, when she was 21 and a senior in college. Less than a year after finishing the treatment, Ms. Eisenstein developed a condition called myelodysplastic syndrome, a precursor to leukemia, almost certainly caused by the cancer drugs. She needed more chemotherapy, of a different type, and a bone marrow transplant.“I celebrated five years of remission in August,” she said.Ms. Eisenstein works full time at a charity organization that she started (thesamfund.org) to help other young adults with cancer, and she plans to marry next spring. But first she needs more surgery, to repair a fracture in the leg where the cancer started.“I plan to dance at my own wedding,” she said.She hopes to have children but is unsure whether she will be able to, because chemotherapy often shuts down the ovaries. “I think it probably will not happen, but in the back of my head there’s a tiny little part that’s still hoping,” Ms. Eisenstein said, adding that she had put off having her ovarian function tested.Early in their relationship, she told her fiancé that she might be infertile, figuring, she said, “if this is going to be deal breaker, let it be a deal breaker now.”“ ‘You know,’ ” she said he replied, “ ‘there are a lot of kids out there who need a home.’ ”Dr. Oeffinger said that by the 1980’s and 90’s, doctors were trying to modify children’s cancer treatments in hopes of lessening severe side effects.“Back in the 1970’s, whole brain radiation was very effective for preventing recurrences in leukemia,” he said. “It was one of the major advances in being able to cure the disease. But it led to significant cognitive deficits, problems with I.Q. loss, especially in those treated at a young age.”By the 80’s, Dr. Oeffinger said, hospitals had lowered the dose or quit using the technique. But even without radiation, chemotherapy can still cause learning problems, he said.It became clear in the 90’s that high doses of radiation to the chest, often used to treat Hodgkin’s disease in children, could predispose girls to breast cancer, even by age 30.Today, doctors avoid irradiating girls’ breasts whenever possible, and women who had such treatment are advised to have yearly breast cancer screenings — preferably with magnetic resonance imaging instead of mammograms, to avoid more radiation, Dr. Oeffinger said.When it comes to learning about the results of research on survivors, many patients feel torn.Allan Goldberg, 39, who had a rare type of cancer on his palate when he was 12, said: “Part of you wants to not think about it, and part of you is like, ‘Yeah, I should.’ There’s a fine balance between living your life not in fear and being prudent.”Mr. Goldberg, who lives in Vail, Colo., competes in triathlons and directs a camp that runs free kayaking trips for young adults with cancer (firstdescents.org).Despite 20 years of working with other cancer patients, Mr. Goldberg did not learn until eight or nine years ago that he was at risk for heart disease and bladder cancer because of his treatments.“I’m a fairly educated individual and I didn’t know about this,” he said. “I felt stupid.”Just two weeks ago tests, found that the back pain he was attributing to a sports injury was because of cancerous growths on his vertebrae. Doctors suspect that the cancer spread there from a tumor that formed in his salivary glands because of the radiation he received long ago.The growths seem to be dormant, and Mr. Goldberg is hoping that they do not need treatment.'"
"'06-10-12,'1','Bank of America, seeking to attract new clients, said yesterday that it was offering free online stock trades to customers with accounts of at least $25,000, sending shares of discount brokers lower.The bank said customers in New York, Boston and other cities in the Northeast would be allowed 30 free trades a month so long as they maintained the minimum balance in any combination of accounts. Such trades usually cost $5 to $10, meaning customers could save as much as $3,600 a year. Bank of America said the program, which is effective immediately, would be extended nationwide over the next few months.Online brokers “will probably have to follow suit” with price cuts, said Thomas Kaylor, an analyst at the CRT Capital Group in Stamford, Conn. “By giving away free trades, it reduces some of the incentive customers have for moving assets over to online brokers.”Bank of America’s move heightens competitive pressures that have already forced the Charles Schwab Corporation, TD Ameritrade Holding and ETrade Financial to cut commissions sharply. Bank of America expects to recover the cost of free trades by persuading customers to sign up for fee-paying products like mortgages and checking accounts, services that not all discount brokers can match.The prospect of customer losses and lower profits sent shares of Schwab, the biggest discount broker, down 4.7 percent, to $17.22. Another large discount broker, TD Ameritrade, dropped 12 percent, to $16.82. ETrade, the No. 4 online broker, fell 8.8 percent, to $22.31. Shares of Bank of America fell 59 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $54.04.ETrade, TD Ameritrade and Schwab said they did not currently plan to cut commissions, and ETrade’s chief operating officer, Jarrett Lilien, said that he did not expect to lose customers.'"
"'06-10-12,'1','OTTAWA, Oct. 11 — BCE, formerly one of the largest holding companies in Canada, said Wednesday that it would dissolve and turn its Bell Canada telecommunications unit into Canada’s largest income trust.BCE was created 23 years ago to avoid regulatory conflicts for Bell and went on to hold major stakes in several companies including Northern Telecom (later Nortel) as well as TransCanada Pipelines. Until recently it controlled a media company that included CTV, Canada’s largest private broadcaster, and The Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto.“There’s no doubt the winding down of BCE certainly does mark the end of an era in Canadian business, but the fact is, BCE was a company that was created for another time,” the chief executive, Michael J. Sabia, said Wednesday in a conference call. “Our strategy has been all about focus on Bell. That’s the business we know, and that’s the business we will stick to.”Given BCE’s market value of about 25.8 billion Canadian dollars ($22.9 billion), Bell Canada will be by far the biggest company to convert to an income trust. About 247 companies with a total market value of close to 200 billion Canadian dollars have made the switch so far.After companies convert to income trusts, they pay most of their earnings directly to unit holders and avoid most corporate tax.'"
"'06-10-12,'1','The private equity firm Apollo Management said yesterday that it would pay $990 million in cash for Jacuzzi Brands Inc., taking private the well-known maker of whirlpool baths.Shareholders would receive $12.50 a share, a 20.8 percent premium to Jacuzzi’s closing price of $10.35 on Tuesday.Apollo said it would combine Jacuzzi’s lesser-known commercial plumbing business with the Rexnord Corporation, a business Apollo bought a few months ago from the Carlyle Group, another private equity firm.The plumbing business, called Zurn Industries, provides less of Jacuzzi’s sales than its bath business but is far more profitable. It had sales of $315.9 million in the first nine months of the year and operating profit of $65.5 million while the spa business sales were $573 million with operating income of $28.7 million.The company posted a loss of $3.9 million in the third quarter.George Sherman, nonexecutive chairman of Rexnord, would become nonexecutive chairman of Jacuzzi Brands and would be a co-investor with Apollo. Once Apollo buys Jacuzzi, Rexnord will pay Apollo $950 million for the company.The remaining part of Jacuzzi — a name that has become synonymous with hot tubs or the whirlpool baths it introduced four decades ago — will become part of Apollo.'"
"'06-10-12,'1','Wheat prices rose to a 10-year high yesterday as a worsening drought in Australia increased the chances that the country’s crop would be cut by more than half.Analysts estimate that the wheat crop in Australia, one of the world’s largest wheat exporters, might fall to 10.5 million metric tons, a decline of 58 percent from last year’s crop.AWB Ltd., Australia’s monopoly wheat seller, stopped exports from the country’s east coast to conserve supply, worsening a global shortage after Ukraine halted export licenses Oct. 3.“With the shortfall that’s developed in the Australian crop, since they’re one of the leading exporters, people are worried availability is going to be reduced,” said Dale Gustafson, a senior grain analyst at Citigroup Global Markets in Chicago.Wheat for December delivery rose for the second time in three days by the exchange’s limit of 30 cents, or 6 percent, to $5.31 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are up 55 percent from a year ago and 14 percent so far this week, a move that, if it stands up, would be the biggest weekly gain since July 1975.In Australia’s wheat-growing region, no rain was forecast for the next five days and temperatures will be above normal, worsening crop damage, said Meteorlogix, a weather service based in Lexington, Mass.'"
"'06-10-12,'1','Not all the programs are free. But even the ones that come with a fee — the Kogod School of Business at American University, for example, charges companies $5,000 — can be a godsend for time- and cash-short small businesses looking for a helping hand. M.B.A. students work on anything from creating a new business plan to tackling succession issues, providing resources that many businesses “simply wouldn’t have access to otherwise,” said Doreen Shanahan, Pepperdine’s Education to Business program director.Why are so many M.B.A. schools doing this? Quite simply, the programs are a response to the wishes of employers who are looking to hire M.B.A.’s with more hands-on experience. “Companies need graduates to hit the ground running, to be better able to apply business theory immediately,” Mr. Fernandes said.At the same time, there’s no cookie-cutter model for these programs. At Pepperdine, for example, as Mr. Pachl discovered, there’s a competition, in which students all tackle a problem faced by the same company, dividing up into teams to devise a proposal. It is also a required course. On the other hand, American University has an elective, in which faculty members choose companies to work with, then advertise each project to students and select teams from applicants.Occasionally, projects also develop from a professor’s particular areas of interest. Four years ago, David Gay, a professor of economics at the Sam M. Walton College of Business Administration at the University of Arkansas, who studies the economics of the wine industry, decided the wineries in the area would make a good consulting project. So, he approached the Arkansas Wine Producers’ Council, a group of five small family-owned wineries, about using his class to study how the industry could attract more tourism.The companies agreed, and Professor Gay then worked with his students to divide the assignment into small pieces: marketing, legal issues, technology and the like. At the end of the semester, the class made a final presentation to the consortium, with suggestions ranging from starting a Web site to using so-called neck holders on bottles, with information about each wine.In most cases, faculty or program administrators start off by working with companies to fine-tune the focus of the project. That is especially important for small businesses, according to the schools. “They’re so stretched on multiple levels, they often come to us with extremely broad requests,” said Robert Krapfel, associate professor of marketing at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. “My job is to home in and narrow the scope.”Consider Travis Schneider, founder of a three-year-old company, StarBrand Media, in Pacific Palisades, Calif., which provides an online shopping source for fashions and other products featured in television shows and movies. Last spring, he worked with Pepperdine’s program to devise a marketing strategy, focusing on how to make the brand more interesting to consumer-products companies. But, when he first approached the school, “He just told us, he wanted to grow revenues,” Ms. Shanahan said. Through a series of meetings, the two came up with a more narrow focus.Not every small business that wants to participate in these programs is appropriate, however. Take the University of Arkansas. Situated down the road from the headquarters of Wal-Mart, it is surrounded by offices of major corporations, which provide the majority of the applicant pool. More important, participating businesses have to be facing a challenge appropriate for high-level analysis. In most cases, companies must also be past the start-up stage, with a product they have already brought to market.Of course, there are downsides. A big one has to do with timing. “If a business needs advice tomorrow and it’s springtime, they may be out of luck if the class isn’t meeting until the fall,” said James Nolen, senior lecturer in the finance department at the McCombs School of Business of the University of Texas at Austin. There’s also the time commitment. Businesses have to be prepared to meet with students throughout the semester.Another potential problem is the students’ level of sophistication. Even those with a few years of work under their belt probably lack the experience and industry knowledge of a more conventional consultant.Still, there are ways around some of these issues. To streamline the process, for example, a team usually picks one student to be the leader, responsible for funneling questions to a point person at the company.Daniel Abraham took another tack. Mr. Abraham is the chief executive of Fortius One, a one-year-old firm based in Washington that provides analysis for business decisions involving geography. He recently worked with a team of students at the University of Maryland to study which of six specific vertical markets the company should enter. To make sure the students were as focused as possible, he kicked off the project by developing separate mission statements laying out the needs that each market had to address.“If I didn’t do that, I think it might have ended up being a waste of time,” he said. Ultimately, according to Mr. Abraham, the students came up with many useful insights that helped the company decide which areas to focus on first.Ultimately, many small businesses say the pros simply outweigh the cons. “We got some fresh ideas from a group of 20-somethings at a tremendous cost savings,” Mr. Pachl said. “I’ve already told the school, next time they’re looking for a new project to work on, we’ll do it again.”'"

While it does not have a full keyboard, it can be used to send e-mail, browse the Internet and listen to music. It also has Bluetooth wireless networking and a Micro SD memory expansion slot.Clad in black plastic and featuring music buttons on the front, the 3125 is fairly austere. A 1.2-inch screen lights up to display a song name or identify a caller. Opening the phone reveals punched metal keys much like the Motorola Razr’s and a 2.2-inch color display.The software has contact management tools and a calendar that synchronizes with a Windows PC. The phone is available online and in Cingular stores for about $150 with a new contract.While you can’t use the 3125 to ask Scotty to beam you up, you can check your e-mail, then call Mom to pick you up from soccer practice.

"'06-10-12,'1','The iPod may be the market leader in portable music players, but it has plenty of competitors. In recognition of that, some companies are delivering products that work with both iPods and other MP3 players.Among them is Logitech’s new FreePulse Wireless Bluetooth headphones, which also eliminate the headphone cord. Because few music players have built-in Bluetooth, the FreePulse comes with a Bluetooth transmitter that fits into a standard headphone jack.The headset, made of very light carbon spring steel, fits behind the head rather than over it. Logitech says that you can hear music up to 33 feet away from the player, but in informal tests the range was much farther. Unfortunately you can’t control your music from the headphones, just the volume. The FreePulse is available for less than $100 at www.logitech.com and major retail and online outlets.As with all devices with rechargeable batteries, the headphones require yet another power plug, but a dual-headed cable lets you charge both the headset and the transmitter simultaneously.

"'06-10-12,'1','It was a season of bags and shoes, as Suzy Menkes pointed out in The International Herald Tribune. In some instances, as at the Christian Lacroix show here, this point was put across so baldly that each model sashayed down a vivid green runway, stopped for the cameras and then, apparently as instructed, awkwardly held out her purse.“I used to say to Bernard Arnault, ‘It’s not as if I get up every morning, look in the mirror while I’m shaving and ask, ‘What can I sketch today that will lose Bernard the most money?’ ” Mr. Lacroix said, referring to the president of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, a company from which the designer has parted ways. Now with the backing of a venture capital fund, Mr. Lacroix seemed determined not to repeat past mistakes.“After all,” he said, “we are here to sell clothes.”That is only partly true. We are here — and this includes what at this point is a fairly complicit fashion press — to sell images and to assist in promoting the “narratives” at the core of most brands. Although these stories typically originate in the biography of some real person (the shrewd and gifted and hardheaded peasant Coco Chanel, say, or the Polish refugee who founded Celine), their elaboration on a grand scale is the work of people more likely to turn up in the business section than in the pages of style.It would be simplistic at this point to think of men like Mr. Arnault or François Pinault, the founder of PPR, which owns the Gucci Group, merely as billion-dollar bean counters when the luxury companies they run have reshaped tastes and cultures across broad swaths of the planet.When you consider that the net effect of all the frothy although deeply earnest stuff that goes on during runway season is to sell a perfume atomizer or key case to someone in Kuala Lumpur, the creativity of John Paul Gaultier or John Galliano or Alexander McQueen or Rei Kawakubo begins to seem anachronistic and even quaint.“The challenge for designers right now is to be super creative and super innovative and yet to realize that this is a business,” Glenda Bailey, the editor of Harper’s Bazaar, said last week before the Chanel show. The dominant trend of the season, she added, is that “designers have to create items that are truly desirable.” And, if that is so, then Chanel was distinctly on message.The show was held in the recently renovated Grand Palais, a glass and cast-iron marvel used in its early years for automobile and aeronautic trade fairs. In keeping with this season’s inescapable theme of commerce, the runway had been turned into what looked like a Chanel atelier cum shop, complete with uniformed assistants and garment racks on wheels.It often happens during the French fashion season that unexpected but serendipitous correspondences turn up between what designers and museum curators seem to be thinking. What this usually means is that a Marlene Dietrich show at a fashion museum will turn up soon enough as a Marlene Dietrich runway moment.In a separate part of the Grand Palais, adjacent to the hall in which the Chanel show was mounted, there is a blockbuster exhibition right now devoted to Walt Disney and the art historical references that influenced him (if influence is the right word), as well as the profound cultural effects Disney Studios produced.Lines of visitors stretch for blocks to see the original cels from “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” or child-size marionettes of Pinocchio or snippets from “Fantasia” screened alongside the “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.” The enthusiasm of the Parisian public can be explained, as least partly, by an extravagant thesis laid out by the show’s curators: Walt Disney was the greatest storyteller of the 20th century.Walt Disney rarely told new stories, of course; his genius was for recasting and marketing myth. And it was his foresight in recognizing the business potential of exploiting familiar tales and transforming them into universally legible commodities that constituted the real magic of Disney. It is no accident that within the fashion business, labels like Dior and Louis Vuitton are what is known as magic brands.And, no matter what anyone says, that is what fashion is about these days. Those who were baffled when the fashion press greeted Nicolas Ghesquiere’s collection for Balenciaga — which to some eyes resembled costumes for the “Star Wars” robot C3PO — with hosannas seriously underestimated the industry’s growing need for circus posters and cartoons. Critics strained to describe Mr. Ghesquiere’s efforts as futuristic, but their observations were probably beside the point.“At the end of the day, would I wear Balenciaga? Probably not,” said an editor from Vogue, who would speak only on condition that her name not be used. “But you have to make a choice between whether you only show pretty dresses that women will want to wear or whether you show work by a designer who can change the way people see.”Strong brands need billboards, in other words. And after a season during which so many designers seemed to come up with some version of party clothes for warriors in one of the outsider artist Henry Darger’s imaginary armies of little girls, it was Mr. Ghesquiere who created the most startling and memorable images, the ones that will be most often reproduced, most copied and that will, ultimately, sell the most bags.That is precisely the trick Marc Jacobs has pulled off in the nearly 10 years since Mr. Arnault hired him at Louis Vuitton. The proof can be found at the label’s flagship store on the Champs-Élysées. On most any day you can find a big crowd lining up behind velvet ropes there, waiting to get inside with an enthusiasm rarely seen outside Space Mountain and a reverence that puts one in mind of church.Not all of them, of course, can afford a costly Alma or a Papillon or a Lockit bag or one of the witty high-low takes on a French shopping tote Mr. Jacobs showed on his runway last Sunday. But at this point one would have to go a long way to find anyone immune to the special, socially elevating effects of hauling an LV monogram around.“What it’s all about in this business, finally, is memory of brand,” said Serge Brunschwig, recently charged with reviving the flagging fortunes at Celine for LVMH. What it is all about, this and every fashion season, is selling consumers on the dream that in a handbag can be found the secret to having a life more glamorous, dimensioned and storybook than one’s own.'"

"'06-10-13,'1','Game shows are not quiz shows. That should be understood at the outset, because knowledge is not an American virtue; luck is. And so is virtue. Prime-time game shows like “1 vs 100,” which begins tonight on NBC, are not a test of a contestant’s erudition or nerve; they are aspirational reality shows that allow ordinary Joes to go for it all in the hope of transforming their lives.Personality is obviously more important than education or skill. The contestants selected to play on “1 vs 100” are lively and likable in exactly the same way as those who compete on “Deal or No Deal,” the NBC game show that precedes it. The new one, with Bob Saget as its host, requires slightly more acumen: there are multiple-choice questions. But the principle is the same: big rewards come with big risks. Producers seek out extroverts who do not desperately need the money but who deserve a lucky break nonetheless, because their intentions are pure.Brian, the first contestant on “1 vs 100,” is a bouncer at a bar; he’s a jolly man who is quick to inform the audience that he wants to win the money for his fiancée. “I’d really like to buy her the engagement ring she deserves,” he says. On a recent episode of “Deal or No Deal,” Mark, an exuberant corrections officer, told the host, Howie Mandel, that he wanted the money because “I’ve never been able to buy my wife a nice ring.”These game shows, like “American Idol,” “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition” or “The Biggest Loser,” tap into viewers’ own fantasies of self-realization, but cash is less romantic than a singing career, a new house or a slimmer, healthier body. While there is nothing more American than the dream of earning $1 million for one night’s work, we haven’t entirely lost our puritanical streak. Contestants have to be altruistically materialistic; they play to help or reward a loved one, not to acquire a sports car or a spa vacation for themselves.Both NBC game shows and several similar ones coming up, like “Set for Life” on ABC or “The Rich List” on Fox, follow the basic format of “Who Wants to be a Millionaire,” the game show that pioneered the formula of dispensing huge rewards for emotional exertion.'"
"'06-10-13,'1','Bursting with hormones, angst, humor and heartbreak, Rick Rosenthal’s “Nearing Grace,” set during the late 1970’s in suburban New Jersey, follows a teenager’s efforts to survive both the recent loss of his mother and his senior year of high school.On the surface Henry (Gregory Smith) appears to be coping much better than his father, Shep (David Morse), and older brother, Blair (David Moscow), who drown their sorrows in alcohol and psychedelic drugs, respectively.But Henry’s vulnerabilities eventually catch up to him. He drops out of school just shy of graduation, and when not hiding out in the basement hoping to uncover the meaning of life, he finds distraction in the company of two extremely different girls: Grace (Jordana Brewster), the guileful object of his desire, and Merna (a very good Ashley Johnson, also a standout in next month’s “Fast Food Nation”), his longtime best friend who patiently yearns for his affections.There’s never a question as to who will ultimately win Henry’s heart. In fact there’s nothing remotely surprising in the entire film. But the generally winning — and freakishly good-looking — cast, endowed by Jacob Aaron Estes’s script with intelligent, if occasionally overwritten dialogue, makes for viewing that is easy on the eyes and the ears.“Nearing Grace” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

"'06-10-13,'1','LONDON, Oct. 12 (Reuters) — A British man pleaded guilty here on Thursday to plotting to blow up financial targets in the United States and conduct “dirty bomb” attacks in Britain.The man, Dhiren Barot, a Muslim convert, admitted planning to bomb the headquarters of the New York Stock Exchange and Citigroup in Manhattan, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington, and Prudential Financial in Newark.“Explosions at these premises were clearly designed to kill as many people as possible,” said the prosecutor, Edmund Lawson.Amid tight security at Woolwich Crown Court in South London, Mr. Barot pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder, and prosecutors outlined the details of his confession. Mr. Barot, looking relaxed and typing on a laptop computer, spoke just to affirm his guilt.In addition to the United States plot, Mr. Barot planned to attack British targets in a conspiracy called the Gas Limos Project.

"'06-10-13,'1','Insurgents have taken to hiding roadside bombs amid the refuse. Trash collectors sometimes stumble upon them and notify the police, but other times they are not so lucky.To protect the bombs set for American and Iraqi convoys, insurgents have killed scores of trash collectors.Most of the workers are Shiites, Mr. Atia said. They usually have few other options because of their limited schooling. Because they work in the open, he said, they are easy targets for Sunni extremists. Mr. Atia used to decorate the inside of his trash van with the images of Shiite clerics, but he took them down.“We are afraid,” he said.Beyond the challenges posed by the violence, the city is woefully ill equipped to deal with the waste of six million people. It has just 380 working trash compacting trucks, compared with 1,200 before the fall of the Hussein government, Mr. Kaabi said. Most of the vehicles were destroyed or lost in the looting that seized this capital after the invasion. He estimated that Baghdad needed 1,500 garbage trucks.With help from the Iraqi government and private organizations, the city is looking to acquire several hundred trucks, he said, and substantially upgrade its facilities for processing waste.“We want to make Baghdad a civilized and bright city,” Mr. Kaabi said.But any tour of the capital demonstrates it has a long way to go to reach that goal. In Arasat, an upscale neighborhood, trash heaps are piled waist high in front of an electronics store in a street off the main road. In Saidiya, a middle-class neighborhood in western Baghdad, 10 piles of random garbage dot an area barely a quarter-mile square.“I never see the trash collectors,” said Aimen Amjad, 30, a shop owner in Saidiya. “If they do come, they come once in a blue moon.”Ola Sami, whose third-floor apartment balcony overlooks a large neighborhood dumping ground, said she was worried about the spread of disease.“Forget about how badly it smells,” she said. “My son got infected because of the piles. The area is like a barn.”Even in Masbah, a wealthy central Baghdad neighborhood that was once home to many of the foreign embassies in Iraq, mounds of refuse have accumulated in front of elegant homes and gardens.“If we try to sit in the garden, we cannot because of flies and mosquitoes,” said Muhammad Amin, 45, who lives next to one of the larger heaps of trash on his block. “We cannot even sit in the garden to enjoy the weather.”It had been months since trash collectors, who went door to door during Mr. Hussein’s rule, had come down his street, he said, because of concrete barriers blocking the road.In Mansour, the troubled western Baghdad district where municipal officials have struggled to keep trash from accumulating, a district councilman who would give only his last name, Naji, said he had fewer than half the trucks he needed. As a result, each garbage crew has to handle a much larger area than it should, which means the trucks make fewer trips through each neighborhood and the trash heaps grow.Meanwhile, side streets are often ignored because the district does not have enough small garbage trucks that can squeeze down the alleys.But security is by far the larger issue, Mr. Naji said. In dangerous areas in the district, the main roads, where many people have taken to dumping their trash, cannot be cleaned because roadside bombs are often hidden there.Sadr City, the Shiite slum that was once notorious for its trash-strewn streets, is one place where conditions have improved. In the past, residents would often use the mounds of trash that dotted street medians as landmarks. (Turn right at the fourth trash pile.)But over the last few months, the area, which has been relatively free of violence because it is dominated by the Mahdi Army, Moktada al-Sadr’s militia, has become cleaner. Municipal work crews now go daily to shovel away trash dumped on the main roads. A median across a street from a busy food market that used to be piled high with garbage was closed off by a barbed-wire fence.Still, it is hardly pristine. On a recent afternoon, children picked through an expanse of trash off the main road leading into the neighborhood. Deeper into the slum, near a fruit stand, rancid garbage lay in a wide ditch.Usually just one garbage truck, with a driver and a worker, serves 20,000 to 30,000 people, said Satar Jabar, a district council member.“It is not enough,” he said.In many places, a more profound change is needed, said Ali Hasan, a Mansour District Council member who represents Washash, a poor neighborhood where trash is a major blight. The fall of the government brought freedom, he said, which some interpret to mean freedom to dispose their trash as they please.“During the time of Saddam, people were afraid of authorities,” Mr. Hasan said. “But now people are not under anyone’s control, and they don’t have the awareness to keep their neighborhood clean.”Mr. Hasan said he had became so exasperated that people were not throwing their trash in bins, he assigned a person to each one, ordering them to carry trash from every home to the metal bin. But the police later took away the bins because of fears they could be hiding places for explosives, so the idea collapsed.The city government has tried educational campaigns, posters, even seminars in schools and mosques to promote cleanliness. But in certain areas, only an armed presence has helped. Since August, the American military, with its Iraqi counterpart, has been conducting neighborhood sweeps of troubled sections of Baghdad. Once areas are secured, trash removal by Iraqi crews is among the first priorities.The most recent statistics on the campaign contained a startling figure, alongside others on houses searched and weapons seized: 7,107,536 cubic feet of trash removed, about the size of the Hindenburg.Muhammad Hasan was in charge of a crew of 40 working recently in Dora, one of the first neighborhoods secured.“As you can see, the workers are working without any threat from insurgents,” he said.Before the Americans came through, trash collectors had not showed up for months in some places, several Dora residents said. The situation has begun to improve. At first, the main roads were cleared but the side streets remained repugnant. Now even those are being shoveled clean.Elsewhere in the city, however, the piles continue to grow.'"
"'06-10-13,'1','WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 — A former deputy director of the White House office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives is charging that many members of the Bush administration privately dismiss its conservative Christian allies as “boorish” and “nuts.”The former deputy director, David Kuo, an evangelical Christian conservative, makes the accusations in a newly published memoir, “Tempting Faith: An Inside Story of Political Seduction” (Free Press), about his frustration with what he described as the meager support and political exploitation of the program.“National Christian leaders received hugs and smiles in person and then were dismissed behind their backs and described as ‘ridiculous,’ ‘out of control,’ and just plain ‘goofy,’ ” Mr. Kuo writes.In an interview, Mr. Kuo’s former boss, James Towey, now president of St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa., said he had never encountered such cynicism or condescension in the White House, and he disputed many of the assertions in Mr. Kuo’s account.Still, Mr. Kuo’s statements, first reported Wednesday evening on the cable channel MSNBC, come at an awkward time for Republicans in the midst of a midterm election campaign in which polls show little enthusiasm among the party’s conservative Christian base.'"
"'06-10-13,'1','After hitting her tee shot in a waste area to the right of the fairway, landing her ball against a rock, Wie called a rules official, Janet Lindsay.Since her stance was impeded by the cart path, Wie was allowed to take a free drop in the waste area. As she stood in the shade of an overhanging willow tree, Wie took the club back but missed the ball.“She was just trying to hit it out back toward the fairway,” Lindsay said. “She took a stroke and missed.”Wie walked away from the ball and tried to gather herself, only to pitch the ball into the bottom of a bush. She took an unplayable lie, which cost her a stroke, hit back onto the fairway, laced an iron to the green and carded an 8 after taking two putts.“There wasn’t much choice,” Wie said. “I hit it, and then I didn’t hit it, and then I hit it out.”The episode lasted 30 minutes, with Wie and her new caddie, Fanny Sunesson, the former caddie of Nick Faldo, measuring out the angles to ensure that Wie dropped her ball no closer to the hole.That was the rule she broke last year, when she dropped her ball away from a bush by the seventh green but closer to the hole and signed an incorrect scorecard.“I called the referee every single time this time,” Wie said. “I don’t think there will be any problems.”Wie, in search of her first career victory, began the round by splitting the fairway. She made par on the first hole, birdied the third and opened with a one-under 35 on the front nine.She bounced back from a double bogey on No. 11 by making eagle on No. 12 ,where she rolled in a 60-foot downhill putt from off the back of the green. She vaulted from one-over par to one-under before her swing and miss and quadruple-bogey on No. 14.After Wie made 8, several of the golf course scoreboards showed she had a triple-bogey 7, adding confusion to what her score actually was.As Wie walked up to the 18th green, she noticed that the large scoreboard also had her making a triple bogey, but Wie said she knew better.When Wie signed her scorecard in the shade of a tent behind the green, the scorer told her that she thought she made a 7. The scorer then asked Wie if she had received a free drop from the bush because of a gathering of bumblebees.Wie and Cristie Kerr, her playing partner, responded at the same time.“That was last year,” they said.'"
"'06-10-13,'1','Industry groups, in particular the National Corn Growers Association, have been holding a series of meetings across the country in recent months to cheerlead for ethanol and biodiesel, which are at the center of broad efforts to overhaul the Midwestern farm economy.“We are guided by the need to structure and scale renewable energy projects to be commercially viable and replicable,” said Alexander Karsner, assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at the Energy Department.The conference was an unusual collaboration between the Energy and Agriculture Departments, which jointly organized the event.The Energy Department described some of its efforts to develop cheaper, more efficient ethanol from noncorn crops, but the central investment appeared to be $250 million over five years to ""crack the technological barriers to developing wide-scale and cost-effective biofuels.""The critical issue is making a breakthrough in the cost of cellulosic ethanol, made from plant waste or nonedible crops. That fuel costs at least twice as much per gallon to produce today as corn-based ethanol.The ethanol boom is at the heart of farm state politics these days, and some attendees dismissed the carefully stage-managed celebration, which included rock music, but no opportunity to ask prominent speakers any questions.Some major issues were discussed. R. James Woolsey, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said federal subsidies for ethanol should be revised to allow the industry to be more self-supporting. He agreed with a suggestion by Mr. Khosla that subsidies should float according to the price of oil, moving higher when oil prices fall.Keith Collins, chief economist at the Agriculture Department, warned that if not carefully managed, the industry’s heated rush to produce ethanol threatened to take too much land away from crop production for food. He said ethanol would consume 19 percent of corn production this year, up from 6 percent in 2000.That could push up corn prices and cause ripple effects on America’s ability to export corn to places like China, where food demand is growing rapidly.Only one oil company — Chevron — was invited to the conference. The company is involved in several research initiatives with the Energy Department, some of them looking at ethanol and bio-diesel.BP, an oil company that invests in biofuels, was snubbed because of concerns that it might not be strong enough in its support of ethanol, said a person at an oil company who had been informed of the decision.Donald L. Paul, Chevron’s chief technology officer, said in an interview that Chevron saw opportunities to help “industrialize” biofuels and ensure that they are sustainable over decades. “Our view is that fuel diversification will be important,” Dr. Paul said. “To meet our fuel needs over the next 25 years we will have to add unconventional fuels, including biofuels. It will take every molecule.”But some questioned the oil industry’s motives for seeming to support ethanol now when it fought so hard to keep it out of gasoline before. On Wednesday, Mr. Khosla, who helped start Sun Microsystems and has been stumping lately for biofuels and other alternative energy investments, accused the oil industry of trying to slow the effort to incorporate more ethanol into gasoline.“Despite nice words from the American Petroleum Institute, make no mistake about it — they are not interested in a rapid transition,” Mr. Khosla said after a speech by Red Cavaney, president of the institute.Mr. Cavaney warned that a push to sell more of an 85 percent ethanol/15 percent gasoline blend could prove “unnecessarily expensive and risky, especially in the earlier years.”“If we are to encourage more long-term use of ethanol, we need to avoid surprising consumers with unanticipated problems.”He also cautioned against a “patchwork of state-by-state laws mandating ethanol use,” which could result in price spikes and fuel shortages similar to the situation when “boutique fuels” were introduced with different ingredients in different regions of the country at the end of the 1990’s.Mr. Khosla accused the oil industry of trying to confine ethanol’s role to 10 percent of gasoline at the pump, serving as a supplement to improve performance, which Mr. Cavaney said was the safest way to go.Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman said in an interview that he had personally invited Mr. Khosla to speak because “he has a viewpoint that has to be heard.”Patricia A. Woertz, the chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, the biggest ethanol producer, said partnerships across different industries and heavy investment in research and infrastructure would be needed to transform biofuels from “visionary to viable.”“The question is not whether there will be a sustainable market for biofuels, but how big that market can or should that market become,” Ms. Woertz said.In his speech, Mr. Bush promised to push to make the research and development tax credit a permanent part of the tax code. And he said the flood of private investment into biofuels must continue.“There is a lot of smart money in America going into energy diversification,” Mr. Bush said. “I hope you make a good return, and I think you will.”'"
"'06-10-13,'1','“Into the Fire” offers a twist on the branded entertainment trend that is remaking consumer marketing. Typically, advertisers pay to appear in programs that incorporate their products or brands into the plot lines — the better to appeal to viewers who can easily skip or zap the conventional commercials that interrupt the programs they want to watch.For instance, in an episode this week of the NBC drama series “Friday Night Lights,” two characters met for dinner at an Applebee’s restaurant; at the end of the episode, the credits acknowledged a “promotional consideration” by Applebee’s.In this instance, Fireman’s Fund is creating something far more elaborate: a program environment that is meant to complement its corporate goals. The special is much like the sponsored shows that were so prevalent in the early days of television, which ranged from children’s series like “Howdy Doody,” supported by makers of cereals and toys, to fare for adults like “Hallmark Hall of Fame,” which still appears as specials before big card-buying holidays like Mother’s Day and Christmas.“The effectiveness of traditional media is in decline; it’s not what it used to be,” said Darryl Siry, chief marketing officer at the Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company in Novato, Calif.As a result, he said, he made a decision in early 2004 to devote “the majority of my marketing budget to philanthropy and communications that are not advertising,” with “Into the Fire” being a significant element in that.Mr. Siry credited the idea for the show to Mark Owens, managing director at a Fireman’s Fund agency, Ketchum Entertainment Marketing, which is part of the Ketchum division of the Omnicom Group. At one point, Mr. Siry said, “we thought of branded entertainment,” in the form of embedding Fireman’s Fund in the contents of the show, “but felt it would be more effective to develop a documentary without any commercial message that is a Fireman’s Fund message.”One reason, he explained, is that “insurance is a low-interest category” — that is, few consumers are clamoring for more insurance ads, woven into a show or not.Another reason is that “people don’t trust insurance companies,” Mr. Siry said, which could dissipate the impact of any overt pitching for a brand or a product.After development began on the special, Fireman’s Fund started considering a choice of a network to show it. History Channel seemed a good choice given the subject of the show — it often presents programming on fires and firefighting — and its audience of adults who are often in the market for insurance.The network’s programming department was interested, said Michael Mohamad, senior vice president for marketing at History Channel in New York, but wanted to meet with Mr. Couturié and executives from Fireman’s Fund “to make sure they met the criteria of what a program on History Channel would be like.” The network is part of A&E Networks, owned by the Walt Disney Company, the Hearst Corporation and the NBC Universal unit of General Electric.At History Channel, “the program comes first,” Mr. Mohamad said, adding: “If the program doesn’t fit, we don’t do it. We’ve had success over the last 10 years by staying true to our brand.”“I could tell you a hundred ideas that we didn’t do,” Mr. Mohamad said, because they were more commercialized than the network would accept. (Alas, he meant it rhetorically.)“Into the Fire” will carry a regular commercial load for History Channel, with about 33 spots, but none will be for Fireman’s Fund. Rather, the company will sponsor four vignettes in the vein of public-service announcements, to appear before, during and after the show.The vignettes feature the actor Gary Sinise, who asks viewers to “join Fireman’s Fund Insurance” in supporting firefighters by visiting a Web site (firehero.org) and making donations to the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation.The donations, Mr. Sinise says, will help buy equipment like thermal imaging cameras for local fire departments. The vignettes were created by Cole & Weber United in Seattle, an agency that is part of the United Group division of the WPP Group.When the DVD’s of “Into the Fire” are released next spring, Fireman’s Fund also intends to use them for fund-raising. The profit from the DVD’s, which will be priced from $10 to $15 each, will also be donated to the firefighters’ foundation. Plans call for the DVD’s to be sold by fire departments, fire-fighter organizations and a retailer that Fireman’s Fund hopes to identify in the next month or two.Since Fireman’s Fund began its philanthropic thrust, Mr. Siry said, the company has donated more than $8 million to fire services.'"
"'06-10-13,'1','The Boston Communications Group, a provider of prepaid wireless services, said yesterday that it was replacing its three top executives and that it would restate earnings after discovering backdated stock options.In other options-related developments, the Sanmina-SCI Corporation, an electronics maker, said that it would restate results to correct stock option errors and that it had received a subpoena from a federal grand jury.And a regulatory filing showed that the antivirus software company McAfee Inc., whose top two executives were forced out on Wednesday, paid $50 million in February to settle an earlier Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into its accounting practices.Boston Communications said that Edward Y.

"'06-10-13,'1','On Thursday, Liu Jianchao, a spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said, “It’s necessary to express clearly to North Korea that the nuclear test is the wrong practice.” Mr. Liu added, however, that “one can say that punishment isn’t the goal.”In contrast to South Korea, Japan reacted swiftly to the reports of the North Korean nuclear test by imposing a ban on imports and ships from North Korea.In response, a North Korean official warned Thursday that the government would take “strong countermeasures” against Japan if it carried out the ban.“The specific contents will become clear if you keep watching,” Song Il-ho, the North Korean ambassador in charge of relations with Japan, told the Kyodo news agency in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital. “We never speak empty words.”North Korea rattled the Japanese in 1998 by firing a missile that flew over Japan and crashed in the Pacific. A top governing party leader in South Korea highlighted the political divide on Thursday by warning against giving in to demands by conservatives that the country join the American-led Proliferation Security Initiative, which aims to intercept North Korean ships suspected of carrying weapons materials.Seoul’s participation in the initiative “could work as a detonator for a military clash,” the party leader, Kim Keun-tae, said at a meeting with cabinet ministers.The main opposition Grand National Party issued its own statement demanding an end to two joint ventures with the North — the Mount Kumgang tourism project, for which South Korea has provided North Korea over $900 million since 1998, and an industrial complex in Kaesong, where South Korean factories produce garments and kitchen utensils with low-wage North Korean workers.Lee Jong-seok, South Korea’s unification minister in charge of relations with North Korea, told the National Assembly on Thursday that negotiations, as well as the sanctions being considered by the United Nations Security Council, were needed because “North Korea is not a country that one can open up with pressure and sanctions alone.”President Roh has found himself caught between increasing American pressure to get tough with North Korea and strong resistance among members of his own liberal governing party.Conservative South Koreans called the North Korean nuclear threat a “death penalty” for the sunshine policy of promoting political reconciliation and economic cooperation with the North. They said billions of dollars funneled into the North — in cash, aid and trade — during eight years of engagement had helped North Korea divert its resources into weapons development.But liberals within and outside the president’s camp say that although they are frustrated with the North Koreans, they see no other option but to engage them. Ending cooperative projects will only worsen inter-Korean relations and increase the danger of military clashes on the divided Korean Peninsula, they say.“It’s clear that the sunshine policy has succeeded between the two Koreas, and it could have been more successful were it not for the bad relations between North Korea and the United States,” former President Kim Dae-jung, the architect of the engagement policy, said, according to the South Korean news media.'"
"'06-10-13,'1','The chief executive of Delta Air Lines, Gerald Grinstein, said yesterday that he planned to retire after the airline emerged from bankruptcy protection, but he declined to say who would succeed him.Delta filed for Chapter 11 protection in September last year and expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the first half of 2007.“It will be a little while after that,” Mr. Grinstein told reporters during an event to promote Delta’s international expansion plans.Mr. Grinstein, 73, declined to say whether the airline had a succession plan in place. “The board will make its decision when the time comes,” he said.In the past, Mr. Grinstein said a successor would probably come from within the company, and he has named the chief operating officer, James Whitehurst, and the chief financial officer, Edward H. Bastian, as possible candidates.Mr. Grinstein also said that Delta intended to emerge from bankruptcy as an independent carrier, dismissing speculation about a possible merger.'"
"'06-10-13,'1','In 1839 Courbet, barely 20, blew into Paris from the provinces, a brash, ebulliently confident young man. He was a proud son of an affluent family of Ornans in the Franche-Comté in eastern France, a region near the Swiss Alps known for its rugged terrain and its political independence from Paris. Although sent to Paris to study law, Courbet soon became determined to make it big as an artist. He proceeded to redefine big in ways that can still get on your nerves, not least because they are quite familiar.Part of his modernity rests on the uncanny fusion of realism and abstraction that derived from the muscular way he dispatched paint onto canvas. A lifelong hunter, Courbet chose the palette knife as his favorite painting tool, and he became adept at flicking, troweling and scraping paint into forms of unusual power, if not ugliness. His strangely smooth yet vividly fragmented paint surface was a slap in the face of academic finish, just as his emphasis on common, contemporary subjects and ordinary people, evident in his early masterpiece, “Funeral at Ornans,” disdained the aloof erudition of history painting.As Ms. Eyerman details in her catalog essay, when, in 1949, Courbet’s work was given its first American museum exhibition, it was hailed as a precedent for the paint-as-paint approach of Jackson Pollock by the art critic Clement Greenberg, who was Pollock’s chief advocate. Ms. Eyerman extends the compliment to the caked surfaces of Gerhard Richter as well.But Courbet’s modernity also stems from a sense of showmanship unlike that of any other 19th-century painter of his stature. Courbet understood the notion of spectacle as it applied to both his art and his life. He had a knack for self-promotion and an advanced understanding of the usefulness of publicity. He deliberately cultivated the dress, manners and loud speech of a provincial, crossed swords with the establishment of the Salon and was regularly raked over the coals by critics. “When I am no longer controversial,” he proclaimed in 1852, “I will no longer be important.”“Courbet and the Modern Landscape” emphasizes Courbet’s radicalism while matching his showmanship with some of its own. The combination, overseen by Eik Kahng, the curator of 18th- and 19th-century art at the Walters, is surprisingly effective: an unusual truce between what might be called the purist and populist approaches to art exhibitions. The paintings are imposing, accessible, engulfing, and they convey a very complicated sense of both the strengths and weaknesses of Courbet’s sensibility.In the end Ms. Kahng seems to have decided to drop the weather and insect sounds, perhaps because the paintings are so powerfully immersive on their own.What’s more, her show is uncluttered by wall texts; the works are discussed in detail in a free brochure. The fluctuating lighting and newly composed music — in effect in two of the four galleries during my visit — was unobtrusive. The soft gonglike sounds in the small gallery devoted to paintings of winter added a kind of “chain of being” resonance that seemed almost appropriate. (It was certainly quieter and more conducive to looking than the ventilation systems that regularly rattle shows — as, for example, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s recent exhibition of Samuel Palmer, another 19th-century devotee of nature.)Courbet believed that artists could give justice to landscapes that they were deeply familiar with, and his greatest landscapes were undoubtedly those he made in the rugged France-Comté, with its jutting buttes and rock-strewn slopes.In the first gallery (spring) the sculptural nature of this landscape is forcefully evident. Stony carapaces and ridges rise against bright blue skies, casting green valleys and hills into big angular shadows of unyielding black. Everything works double time as topographical fact and paint. The images dissolve up close: not into the benign glowing patterns that Monet would achieve or the brilliantly colored regimentation of van Gogh, and not into the stroke-by-stroke doggedness of Cézanne, perhaps the greatest student of Courbet’s work, but into something roiled and wild, like nature itself, only in molecular form.In “The Gust of Wind” a rush of dark clouds is indicated with fairly conventional brushwork, but the earth itself is nothing but jagged outcroppings of paint slightly differentiated by color into lake, rock and tree. It is a land of primordial isolation, impenetrable, devoid of human intervention.Seasonal or not, each section of the show has a striking coherence of form and subject. In the second gallery (fall), where the lights cast leafy patterns on the floor, the sky and the horizon all but disappear in the paintings. The greens and browns of wooded glens and rocky cavern close in, paint becomes even more fractured and suspended in space. Almost invariably, a stream or river runs through the image, continuing the theme of isolation and impenetrability.Two similar images of a place called Le Puits Noir (or Black Well) seem almost Arcadian. You could imagine the female bathers and male gazers of Manet’s “Déjeuner sur l’Herbe” settling in, gingerly. But in other renderings of this spot, the surface is largely black, and in paintings of grottos and the source of the Loue River, the central rush of water is framed entirely in rocks. They almost wall up a surface that at the same time remains completely porous as paint.The remaining two sections of the exhibition don’t equal the force of the first two, but this has the benefit of giving a truer sense of Courbet’s multifarious achievement. In the winter section, where the artist’s images of deer seem like little stuck-on decals, the museum uses pinpoint lighting that gives the frothy snow scenes a lurid glow; it is the show’s only real misstep, but it reminds you that Courbet, antecedent to the Impressionists and Pollock, also helped invent calendar art. The title of one of Mr. Greenberg’s most famous essays comes to mind, but with a new emphasis: “Avant-Garde and Kitsch.”The final section (summer) contains nothing but seascapes. The horizontal bands of contrasting colors and textures connoting various water and light conditions are indeed beautiful, but conventionally so. Though they are as close as Courbet gets to exquisite, they also suggest that he was far more original on solid ground, especially that of the Franche-Comté, the ground he knew by heart.'"

The houses will step down a terraced hillside toward the water, maximizing the ocean views from their covered lanais and 68-foot-long glass walls. The residences will be full-ownership, with no stipulations on the amount of time owners may use their properties. There will be a fitness center and a 75-foot-long swimming pool, both exclusive to the residences. All houses will have courtyards and attached garages. Not far from the development are a public beach, restaurants, shops, tennis courts and three 18-hole golf courses, which will offer preferential tee times and reduced fees to the homeowners.AMENITIES A private area with a swimming pool and whirlpools, among others.PRICES The first phase of residences are about $2.4 million to nearly $3.4 million.STATUS The first phase of eight properties is scheduled to be completed in January, the rest of the development in July 2007.DETAILS This project will line a beach beside the Hotel del Coronado, a National Historic Landmark built in the late 19th century on a peninsula in San Diego Bay. There will be 35 1,230- to 2,030-square-foot two- and three-bedroom adjoining suites. The properties will be full ownership, but owners will be allowed to spend no more than 90 days a year in them; when owners are away, the properties must be offered for rent. The resort’s amenities, including restaurants, swimming pools, yoga classes, surfing lessons and bike rentals, will be available to owners.

"'06-10-14,'0','It was Thomas’s first time on the bench since 2002, when he coached the Indiana Pacers.“Coaching, I love it,” he said. “I got a good group of guys to coach in there. They’re trying to do the things that we want done.”The Knicks’ starting lineup will probably change throughout the preseason, but the first lineup Thomas used is the one that seems most likely to stick: Stephon Marbury and Steve Francis in the backcourt, with Jared Jeffries, Channing Frye and Eddy Curry in the frontcourt.Thomas insists that all starting jobs are up for grabs, but he spoke with great enthusiasm about that group. He mentioned Jeffries first, saying it was critical to have a small forward who can guard the league’s best scorers. He said that Frye and Curry played well last season when they were given playing time — a subtle dig at Brown.Thomas also seemed to have Brown on his mind when he said he wanted to return Marbury and Francis to All-Star status. Both struggled last season.With another point guard in the backcourt, it appears that Marbury is at last having one wish fulfilled: to play off the ball, as a scorer. Marbury asked Brown to give him that role last season, but Brown resisted.Francis took most of the ball-handling duties when both he and Marbury were on the court last night. At times, the Knicks also used their swingmen, Jeffries and Renaldo Balkman, in the initiating role. Marbury responded with 16 points in 22 minutes, but had no assists.Thomas said his offense did not use a traditional point guard, but rather a “push man,” so the job of starting the offense will fall to several people.Marbury is clearly enthusiastic about the freedom he has in Thomas’s read-and-react offense.“You can just go out and play basketball,” he said. “You’re not thinking about trying to make the right play. You’re just playing basketball.”Quentin Richardson, a disappointment last season, seemed rejuvenated. He scored 9 consecutive points for the Knicks in the second quarter, and finished with 14.Curry, however, showed some of the same bad habits that hurt him last season. He committed 5 fouls — 3 offensive — and finished with 5 turnovers, along with 8 points and 5 rebounds in 22 minutes.Balkman, the Knicks’ top draft pick in June, displayed the hustle and nose for the ball that caught Thomas’s eye last spring. He grabbed seven rebounds and — though not known as a shooter — made a late 3-pointer to finish with 11 points.But the best rookie on the court was the one the Knicks passed up — point guard Marcus Williams, who was taken by the Nets two spots after Balkman. Williams made three 3-pointers and finished with 21 points and 7 assists.The mood at the Garden could sour quickly if the Knicks stumble in the opening weeks of the season — a possibility that Thomas acknowledged. The Knicks play 11 of their first 18 games on the road, including 5 of their first 7. Twelve of their first 18 opponents were playoff teams last spring — including San Antonio, Detroit and defending champion Miami.“Chances are, when you look at our schedule, we may start out in a hole,” Thomas said. “And you can’t get so buried in a hole that you lose hope. And you’ve got to have enough intestinal fortitude to fight yourself out of the hole and persevere and overcome the obstacles.”Nets guard Eddie House could miss four to six weeks because of a torn meniscus in his left knee. He will have arthroscopic surgery Monday. The 6-foot-1 House was perhaps the Nets’ biggest free-agent acquisition in a relatively quiet off-season. He can play both guard positions and is an accomplished 3-point shooter. ... The Knicks’ Jalen Rose was left inactive for last night’s game, but he is expected to start tonight in Philadelphia. The Knicks’ other inactive players — Malik Rose and Jerome James — are injured and are not expected to play.'"
"'06-10-14,'0','Proposals like Wisconsin’s are also on the ballot in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Virginia. And while most of the measures are expected to pass, their emotional force in drawing committed, conservative voters to the polls, many political experts say, has been muted or spent.Recent polls in Arizona, Colorado, Virginia and Wisconsin, for example, have suggested only narrow majorities in support, in contrast to the 60 to 70 percent or more majorities in most states that voted on the issue in 2004. Two recent polls in South Dakota suggested that the same-sex marriage amendment might actually lose, while a third said it seemed likely to pass.“As it stands right now, conservative turnout is not going to be as strong as it has traditionally been,” said Jon Paul, the executive director of Coloradans for Marriage, which is supporting a ballot measure that would ban same-sex marriage.Some pollsters say people might just be burned out on the subject of marriage and its boundaries.“It doesn’t seem to be salient to what most Tennesseans are concerned about right now,” said Robert Wyatt, the associate director of the Middle Tennessee State University poll. The ballot proposal there will almost certainly pass, Dr. Wyatt said, but few people think it will drive turnout or swing the tight race for the Senate between Bob Corker, a Republican, and Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., a Democrat. Both candidates support a ban on same-sex marriage.Dr. Wyatt said efforts to stir enthusiasm among conservatives have mostly fallen flat.“It’s one of those things that’s like preaching to the choir,” he said.The momentum against same-sex marriage at the ballot box has also been hurt by court cases that have upheld bans on same-sex marriage — notably rulings by the highest courts in New York and Washington this summer — by removing some of the urgency for constitutional amendments.Here in Colorado, the debate has been complicated by the presence of two ballot measures on the subject that in essence work in opposite directions. One measure would add a ban on same-sex marriage to the Constitution, and the other would create a framework of legal rights for same-sex couples in civil unions.Scholars who track gender-law issues say that gay rights groups and their allies have worked hard since the last election to create a middle-ground position on the question of partnership rights that could appeal to voters who might not vote for same-sex marriage.The position, which has been repeated like a mantra across Colorado this year by advocates for the civil union proposal, holds that civil unions are not marriage and that if voters want to hold marriage apart as a separate institution for heterosexuals, that would be fine. But it is only fair and just, they say, that couples in other types of relationships have legal protections, too.Opponents of the civil union bill say that the moderation line is a smokescreen and that same-sex marriage in Colorado will become a reality in fact, if not in name, if the civil union proposition is approved.“It is nothing short of Orwellian doublespeak to say it is not marriage,” State Representative Kevin Lundberg, a Republican from eastern Colorado, said at a recent forum in Denver on the ballot proposals.Political analysts suggest that just like patrons perusing an old-fashioned Chinese restaurant menu, voters in Colorado considering the two measures might take one from Column A and one from Column B. Some people say they plan to do just that.Joel Sidell and Dona Maloy — longtime unmarried partners who live in the Denver area — show how the lines have fractured. Mr. Sidell, 62, a retired police officer and a Republican, said he would probably vote for the ban on same-sex marriage and against civil unions.“To me, it still does not seem right for a woman to be able to marry a woman and a male to marry a male,” Mr. Sidell said. “I don’t think it’s the sanctity of the term. It just doesn’t seem proper.”Ms. Maloy, 61, is a Democrat who said she planned to vote the opposite of her partner — no on the marriage amendment and yes to benefits for same-sex partners.“I think that marriage is a personal thing; at least it is for me,” she said. “Legally, I don’t see why people can’t all have the same rights.”The two major party candidates for governor in Colorado have also taken opposite sides on the marriage-civil union debate. The Democrat, Bill Ritter, has said he will vote for civil unions and against the constitutional amendment, while the Republican, Representative Bob Beauprez, has said he plans to vote against civil unions and for the same-sex marriage ban. Pollsters say those positions do not appear to be swaying the race, which Mr. Ritter has led by 10 to 15 percentage points in recent polls.Tangled legal questions over parental rights, health care decisions and employer benefits have emerged in some states where efforts to ban same-sex marriage and civil unions were successful in the past, complicating calculations about how the bans play out in real life. The case of Lisa Miller and Janet Jenkins is one example.Ms. Miller and Ms. Jenkins were joined in a civil ceremony in 2000 in Vermont, which allows same-sex contracts. Ms. Miller had a baby in 2002 through artificial insemination, and they raised the child together. Now they have separated, and both Vermont and Virginia, which does not recognize the validity of Vermont’s civil union system, have claimed jurisdiction over the question of child custody.Legal experts say the case is probably headed for the Supreme Court. In the meantime, Virginia’s same-sex marriage ballot proposal would define marriage as between a man and a woman and also put into the Constitution the legal language at the heart of the custody battle: that civil unions formed in other states are invalid in Virginia.That prohibition on civil unions is even too far-reaching for some opponents of same-sex marriage, said Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.“It’s so sweeping, it’s giving some people pause,” Mr. Sabato said.Meanwhile, gay men and lesbians continue to come out in ever greater numbers, especially in some of the states that will be voting on the marriage issue next month.From 2000 to 2005, the number of people identifying themselves in Census surveys as being in a same-sex couple grew by 30 percent, to about 770,000, according to a study released this week by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, which tracks and researches gay legal issues.Of the eight states with ballot measures, the study found that six had growth rates higher than the national average, led by Wisconsin, up 81 percent; Colorado, up 58 percent; Virginia, up 43 percent; and South Carolina, up 39 percent.Conservatives like Mr. Paul of the Colorado marriage group say the low-key tenor of the same-sex marriage debate could change in a thunderclap if a court decision that appears to undermine traditional marriage boundaries is handed down before the election. The New Jersey Supreme Court has a case pending and could issue a decision before Election Day.'"

"'06-10-14,'0','PARIS, Oct. 13 — Swiss banks broke their nation’s laws by providing banking information to American counterterrorism officials, Switzerland’s top data-protection official said Friday.The banks, known for safeguarding privacy, should have informed customers using the Swift money-transfer service that their data could be passed on to third parties, the Swiss official, Hanspeter Thür, said in Bern, according to The Associated Press.Just the possibility of the data being leaked should have been grounds enough to warn customers, he said. His statement was at odds with the views of the Swiss finance minister, Hans-Rudolf Merz, who said last month that giving the Central Intelligence Agency such access did not infringe on the country’s banking secrecy rules.After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Swift provided records on millions of international banking transactions to the American government in response to subpoenas from the Treasury Department. Swift — formally the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication — operates a secure electronic-messaging service used by some 7,800 financial institutions to make international money transfers worth $6 trillion a day.Analysts at the C.I.A. have used the records to conduct tens of thousands of individual examinations of banking records in search of evidence and patterns of possible terrorist financing. A prime focus of the effort has been on international transactions coming into and out of the United States.'"
"'06-10-14,'0','Indeed, the buzz today is around Disney, which has ambitiously added viewers both on cable and the Web. It has had a handful of megahits, like “High School Musical,” which generated sales of millions of CD’s and DVD’s; “The Cheetah Girls”; and, most recently, “Hannah Montana.”To lure viewers, Disney made some bold moves, including introducing shows in early summer when Nickelodeon was playing reruns from the earlier season.As a result, the Disney Channel’s ratings are up 17 percent, to 2.7 percent of all cable television homes at the end of September for children 2 to 11 years old, according to Nielsen Media Research.Nickelodeon’s ratings for that audience, meanwhile, were flat at 3.8 percent of all television homes compared with the period a year earlier. That means an average of 1.2 million children watched Nick at any given time compared with 863,000 for the Disney Channel. At the same time, the Cartoon Network says its ratings have declined 3 percent, for a period that includes prime time. However, Viacom says that the ratings drop is about 16 percent in the time period where the Cartoon Network competes with Nickelodeon.The statistics are even more striking among children 6 to 11: Nick has lost 3 percent, as its ratings dropped to 3.5 percent of all cable homes, while the Disney Channel’s ratings have soared 23 percent, to 2.7 percent of cable homes.Whether the Disney Channel is taking viewers from the Cartoon Network or simply adding new viewers — some of whom might have otherwise gone to Nick — is unclear.Ms. Zarghami is quick to point out that Nickelodeon has been the No. 1 rated cable network for the last 11 years. She dismisses Disney’s recent success as cyclic. “I am not concerned that Disney is having a good summer,” she said. “They have had a good summer before. Our story is consistency. Consistency of audience: revenue and brand attributes.”“Remember ‘Pokémon,’ ” she said, referring to the animated hit show on WB Network. “There were a few weeks when we though the sky was falling in. We thought, here is a competitor who is here to stay, but they went away.”“Disney has gotten close to Nickelodeon before but our leadership is with the core demographic,” Ms. Zarghami said, alluding to the 2 to 11 year olds that are Nick’s primary audience.Nevertheless, Nickelodeon is planning an ambitious slate of series in search of a hit. Though Ms. Zarghami says this is business as usual, there are not only new animated shows, including “El Tigre” and “Barnyard TV,” but also some live-action movies, an effort perhaps to respond to the popularity of Disney’s “High School Musical.”For all the hype surrounding the Web, for the near term Nickelodeon’s hit shows remain the bread and butter of its business. “SpongeBob SquarePants” has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising revenue and, along with Nickelodeon’s other recent hit, “Dora the Explorer,” has brought in about $4.5 billion in product sales, according to company officials.In the last several years, Nickelodeon had a steady stream of successes but has not come up with hits of the magnitude of “Blue’s Clues” or “Rugrats.”Judy McGrath, chairman of MTV Networks, maintains she is not worried. “‘We are always shooting for megahits, but business is based on a slate of strong performers that people like and that you build a steady business on.”To hold its young audiences Nickelodeon has been aggressively expanding online. On Monday, its parent MTV Networks, a division of Viacom, is set to announce the purchase of Quizilla, a Web site that aims to appeal to teenage girls and will complement The N.Com, a Nickelodeon-based site for female “tweens,” those aged 9 to 12.Other recent additions include Neopets.com, which allows children to create and play with pets; Addicting Games.Com, a gaming site for children and tweens; and a second gaming site, Shockwave.Viacom wants to position itself online as far broader than just the Nickelodeon brand. Executives say their strategy is now diversified into sites that have little to do with Nickelodeon content but try to reach the same young audiences. Nick and its newly acquired sites attract about 28 million visitors a month, the company said.“We roll across all our businesses,” Ms. McGrath said. “We sell across many of these brands: we sell Nick, the N.Com, MTV 2, Neopets.”And the competition on cable-related sites has grown more intense. Nick.com and NickJr.com, the network’s main sites, had 11.6 million visitors in September, according to comScore/Media Metrix. That is up from 8 million a year earlier. At the Disney Channel Web site, the number of unique visitors rose to 11.5 million at the end of September, up from 5.8 million a year earlier, according to comScore.Though the increase comes off a far lower base, clearly Disney’s hits have caught on with young audiences. And visitors to the Nickelodeon sites still spend more time there: an average of 54.9 minutes, while Disney’s visitors spend an average of 49.5 minutes on its site, according to comScore.For Viacom, maintaining the success of its core cable brands is crucial. Led by MTV and Nickelodeon, they accounted for 63.7 percent of the company’s $5.2 million in revenue for the first six months of this year and 95 percent of the company’s income from its two principal operations: cable networks and entertainment.At cable the days of easy growth are over. The cable business has matured in recent years. For the first six months of this year Viacom’s cable network revenues rose 7 percent, to $3.3 billion, and operating income for the cable networks increased 10 percent, to $1.3 billion.That makes the battle for market share even more significant. Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman, has repeatedly described Viacom as a “growth” company and publicly reprimanded its former chief executive, Tom Freston, for not buying the fast-growing MySpace, the hot Web site that the News Corporation acquired.“It’s a maturing business,” said Richard Bilotti, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “Nickelodeon is a victim of its own success.”'"
"'06-10-14,'0','Similarly, the concerns of South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission have also been addressed, Microsoft said.“We are excited to bring the security enhancements and innovative new features of Windows Vista to our customers and partners around the world, and we are committed to adhering to local law in every region of the world,” Mr. Ballmer said in the statement.Until now, Microsoft has resisted pressure to change Vista. Last month it accused the European Commission of not giving it clear enough guidance on whether Vista would pass muster under European antitrust law.It also highlighted research that showed that hundreds of thousands of jobs in the European technology industry were at stake if Vista’s introduction were delayed. Also last month, members of the European Parliament wrote to Ms. Kroes warning her of the harm she would be causing to European companies if she forced a delay.The commission stood its ground, insisting that it was not up to regulators to approve Vista before its introduction. It repeated this message Friday. “The commission has not given a green light to Microsoft to deliver Vista,” it said in a statement. “Microsoft must shoulder its own responsibilities to ensure that Vista is fully compliant with competition rules and in particular with the principles laid down in the March 2004 commission antitrust decision concerning Microsoft.”In 2004, the commission found that Microsoft had violated antitrust rules by bundling its music and video player, Media Player, into Windows XP and ordered the company to release a second version of Windows with Media Player stripped out.“We understand that the European commission doesn’t give a green light to a product before it is launched, and that it is a company’s obligation to be in compliance with antitrust law,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, said in a conference call with journalists on Friday.“Having made the changes we were advised to make, we are confident Vista is in compliance,” he added.Many of the problems with Vista identified by the commission echo the issues that resulted in the 2004 antitrust ruling. It alerted Microsoft to five potential antitrust problems in March, which were addressed in changes incorporated into the new operating system over the summer.Last month, the commission pointed to three remaining problems, concerning Microsoft’s plan to bundle into Vista an Internet search engine, security software and a fixed document format similar to the one sold by the software company Adobe.Symantec, a leader in antivirus software, embarked on a huge public relations offensive, contending that Microsoft was effectively shutting it and other security software specialists out of Vista.Two weeks ago, Microsoft addressed the main concerns of Symantec by agreeing to allow access to the heart, or kernel, of the Windows operating system to security products made by competitors. In the area of search, Microsoft changed Vista to allow users to choose their own search engine and make it the default Internet search tool on their computers.In the area of fixed document formats, Microsoft agreed to the commission’s demands that its new fixed-layout document format, called the XML Paper Specification, be scrutinized by an independent standards-setting organization. It also agreed to change the licensing terms to make its format more available to other software developers.The commission said in a statement that it would “closely monitor the effects of Vista in the market” and would examine any complaints the new operating system might provoke “on their own merits.”'"
"'06-10-14,'0','“Looking at Flipper, Seeing Ourselves,” by Frans de Waal (Op-Ed, Oct. 9), impressed me regarding dolphin intelligence.The article asks, “What is so upsetting to some people about the closeness between animal and human intelligence, or between animal and human emotions, for that matter?”What is so upsetting is that if we accept nonhuman animals as more similar to humans than we thought, we might be forced into evaluating the ethics of some of the cruel practices commonly accepted in society: animals used as entertainment, food, clothing, in psychology experiments and so on.

"'06-10-14,'0','Missouri has the nation’s fourth-longest winning streak at seven and is averaging 34.2 points a game, 14th best nationally. The Tigers are also ranked eighth in points allowed at 11.8 a game and 10th in total defense, surrendering 255 yards a game.Daniel has thrived in Missouri’s no-huddle, spread offense. He is nimble — with a 40-yard dash time of 4.4 seconds — and his performance has eased the loss of quarterback Brad Smith, a four-year starter who owns 69 school, Big 12 and N.C.A.A. records and is now a rookie wide receiver for the Jets.“The highest compliment you can say about Chase is that he’s just a winner,” Texas A&M Coach Dennis Franchione told reporters earlier this week. “He finds a way. He makes the most of his talent. He makes his teammates better. He’s an intelligent, savvy quarterback.”But neither Franchione nor the coaches at many other traditional college football powers offered Daniel a scholarship.Southlake (Tex.) Carroll High School’s Todd Dodge, who coached Daniel, did his best to promote him, going so far as to put together a 10-minute highlight video of Daniel’s junior season that Dodge distributed at the 2004 American Football Coaches Association convention in Orlando, Fla. The video consisted of the 60 touchdowns that Daniel played a part in and, at Daniel’s behest, Dodge gave copies to numerous college programs, including Texas, Stanford and Missouri.“I asked him, ‘Why Missouri?’ ” Dodge said. “He said, ‘Well, I’ve watched Brad Smith, and they seem to put a premium on asking a guy to be a runner and a passer, and I think that’s my strength.’ ”The video was meant to help answer questions about Daniel’s height, considered small for a quarterback, and to dismiss the notion that his 3,681 passing yards and 1,529 rushing yards as a first-year starter his junior year were merely a product of Dodge’s spread offense.“A lot of coaches felt he didn’t have a whole lot of upside and that he was about as good as he was going to get,” said Dodge, who played quarterback at Texas from 1982-85. “I felt they were wrong, because all he had ever done was improve.”Missouri Coach Gary Pinkel was so impressed by the video that he became the first to offer Daniel a scholarship. Daniel then completed a standout senior season with 4,617 passing yards, 1,425 rushing yards and 70 touchdowns, leading Southlake Carroll to a 16-0 record and USA Today’s mythical national championship. Several colleges immediately made late attempts to recruit him.Texas’ offensive coordinator, Greg Davis, called Dodge less than a week before signing day to gauge Daniel’s interest in the Longhorns after it became clear they would lose a quarterback, Ryan Perrilloux, who had committed but then changed his mind and signed with Louisiana State. But Daniel was not swayed.“Signing day was kind of miserable for Chase, just from the standpoint that so many people said he took pride in turning Texas down,” Dodge said. “That was not true at all. He basically was a kid that honored his commitment.”At Missouri, the pairing of Daniel and Pinkel has been a perfect fit. Pinkel became intrigued by Florida Coach Urban Meyer’s success with the spread offense and defenses’ problems stopping it, and Pinkel implemented the explosive offensive attack it the year Daniel arrived.Daniel, who had played within a similar system since eighth grade, appears at ease as the triggerman in Missouri’s offense. He is able to beat defenses with his strong right arm and his quick feet.“He is a really good football player,” Mississippi Coach Ed Orgeron told reporters last month before his team surrendered 243 passing yards and 89 rushing yards to Daniel in a 34-7 loss.Daniel is Pinkel’s latest quarterback prodigy. Pinkel was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for seven years at Washington under Don James, and he coached several future N.F.L. quarterbacks, including Mark Brunell, Chris Chandler and Hugh Millen.Pinkel said Daniel had an innate ability to play quarterback, and he marveled at Daniel’s maturity and leadership.“He could be starting about anywhere in the country right now,” Pinkel said.Pinkel, who coached Toledo for 10 seasons, is 35-30 in his six seasons at Missouri. He has rebuilt a program that had lackluster facilities and had won only 7 of its last 22 games before he arrived in 2001. In August, the team moved into an expanded and renovated athletics training complex that is undergoing $16 million in improvements.Famously driven, Pinkel appears to have relaxed some this season. He took his team swimming during the preseason and to the movies on another occasion.“Winning and maturity will do that,” James said. “He’s got more confidence.”So does Daniel, who is learning to handle his fame.“It’s not too crazy,” Daniel said later after he fled the coffee shop. “You’ve just got to keep a low profile.”That may be increasingly difficult for Daniel and the Tigers.'"
"'06-10-14,'0','LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13 — Air America Radio, the liberal talk network started two years ago in a bid to counter the influence of conservative radio personalities like Rush Limbaugh, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday.The network and its corporate parent, Piquant LLC, filed after an owner of stations that carried Air America programming took legal action to freeze its bank accounts as part of a dispute over unpaid bills. Last month the network’s backers said they would no longer provide cash to subsidize its operating losses, according to an affidavit filed by Air America in connection with the bankruptcy.United States Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert Drain approved motions on Friday that will let the company continue to pay salaries and remain on the air. The judge also approved a loan of $900,000 from Democracy Allies, an entity formed by current investors in the network, including Rob Glaser, chief executive of the media and entertainment company RealNetworks. Its full proposed loan of $2.6 million is to be considered at a later hearing, said Tracy Klestadt, a lawyer representing Air America.Mr. Glaser, who has been perhaps the network’s biggest champion, had no comment on the filing, a spokesman said. He is also the company’s largest secured creditor and is owed $9.8 million, according to bankruptcy court filings.Air America, whose broadcast talent includes the comedian Al Franken, has struggled financially since it went on the air in the spring of 2004. According to court papers, the company lost $8.6 million in 2004 and $19.6 million last year, and has lost $13.1 million so far in 2006.'"
"'06-10-14,'0','You might not think that the music of Bach has a lot in common with that of Toru Takemitsu, and by most standards of measurement — the composers’ use of harmony, rhythm and musical syntax — you would be correct.But Peter Serkin’s standards have always been a bit different from everyone else’s. At Zankel Hall on Wednesday evening, he performed most of Takemitsu’s solo keyboard music, with Bach works opening and closing the program. And he showed that under the right circumstances, there are connections to be made.Those circumstances, in truth, are largely matters of artifice and poetic license.For starters, Mr. Serkin evened the playing field of timbre, moving Bach’s Chorale Prelude on “Wer nur den lieben Gott lässt walten” (BWV 691) and the early “Capriccio on the Departure of a Most Beloved Brother” (BWV 992) to the modern piano. More unusual, he countered this move toward Takemitsu’s sound world with one toward Bach’s: his piano was tuned to an 18th-century mean-tone temperament rather than the equal temperament common today. The effect would probably have been more telling if there had been more of Bach’s music on the program. Takemitsu’s is so chromatic and, at times, lightly dissonant that the effect of this tuning change was not dramatic.But what really pushed Bach’s and Takemitsu’s music toward each other was Mr. Serkin’s interpretive approach, which was a matter of applying Takemitsu’s spirit to Bach’s music. Takemitsu’s works, from the early “Litany” (1950) through his last, “Rain Tree Sketch II” (1992), are mostly gentle meditations. Even the exceptions — “Piano Distance” (1961), with its loud bursts, and “For Away” (1973), with its denser harmonies and sharp edges — are more about atmosphere and the contrast between silence and sound than about dramatic energy.Mr. Serkin offered these works with an entrancing suppleness and transparency, and with a restrained, silken tone. And that was how he performed the Bach as well. He played the chorale prelude delicately and with finely shaded dynamics. And he painted the first four movements of the capriccio in dark hues and the same kind of melancholy, pianissimo phrasing that he brought to the opening movement of Takemitsu’s “Uninterrupted Rest” (1952).In the capriccio’s final two movements — when the brother’s coach whisks him away — Mr. Serkin abandoned the dynamic manipulations that had driven his account of the earlier movements and adopted bright timbres, zesty tempos and more conventional Bach playing. It was as if he were breaking the spell and releasing the audience to the bustling world outside.'"
"'06-10-14,'0','THE humble apple has a long history. It’s said to be the most commonly grown, versatile and varietal of fruits, not to mention most beloved. Its allure put Snow White into a coma. Adam and Eve, already living large, began their sweet-sour lives with a bite. One apple supposedly knocked an idea about gravity into the head of Sir Isaac Newton; another, fashioned in gold, precipitated the Trojan War. And of course there’s the Big Apple. That the perfect, glossy, uniformly bright red symbol of New York looks suspiciously like a Red Delicious from Washington State doesn’t matter, although the McIntosh, less handsome but a native New Yorker, might have been a more appropriate choice.October is National Apple Month, a perfect time to sample this year’s crop. Whether you choose sweet, sour, red, green or yellow, a medium-size apple is only 80 calories and full of pectin, antioxidants, potassium, calcium and vitamin C. Supermarkets now stock five or six varieties, and most are thick-skinned — good travelers that resist bruising. For fresher, unwaxed, less handled fruit and for fragile, uniquely complex heirloom apples, go to the source — the orchard.Northern Westchester and lower Putnam still have a few where the public is welcome to enjoy acres of picturesque landscape still untouched by developers. Some orchards have areas for pick-your-own apples and fields of pumpkins both off and still on the vine. Some offer hayrides, cider- or doughnut-pressing demonstrations, fruit pies and other fresh-baked goods, potted annuals, local garden vegetables, or jars of honey and preserves. All the orchards are more than a century old, but portions are always being replanted with commercial apples, heirlooms and new hybrids. Not all apple varieties will be available at the same time. They ripen serially, into late fall.Salinger’s, in Brewster, one of the larger orchards, offers the widest variety of apples, as well as a number of other fruits in season. An online newsletter keeps customers up-to-date. Stacks of pumpkins, Indian corn, snake and swan gourds, and pots of annuals lead to the market’s entrance. Inside are lean and creamy, hot-off-the-press doughnuts and bins of pears and apples. The peak-of-the-season selection includes Mutsu, Jonagold, Cortland, Macoun, Empire, McIntosh, Honeycrisp and Winesap. Shelves hold honey and preserves and, from the bakery, dozens of fruit pies, fresh or frozen (to finish in the home oven), with or without sweetener. The favorite apples of the owner, Bruce Salinger, are the sweet, firm Fuji and similar Mutsu, a complexly flavored apple with a hint of anise. But different varieties are constantly being developed. Mr. Salinger suggests watching for Fortune, a new apple with the sweetness of Northern Spy and the bite of McIntosh.There are apples for every taste, and more than three dozen grown locally. The personal favorites of Geoff Thompson, owner of Thompson’s Cider Mill in Croton-on-Hudson, are Liberty, a new variety; the delicate Macoun; sweet, nutty Hudson’s Golden Gem; and any of the Russets. These last make excellent cider, which he presses, as needed, every weekend in his red barn.'"
"'06-10-14,'0','A pattern had been set for the Mets: pitch the 40-year-old Tom Glavine every third day and hope and pray and battle when he isn’t pitching. And it worked, until last night.On Thursday night, Glavine pitched a tremendous game and the Mets won, 2-0. Yesterday, balls began flying out of Shea Stadium off the bats of both teams as the Mets played their non-Glavine game — hitting and relief pitching, and more relief pitching, and resilience. They tried to pull away from the Cardinals, but St. Louis pulled back. Ultimately, the Mets’ bullpen wilted under the pressure, and the Cardinals won, 9-6.The sobering question for Mets fans is this: How long can the Mets keep this up?“We have always stepped up to challenges,” Randolph said before last night’s game. “And we’ve done it all year long.” Randolph gave an eloquent answer yesterday to a question about perception. How do the Mets, with a whopping $100 million-plus payroll, manage to become a scrappy, underdog team.The Mets don’t have stars, they have stars who, despite their accomplishments still carry the burden of proof. And they have anchors throughout the clubhouse.The Mets are a team of stars that hustles, a team that is resilient, a big-market team that has to keep playing with a small-market sense of urgency, particularly after last night’s defeat.“It’s not about the payroll,” Randolph said. “For me, it’s about the attitude and the players you have on your team, your personality.”After Thursday night’s victory, I looked around the Mets’ clubhouse. Randolph was in his office; Glavine, who is 40, was off to one side speaking to reporters; Floyd, who is 33, was talking to other reporters along the back wall; and Carlos Delgado, 34, was talking, too.Randolph, Glavine, Floyd and Delgado. That is a powerful force field. I’m not saying this simply because the Mets are winning. I’m saying it because this chemistry is helping them win.Delgado is one of the most respected players in baseball, perfect for a franchise attempting to establish itself. He attracted attention two years ago with his silent protest, sitting in the dugout rather than joining his teammates on the field for the singing of “God Bless America.” He objected to the Iraq war and the Navy’s use of the small island of Vieques, off Puerto Rico, as a weapons-testing site for nearly 60 years.I remembered when he was in New York with the Toronto Blue Jays for two days, playing the Yankees in the Bronx. He was fiercely booed by fans at Yankee Stadium and ripped by talk-radio hosts and fans. He never backed down, never changed his routine, never sought fanfare.You may disagree with Delgado’s stand, but for the Mets, trying to build a foundation, Delgado was precisely the sort of through-thick-and-thin-type player they needed as a cornerstone.“He’s very solid,” said Randolph, who got to know Delgado when he played for the Blue Jays and Randolph was a coach with the Yankees.“You can tell when a guy exuded confidence, when he believes in his ability,” Randolph said. “He’s very confident, so he doesn’t go up and down emotionally.”General Manager Omar Minaya built these Mets to win now, and they have a good mix, one that doesn’t have a star at every position, like the Yankees in the postseason, one that finds a use for role players.When Floyd reinjured himself, he was replaced by Endy Chávez, who made a rally-killing catch in Thursday’s tight game.Interestingly, the Yankees were at their inspirational best this season after Hideki Matsui and Gary Sheffield were lost to injuries. A re-energized Bernie Williams and Melky Cabrera gave the Yankees energy and zest, and the team raced away with the American League East division. When Matsui and Sheffield returned late in the season, it was as if a rush of energy left the team.The Mets, lacking starting pitchers, lacking Floyd, needing one relief pitcher after another in most of their postseason games, have no choice but to be resilient, to bounce back. Can they do it?“If this team plays good baseball, we can win,” Delgado said. “We can match up with anybody; we can win the whole thing.”But after last night, they will have to play like an underdog.'"

"'06-10-15,'0','BEIJING, Oct. 15 — Chinese police officials have charged a prominent human rights lawyer with inciting subversion, part of a continuing crackdown on people who have sought to use China’s nascent legal system to limit the power of the state.The lawyer, Gao Zhisheng, was taken into custody in mid-August and was formally arrested on Sept. 21, but the police only recently made clear the nature of the charge, said his lawyer, Mo Shaoping.If Mr. Gao ends up being indicted and tried on subversion charges, it could mark one the highest profile prosecutions of an internationally recognized dissident in recent years.China often uses the legal system to punish people it considers subversive. But in recent years it has mainly sought to prosecute them for violating ordinary criminal laws, such as leaking state secrets, violating commercial codes, disrupting traffic or committing fraud.Mr. Gao, 42, represented displaced homeowners, victims of official corruption and religious rights advocates, including members of the Falun Gong sect, which is banned in China.'"
"'06-10-15,'0','COLLEGE STATION, Tex., Oct. 14 (AP) — Texas A&M Coach Dennis Franchione knew it was risky to tell his players they were going to beat No. 19 Missouri.He did it anyway, and the Aggies came through.“I wanted them to know I was confident in them,” Franchione said. “You know, you can’t do that week in and week out. I just think they needed to hear that.”Jorvorskie Lane ran for 127 yards and a touchdown and Texas A&M handed Missouri its first loss of the season by beating the Tigers, 25-19, on Saturday.Missouri (6-1, 2-1 Big 12 Conference) was trying to go 7-0 for the first time in 46 years.Stephen McGee was 19 for 23 for 183 yards and a touchdown for the Aggies. Texas A&M beat a ranked opponent at home for the first time in six tries under Franchione.The Aggies (6-1, 2-1) snapped a three-game losing streak to Big 12 opponents at Kyle Field. It was also a validating victory for Franchione, who was 16-19 in his first three seasons in College Station.'"

"'06-10-15,'0','The chief executive of UnitedHealth Group, a health insurance company that has been criticized for the way it accounted for stock options granted to top executives, is under pressure from board members to resign, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.The fate of William W. McGuire, who is also the chairman of the board of UnitedHealth, one of the biggest United States health insurers, may be decided at a board meeting on Sunday, the paper said.Reached by telephone on Saturday, Mark F. Lindsay, a spokesman for UnitedHealth, said, “It is premature to speculate on any actions the board might consider based on the review by the independent committee.” He declined further comment.Directors were briefed on Friday on the results of an internal company probe that found options were backdated, according to the report.The Minnesota attorney general, a New York federal prosecutor, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Services are also investigating stock options at Minneapolis-based UnitedHealth. Through backdating, stock options can be manipulated to increase their value.'"
"'06-10-15,'0','“These dangers are urgent,” Sam Nunn, an expert on nuclear proliferation and a former Democratic senator, told the group. “We are in a race between cooperation and catastrophe and, at this moment, the outcome is unclear.”But even the atomic agency itself exemplifies some of the underlying tensions inherent in the development of nuclear energy.For decades, the I.A.E.A., known as the world’s nuclear policeman, has pursued its other mandate — to promote safe nuclear power — by running technical aid programs with roughly a hundred states. Some of that knowledge could be useful in a weapons program, though the aid is meant exclusively for civilian use.The agency still helps Pakistan, which exploded a nuclear bomb in 1998. It also helped North Korea until a decade ago. Even today, it is assisting Iran, which many experts fear is close to mastering the basics of making a bomb. It has 14 programs under way with Iran, including a study on upgrading a nuclear research laboratory, as well as helping it start up its Bushehr reactor.North Korea’s reported test has shaken the nuclear status quo and raised anew the question of whether Asia will be the first to feel a nuclear “domino effect,” in which states clandestinely hedge their bets by assembling the crucial technologies needed to make a bomb, or actually cross the line to become new weapons states. In the Middle East, the confrontation with Iran has focused new attention on countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, both of which fear that an Iranian bomb would make Tehran the greatest power in the region.Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the I.A.E.A., has estimated that up to 49 nations now know how to make nuclear arms, and he has warned that global tensions could push some over the line.“We are relying,” he said, “primarily on the continued good intentions of these countries — intentions which are in turn based on their sense of security or insecurity, and could therefore be subject to rapid change.”Worry about proliferation is hardly new. In March 1963, President John F. Kennedy said, “I am haunted by the feeling that by 1970, unless we are successful, there may be 10 nuclear powers instead of 4, and by 1975, 15 or 20.” That timetable proved to be inaccurate. But in recent years there has been a sense around the globe that President Kennedy’s prediction is about to come true, three decades late.Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said this year that “the international community seems almost to be sleepwalking” down a path where states, after long living without nuclear arms, now feel compelled to revisit their logic.He warned of a new arms race — not one of superpowers, but of regional powers. “Perhaps most damaging of all,” he concluded, “there is also a perception that the possession of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction offers the best protection against being attacked.”Democrats and Republicans spent the past week arguing over who lost control of North Korea, Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. But seeds of the problem were planted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, just months after the armistice ended the fighting on the Korean Peninsula in 1953.“It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of soldiers,” President Eisenhower told the United Nations that year, just as his administration was completing a series of 11 nuclear tests. “It must be put in the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace.”His program was called Atoms for Peace, and soon involved dozens of nations, all seeking to unlock the magic of nuclear power. The first generation of nuclear reactors sprang up around the globe, as did a huge supporting industry and an international overseer, the I.A.E.A.But almost from the start, evidence accumulated that countries were using the civil alliances and reactor technologies to make bombs. By 1960, France had joined the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union as a nuclear weapons state. China conducted its first test in 1964. Israel had the bomb by 1967, India by 1974, South Africa by 1982 (it has since given up its weapons) and Pakistan by 1998.All but the original three built their weapons by exploiting at least some technologies that were ostensibly civilian, nuclear analysts say. They enriched uranium beyond the low level needed for power reactors. Or they mined the spent fuel of civil reactors for plutonium — the path that North Korea started taking in the late 1980’s or early 1990’s, according to American intelligence officials.The international atomic agency, which still inscribes Atoms for Peace on its business cards, has worked hard to fight this kind of cheating while also helping with the basic technology. In the 1980’s, it aided Iran’s hunt for uranium.Even today, Iranian technicians fly to Vienna and agency experts go to Iran to lend a hand. In August, two experts went to review progress at the Bushehr reactor, which is scheduled to go critical next year.“It’s helping establish that the plant is run in a safe and secure manner, which is in everybody’s interest,” said M. Peter Salema, an agency official. “Look at Chernobyl. That’s the whole point.”Many of the agency’s cooperative projects use nuclear science to humanitarian ends, like fighting disease and treating cancer. But others involve more basic atomic skills.“We provide expert services,” Dr. Salema said, “so they can learn to do things for themselves.”The Manhattan project scientists who built the first atom bomb predicted that the diffusion of their secret knowledge was inevitable. It was just a question of time. Now, after decades of scholarly digging, government declassification, open research in uranium and plutonium metallurgy and the rise of the Internet, much of that information is freely available.“The general concepts are widely known,” said Robert S. Norris, the author of “Racing for the Bomb.” “Still, it’s another thing to actually do it. That still requires certain skills of engineering and chemistry and physics.”The hardest part, experts agree, is not acquiring the weapons blueprints but obtaining the fuel. That is becoming easier because of developments both overt and covert.Abdul Qadeer Khan, a chief architect of Pakistan’s nuclear arms program who went on to establish the world’s largest atomic black market, sold the secrets of how to make centrifuges for enriching uranium to Libya, Iran and North Korea. Tehran insists its intentions are entirely peaceful, though most analysts judge that all three countries bought from the black market because they wanted to make nuclear arms.Dr. Khan sold plans and parts for Pakistan’s first-generation centrifuge, the P-1, as well as the next generation, the P-2, which can spin faster to enrich uranium more rapidly.Investigators are still trying to learn where else Dr. Khan may have planted his nuclear seeds. They discovered outposts of his network in Dubai, Malaysia and South Africa and found that before his downfall in 2004 he visited at least 18 countries, including Egypt, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria and Saudi Arabia.The worrisome enrichment trends involve not just stealthy military advances but also soaring demands for nuclear power, driven by rising populations, dwindling oil supplies and fears that the combustion of fossil fuels is warming the planet.“The nuclear renaissance is gaining momentum,” said George B. Assie, vice president for business development at Cameco, the world’s largest publicly traded uranium company, based in Canada.In London, the World Nuclear Association says 28 new reactors are under construction, 62 planned, and 160 proposed, most in Asia. The required uranium, it estimates, could run to more than 65,000 tons.While it is not clear if the expansion of the world’s civilian atomic infrastructure will ultimately lead to a rise in the number of countries building nuclear arms, it could give more countries the means to do so.There are two main ways to turn civilian technology to military use. The first is to enrich uranium fuel from its usual level of 5 percent for reactors to the 90 percent needed for a bomb, a modest step that requires longer processing in centrifuges. The second is to take spent reactor fuel and mine it for plutonium, the other main fuel for a bomb.The Brazilian military, for example, worked hard for decades to develop centrifuges to enrich uranium fuel for a bomb, a secret program it renounced in the 1990’s.In May, Brazil, despite growing pressure to give up indigenous production, inaugurated its first uranium enrichment plant — an assembly of advanced centrifuges in Resende, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. While Iran has aroused global suspicions for erecting a similar plant, Brazil managed to reassure other nations, and the international atomic agency, that its aims are peaceful.“We have an urgent need to expand the electric system,” said Leonam dos Santos Guimarães, an official of Electronuclear, which operates nuclear power plants in Brazil.Forecasting the size of the revitalized global industry is difficult. Even so, the predictions can be staggering. Hans-Holger Rogner, an economist at the international atomic agency, said that many forecasts for the 21st century foresaw huge expansions beyond the 443 power reactors now operating globally.“An increase to 5,000 reactors is well within the range of many of the longer-range studies,” Dr. Rogner said, adding: “People are positioning themselves. There seems to be a race coming and nobody wants to be left out.”A day after North Korea’s nuclear test, Japan’s new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, vowed not to abandon Japan’s commitment to reject and never possess nuclear weapons, a cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.But, even so, Japan already has all the component parts. It has many tons of plutonium left over from the operation of its reactors, according to a 2004 government report to the I.A.E.A. A small nuclear warhead requires only 10 pounds.Japan is the ultimate example of a “nuclear option” state, a country that the world knows could become an atomic power virtually overnight, if need be. “They could be very far down the road toward a virtual deterrent and not be in violation of any of the existing international treaties,” said Robert L. Gallucci, the former chief American negotiator with North Korea, and now dean of Georgetown University’s school of foreign service.South Korea has also vowed not to pursue nuclear weapons. But it has an extensive network of nuclear power reactors and a few years ago, I.A.E.A. inspectors found evidence of undeclared experimentation to make highly enriched uranium. In the early 1990’s, South Korea signed an agreement to keep the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free — but it signed the accord with North Korea.Iran’s nuclear rise has prompted concerns that the Middle East could experience similar pressures. In the region, only Israel is believed to possess nuclear arms, although it has never confirmed that. If Iran — a Shiite state — does indeed build nuclear weapons, there are fears that Sunni powers like Saudi Arabia or Egypt will be tempted to make their own bombs.Egypt, which long ago sought to build nuclear arms, may be starting to rethink its earlier renunciation. The 1998 nuclear tests by India and Pakistan shook Cairo. “Egypt’s leaders had placed their bet clearly in favor of the Middle East and the world moving away from nuclear weapons,” said Robert J. Einhorn, a former senior State Department nonproliferation official. “But here was a disquieting indication that movement might be in the opposite direction.”Recently, the international atomic agency found that Egypt had kept some of its old and new efforts cloaked in secrecy, including a continuing project to acquire uranium ore in the Sinai desert. In September, Cairo announced plans to revive its stalled program to build reactors for generating nuclear power. It gave no sign of whether it, like Iran, planned to make reactor fuel on its own.So the question now is whether North Korea’s test, and Iran’s challenge, will change the calculus. “When additional countries get the bomb, it does create new pressures,” said Matthew Bunn of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who tracks the spread of nuclear technology. “But each country is unique and there’s little risk that the dominoes will fall quickly, especially if we take steps to prevent it.”When atomic specialists gathered in Vienna in September to discuss new ground rules for a second nuclear age, their proceedings were fueled by the fear that some of the old restraints — both technological and political — are fraying.The central proposal debated at the I.A.E.A.’s headquarters sounded simple: No longer should nations be permitted to develop their own means of enriching uranium to make reactor fuel, which Iran and other developing states have claimed as their inalienable right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Nearly 40 years after the treaty was drafted, the dangers simply seem too great.Instead, the argument went, nations should band together to make multinational fuel banks where they could watch one another, making sure no fuel is diverted for bomb production.“A threat exists,” said Sergei Kirienko, director of the Russian Federal Atomic Energy Agency. “We understand that only those solutions that are resolved together, that ensure access for all nations today, will be successful.”Russia took the lead, proposing an international fuel bank that it would set up on its own soil by next year — and from which it could potentially extract billions of dollars in sales. But the big splash came when Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire philanthropist, pledged $50 million for a fuel bank to be run by the I.A.E.A., making the United Nations body a “supplier of last resort” for any country that forsakes making its own fuel. The Bush administration has backed similar plans.But while there is agreement on the problem, solutions bogged down in bickering — from weapons states that want to maintain their capacity and from developing nations that sniff a conspiracy to deny them the same nuclear rights that large powers have long enjoyed.“We should guard against the notion that sensitive technologies are safe in the hands of some, but pose a risk when others have access to them,” said Buyelwa Sonjica, the energy minister of South Africa, which wants to restart its enrichment program and build up to six reactors.Few parties involved in the debate are optimistic about reform, and some say the enterprise is doomed to failure.“Nuclear power is inextricably linked with nuclear proliferation,” the environmental group Greenpeace said in a recent statement. “None of the schemes being promoted will solve this problem. In fact, they will make it worse.”So far, though, the countries that the world most wants to stop from enriching say they have seen no reason to do so.At a dinner in New York in September, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran looked supremely confident as he batted away the idea that other countries could be relied upon to provide him with the nuclear fuel he said he needed.“Before stopping enrichment by others, why don’t you stop building the next generation of nuclear weapons?” he asked his American hosts. Then, smiling, he suggested that the United States just buy its nuclear fuel from Iran’s new facilities. He would sell it to Washington, he said, “with a 50 percent discount.”'"
"'06-10-15,'0','“I’ve urged everyone to make those decisions on their own,” Mr. Talent said after the speech to the electricians, in Osage Beach, Mo., when asked about the ballot measure. “I’ve tried not to make it political.”Ms. McCaskill denied shying from the issue but acknowledged it was not part of her standard campaign speech.“It’s not that I’m ignoring it, but the stem cell issue usually comes up in the context of question and answer,” she said after a debate in Clayton, Mo. “People are confused and want to talk about it.”The truth of the matter, campaign analysts say, is that Mr. Talent and Ms. McCaskill are battling over a tiny percentage of undecided voters and dare not risk offending them by drawing attention to such a polarizing issue.The race here is one of six nationwide in which Democrats see the possibility of picking up a Republican seat to win control of the Senate; as such, there is little margin for error for either party. Even in a recent national television appearance on MSNBC, when the two candidates were asked about stem cell research, Mr. Talent and Ms. McCaskill were measured in their responses, and careful to use language that would not offend.Robert Hunt Sprinkle, the editor in chief of Politics and the Life Sciences, a journal edited at the University of Maryland, has tracked how the stem cell research issue has figured in elections nationwide. Mr. Sprinkle said it was “quite sensible” that the two candidates in Missouri had backed away from “defending a view on a topic of arcane technological content” in a close campaign.“This is a debate that is entered at one’s peril in the campaign context, when a sound bite is removed for analysis,” he said. “These are very treacherous waters.”The dynamic is markedly different in several other states, where Democratic candidates have made stem cell research a bigger part of their campaigns, in part because of evidence of broad public support for the research in those states and because of the wedge it sometimes drives between far-right and moderate Republicans.In Wisconsin, the incumbent Democratic governor, James E. Doyle, has made his steady support of all permissible forms of stem cell research almost a daily mantra in his race against Representative Mark Green, a Republican who favors setting stricter limits.In the Maryland race for the Senate, Lt. Gov. Michael Steele, a Republican, is running against Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, a Democrat who has tailored his message to two main themes: the war in Iraq and his support for stem cell research.“Ben Cardin is doing what I expected Claire McCaskill to do, which is bring it up,” said Trevor Parry-Giles, an associate professor of political communication at the University of Maryland. “It might be one of those issues that plays better on the coasts for Democrats, but Republicans face a tougher road on this one because they need moderate independent voters.”In Missouri, Mr. Talent has found himself tripping over the Republican divide.Some more moderate Republicans, including Gov. Matt Blunt and John C. Danforth, the former United States senator, are backing the stem cell research referendum, while more conservative legislators, including Representative Todd Akin, are speaking out against it, particularly to Christian congregations.At first, Mr. Talent chose to steer clear of the issue, hesitating to take a position on the ballot measure before relenting under pressure from Christian conservatives. The senator had already angered many conservatives by removing his name from a Senate bill opposed to cloning, so there was some bridge-building to be done.“This is a difficult issue,” Mr. Talent said in an interview. “It comes up a fair amount, but I’ve been talking about my priorities and what they’re going to be. Generally, I’ve focused on what I’ve done.”And as of late, Ms. McCaskill has made that task easier for Mr. Talent by also sidestepping the stem cell debate. Like many Democrats facing off against incumbent Republicans, Ms. McCaskill, the Missouri state auditor, has highlighted Mr. Talent’s close association with an unpopular White House and pressed national issues like security, the war in Iraq, taxes and health care.“He agrees with President Bush more than I agree with my husband,” Ms. McCaskill said of Mr. Talent in an interview. “I think it’s very hard for Missourians to accept that he’s an agent of change. In contrast, I have very independent branding.”The largest group in the state promoting stem cell research, the Missouri Coalition for Lifesaving Cures, which is responsible for putting the initiative on the ballot, has steered clear of questions about the Senate race because of its nonpartisan stance.The group’s chairman, Donn Rubin, said it was trying to pitch a large tent.“Our initiative is supported by many denominations, Christian and other, who believe in this research as a means to alleviate suffering,” Mr. Rubin said. “Any one of us could be a patient tomorrow and we all have a stake in seeing this amendment pass.”If the measure were to pass — and polls indicate that a majority of Missourians support it — Missouri would join California as the only states to include the right to perform stem cell research in its state constitution. But unlike the California measure, which designated billions of dollars for the research, the Missouri amendment does not include a commitment to financing. (It does not bar the possibility of it, however.)The ballot measure would guarantee that any stem cell research that is legal under federal law could be performed in Missouri. Mr. Rubin said the coalition sought to get the issue on the ballot in direct response to efforts for years by conservative lawmakers to ban the cloning procedure involved in some forms of the research.In the most controversial form of stem cell research, embryos are cloned and their stem cells are removed. This practice has ignited the political debate about whether life is being destroyed.“This is the big one, this is the biggest pro-life issue voters have ever been confronted with,” said Pam Fichter, the president of Missouri Right to Life. “This is the people deciding whether they want to enshrine in the constitution the right to clone and kill human embryos.”Given the void in the discourse at the candidates’ level, many voters have been left to sort through a barrage of advertisements financed by independent groups. On billboards, on the radio and on television, the proposed amendment has been dubbed the “kill bill” by anti-abortion groups and conservative Christians. Advocates for the measure equate its passing with the guarantee of lifesaving cures.Meanwhile, the Senate candidates continue to look for swing voters. Ms. McCaskill is working long hours to shore up her standing in the state’s rural counties, where weak support from conservative voters contributed to her narrow defeat in the governor’s race in 2004 and where opposition to the stem cell initiative tends to be strong. At the same time, Mr. Talent is trying to win the support of more liberal voters in urban areas, where his conservative views on stem cell research generally are not well received.“They’re raiding the traditional backyard of the other,” said Professor Lana Stein, who heads the political science department at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.'"
"'06-10-15,'0','Couples decide to live together for many reasons, but real estate can be as compelling as romance.“Owning three toothbrushes and finding that they are always at the wrong house when you are getting ready to go to bed wears on you,” said Amanda Hawn, a 28-year-old writer who set up housekeeping near San Francisco with her boyfriend, Nate Larsen, a real estate analyst, after shuttling between his apartment and one she shared with a friend. “Moving in together has simplified life,” Ms. Hawn said.The census survey estimated that 5.2 million couples, a little more than 5 percent of households, were unmarried opposite-sex partners. An additional 413,000 households were male couples, and 363,000 were female couples. In all, nearly one in 10 couples were unmarried. (More than one in four households consisted of people living alone).And the numbers of unmarried couples are growing. Since 2000, those identifying themselves as unmarried opposite-sex couples rose by about 14 percent, male couples by 24 percent and female couples by 12 percent.Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said gay couples were undercounted because many gay people were reluctant to disclose their sexual orientation. But he said that inhibition seemed to be fading.“I would say the increase is due to people feeling more comfortable disclosing that they are gay or lesbian and living with a partner,” he said.The survey did not ask about sexual orientation, but its questionnaire was designed to distinguish partners from roommates. A partner was defined as “an adult who is unrelated to the householder, but shares living quarters and has a close personal relationship with the householder.”Some of the biggest gains in unmarried couples were recorded in unexpected places. In the rural Midwest, the number of households made up of male partners rose 77 percent since 2000.The survey revealed wide disparities in household composition by place. The proportion of married couples ranged from more than 69 percent in Utah County, Utah, which includes Provo, to 26 percent in Manhattan, which has a smaller share of married couples than almost anyplace in the country. But Manhattan registered a 1.2 percent increase in married couples since 2000, in contrast to the rest of New York City and many other places.Among counties, the highest proportion of unmarried opposite-sex partners was in Mendocino, Calif., where they made up nearly 11 percent of all households.The highest share of male couples was in San Francisco, where, according to the census, they accounted for nearly 2 percent of all households. In Manhattan, they made up 1 percent of households. Hampshire County, Mass., home to Northampton, had the highest proportion of female couples, at 1.7 percent. Some of the highest numbers of unmarried couples were recorded in the South, which as defined by the census, has the largest population of any region.David Blankenhorn, president of the marriage advocacy group the Institute for American Values, said married couples had become a minority largely because of the growing number of households made up of people who planned to marry or who used to be married.Steve Watters, the director of young adults for Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian group, said that the trend of fewer married couples was more a reflection of delaying marriage than rejection of it.“It does show that a lot of people are experimenting with alternatives before they get there,” Mr. Watters said. “The biggest concern is that those who still aspire to marriage are going to find fewer models. They’re also finding they’ve gotten so good at being single it’s hard to be at one with another person.”But Pamela J. Smock, a researcher at the University of Michigan Population Studies Center, said her research — unaffiliated with the Census Bureau — found that the desire for strong family bonds, and especially marriage, was constant.“Even cohabiting young adults tell us that they are doing so because it would be unwise to marry without first living together in a society marked by high levels of divorce,” Ms. Smock said.A number of couples interviewed agreed that cohabiting was akin to taking a test drive and, given the scarcity of affordable apartments and homes, also a matter of convenience. Some said that pregnancy was the only thing that would prompt them to make a legal commitment soon. Others said they never intended to marry. A few of those couples said they were inspired by solidarity with gay and lesbian couples who cannot legally marry in most states.Jennifer Lynch, a 28-year-old stage manager in New York, said she had lived on the Lower East Side with her boyfriend, who is 37 and divorced, for most of the five years they have been a couple.“Cohabitating is our choice, and we have no intention to be married,” Ms. Lynch said. “There is little difference between what we do and what married people do. We love each other, exist together, all of our decisions are based upon each other. Everyone we care about knows this.”If anything, she added, “not having the false security of wedding rings makes us work even a little harder.”With more competition from other ways of living, the proportion of married couples has been shrinking for decades. In 1930, they accounted for about 84 percent of households. By 1990 the proportion of married couples had declined to about 56 percent.Married couples have not been a majority of households headed by adults younger than 25 since the 1970’s, but among those aged 25 to 34 the proportion slipped below 50 percent for the first time within the past five years. (Among Americans aged 35 to 64, married couples still make up a majority of all households.)“It’s partially fueled by women in the work force; they don’t necessarily have to marry to be economically secure,” said Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College of the City University of New York, who conducted the census analysis for The New York Times. “You used to get married to have sex. Now one of the major reasons to get married is to have children, and the attractiveness of having children has declined for many people because of the cost.”William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, attributed the accelerated trend to the lifestyles of baby boomers.“It’s the legacy of the boomers that have finally caused this tipping point,” Dr. Frey said. “Certainly later generations have followed in boomer footsteps, with high levels of living together before marriage, and more flexible lifestyles. But the boomers were the trailblazers, once again, rebelling against a norm their parents epitomized.“This would seem to close the book on the Ozzie and Harriet era that characterized much of the last century,” he said.'"
"'06-10-15,'0','He had long been unsure of the role his sexuality should play. At the nation’s first major gay march on Washington in 1979, he told friends he could neither attend nor stay away.“His act of courage was to jog within a block of it,” said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, the congressman from Mr. Studds’s adjoining district, who announced his own homosexuality four years later. “He felt that conflicted.”Once outed, however, Mr. Studds refused to buckle to conservative pressure to resign.“All members of Congress are in need of humbling experiences from time to time,” Mr. Studds said at the time. But he never apologized. He defended the relationship as consensual and condemned the investigation, saying it had invaded his privacy.He went on to win re-election in 1984, surprising both supporters and opponents.For some, it echoed an earlier, unexpected accomplishment: In 1968, as a 30-year-old teacher at St. Paul’s School in Concord, N.H., Mr. Studds was one of two crucial figures who persuaded Senator Eugene McCarthy to bring his antiwar presidential campaign to the state’s primary. Members of the campaign partly attributed Mr. McCarthy’s surprisingly strong showing there — which helped force President Lyndon B. Johnson out of the race — to the 12-day tour Mr. Studds had scheduled.“He was a major factor for us in the New Hampshire primary,” said Seymour M. Hersh, who was the press secretary for Mr. McCarthy. “Gerry was just there; he was there with ideas, he was there to organize.”Mr. Studds’s re-election in 1984 had reverberations of its own.“In a sense, he became a role model,” said Charles Kaiser, author of “1968 in America” and “The Gay Metropolis.” “His experience convinced other people that it would now be possible to run as an openly gay person.”Mr. Studds also seemed emboldened by his re-election. He began to demand more money for AIDS research and treatment. He pressed for the right of gay people to serve openly in the military, releasing a previously suppressed Pentagon report in 1989, which concluded that sexuality “is unrelated to job performance in the same way as is being left- or right-handed.”In addition to speaking on the House floor on behalf of gay marriage, he set an example. In 2004, he and his longtime partner, Dean T. Hara, became one of the first couples to marry under a Massachusetts law allowing gay marriage.“Gerry often said that it was the fight for gay and lesbian equality that was the last great civil rights chapter in modern American history,” Mr. Hara said in a statement.“He did not live to see its final sentences written,” Mr. Hara added, “but all of us will forever be indebted to him for leading the way with compassion and wisdom.”Mr. Studds’s past had recently resurfaced. In the final two weeks of his life, the two-decade-old controversy surrounding Mr. Studds became an issue in the 2006 midterm election campaign as a new Congressional page scandal unfolded.Though his name had barely been mentioned in Washington since he retired, the resignation late last month of Representative Mark Foley, a Florida Republican, revived interest in Mr. Studds’s own dalliance with a teenage page in 1983.Across the country, several Republican candidates sought to deflect criticism aimed at their own party by reminding voters about Mr. Studds. The National Republican Congressional Committee chastised Democrats in this year’s race for taking contributions from party leaders who had served with Mr. Studds.In the Oct. 16 issue of The Weekly Standard, printed before Mr. Studds’s death, the conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer also invoked the retired Massachusetts congressman as he drew a contrast between Republicans and Democrats. Mr. Krauthammer argued that Mr. Foley had resigned immediately and that Mr. Studds had left Congress only after Democrats had lost their majority, which he called “the political equivalent of dying in your sleep.”Mr. Hara, Mr. Studds’s husband, declined to comment on the newest criticism.A memorial service will be held in November. In addition to Mr. Hara, Mr. Studds is survived by his brother, Colin Studds; his sister-in-law, Mary Lou Studds; his sister, Gaynor Stewart; four nephews; and his English springer spaniel, Bonnie.'"
"'06-10-15,'0','But to critics, Mr. Spitzer’s bold assaults on corporate America sometimes bordered on the reckless, raising questions in their minds about his fitness to run the state’s sprawling government. There have been stories of his angry phone calls and in-your-face gestures aimed at critics. Some defendants say he threatened them with criminal charges to force settlements, something his office denies.For all their disagreements, though, critics and supporters concur on one thing: Mr. Spitzer, 47, understood power better than any attorney general in recent memory and was rarely shy about using it. And he is likely to take a similar no-holds-barred approach to trying to shake up the hidebound political culture of Albany.“He’s not a go-along, get-along kind of guy,” said Eric Dinallo, who led the investigations of Wall Street for Mr. Spitzer’s office and is now general counsel for Willis Group, a global insurance broker.“So I’d predict his reaction will be to completely ‘out’ any big conflict and publicly laser-beam the problem or person he views as responsible,” he said. “As in financial services, it could cause a paradigm shift in the way things are done in Albany.”A review of Mr. Spitzer’s record, including about two dozen interviews with current and former colleagues, friends and adversaries, reveals other clues about how Mr. Spitzer, who has a large lead in polls over his Republican rival, John Faso, would behave as governor.Judges praise Mr. Spitzer for elevating talent over patronage when making key appointments. He proved himself an extremely tough negotiator, willing to raise the stakes in a confrontation. He insisted on devouring thick backgrounders instead of relying on a press release before stepping in front of television cameras.He was also keenly aware of how the news media could help achieve his goals — and, critics say, promote his political career. He could agonize over important decisions, yet he would aggressively, at times ruthlessly, some say, pursue his objectives. And he had a firm belief in his own rightness, coupled with a low tolerance for those who would stand in his way.Along the way, he reinvented an office whose glory days seemed past, capitalizing on a growing public concern that the financial markets were weighted against average people. It was a crusade grounded in Mr. Spitzer’s philosophy that the states were obligated to police markets left untended by sleepy Washington bureaucracies.“Critics of state action overlook the absence of federal action that made the Merrill Lynch investigation and reforms necessary,” Mr. Spitzer told Congress in June 2002, rebutting assertions that he had overstepped his authority.“The state security regulators are the cops on the beat who ensure that the investing public is protected from fraud — whether that fraud is perpetrated by a small bucket shop or by one of the biggest investment institutions in the world.”Before he narrowly defeated Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco, a Republican, in 1998, Mr. Spitzer’s familiarity with a little-known state securities law called the Martin Act was confined mostly to having once been accused of breaking it. Mr. Vacco asserted Mr. Spitzer had violated the law by failing to file required consumer-protection notices before using a co-op apartment as collateral for a campaign loan.It was one of many barbs tossed around during a heated campaign, in which Mr. Vacco accused Mr. Spitzer of conflicts of interest stemming from his family’s extensive real estate holdings. Mr. Spitzer, in turn, asserted that Mr. Vacco had weakened the office with patronage hires. And after he took over, Mr. Spitzer, a former assistant district attorney, made a point of hiring seasoned prosecutors, and giving them leeway to develop cases as they saw fit.“Eliot is the leader, but the engine of this office is the bureau chiefs,” said Michele Hirshman, Mr. Spitzer’s top deputy and a former federal prosecutor. “Things bubble up from them. This is not a top-down organization.”One of those bureau chiefs was Mr. Dinallo, who came to the job with an unusual appreciation for the Martin Act. He had used it to prosecute white-collar criminals while at the Manhattan district attorney’s office, but he knew it could also be used to bring civil cases. Although only a few attorneys general had made full use of it, notably Louis Lefkowitz in the 1970’s and Albert Ottinger in the 1920’s, Mr. Spitzer quickly grasped its potential, Mr. Dinallo said.The state law — which grants far-reaching authority to subpoena documents, compel testimony and conduct public investigations in securities cases — gave Mr. Spitzer a powerful weapon to back up his oft-spoken criticism that federal agencies were shirking their enforcement duties. One of his earliest conversations with his new staff included an abstract digression on federalism, with Mr. Spitzer explaining his belief that states had a responsibility to pick up the regulatory slack.“Frankly, a lot of people rolled their eyes and said, ‘Too theoretical, come on,’ ” Mr. Spitzer recalled recently.By the time Mr. Spitzer began his first major Martin Act investigation, of Merrill Lynch in 2001, he had already built a solid record pursuing labor, environmental and predatory-lending cases, and strengthened the part of his office that defends state agencies. There were also disappointments, notably an unsuccessful suit accusing the gun industry of selling unsafe weapons, as well as failed attempts to pass laws increasing Mr. Spitzer’s power to combat Medicaid fraud.But Merrill Lynch soon changed everything.It came onto the radar screen after the company settled a lawsuit by a Queens doctor who lost $500,000 investing in Internet stocks touted by Merrill Lynch’s analysts. Mr. Dinallo and his team went after the firm, subpoenaing years of internal e-mail messages and other documents. They revealed that the analysts were privately criticizing the same companies they were recommending to investors, and that some of those companies were also clients of Merrill Lynch’s investment banking division, creating a conflict of interest.After negotiations on a settlement stalled in April 2002, Mr. Spitzer invoked a section of the Martin Act that allowed him to go to a judge, without Merrill Lynch’s knowledge, and secure a court order forcing it to disclose its conflicts. He then went public, accusing the firm of a “shocking betrayal of trust.”At first, the reaction was not what Mr. Spitzer expected. Federal regulators, smarting from his open disdain for their enforcement efforts, declined to join him. Merrill Lynch dug in its heels. And Wall Street bankers shook their heads, saying the overeager attorney general obviously did not understand high finance.“He was really alone on the Merrill Lynch case,” Mr. Dinallo said. “It was not long after 9/11, and we were dealing with one of the biggest employers in New York. Now it all looks so obvious and easy, but at the time it was somewhat scary, frankly.”But the scales soon tipped. Watching its market value plunge on the news of Mr. Spitzer’s findings, Merrill Lynch agreed to pay a $100 million fine and change its practices, earning him his first major victory.Still, the episode exposed a certain naïveté about the full implications of Mr. Spitzer’s activist brand of federalism. Nicholas Thompson, who wrote a lengthy analysis of Mr. Spitzer’s use of the Martin Act for Legal Affairs magazine in 2004, said Mr. Spitzer came close to putting “one of the nation’s most important financial firms out of business,” when he unwittingly put into play the federal law that bars securities firms under court order from managing mutual funds.“When I finished reporting that story, I was left wondering, ‘Do I like Spitzer?’” Mr. Thompson said recently. “I’m not sure. The Martin Act gave him a frightening amount of power, and he didn’t hesitate to use it.”The Merrill Lynch case contained key elements that defined all of Mr. Spitzer’s forays into Wall Street misconduct: An admission by the company that a long-accepted practice was improper, coupled with a commitment to change. He followed up with a $1.4 billion settlement with 10 other firms, widely viewed as an admission of guilt from the entire investment banking community.In negotiating settlements, Mr. Spitzer displayed a steeliness that unnerved some executives. A lawyer who sat in on several such sessions said a typical meeting would begin with Mr. Spitzer welcoming the bankers with jokes and light banter.“Then he would change modes and give an extremely tough message,” the lawyer said. “If you read a transcript of it, it would strike you as extremely negative or cold. Then, on the way out, he would revert to jokes. The atmosphere may be tense but it would still be civil.”Using the investigative approach of following e-mail messages and pressing insiders to talk, Mr. Spitzer followed up tips generated by the Merrill Lynch case and went after mutual fund executives who engaged in illegal market timing or late trading of shares. He racked up 11 guilty pleas and more than $4 billion in settlements in those cases.In quick succession, his office took on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. He extracted large settlements and pledges of reform from insurance giants, including $850 million from the broker Marsh & McLennan, whom he accused of defrauding clients by rigging bids for policies. With the drug industry, Mr. Spitzer won a commitment from GlaxoSmithKline to fully disclose information from clinical trials.David D. Brown IV, who succeeded Mr. Dinallo in 2003 as chief of the investment protection bureau, said the cases “reflected a deliberate choice by Spitzer to get to the regular places where people interact with the world of finance.”As Mr. Spitzer plowed ahead, he won plaudits and gained a national reputation as “the sheriff of Wall Street.” One financial columnist said he “may be America’s most powerful politician outside Washington.”But criticism also mounted in some quarters that he was abusing his discretion and muddying the boundaries between federal and state oversight. There were attempts in Congress, unsuccessful, to ban state investigations of securities firms, and arguments flared between federal regulators and Mr. Spitzer’s office.Some observers expressed discomfort at how Mr. Spitzer handled the Marsh case, noting that he announced publicly he would no longer negotiate with its chief executive, Jeffrey W. Greenberg. That left Marsh with the choice of getting rid of Mr. Greenberg or facing possible criminal indictment, a corporate death sentence. It decided to replace Mr. Greenberg with Michael G. Cherkasky, who was Mr. Spitzer’s former boss at the Manhattan district attorney’s office, as well as a friend and campaign contributor.Critics said the move was orchestrated by Mr. Spitzer. Mr. Spitzer refused to give an inch. In a speech to the National Press Club in January 2005, he mocked federal regulators and Wall Street barons, and dismissed his critics as “so-called voices of the free market, defending frauds as honest mistakes and making excuses for criminal actions like bid rigging.”“Does anybody out there really believe that the market was better off with those problems before we revealed them?” he said.As Mr. Spitzer’s high-profile victories gained him enemies, stories circulated of him blowing up at people or threatening businesses with ruin if they did not settle, which his office denied. Although much of it could be traced back to embittered defendants eager to take the shine off Mr. Spitzer’s reputation, a few one-time supporters also questioned his judgment.Jacob H. Zamansky, a lawyer who brought the lawsuit against Merrill Lynch that prompted Mr. Spitzer’s investigation, complained that he did not do enough to ensure that small investors were made whole. Short of wringing settlements from embarrassed corporations, Mr. Spitzer seemed to have trouble winning the few cases that actually went to court, Mr. Zamansky asserted.He cited the acquittal of Theodore Sihpol, a midlevel banker who was arrested in a late-trading case where Mr. Spitzer decided to let the main culprit, Edward Stern, manager of Canary Capital, walk away after paying a $40 million penalty.“Public shaming of companies and individuals is appropriate, but is that really the role of a prosecutor?” Mr. Zamansky said. “It’s not just shaming people. It’s proving a case, and that’s where he came up empty.”In an interview, Mr. Spitzer said he had no regrets, although he conceded it was a difficult decision to not prosecute Mr. Stern.“I agonized long and hard over the disposition with Canary and Stern,” he said. “Leniency with Stern broke open the late-trading issue. We made the right judgment call.”The case that has caused Mr. Spitzer the most trouble involved John C. Whitehead, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Whitehead irked Mr. Spitzer by criticizing his investigation of Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chairman of American International Group.Mr. Greenberg, a towering figure in the insurance industry, was forced out at A.I.G. after Mr. Spitzer and federal regulators accused the company of manipulating its financial statements to bolster its stock price. Mr. Spitzer sued Mr. Greenberg for fraud, but stopped short of filing criminal charges, even though he once made comments that seemed to imply Mr. Greenberg had broken the law.Mr. Whitehead, who took issue with Mr. Spitzer’s remarks about illegality, wrote in The Wall Street Journal last December that Mr. Spitzer called and threatened him over his defense of Mr. Greenberg, saying: “It’s now a war between us and you’ve fired the first shot. I will be coming after you. You will pay the price.”Mr. Whitehead wrote: “I was astounded. No one had ever talked to me like that before. It was a little scary.”Mr. Spitzer’s office responded by questioning Mr. Whitehead’s motivation, suggesting he was part of a plot by Mr. Greenberg to discredit the attorney general. Mr. Spitzer conceded in a recent interview, “It was a call that could have been handled more judiciously.”Asked why he had made the call in the first place, Mr. Spitzer replied, “When you respect someone the way I respect him, you care about their opinion. I suppose it comes from an underlying faith, clearly wrong, in my powers of persuasion.”He has also engaged in a running feud with Kenneth G. Langone, the billionaire former director of the New York Stock Exchange, whom Mr. Spitzer is suing, along with the exchange’s former chairman, Richard A. Grasso, over Mr. Grasso’s $190 million pay package. Mr. Langone’s representatives said Mr. Spitzer told a mutual acquaintance he intended to “put a spike through Langone’s heart.” The two men have had several tense encounters at social functions.“Spitzer’s methods are a perverse combination of duplicity and smear tactics,” Mr. Langone said in a statement. “It’s worse than just bad judgment. It is a flat-out disgrace.”Darren Dopp, a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer, said his cases “are decided by the facts and the law. We’ve succeeded by making sure that we were right on both.”People who have worked with Mr. Spitzer acknowledge that he can get charged up. But they see these episodes as evidence that he is passionate about his work and cannot understand why others defend things that he finds indefensible.“He does get angry when he sees people being cheated,” said Mr. Brown. “It leads to him being as forceful as he was with Marsh.”Close observers of Mr. Spitzer’s reign said it was not possible to separate his personality from his achievements in office, and that much of what drives him as a person seemed bound up in his style of governance. Richard I. Beattie, a prominent corporate lawyer who has dealt with Mr. Spitzer on behalf of several clients over the years, said Mr. Spitzer would be likely to bring the same forceful approach to the governor’s office.“He’s an activist,” Mr. Beattie said. “Most people who come into that job don’t go looking for things, but he did. And he kept at it.”'"
"'06-10-15,'0','While the Metropolitan Opera’s offer of 200 tickets at $20 for weeknight performances is laudable, the notion that it will bring younger people to its audience is dubious.Most young people work until 5 or 6 p.m. and cannot reach the box office in time to buy tickets at the lower price. More than likely, the tickets will be bought by retirees and other seasoned standees.A better idea would be to distribute these tickets through schools or earmark a portion to students under 30.I resent the comments by Norman Peck, the president of the Peter Jay Sharp Foundation, regarding attendance at cultural events in the city: “If you don’t do something, you’ll be left with guys who have false teeth and white hair” and “Eventually, they’ll all die and you’ll have nothing.”My husband and I, both in our 80’s, have very good teeth, and his hair is beautifully white. Since our retirement, we have made at least one or more yearly trips to New York City, helping its local economy with our hotel stays, meals and attendance at musical events, museums and the theater.Except for some senior admissions at museums, we have willingly financed our own expenses on the salaries of retired teachers — which are by no means exorbitant.It would have been gracious of Mr. Peck to acknowledge the loyalty of attendees rather than to insult them.'"
"'06-10-15,'0','The recently ended third quarter, which many people regarded as a stellar period for stocks, is a case in point. The S.& P. 500-stock index posted gains of 5.7 percent in the quarter, but long-term Treasury bonds generated total returns of 6.7 percent, Mr. Bernstein noted. And long-term high-quality corporate debt gained 7.1 percent. “In this environment, you want to be broadly diversified,” he said.What’s more, the same forces that would cause the Fed to cut rates next year are likely to be a boon for bonds.“Inflation is always the main focus of bond investors,” said Mario D. DeRose, fixed-income strategist at Edward Jones, the brokerage firm based in St. Louis. “And typically, when the Fed begins to cut rates, they do so because they are no longer worried about inflation.”In fact, inflation fears often subside well before the Fed begins to trim rates. Historically, the bond market has rallied soon after the Fed has stopped raising rates — in anticipation of future rate cuts.Since 1980, there have been five periods in which the Fed has paused after a series of rate increases, just before starting a series of rate cuts. During these periods, the Lehman Brothers aggregate bond index returned 8.9 percent, on average, according to Mr. Stovall. During the same periods, on average, the S.& P. 500 rose by only 2.3 percent.Clearly, the bond market tends to rally as investors pour money into fixed-income securities in an attempt to time the market. Adding to the allure of bonds during these transitional periods is the uncertainty surrounding the financial markets, Mr. Stovall said. And during uncertain times, investors often prefer to be paid to wait in bonds than to take chances on stocks.To be sure, some people would argue that bonds are unlikely to outperform stocks this time around because long-term bond yields remain at historically low levels. The 30-year Treasury bond, for example, isn’t even yielding 5 percent.But even if long-term interest rates are low, they can still go lower. After the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady at its August meeting, yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 4.63 percent by the end of the third quarter, from around 5 percent. (They have since rebounded slightly, to around 4.8 percent.)“The greater risk going forward this year is that rates will go lower, not higher,” Mr. DeRose said. This risk stems from the distinct possibility that the economy will slow much faster than the equity markets anticipate. That could happen if the housing market cools much faster than expected.Another clue to the likelihood of falling interest rates is the shape of the so-called yield curve — which charts the spectrum of interest rates paid by bonds of varying maturities.Typically, bonds with longer maturities tend to pay higher yields, because they tie up investors’ money for much longer stretches than short-term debt. But today, two-year Treasury notes are paying 4.86 percent while 10-year Treasuries are paying 4.8 percent, a situation known as an inverted yield curve.Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Client Services, recently studied inverted yield curves, which are often a precursor to a recession or a milder economic slowdown. He discovered that inverted curves generally don’t correct themselves because long-term bond yields rise. Instead, both short- and long-term rates tend to be lower six months after yield curves invert. The only difference is, short-term rates tend to fall faster than long-term yields.Since 1978, yields on 10-year Treasuries were down 0.66 percentage point, on average, six months after yield curves inverted. Yields on two-year notes, meanwhile, were down by 1.21 percentage points.So don’t be surprised if long-term rates fall further over the next several months — which would bolster the price of older, higher-yielding securities.MR. CHAN says it will be hard to know which of these two asset classes — stocks or bonds — will outperform in the coming months without knowing when the Fed will start to trim rates.“If the Fed ends up easing sooner rather than later — or sooner than it should — that’s likely to benefit the equity markets,” he said. That’s because inflation-fearing bond investors won’t be in a bullish mood if the Fed starts to cut rates before it eliminates all inflation threats.On the other hand, he said, “if the Fed waits longer than expected before it cuts rates, then the bond market will probably outperform,” Mr. Chan said. That’s because bond investors will be convinced enough that inflation has been stamped out.“In this scenario,” he said, “the bond market will have nothing to fear.” And that has to be a bullish sign for bonds.'"

"'06-10-15,'0','If there were any doubts that the New Jersey Legislature must reduce the state’s soaring property taxes, a Census Bureau report earlier this month should wipe them away. For homeowners with a mortgage, the state has the highest median housing costs of any state in the nation. Property taxes play a major role in those high costs.The details are striking. Four of every 10 New Jerseyans pay 30 percent of their pretax income for housing; 15 percent pay half. Almost half of renters pay 30 percent of their pretax income for housing, and a quarter pay 50 percent. In Newark, 72 percent of mortgage holders paid more than 30 percent of their pretax earnings for housing.James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, says high property taxes together with high income and business taxes are having a negative impact on the state’s economy. They are certainly working against Gov. Jon Corzine’s efforts to bring industry to New Jersey.“It’s very difficult for business to transfer workers to New Jersey with its high taxes and high housing costs,” Dr. Hughes says. One result is that New Jersey has had a net loss of 14,000 office jobs since late 2000. Another is the crescendo of anecdotes about people moving out of the state because of high property taxes.All this adds to a single conclusion: legislators must do something drastic during their current special session on property taxes.“We have an expenditure problem, not a tax problem,” Dr. Hughes says. The high annual increases in spending by schools and government at all levels mean that even if the Legislature were to raise income or sales taxes, the additional money would be eaten away in just a few years and the situation would again be as bad as it is now.'"
"'06-10-15,'0','FOR Goro Miyazaki the summer ended on a bittersweet note. This 39-year-old filmmaker had the pleasure of seeing his first movie, the animated feature “Gedo Senki,” or “Tales From Earthsea,” blossom into the biggest hit of the summer in Japan, as it rose to the top spot and took in more than 7.3 billion yen (about $61.4 million) by the end of September.But even his success brought inevitable reminders that he is, after all, the other Miyazaki. His Oscar-winning father, Hayao, regarded by many critics as the greatest director working in animation today, has earned much more with his own hits. Ursula K. Le Guin, author of the popular “Earthsea” novels, on which the new film was based, went out of her way to make the distinction on her Web site, calling the father “a genius of the same caliber as Kurosawa or Fellini.” She went on to complain about the liberties Goro and his new film took with her work.“Of course a movie shouldn’t try to follow a novel exactly — they’re different arts, very different forms of narrative,” she wrote. “There may have to be massive changes. But it is reasonable to expect some fidelity to the characters and general story in a film named for and said to be based on books that have been in print for 40 years.”So the younger Mr. Miyazaki can be forgiven a bit of weariness. “Sometimes I wish hadn’t entered the same profession as my father,” he said, speaking through an interpreter during an interview at Studio Ghibli, headquarters of the Hayao Miyazaki and the director Isao Takahata, in this suburb of Tokyo. “I realized for the first time how difficult it is to be the son of Hayao Miyazaki. If I weren’t involved in animated filmmaking, I would just have a simple, quiet, normal life.”When American audiences will have the chance to judge Goro Miyazaki’s work for themselves is an open question. There is currently no plan to distribute “Gedo Senki” to theaters in the United States; the rights are tied up with a 2004 Sci-Fi Channel mini-series.In a telephone interview from her home in Portland, Ore., Ms. Le Guin said: “Mr. Miyazaki’s movie won’t be shown as long as the Sci-Fi Channel people sit on their rights, which they have until ’09, unless they decide to stop being a dog in the manger.” Representatives from the Sci-Fi Channel did not respond to calls seeking a comment.'"
"'06-10-15,'0','Certain real-life figures — Neal Cassady, June Miller, the guy who died so Milton could write “Lycidas” — loom large for poets, but make unresponsive subjects for biographers. The facts of their lives just don’t convey their allure. Maybe they come across best in verse or novels. Maybe you had to know them. Doug Kenney is one of these.Plenty of goateed comedy writers, Harvard Lampoon veterans and Hollywood people in Brioni suits still mist up at the memory of Kenney, the raffish humor whiz who helped start National Lampoon in 1970, helped write “Animal House” and “Caddyshack” and then fell or jumped off a cliff in Hawaii in 1980. He definitely had one blowout decade. But from his parodies and japes, which have dated unevenly, as well as his life’s erratic plot points, it’s hard to get exactly why people thought he was so cool. Even “A Futile and Stupid Gesture,” Josh Karp’s painstaking argument for his supergenius, doesn’t close the case.Karp’s book is written magazine style, which is to say proto-screenplay style, in vignettes that end portentously, with three stars to clear the head and white space. A typical cliffhanger goes like this: “A growing mistrust of O’Rourke ... hung over the magazine as 1974 came to a close.” Asterisks. White space. New scene: “From the day he arrived in New York, John Belushi. ...”The effect of this is to drum up suspense and ladle significance on a subject, as if the narrative were so panoramic it could be seen only incrementally with binoculars, or so drug-addled it could be rendered only as moments of scary lucidity followed by blackouts. Either way, the heaviness and exaggeration of Karp’s prophecies — “It was brilliant radio humor of the first order whose creator would implode after only 13 shows” — underscores the tall order in the book’s subtitle: “Changed Comedy Forever.”So what did Kenney and National Lampoon actually change? Well, for one, Kenney and his jerky clowns — in creating a magazine that begat a stage show, a television show (“Saturday Night Live”) and a movie franchise — staple-gunned a certain kind of absurdist conceptual humor to gross-out jokes about puking, violence and masturbation. That worked well. Today we can see it in Kevin Smith movies and “The Andy Milonakis Show” on MTV2. These guys also put on paper a mouthy, enraged countercultural comedy — the kind that aligns itself with rock ’n’ roll, and not with the Catskills — for which future generations of blander comedians would pine, as they do on Aaron Sorkin’s new television drama, “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.”'"
"'06-10-15,'0','When I was a teenager and went out at night, my mother always used to say the same thing at our doorstep: “Don’t do anything I’ll have to read about in the paper.” It was her way of telling me not to do anything stupid. She knew what she was talking about: when my mother met my father, she was 16. He was 18. It was 1956, and they were at a dance party on the outskirts of Paris. My father was playing drums in a little jazz band; my mother helped him with the dishes; within a year they were married and my brother was born.Two months later my father was called up for his military service, which at the time was mandatory in France. It wasn’t a good moment to be doing your patriotic duty. Thanks to what was not yet called the Algerian War, my father would spend three years in uniform instead of the usual 18 months. He was stationed at Tizi Ouzou, the capital of Great Kabylia, where, according to him, nothing much ever happened.Being separated so soon from her husband came as a blow to my mother. Before anyone knew what was going on, she took matters into her own hands: she left the baby with her in-laws and went off to Algeria to find the man she loved. For a 17-year-old girl, in those days, this showed real spirit.When she arrived, my parents leapt into each other’s arms. Not just each other’s either. One of the internists at the Tizi Ouzou hospital fell under my mother’s spell, which was powerful; soon he was joining them in bed. I was conceived during one of their threesomes.“You are a love child,” my mother used to tell me when I was little. I never knew quite what this meant, though the sound of it made me uneasy. When she revealed (much later, and under questioning) the circumstances surrounding my conception, she passed along something she claimed to have read in a magazine: that when two men ejaculate into a woman’s vagina, their sperm, instead of competing, team up to fertilize the ovum, and they create a mutant. At the time, I didn’t dare ask what kind of mutant she was talking about. Something like one of the Fantastic Four? Possibly the Thing?'"
"'06-10-15,'0','“I’ve been doing this for 30 years, and there’s nothing that’s come close to this,” said Tre Green of Chazy Orchards in Chazy, N.Y. He was one of the first people in the state to try them and now has them on about 80 of his 800 acres. “It’s a hard apple to grow, but it has such a spectacular taste, I think supply is going to take a long, long time, if ever, to catch up with demand.”And if nothing in his experience selling apples is comparable, how about in other businesses? He paused: “Well, maybe the development of the Internet for information exchange.”Like most farming stories, the apple story is either horrible (glut, drought, hail, heat, imports) or terrific (bumper crop). This year, it seems to be pretty terrific. One reason, aside from good weather, is that farmers’ markets have matured into a standard part of the food chain, allowing farmers to sell their wares directly. Another is that many farmers have become such smart marketers and product developers.Take Chuck Mead, 51, and his dad, Sid, 82, at Mead Orchards in northern Dutchess County, where their family has been farming since 1916. In the early 1990’s, Chuck Mead was thinking of packing it in — too much work, too little gain, little prospect of things changing.But, in fact, they did. And now instead of just selling fruits and vegetables wholesale, at least half his business is selling at farmers’ markets, including ones every week in Mount Vernon, White Plains, the Bronx, Ossining and Rhinebeck. The pick-it-yourself business at the farm is having perhaps its best year, and his own sales there are going well.And rather than planting the same crops, he has developed into something like a buyer at Neiman-Marcus, always alert for exciting new product lines.So even though he is near the southern end of the range for growing them, he has planted about 800 or 900 Honeycrisp trees, with plans to add 1,000 more next year.“This is a much more complicated business than it used to be,” said Mr. Mead, who farms 185 acres on gorgeous hilly terrain across the Hudson from the Catskills. “You want to pick up on something new, and if you wait four or five years, you might miss it. But you also don’t want to plant a whole bunch of something that turns out to be a dog.”So, along with his tart cherries from Hungary and slightly weird Asian pears, along with the Cortlands, Cameos, Mutsus and Senshus, the Macouns, Idareds, Romes and Galas, Mr. Mead is now tending his Honeycrisps, a cross between a Macoun and a Honeygold.And having flirted with getting out, he is now so committed to farming he has sold the development rights to his land, meaning it will stay agricultural in perpetuity.Still, in the brave new world of entrepreneurial ag, he has one place where he draws the line.“Well, there’s also the entertainment angle,” he said. “You know the farms that have hay mazes, corn mazes, petting zoos, all kinds of stuff? That’s fine for some people and not for others. We get calls all the time: Do you do hayrides, do you do this or that? I just say, no, but we have a beautiful view of the mountains.”'"
"'06-10-15,'0','A Lamborghini isn’t just a car, it’s an event. The Murciélago, named for a famous Spanish fighting bull, has been out since 2001 with a 580-horsepower V-12 engine, and more than 2,000 have been sold — a huge number for a supercar. The LP640 is a new variant that is more powerful and more user-friendly.The LP designation refers to the engine’s mounting position (“longitudinale posteriore”) behind the two seats; 640 is the horsepower it makes in European specification. Because of slight changes to meet American emissions rules, the output in this country is slightly less, at 632 horsepower — akin to the difference between getting hit by a .44-caliber bullet or a .45; the wounds are pretty much the same size.The V-12’s displacement has grown to 6.5 liters, from 6.2, by increasing the cylinder bore and lengthening the piston stroke; torque output is improved to a mighty 487 pound-feet.Gas mileage is on par with the thirstiest big trucks, just 9 miles a gallon in town and 13 on the highway, earning the government’s biggest gas-guzzler tax, $7,700. This is part of the price you pay for the most powerful street-legal (to use the term loosely) Lamborghini ever. It is also the fastest. This 3,670-pound projectile has a claimed a top speed of “over 211” miles an hour. The numbers on the speedometer go up to 220, in case you catch a good tailwind.For Lamborghinis in general, and past Murciélagos in particular, the company’s raging-bull emblem seems apt. The cars have a reputation as being tough to tame.The toughest thing about the LP640 is the searing heat it generates. Horsepower not only makes speed, it makes heat. The engine radiates heat like the Space Shuttle re-entering the atmosphere, and after a rigorous drive the Murciélago can keep your garage warm all night.As a result, the LP640 differs stylistically from a standard Murciélago in that every air intake and exhaust point was enlarged as much as possible without ruining the car’s elegant, low-slung styling.“You know you have achieved perfection in design,” Antoine de Saint Exupéry, the great adventurer, once wrote, “not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing more to take away.” That is an apropos description of this minimalist missile.The carbon-fiber body is just 44.7 inches high — a good foot lower than the average sedan. The test car was painted Pearl Metallic Orange. “It glows, like a monarch butterfly in the sun,” a neighbor rhapsodized. But opening the Lamborghini’s trademark scissor doors revealed a garish orange and black leather interior that says, “Trick or treat!” The seats are reminiscent of curved novelty chairs from a 1970’s bachelor pad. Though well bolstered, they felt as if you might slide down them into the footwell under heavy braking.Someone had decided people ought not smoke in this car, so the cigarette lighter plug had been removed. Since the lighter outlet is right next to the ignition switch, it took me only about two seconds to stick the key in the socket and short out the lighter, along with the stereo system that shares the same fuse. That made for a quiet cabin, until the V-12 engine coughed angrily to life. The engine is rather difficult to ignore, since it resides a couple of inches behind the driver’s ear. You can even see it, through the transparent engine cover.What next? No gearshift selector? This car was equipped with an optional $10,000 automatic transmission called e-gear, which you shift only with fluted levers on either side of the steering wheel.At first, e-gear seemed abrupt. But as I learned it, I became convinced it was based on a musical instrument. Strumming it lightly, but with a flourish, seemed to produce quick, seamless shifts. At times, it’s almost like playing air guitar. Don’t snicker until you’ve tried it.Your right hand takes the transmission up through the six forward gears, and your left hand downshifts. Each downshift is accompanied by a flatulent burst of throttle. In traffic, the car sounds noticeably racy — even when you don’t want it to, as when a police car pulls up alongside. Officers tend to look at the LP640 with the kind of “Go ahead, punk — make my day” glare made famous by Clint Eastwood.The most surprising thing about the LP640 is driveability. This has become an increasing issue in recent years, as automakers turn out machines with ever-escalating horsepower ratings. Models in the 500-horse club, of which there are now more than a dozen, have struggled to put their power politely on the pavement. The Murciélago’s throttle tip-in used to be “brutale,” as the Italians say, with power that virtually exploded from the engine to the wheels. The tires spun, the vehicle convulsed and occupants began to pray.The LP640 benefits from an electronic drive-by-wire engine management system that metes out punch in survivable doses. Yes, you can go from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 3.3 seconds. But your eyeballs won’t roll back in your head while doing it.By the time you hit third gear, you can be traveling faster than 100 m.p.h. It took a long, straight stretch of road for me to finally get the car into sixth gear.The test car was equipped with optional $13,000 ceramic brakes that stopped the LP640 almost as quickly as the engine could propel it.The LP640 steers as precisely as a Le Mans racer (the R-GT version of the car is just that). The low center of gravity and finely articulated suspension make the car corner like a go-kart. The four-wheel independent suspension works as a tightly choreographed ensemble of hydraulic shock absorbers, coil springs, dual front and rear struts and stabilizer bars; the system all but outlaws body lean, brake dive and acceleration squat. This is essential because the LP640’s ground clearance is barely an inch at speed; any wallowing whatsoever would grind off bodywork. (A cockpit switch raises and lowers the car’s nose slightly, so you can coax it into a garage and over parking-lot speed bumps.)Turning the LP640 can be a bit of a struggle. The car has full-time all-wheel drive, with the supply of torque continuously varied from front to back through a viscous coupling. That really helps on snow and ice — as if anyone would ever drive this $379,000 (as tested) museum piece in those conditions.But the all-wheel drive results in a scandalously wide turning radius of 41.5 feet. The actual space you’ll need while turning is far more than that, because you must allow plenty of margin for miscalculations. The ends and sides are obscured by high window sills and a low seating position. You pick up little visual cues as you get to know the car. But trial and error is a prohibitively expensive way to learn. Busting the carbon fiber bodywork is a surefire way to total the car.A backup camera would be handy, given all the blind spots, but it is not available (though, curiously, you can get one on the smaller, less expensive Lamborghini Gallardo).Though Lamborghini is owned by Audi, the Murciélago exhibits none of the electronic and technical overkill with which most German manufacturers seem infatuated these days. There is no iDrive and no plethora of switches, dials, buttons, stalks and redundant voice controls. Just the accelerator, the wheel, e-gear and the road ahead.If you blow out the radio as I did, there’s not much to do but shut up and drive.'"

"'06-10-16,'1','In the 2002 report, the commission stated, “The high expectations that Cuomo’s arrival at the agency generated among fair housing advocates have ended in frustration and disappointment.” It found that “Cuomo has had some important victories,” but noted a decline in efficiency and productivity and “an exodus of high-level personnel who have chafed under the demands of Cuomo’s highly politicized regime.”The report did not accuse Mr. Cuomo of condoning corruption, nor did it mention the claim about pesticides, which stems from a federal lawsuit.Later in the debate, Mr. Cuomo said, “I brought 2,000 cases against discrimination when I was at HUD.” But the same report called the department’s enforcement of fair-housing laws “dismal” and said the number of actions had declined, in relative terms, since 1997.Mr. Cuomo made at least one significant error when he said, referring to Ms. Pirro, “There is a candidate who is being accused of criminal wrongdoing and is under investigation by a number of law enforcement agencies and has their ethics questioned.”Prosecutors are investigating whether Ms. Pirro illegally recorded her husband’s conversations last year in an attempt to learn whether he was having an affair, but she has not been formally accused of anything.Ms. Pirro was asked about her office’s handling of the case of Jeffrey Mark Deskovic, who was convicted in 1990 of raping and killing a high school classmate. Last month, Mr. Deskovic was exonerated and released from prison after a new test of DNA evidence this year linked the crime to another man.Ms. Pirro said, “There was no new evidence during the time I was the D.A.” In fact, however, Mr. Deskovic was freed not because of new evidence but because of a new test — using a technique not available in 1990 — of old evidence.Barry C. Scheck, a co-director of the Innocence Project, which worked on the case, said the new test was identical to one that Mr. Deskovic sought, twice, in petitions filed in 2000 to a federal appellate court. Ms. Pirro’s office argued then that Mr. Deskovic had lost his right to an appeal when one of his lawyers missed a filing deadline.Asked why she did not support a new DNA test for Mr. Deskovic in 2000, Ms. Pirro said yesterday, “The running of that information against the database would not have been possible at that time.”But Mr. Scheck noted that in 2000, the law providing for that database, a state compendium of DNA samples from convicted felons, had already been enacted and that the database was all but complete. “If Pirro had agreed to retest the evidence from the victim and put the DNA profile into the database back in 2000, it would have matched the real murderer and Deskovic would have been freed years earlier,” he said.Discussing Ms. Pirro’s often-touted efforts against pedophiles who use the Internet, Mr. Cuomo cited a recent article in The New York Times that noted that 93 percent of such cases in Westchester County resulted in some form of probation, even though Ms. Pirro noted in news releases that the crime of attempting to disseminate indecent material to a minor is punishable by up to four years in prison.Mr. Cuomo said the article showed that Ms. Pirro’s record “failed compared to Nassau and Brooklyn and Manhattan.” While the article cited figures indicating that prosecutors in those jurisdictions were less likely than Ms. Pirro to bargain with defendants charged with trying to sexually entice minors using the Internet, it also noted that each of those offices had brought fewer such cases than Ms. Pirro had.'"
"'06-10-16,'1','“If hedge funds are privy to inside information and they invest in different securities all over the capital structure, this raises lots of concerns” said Alistaire Bambach, assistant director for the Northeast regional office of the S.E.C. She declined to comment on any open investigation.The power shift in the loan market has prompted the trade association for lenders to develop new guidelines, to be announced today, governing how confidential and material — meaning potentially market-moving — nonpublic information is used.“There are laws against insider trading: you can’t trade securities on the basis of material nonpublic information,” said Elliot Ganz, general counsel of the industry group, the Loan Syndications and Trading Association. That goes for hedge funds as well as any other entity that owns or trades loans.Lending was once a clubby world dominated by banks, which are highly regulated and go to great lengths to separate their various lines of businesses. To keep bankers from possibly sharing inside information with traders, some banks even separate their divisions on different floors and use coded identification tags to restrict access.But hedge funds, which do not generally face such strict regulatory oversight, tend to be smaller than banks and have fewer information barriers. At some funds, the person trading loans, who may have access to confidential information, often sits next to the person trading the bonds — or, in some cases, may be the same person.“You can’t put an ethical wall down the middle of someone’s brain,” said Herbert F. Bohnet, a lawyer at Ropes & Gray who represents hedge funds.Many hedge funds have put in place information barriers to guard against trading on inside information. Silver Point, a $6 billion hedge fund focused on investing in various kinds of debt, physically separates the people who have inside information from those who do not, among other measures. “Silver Point has a sophisticated information barrier,” said Adam Weiner, a spokesman for the fund.Some funds choose to restrict their trading. For example, Highland Capital Management, a $28.5 billion investment management firm that operates hedge funds, and Silver Point each say that when their public side receives any nonpublic information about a company, it restricts itself from trading any securities in that company. Other funds, to avoid even the appearance of having a trading edge, simply opt to receive only public information.The hedge fund business has exploded in recent years, with more than 9,000 funds now managing more than $1.2 trillion for pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals. Part of the appeal to these sophisticated investors is the funds’ greater freedom to bet on different markets, including exotic and risky investments. Many institutional investors use them to diversify their portfolios.These funds are paid enormous fees — typically, 2 percent of the assets they manage and 20 percent of the profits — for the bets they make that pay off.Searching for different returns from the stock and bond markets, hedge funds found fertile ground in the loan market. Institutions, including hedge funds, bought $224 billion of loans in 2005, compared with $50 billion in 2000, according to Reuters Loan Pricing Corporation. The percentage owned strictly by hedge funds is not known.When a public company takes out a loan, it generally agrees to provide the lender with certain information, sometimes including monthly financial updates. Investors in a public company’s stock or bonds, by contrast, receive only quarterly reports.If a company is considering whether to refinance debt or secure financing for a merger or acquisition, it may share those intentions with lenders. If a company is having problems that threaten to break the terms of its loans, it has to disclose that to its lenders, too.As part of their role as lenders, hedge funds have also grown prominent in corporate bankruptcies, where they can make a cheap bet on a company’s recovery by buying its debt. By owning the debt, they can become powerful creditors and serve on committees that have a large say in the future of a company.“Hedge funds have become a dynamic force in Chapter 11 cases,” said Harvey R. Miller, vice chairman at Greenhill & Company and the former head of the bankruptcy and reorganization group at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. “Where you used to have a syndicate of banks, today you have a syndicate that is mostly hedge funds, and it would appear they have different objectives than a syndicate of banks used to have. Their horizons are much shorter.”Hedge funds have come to dominate certain riskier segments of corporate lending, including the second-lien loan market. In this market, if a borrower defaults, the primary lender gets repaid before the secondary lender; in exchange for shouldering this risk, that second-lien lender earns a higher interest rate from the borrower. In the first half of this year, companies borrowed $12.4 billion in second-lien loans, an increase of 195 percent over the same period in 2003, according to Reuters L.P.C.A number of hedge funds are particularly active in extending and trading loans, including Highland Capital Management, Canyon Capital and Silver Point Capital. All three funds owned part of Movie Gallery’s loans, though each of them said they were not on the March 6 private conference call.Determining whether any of Movie Gallery’s loan holders misused information will be difficult. The company’s stock had been volatile in the months before the private call because of the expensive acquisition of the Hollywood Entertainment movie rental chain. New technologies such as video-on-demand also worried many investors, as did the growth of DVD sales by discount retailers such as Wal-Mart.Still, the trading patterns were unusual. Movie Gallery held two conference calls on March 6: one for lenders who agreed to receive only public information, and one for those who receive private information.The next day, the price of its bonds fell to $63, from $65, and the stock dropped 5 percent, to $3.11. That evening, Debtwire, a subscription-only news service for debt-market traders, published some of the contents of the private meeting, attributing it to people who had been on the call. The next day, the bonds fell almost 10 percent and the stock more than 20 percent.The situation at Movie Gallery raises tougher questions for regulators than more typical trades on inside information, such as someone getting wind of a big merger before it happens. Did the private information from the call become “public” once it has been released over Debtwire? Trading on public information is, of course, perfectly legal.Movie Gallery, meanwhile, has hired advisers to help turn itself around. Its stock closed at $2.17 on Friday, down 73 percent from its closing price a year ago. Andrew Siegel, a spokesman for Movie Gallery, declined to comment.As much as the S.E.C. is trying to root out instances of actual insider trading, it is also scrutinizing the broader issue of how companies manage the information they have access to as debt holders. In one case in 2005, for example, the S.E.C. sued Van D. Greenfield and his fund, Blue River Capital, accusing them of using fake trades to secure a position on the WorldCom creditors committee. That position enabled him to get inside information while his fund continued to trade in the securities of the company.While the S.E.C. did not charge the fund with insider trading, it accused Blue River Capital of failing to have information barriers in place to prevent the misuse of such information.Blue River withdrew its registration as a securities dealer and now operates as a private investment vehicle for the people who run it, according to Arthur S. Linker, Mr. Greenfield’s lawyer. Mr. Greenfield settled the case last year without admitting or denying guilt and, through his lawyer, declined to comment.Mr. Miller of Greenhill said that the issue of managing secrets was a serious one for the industry. Walls may be in place, but people still run into each other outside the walls. “It is hard to be foolproof,” he said.'"
"'06-10-16,'1','As a result of the American campaign, banking officials and experts say that some foreign banks are cutting ties with North Korea and Iran.But while achieving some unilateral success in economically punishing North Korea and Iran for their nuclear ambitions, some experts say the moves against Iran, at least, could damage American economic interests if that country switched to currencies other than the dollar for its large oil trades.The United States had turned to unilateral action in part out of frustration that its efforts to mobilize international sanctions had run into trouble. That frustration might remain if the United Nations sanctions against North Korea, passed Saturday, prove not to be as effective as the United States hopes.Most experts acknowledge that a globally cooperative effort would be much more effective than the American unilateral efforts, but that the United States can inflict some pain with the creative use of the reach of its own laws and pressure.The ban on American transactions with the Iranian bank, Bank Saderat, means that it will no longer be able to obtain American dollars for its dealings with any other bank in the world. Bank Saderat is one of Iran’s half-dozen largest banks.The technical term for the banned activity is a “U-turn transaction.” Such a transaction permits, for example, Iran to sell oil to a German customer, who in turn directs a European bank to deposit dollars obtained from an American bank into an Iranian bank account located in Europe. The phrase “U-turn” applies because the funds are transferred to a United States bank and instantly turned back as dollars to a European bank.Many American banking officials predict that, in coming months, the United States will ban American bank involvement in transactions involving the other leading banks in Iran. That is because there is a widespread assumption among bankers that all of Iran’s state-owned banks engage in the same activities as Bank Saderat. The likely result is that Iran will have difficulty selling its oil for dollars, the international medium of exchange for all oil sales.“This is a pretty dramatic uptick of pressure from the United States,” said Judith A. Lee, a law partner specializing in economic sanctions at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Washington. “It is going to create significant difficulties for European banks and European countries.”American officials decline to say whether the move against Bank Saderat would apply to other Iranian banks.Stuart Levey, under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said recently that in the last two years the United States had “learned a number of lessons about how best to use financial tools to apply financial pressure” on countries like Iran and North Korea.In the last year, Mr. Levey has traveled to several countries in Europe to exert pressure on Iran and to Singapore, China, Macao, Hong Kong, Vietnam and South Korea to press banks to break their ties with North Korea.The message was reinforced a year ago when the United States barred financial transactions with a bank in Macao, Banco Delta Asia, which officials said was involved in North Korean nuclear dealings, money laundering and counterfeiting.Last month, citing news media reports, Mr. Levey said that at least two dozen financial institutions overseas had curtailed or suspended business with North Korea.China, for instance, froze the accounts of North Korea in a Macao branch of the Bank of China and also cracked down on the circulation of counterfeit American dollars in China near the North Korean border.The administration hopes that could set a pattern for the future, American officials said. “We have no reason to believe that China will not continue to protect their financial system from abuse,” a Treasury official said Sunday.As for Iran, several European banks, including Credit Suisse and UBS in Switzerland, HSBC in Britain and ABN Amro in the Netherlands, have announced curbs on dealings with Iranian banks and businesses.“We are seeing a whole series of banks not doing business with Iran, restricting the flow of funds into Iran significantly,” said Edward Morse, chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers.Last month, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. suggested at an international meeting in Singapore that banks around the world should stop doing business with more than 30 Iranian companies and government enterprises that American intelligence had linked to various illicit activities.Evidence that American moves against Iran might be having an effect came at the same meeting, when Ebrahim Sheibany, the Iranian central bank governor, told a local paper at an international financial meeting that Iran would have “no choice” but to shift its sale of oil away from the dollar and to the euro or Asian currencies.Whether that shift away from dollars could have the unintended effect of hurting the United States is a matter of debate. Some experts say there is a danger that if Iran does shift currencies, it could weaken the standing of the dollar as a reserve currency, forcing the United States to raise interest rates to attract dollar purchasers.“This is a step where the end result could clearly weaken the dollar,” said John G. Heimann, an investment banker and former comptroller of the currency in the Carter administration. “What has to be considered is whether or not we are shooting ourselves in the foot.”'"
"'06-10-16,'1','The restoration of the doors is a tale of patience, scholarship and technological innovation. They were last restored after the devastating floods that ravaged Florence in 1966. But soon after, their surface became mottled.“It happened with alarming speed,” said Gary M. Radke, a humanities professor at Syracuse University who is a consultant to the High Museum and has worked as the curator of the traveling exhibition for five years. “In the beginning nobody was sure why. Was it an increase in modern pollution or did the hundreds of plaster casts made in the 19th century leave behind residue that penetrated the surface?” Scientific analysis of samples from the panels revealed that a soluble salt had crept under the surface of the gilding, causing a corrosive action that Mr. Radke described as an “electric charge” between the gold and the bronze underneath. A result was bad blistering, which also put holes and bubbles on the surface.Conservators began with four panels that had fallen off in the 1966 flood, but had then been reattached. “Initially we cleaned them with a chemical bath,” said Annamaria Giusti, the director of the Museum of the Opificio delle Pietre Dure, who heads the conservation project. “The project began in 1980. I took over in 1996.”Before every decision, there were discussions and debates, sometimes lasting years. From 1990 to 1996 all work stopped for a debate about whether the remaining six panels should be cleaned in place or also removed from the doors.“There were dangers in doing either,” Ms. Giusti said. At that point, laser technology wasn’t available, so the only cleaning method was a chemical bath of Rochelle salts, the chief ingredient in baking powder. “Had they been cleaned in place, we were worried that the toxic solution might seep behind the relief and damage it,” she said.Ms. Giusti, a group of three restorers and a committee of scientists debated. The restorers favored removing the panels; they wanted to drill holes and push the reliefs out of the doors. (In 1966 holes had been drilled through the framework to remove panels for cleaning.) Ms. Giusti wanted to remove the panels, but without drilling any more holes. The scientists wanted to clean the panels in place.Finally, they compromised: the panels were removed without making more holes. Glue was put around the plain bronze edges of the reliefs to attaching a steel frame; with the help of a crane, the reliefs were slowly nudged out.By the late 1990’s, technology had advanced to the point that it was decided that laser treatment would be the best method for cleaning the removed panels. For the first time that she knows of, Ms. Giusti said, lasers were used to clean bronze. This was deemed safer because chemical baths always pose a danger that salts from the cleaning agent will become stuck behind the panels.A team of scientists, conservators and art historians, with a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, have studied the project for the last year. “We were trying to figure out how Ghiberti and his workshop accomplished this great feat,” said Francesca Bewer, a technical art historian at the Straus Center for Conservation of the Harvard University Art Museums.“The Gates of Paradise” were created using what is called the lost-wax technique, in which a detailed wax model is imbedded in a fire-resistant clay mold. The wax melts when the mold is fired; then liquid bronze is poured into the mold where the wax had been. Ghiberti cast the individual panels in bronze and then gilded each section before inserting it into the giant doors.In this way, Mr. Radke said, the bronze gives the viewer an overall impression of three-dimensionality, a technique that has been copied by artists ever since.“We wanted to take advantage of having such close access to art of this kind,” Ms. Bewer said. “To see the tricks he used to create the sense of depth.”The public will see not only the extraordinary workmanship, but the results of the restoration as well. The three panels on the North American tour are from the left door. They depict the stories of Adam and Eve, Jacob and Esau, and Saul and David. There will also be four sculpture relief elements — two prophets’ heads and two standing figures — from the original frame of the left door.“One of the heads has been restored; the other hasn’t,” Mr. Radke said. “The same with the standing figures. In this way the public will be able to see the transformation that took place by cleaning them.”The Italian government has financed most of the restoration and conservation of “The Gates of Paradise,” and additional financing has come from the Friends of Florence, an American-based nonprofit organization. The High Museum has also agreed to help finance the conservation of a 14th-century silver altar in the Museum dell’Opera del Duomo.Sending the panels and sculptures to Atlanta will be no easy task. Specially designed oxygen-free cases will be used to transport the works by air. So prized are these bronzes that the Italian authorities insist that each panel travel separately.“They are simply too precious to fly together,” Ms. Giusti said.'"
"'06-10-16,'1','Open Solutions, which provides data processing technology for banks and other financial institutions, agreed yesterday to be acquired by Providence Equity Partners and the Carlyle Group in a deal valued at about $1.3 billion, including the assumption of debt.Under the terms of the deal, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007, Carlyle and Providence will pay $38 for each share of Open Solutions stock, representing a 32 percent premium over the average closing price of Open Solutions’ stock for the last 30 trading days.According to people briefed on the deal, who requested anonymity because the deal had not yet been publicly announced, Providence and Carlyle were attracted to the technology and client list that Open Solutions, which is based in Glastonbury, Conn., had developed since its founding in 1992. The people said that the new owners planned to invest heavily in both internal research and development, and in complementary acquisitions.Wachovia Securities acted as financial adviser to Open Solutions.

"'06-10-16,'1','Euronext and the NYSE Group said yesterday that they remained willing to start talks with two rivals, Deutsche Börse and Borsa Italiana, to combine their European cash equity businesses.“Euronext and NYSE continue to believe that a cash equity combination delivers the maximum benefits to investors, issuers and all stakeholders with minimum execution risk,” the two exchanges said in a statement. “This combination would be advantageous to Europe while leveraging trans-Atlantic synergies.”The proposal came after Deutsche Börse, Europe’s No. 1 exchange by market value, asked the European Commission on Friday to approve its 9.8 billion euro (about $12.27 billion), bid for Euronext, the No. 2 European exchange. Euronext, of Paris, has agreed to a NYSE offer.New York-based NYSE, operator of the world’s largest stock exchange, and Deutsche Börse, of Frankfurt, have been fighting over Euronext for much of this year. Exchanges are seeking to consolidate in response to steps by securities firms to trade stocks and other financial instruments globally.“Euronext and NYSE reconfirm their willingness to begin immediately discussions with Deutsche Börse and Borsa Italiana to create a consolidated European cash market,” the statement said.'"
"'06-10-16,'1','Verizon Communications is close to deciding to spin off rather than sell its directories division, because a spinoff would cost it less in taxes, according to a person briefed on the discussions.Verizon’s board is expected to begin debating the matter in the next few weeks and could make a final decision in about a month, this person said. Verizon has said it would spin off or sell the group, Verizon Information Services, by the end of the year.More than half a dozen private equity firms have shown interest in buying the division, which publishes Verizon SuperPages directories in 35 states. But the company has not found a buyer willing to pay enough to offset the hefty tax bill that would follow a sale.The directories group would be an independent and publicly traded company after it was spun off, and Verizon stockholders would receive shares in the company tax-free. The directories division would also assume as much as $9 billion in Verizon debt, according to analysts’ estimates.While revenue growth has been declining at the directories group as pressure mounts from low-cost rivals and more ads move online, the subsidiary remains very profitable. As a result, if a spinoff takes place, Verizon’s profits would decline by between 18 and 20 cents a share, according to Jeffrey Halpern, an analyst who covers the company for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.'"

Among their ranks were a general in the Soviet Army (Petro G. Grigorenko), a decorated member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (Andrei D.

More important, they encouraged the Soviet government to do the same.Today’s Russia may have more to learn from its recent Soviet past than it realizes.Benjamin Nathans Philadelphia, Oct. 11, 2006The writer is an associate professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania.'"

"'06-10-17,'0','“I can’t wait to put people on the drug,” Dr. James Underberg, a clinical assistant professor at New York University medical school who participated in a clinical trial of Januvia.Januvia is the third major new diabetes drug approved since the summer of 2005, and potentially the most important, analysts and doctors say. The drug works in a different way than existing treatments, and its pill form makes it more convenient than Byetta, a treatment approved last year that has some of the same benefits as Januvia but must be taken by injection.Analysts predict that Januvia, either as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with an existing diabetes drug called metformin, will have worldwide sales of nearly $2 billion by 2010. Merck hopes to win approval for that combined drug early next year.Optimism about Januvia has helped push Merck shares up 38 percent this year, compared with an 11 percent gain for the average large drug stock. Merck shares gained 20 cents today to close at $43.96 — their highest level since the company withdrew its arthritis drug Vioxx in September 2004 after a study linked Vioxx to heart attacks and strokes.Executives at Merck declined to comment on their plans for advertising Januvia to consumers. Unlike several other major drug makers, Merck has not committed to waiting at least six months before advertising new drugs so that doctors have a chance to learn about new therapies before patients begin asking for them.But physicians like Dr. Underberg are already enthusiastic. “It doesn’t cause weight gain, it doesn’t cause episodes of hypoglycemia, and the side effects otherwise are pretty moderate,” he said.Hypoglycemia is a potentially dangerous condition in which blood sugar levels drop too fast. In severe instances, it can cause fainting or even coma. Several older diabetes drugs can cause hypoglycemia by pushing the pancreas to produce large amounts insulin quickly.In contrast, Januvia and Galvus are the first in a newer class of drugs called DPP-IV inhibitors, which work by enhancing levels of a natural protein called GLP-1. The protein stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin and discourages the liver from making glucose. But the DPP-IV inhibitors work only when blood sugar levels are already elevated, such as after a meal, sharply lowering the risk for hypoglycemia.“The approval of Januvia marks an important advance in the fight against diabetes,” Dr. Steven Galson, director of the F.D.A.’s center for drug evaluation and research, said in a statement. “We now have another new option that treats the disease in an entirely new way.”Diabetes is a disease in which blood sugar rises uncontrollably from a lack of, or resistance to, insulin, a hormone normally produced in the pancreas. In type-1 diabetes, the pancreas is unable to produce insulin.Type 2 diabetes is linked to obesity and inactivity. Typically, the disease progresses over several years as the pancreas gradually loses the ability to produce insulin, and drug treatments lose their effectiveness. Eventually, many patients wind up injecting themselves with insulin to control their blood sugar. Severe, late-stage diabetes sharply raises the risks of many medical problems, including heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, and blindness.Jay Galeota, general manager of Merck’s global diabetes franchise, said Merck planned to ship Januvia to pharmacies and offer samples to doctors’ offices very rapidly. The company expects to market Januvia to both doctors and patients almost immediately, he said.“We’re confident that we’re going to communicate the science of Januvia in a very wide way,” he said. “We’re expecting very rapid uptake right away.”While there are several major classes of diabetes medicines already on the market, many have side effects that discourage patients from taking them, including weight gain and nausea. As a result, the market is ripe for new treatments, doctors and analysts say.In clinical trials that examined Januvia in 2,719 patients, the most common side effects were sore throat, diarrhea and colds, the F.D.A. said.Richard Evans, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said he expected Januvia and Galvus to rapidly replace an older class of drugs called sulfonylureas. The newer drugs are similarly effective but much less likely to cause weight gain and hypoglycemia, he said.“Everybody knows that sulfonylureas are kind of a losing game,” he said. While Galvus and Januvia are very similar, Januvia may have an edge because it clearly works as a once-a-day pill, while Galvus was initially designed to be taken twice daily, Mr. Evans said. Novartis, Galvus’s manufacturer, now claims that Galvus is effective when taken once daily, but doctors may be skeptical of that claim, he said.Tony Butler, an industry analyst at Lehman Brothers, said he expected Januvia to have sales of $271 million next year, rising to $1.1 billion by 2010. Sales of the Januvia-metformin combination pill will add another $500 million in 2010, Mr. Butler said.'"
"'06-10-17,'0','JERUSALEM, Oct. 17 — The Palestinian Authority’s president, Mahmoud Abbas, warned Tuesday that the current Palestinian political crisis was intolerable and suggested that he would dismiss the Hamas-led government if the rival factions cannot agree soon on a national unity government.“To maintain the status quo is impossible,” Mr. Abbas said in remarks broadcast on Palestinian television. “As the person in charge, I am obligated to consider all options that could get us out of this crisis.”Mr. Abbas’s speech, delivered from the West Bank city of Ramallah, was the clearest signal yet that he was prepared to act against the Hamas government. With Israel and Western governments cutting off the flow of money to the Palestinian Authority, the Hamas government has barely functioned since coming to power more than six months ago.The Palestinian leader said he still sought a national unity government that would include his secular Fatah movement and Hamas, the Islamic radical group. The two parties agreed on such an arrangement more than a month ago, but the talks broke down over issues that include the recognition of Israel, which Hamas rejects.If no agreement is reached soon, Mr. Abbas indicated that he would be willing to dismiss the government. “I have the right to dismiss the government,” he declared. He then went on to say that a “government of technocrats would be the simplest and most practical solution.”'"

"'06-10-17,'0','“I didn’t think Atlanta was a very good football team,” Giants receiver Plaxico Burress said. “Out of all the teams that we’ve played, they were probably the worst team. I don’t think any of us in there were surprised with us winning.”It is unlikely that any of the Giants would similarly downgrade the status of their next opponent. The Giants play the Cowboys (3-2) at Dallas on Monday night.It is the type of game that the Giants have not conquered. They have made a habit, particularly on the road, of beating the league’s weaker teams and falling, sometimes admirably and in overtime, to the stronger ones.In 2005, the Giants were 4-4 on the road. The victories — against San Francisco, Oakland, Philadelphia and New Orleans — were against teams that did not finish better than 6-10. The game against the Saints, while officially an away game, was actually played at Giants Stadium, moved from the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina.Last season’s road losses were against teams that finished 9-7 or better: San Diego, Dallas, Seattle and Washington.“Our philosophy is always, win all of them at home and try to steal some on the road,” quarterback Eli Manning said. “Because it’s tough playing on the road, and when you’re playing a tough team, it’s even harder.”The question is not so much whether the Giants need to beat championship contenders in the regular season to boost themselves in the standings. Beating middling teams and losing to most of the top teams is often enough to make the playoffs, as the Giants demonstrated last season, when they lost to Carolina in the first round.The question, rather, is whether the Giants need to do it to prove to themselves, and others, that they are capable of such a trick.The Giants opened the season at home against the Indianapolis Colts, a perennial title contender and a worthy measuring stick. The Giants lost, 26-21.They then played miserably for three quarters in Philadelphia before scoring 23 points in the fourth quarter and overtime to beat the Eagles, a team that has since won three of four games, making the Giants’ victory look better in hindsight than it did at the time.The Giants lost badly to the Seahawks in Seattle the next week. After a dominating home victory against the Washington Redskins, they beat the Falcons by overcoming another double-digit second-half deficit on the road, as they did against the Eagles.The Giants are carrying a feeling of confidence and a two-game winning streak that appeared improbable two weeks ago.“Some games feel different,” Manning said. “You know you’ve done something — you’ve kind of conquered a challenge, maybe a greater challenge playing on the road against a good team rather than some games. Everybody felt good after yesterday’s game.”A victory against the Cowboys, a fierce division rival led by the former Giants coach Bill Parcells, would make the team feel even better. N.F.L. players often say that playing on a Monday night provides extra motivation, because it offers a chance to impress friends and family around the country.“You may say to some of the younger guys, ‘All of your aunts and uncles, everybody, is watching,’ and that may perk them up,” Coughlin said.But among the millions watching are other N.F.L. players and coaches, taking a rare opportunity to watch another team’s football game as it unfolds.The Giants want to win, of course; the standings matter most. Sending a message would be a side benefit, whether the message is delivered live on a Monday night or in a meeting room during the week.“You know what really is on that tape, that’s what other people are watching,” center Shaun O’Hara said. “The tape doesn’t lie. When people turn on that tape, you want them to see the type of play that you’re playing, and the physical aspect of it — that you’re really bringing it to the other team. That’s what you want to show them.”Against a top-level opponent, on a prime-time stage, the Giants have another chance to show themselves.Linebacker Antonio Pierce took exception to a postgame comment by Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, who said the Giants used a “vanilla” defense to slow the league’s top rushing team. “We were vanilla — vanilla with seven sacks and a win,” Pierce said. “It’s good enough for us.” ... The Giants’ players have two days off; they will resume practicing Thursday.'"
"'06-10-17,'0','As a commercial airliner, the 787 will seat 210 to 330 passengers, depending on the airline that flies it.“There are around 39 Boeing 747’s with interiors configured for V.I.P. use in the world, and many 757’s and 767’s, an MD-11, and two 777’s,” said Aaga Duenhaupt, a manager for Lufthansa Technik, based in Hamburg, a subsidiary of Deutsche Lufthansa that designs and builds the interiors for new and used (or “pre-owned,” as they like to say in both the luxury car and luxury jet markets) airliners for individual or corporate use.Even though the first deliveries of the 787 are not expected until 2008, industry experts say that marketing interior design plans now makes sense because there is always great interest in the next big thing at the highest end of the luxury private jet market. Ordering now ensures getting into the front of the line for a private 787, fully loaded, they say.PrivatAir, a Swiss company that markets charter and individual flights on privately configured big planes, is interested in buying a 787 from Boeing and in having it outfitted in true luxury, its chief executive, Greg Thomas, said.“We’ve signed a letter of intent and are still in negotiations about the finer points of the contract,” he said. “We have put money down; at the moment it’s refundable. We are very interested in the airplane — the capabilities are superb and it’s a classy product.”PrivatAir, which specializes in long-haul V.I.P. flights, manages a fleet of 50 aircraft, including a 757 that is chartered by governments worldwide for special purposes. The 757 is also used three or four times a year for so-called air-cruises — “around-the-world trips for 21 days, basically by retired Americans,” he said. Those trips can cost $50,000 to $70,000 a person.Such planes are also used for special business purposes. “We’ve done movie launches,” Mr. Thomas said. “We did the launches of ‘Ocean’s 11’ and ‘Ocean’s 12’ and ‘King Kong,’ ” he said. “The studio will rent the plane for the actors to go and do premieres. One of the ‘Matrix’ movies we whistle-stopped in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore to open the movie in several cities one day after another.”Mr. Thomas said PrivatAir had ordered a 767 aircraft and expected delivery late this year.Jumbo jets are often favored by Arab sheiks and other fabulously wealthy people who tend not to advertise their opulent lifestyles. A notch or two down-market, the 777’s, 767’s and 757’s are often coveted by corporate titans, among them Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google, who bought a used 767 last year and spent millions converting it into a private jet.Airliner-size jets are also used by individual business people. Among them is Willie Gary, who grew up in a family of migrant workers in Florida but is now a prominent liability lawyer. Weary of wasting valuable time away from his family in commercial airports and eager to have the space to conduct business in the air, Mr. Gary bought a Boeing 737 several years ago and had it outfitted as a private jet. He also owns a 16-seat Gulfstream G2 that he refers to as his “second plane.”Mr. Gary planned to invest in a bigger private 757, but now he says he is ready to kick the tires of the 787 Dreamliner, once the plane is on the market.“On the 737, we can take depositions,” Mr. Gary said. “We have meetings and settlement conferences. It gives me the luxury of getting in and getting out and moving on. I’ve touched down in as many as five states in a day,” he said. “But I’m not going to keep the 737 forever. I’m a goal setter, and I’m always looking for something new.”Anticipating strong growth in private demand for the long-haul, airliner-size planes, Lufthansa Technik says it is setting up a unit to design 787 interiors for clients.The interiors have been developed in a partnership with Andrew Winch, who is best known for designing top-luxury interiors for big yachts.Over the years, Lufthansa Technik has designed the interiors for 12 jumbo 747’s, said Mr. Duenhaupt. A 747 purchased “green,” that is, with basically a bare interior, costs about $180 million, he said. “And then, if you really want that 747 to be a full-blown V.I.P. aircraft, with all the V.I.P. luxuries, you can spend up to $50 million more on the interior.”Some private 747’s are even equipped with medical emergency rooms, “including ones that can do open-heart surgery when people are flying into a certain environment,” Mr. Duenhaupt said. “But preferably the surgery is done on the ground when the plane has landed.”Luthnansa Technik is now working on preliminary designs for the much-delayed Airbus A380, which will be the biggest plane in the sky once it is available.In addition to its size, which will allow for even more luxury, the A380 has a feature that may appeal to the most status-conscious of owners, who may travel with underlings. That feature harks back to the days of ocean liners, where social classes were physically segregated.“The A380 will offer a chance to separate the senior V.I.P.’s from the junior V.I.P.’s because you have two decks, and they can be kept apart,” Mr. Duenhaupt said.'"
"'06-10-17,'0','Mr. Olmert has broached the possibility on several occasions, and Mr. Siniora has shot it down each time, and did so again on Monday.In Beirut, Mr. Siniora’s office issued a statement saying that he had “announced more than once that Lebanon will be the last Arab country to sign a peace deal with Israel.”“I pledge to work tirelessly to take advantage of any opportunity, any crack, any possibility of holding negotiations that will lead to real dialogue with responsible representatives of the Palestinian people,” Mr. Olmert said.But he reiterated that no real progress was possible until Cpl. Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier was released. He was captured by Palestinian militants on June 25. The Palestinians, in turn, are seeking freedom for a large number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.In a wide-ranging speech, Mr. Olmert made no mention of his plan to withdraw from some Jewish settlements in the West Bank. That was the dominant theme of his election campaign in the spring.But since then, Mr. Olmert’s popularity has fallen sharply, with many Israelis critical of his handling of the war in Lebanon. His failure to mention the West Bank withdrawal plan appeared to confirm the widespread belief that it was on hold indefinitely.On other issues, Mr. Olmert said he believed that moderate Arab countries were building closer ties to guard against what he called threats from Iran and Islamic militants.He also repeated his call for the international community to act against Iran’s nuclear program. Israel says that Iran is aggressively seeking nuclear weapons, which Iran denies.Mr. Olmert will travel to Russia on Tuesday and is expected to raise the issue with President Vladimir V. Putin. Russia has helped Iran develop its nuclear program and has opposed sanctions.Meanwhile, Mr. Katsav, who has served in the mostly ceremonial position of president since 2000, is facing increasing pressure to step down.“There is a sense that corruption has reached the highest level of Israeli society, and that this must be cleaned up,” said Shlomo Aronson, a political science professor at Hebrew University.Nahum Barnea, a leading newspaper columnist, wrote in Yediot Aharonot: “The man Moshe Katsav is innocent as long as it has not been proven otherwise. But the man is one thing and the president another. President Moshe Katsav cannot continue in his position much longer.”'"
"'06-10-17,'0','A household cleaning product that researchers say looks and smells like a soft drink has been the cause of more than 100 accidental ingestions, according to a study published in the journal Pediatrics in August and presented Sunday at a conference of the American College of Emergency Physicians.From Jan. 1 to April 20, researchers found 104 records in the Texas Poison Center database of human ingestion of Fabuloso, manufactured by Colgate-Palmolive. Of these, 94 were unintentional and 2 were occupational exposures. The rest were either related to self-harm or not characterized as to cause. None caused serious harm.Fabuloso is sold in purple, blue, yellow and green varieties, and packaged in one-liter, transparent plastic bottles that resemble soft drink containers.The study’s authors say the most common reason for ingestion appeared to have been mistaking the product for a drink. More than 40 percent of the calls to the poison center involved ingestion by people over 12.Three-quarters of those 20 or older who drank it accidentally were women; of those under 6 who drank it, three-quarters were boys. The authors write that Fabuloso “is a minor gastrointestinal irritant and unlikely to cause any major morbidity or mortality.”The different colors have varying odors, all of them pleasantly fruity. “It doesn’t taste terrible,” said Dr. Marc E. Levsky, a co-author of the study and an assistant program director in the department of emergency medicine at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in Fort Hood, Tex. “It’s a detergent solution, and it tastes like soap.”'"
"'06-10-17,'0','A woman who gains even a small amount of weight between pregnancies significantly increases her risk of a poor pregnancy outcome, according to a new study.The study, which appears in the September 30 issue of The Lancet, used the records of more than 150,000 Swedish women who had first and second consecutive births from 1992 through 2001. The researchers calculated body mass index, or B.M.I., at the beginning of the first pregnancy and again at the start of the second.Compared with women who gained less than one unit of B.M.I. between pregnancies, those who gained three or more were twice as likely to have gestational diabetes, 76 percent more likely to have gestational hypertension, 30 percent more likely to have a Caesarean delivery and 63 percent more likely to have a stillbirth. The more weight they gained the more likely they were to have an adverse outcome.The authors acknowledged that since the time between births varied from 1 to 10 years, some of the weight gain could be due to temporary postpartum weight retention and that there could be unmeasured factors that might have affected both weight gain and pregnancy outcome.“The strongest evidence of causality would come from a randomized clinical trial, but that’s obviously not possible here,” said Eduardo Villamor, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. “One alternative is to look at changes in exposure over time and to find out if they are associated with changes in risk, and that’s what we did. For now, we believe that the results allow us to conclude that weight gain in women of normal B.M.I. between pregnancies is not advisable.”'"
"'06-10-17,'0','On his own flat-lining in the polls, Mr. Schlesinger said, “I think that’s what’s been at work is, basically, a spin of all different agendas, some of it driven by the Washington media, to take this election away from the people of Connecticut.”Mr. Schlesinger, a two-term mayor of Derby and a former state representative, has billed himself as a fiscal conservative and the real Republican in the race, taking aim at Mr. Lieberman, who is now running as an independent and is counting on support from Republicans to win the Nov. 7 election. Mr. Schlesinger has remained doggedly in the race even as Republicans have urged him to step aside for a stronger candidate.Party leaders’ doubts were accelerated this summer when news accounts revealed that he had gambled under a fake name while in elected office and had gambling debts. By the time Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Lamont were dueling for the Democratic nomination, national Republicans had given up on Connecticut altogether because they considered Mr. Schlesinger a weak candidate.That only made Mr. Schlesinger angry — and more determined.He brought both sentiments to the Stamford Marriott on Monday, where in front of an audience of several hundred people he mocked his rivals, made outlandish comparisons and held out hope that he could win.And he did change the dynamic of the debate measurably, backing up Mr. Lieberman’s and Mr. Lamont’s attacks on each other and diverting a two-way exchange. At times, he took aim at both in one strike.“They’re not arguing over differences of opinions, because basically, I’m running against two very liberal individuals,” Mr. Schlesinger said at one point. “On most issues other than Iraq, I really don’t see much difference between my friends Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Lamont.”At another point, Mr. Schlesinger proclaimed that he would never accept endorsements from the kinds of polarizing figures who had stepped in to support Mr. Lamont (leaving out the fact that he had garnered very few endorsements of any kind). “Because there’s no room in my campaign for a Jesse Jackson,” Mr. Schlesinger said. “There’s no room in my campaign for an Al Sharpton. There’s only room in my campaign for people who care about other people, no matter what race they are.”Mr. Schlesinger also served as comic relief, startling the audience and his fellow candidates by saying things most politicians would not. When the topic turned to immigration, he said, “We’ve got people flooding into this nation with absolutely no reason other than they just want a good life for themselves.“Well, you know what?” he continued. “If I want the good life for myself, I just don’t go over the border illegally into Mexico, and I don’t expect the Mexican government to take care of me.”On the subject of North Korea, Mr. Schlesinger pointed out that the years of tension over that government’s nuclear program nearly mirrored the same stretch of time — 18 years — that the senator has been in Washington. (Tensions began to grow in the early 1990’s.)“What a coincidence — that happens to be the term of Joe Lieberman,” Mr. Schlesinger said. “Joe, you’ve got to answer for this.”Mr. Lieberman looked slightly baffled, then slightly amused. “I thought the attacks were only going to come from this side,” Mr. Lieberman said, turning to Mr. Lamont.'"
"'06-10-17,'0','Christianity took root here near the dawn of the faith 2,000 years ago, making Iraq home to one of the world’s oldest Christian communities. The country is rich in biblical significance: scholars believe the Garden of Eden described in Genesis was in Iraq; Abraham came from Ur of the Chaldees, a city in Iraq; the city of Nineveh that the prophet Jonah visited after being spit out by a giant fish was in Iraq.Both Chaldean Catholics and Assyrian Christians, the country’s largest Christian sects, still pray in Aramaic, the language of Jesus.They have long been a tiny minority amid a sea of Islamic faith. But under Saddam Hussein, Iraq’s million or so Christians for the most part coexisted peacefully with Muslims, both the dominant Sunnis and the majority Shiites.But since Mr. Hussein’s ouster, their status here has become increasingly uncertain, first because many Muslim Iraqis framed the American-led invasion as a modern crusade against Islam, and second because Christians traditionally run the country’s liquor stories, anathema to many religious Muslims.Over the past three and a half years, Christians have been subjected to a steady stream of church bombings, assassinations, kidnappings and threatening letters slipped under their doors.Estimates of the resulting Christian exodus vary from the tens of thousands to more than 100,000, with most heading for Syria, Jordan and Turkey.The number of Christians who remain is also uncertain. The last Iraqi census, in 1987, counted 1.4 million Christians, but many left during the 1990’s when sanctions squeezed the country. Yonadam Kanna, the lone Christian member of the Iraqi Parliament, estimated the current Christian population at roughly 800,000, or about 3 percent of the population. A Chaldean Catholic auxiliary bishop, Andreos Abouna, told a British charity over the summer that there were just 600,000 Christians left, according to the Catholic News Service.At the Church of the Virgin Mary, Father Khossaba showed a visitor the baptism forms for parishioners leaving the country who need proof of their religious affiliation for visas. Some weeks he has filled out 50 of the forms, he said, and some weeks more.Attendance on Sundays has dwindled to four dozen or so, he said; it used to be more than 500 on average, and on Easter Sundays, before the collapse of the Hussein government, more than 1,500. Not all the missing members have left, of course; some simply stay at home on Sundays because of fears for their safety.Many Christians have relocated, changing neighborhoods or even cities. About a thousand Christian families, from Mosul, Baghdad, Basra and elsewhere, have taken refuge in Ain Kawa, a small town outside the Kurdish city of Erbil, which has become an oasis for Christians, said the Rev. Yusuf Sabri, a priest at St. Joseph’s Chaldean Catholic Church there.A Christian man with Baghdad license plates on his car who asked not to be identified said he had just arrived in Ain Kawa to inquire about moving there. A leaflet had been left at his home demanding he leave in three days. It bore the signature of Muhammad’s Army, a Sunni insurgent group.“They regarded me as an agent for the crusaders,” he said.Asaad Aziz, a 42-year-old Chaldean Catholic, is one of those trying to leave the country. After the ouster of Mr. Hussein, he bought a liquor store in a mostly Shiite neighborhood. Nine days after he opened, the store was bombed. Mr. Aziz was hospitalized for a month.The employees rebuilt the store. But several months later, a note slipped under the door gave Mr. Aziz 48 hours to close.“Otherwise, you will blame yourself,” it said.Mr. Aziz closed. But after an unsuccessful stint at a friend’s printing company, he returned to the business he knew best, opening a liquor store in a mostly Christian neighborhood. Last month, a gunman riddled the new storefront with bullets as Mr. Aziz cowered in a back room.He told another story: the teenage daughter of another Christian family he knows was kidnapped recently. The captors initially demanded a ransom, but later sarcastically said the pope was the only one who could release her. She was eventually killed.“When the pope gave his statement, it destroyed any last hope that we had here,” said Mr. Aziz, who has forbidden his daughters, one in high school and the other in college, to return to school.He recently went to the Turkish Embassy to inquire about a visa but was rebuffed. At this point, he said, he will go anywhere.“We cannot practice our rituals and we cannot bring food home to our families,” he said. “That’s why I want to leave the country.”Mosul, near the historic heart of Christianity in Iraq, has also become increasingly dangerous. The recently murdered priest, the Rev. Boulos Iskander Behnam, is just the latest member of the Christian community to be kidnapped or killed there.Conditions have been especially bleak for Christians in Basra, the southern city that is dominated by radical Shiite militias. Christian women there often wear Muslim head scarves to avoid harassment from religious zealots trying to impose a strict Islamic dress code. After the pope’s statement, an angry crowd burned an effigy of him.In Baghdad, Juliet Yusef attends St. George’s, the country’s lone Anglican church. She, too, now wears a head scarf anytime she ventures outside her neighborhood. “I am afraid of being attacked,” she said.Dora, a neighborhood in southern Baghdad that was once heavily populated by Christians and has been plagued by sectarian violence, has now been mostly emptied of them. Christians were singled out there by insurgents who accused them of being friendly with the occupying Americans.“They are Christian, we are Christian,” said one holdout, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Suzan. “They think most likely we know each other well.”Two priests were kidnapped over the summer in Dora, although both were released, one after nearly a month.Oddly, before the pope’s comments, as sectarian violence has escalated in Baghdad in the past year, some said the situation might have actually improved for Christians as Muslim militants turned their attention on one another.Canon Andrew White, the Anglican vicar of Baghdad, who lives in Britain but visits Iraq frequently, said his driver was kidnapped recently but was promptly released after his Sunni Arab captors discovered he was a Christian. He said his captors apologized by saying, “We thought he was Shiite.”“It must be the only occasion when being a Christian actually helped in this country,” he said.'"

"'06-10-18,'1','Vadim Mamotin, director general of the site’s parent company, Mediaservices, spoke through a translator by telephone with the International Herald Tribune and then participated in an online chat with 59 journalists. Mr. Mamotin maintained that the company operated legally under Russian law.“In six years of operation we have never been convicted by a Russian court or declared illegal,” Mr. Mamotin said in the telephone interview. “Under Russian law, we are 100 percent legal.”Mr. Mamotin said that the site, which claims five million subscribers and a growth rate of 5,000 a day, pays artists by turning over 15 percent of its revenue to a collecting agency, the Russian Multimedia and Internet Society, or ROMS. by its initials in Russian.Organizations representing global authors, composers, music publishers and record companies issued a statement, however, calling for closure of the site and reaffirming their stance that both ROMS and AllofMP3 operate illegally.“Under the copyright laws of virtually every country in the world, including Russia, it is illegal to distribute recordings without the permission of the rights owners,” read the statement, released by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers and the Recording Industry Association of America. “ROMS has no mandate from international rights holders to license the site in or outside of Russia.”The battle with AllofMP3 comes as the Internet continues to bring upheaval to the music industry by radically changing distribution models.Some players, like Pirate Bay in Sweden, continue to operate illegally, while others, like Napster and Kazaa, have converted their operations into legal pay sites in cooperation with music industry.Also on Tuesday, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry said it had begun legal action against 8,000 people in 17 countries, aiming at computer users who illegally share their music collections over the Internet. The federation, which represents record companies around the world, said that many of the targets of the suits were the parents of children who had been illegally sharing music files, The Associated Press reported.AllofMP3 said Tuesday that as of today, its business model would move toward an ad-supported distribution of free content. The company, which previously charged about $1 an album, plans to offer consumers a new software program that allows them to download any song from the site for free. AllofMP3 claims to have a catalogue of hundreds of thousands of albums, increasing at a rate of 1,000 a month.Users of the new service will only be able to listen to songs by using the AllofMP3 software, and the songs will be usable on just one computer at a time. The interface, called Music for the Masses, will initially be available for Microsoft Windows, with an Apple version arriving in several weeks, Mr. Mamotin said.The idea, he said, is to make the offering attractive enough to win new customers and build a big enough community to attract advertising.'"
"'06-10-18,'1','Still, the Labor Department reported that core consumer inflation is now running at 2.9 percent for the year — the highest level in almost 11 years.The government also announced today that Social Security recipients will see a 3.3 percent increase in their 2007 benefit checks, or about $33 a month for the average retired worker. That cost-of-living increase, derived from the consumer price index, is smaller than the 4.1 percent increase for 2006.With inflation still running well above 2 percent, the maximum level that Fed policy makers have said they think is healthy, investors and economists are waiting to see whether a two-year march of interest-rate increases by the central bank will eventually start to restrain consumer prices. The Fed, trying not to overshoot the mark and risk a recession, has held rates steady at its last two policy meetings.Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, have said the sagging housing market would help cool inflation. Today, the government reported that while housing starts rose in 5.9 percent in September, the number of new building permits fell for the seventh consecutive month.The tick upward in housing starts was unexpected, but few economists think that housing construction has bottomed out.“Even a cursory glance at the awful permits numbers should disabuse all but the most incurable optimists of that notion,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist with High Frequency Economics, in a research report.That was apparently the sentiment on Wall Street this morning, where investors weighed the housing and inflation reports along with announcements of stronger-than-expected profits in the third quarter from I.B.M. and Intel.With all signs pointing to continued cooling in the economy, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates on hold for the time being. And that is exactly what many equity investors would like.“The stock market has the tendency of doing best when we’re in a slow-growth environment,” said Bruce Bittles, an investment strategist with Robert W. Baird. Mr. Bittles said he expected stocks to continue moving broadly upward because many Americans, nervous over the current economic and political climate, have yet to jump in to the market.“The largest mystery about this rally is the fact that it really hasn’t induced a lot of optimism on the part of investors,” he said. “Investor confidence is still somewhat cautious.”'"
"'06-10-18,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 17 (AP) — The chairman of the KLA-Tencor Corporation, which supplies computer chips, retired Tuesday with a less-valuable stock-option package, becoming the latest insider swept up in the efforts to clean up an accounting problem expected to cost up to $400 million.The chairman, Kenneth Levy, who founded the company, decided to step down late Monday after KLA acknowledged it had improperly booked employee stock options for several years. Mr. Levy, 64, will be succeeded as nonexecutive chairman by Edward Barnholt, 63, a member of KLA’s board since 1995.Mr. Levy’s options will be re-priced, an indication that the company suspects he bears some responsibility for the problems that occurred from July 1997 through June 2002.When it released the findings of its internal inquiry, KLA did not directly accuse anyone of misconduct. But the company explicitly absolved its current management team, led by the chief executive Richard Wallace, of any wrongdoing.'"
"'06-10-18,'1','Many of the sharpest exchanges involved an issue that has dominated many races across the nation this year: the war in Iraq.At one point, Eric Scott, the moderator, asked Mr. Menendez, who voted against the war while in the House of Representatives, if he thought Representatives Robert E. Andrews and Bill Pascrell Jr., two Democrats who voted for the war, should be held accountable for their votes.Mr. Menendez said he could not speak for them, then accused Mr. Kean of being silent on the issue until recently. Then, referring to Mr. Kean’s call in recent months for the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, he said, “You want to use Donald Rumsfeld’s resignation as a fig leaf to cover up the fact that you still continue to support the war, would have voted for it even with the benefit of hindsight.”At another point, Mr. Scott tried no fewer than four times to ask whether Mr. Kean would have voted for the war, knowing what he did now.As he has done in interviews and at news conferences, Mr. Kean tried to explain his answer in longhand by invoking the names of President Bill Clinton and Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, as two prominent people who had supported the war. And he repeated his refrain that what was most important was getting “our troops out of harm’s way as quickly as humanly possible.”Mr. Scott, apparently dissatisfied, said that it was clear that “you’re not going to answer that question.”Later, the two candidates clashed over the minimum wage, in responding to a question from a caller who identified herself as Helene from East Rutherford. Mr. Menendez said he supported raising the federal minimum wage, then ripped Mr. Kean for opposing a similar state measure. “I think he’s out of touch with the realities of people in this state who work hard,” he said.Mr. Kean reacted sharply, noting that Mr. Menendez had voted against a bill that would have raised the federal minimum wage. “If you had been willing to reach across the partisan aisle and get it done, we could have had a federal minimum wage of $7.25,” Mr. Kean said. “We don’t, Bob, because of your inability to reach across the partisan aisle.”One topic that also came up was the nasty nature of the race. One caller, Mike from Manalapan, N.J., said that voters were disgusted by both candidates because “their commercials are horrendous” and because they only wanted to talk about the “evilness” of the other candidate.On that note, Mr. Scott asked each candidate to say something nice about the other.Mr. Kean said, “I appreciate the love that Bob Menendez has for his mother and for his children.”Mr. Menendez said, “I appreciate Tom Kean Jr.’s willingness to serve.”Neither, however, could find enough nice things to say to fill up their allotted 45 seconds.'"

"'06-10-18,'1','The business of trading such financial contracts has generated huge fortunes that have led many exchanges to begin looking for merger partners. They seek to create greater efficiency and more liquid markets where buyers and sellers more easily find what they want for the right price, much as on eBay.By combining, the Chicago exchanges, to be named the CME Group, will have average daily trading volume of close to nine million contracts a day, representing $4.2 trillion in notional value, or the amount of the underlying assets, not the value of the contracts themselves. By a comparison of sorts, some 1.8 billion shares, or $87.2 billion, are traded on average on the New York Stock Exchange, the world’s biggest stock market, every day, although those shares, unlike derivatives, represent direct ownership stakes.“That makes us the risk capital of the world,” said Terrence A. Duffy, the mercantile exchange’s chairman.The combination of the two exchanges also signals the growing importance of Chicago as a center of global finance. The board of trade pioneered the concept of a futures contract — the delivery of a specific commodity by a certain date — in the 1860’s, originally for grains like corn and wheat. The mercantile exchange led the push into electronic trading in the early 1990’s.Since then, these Chicago markets have been pressing further into the ever-growing world of trading derivatives contracts.Derivatives can refer to a futures contract that is tied to the price of a commodity, like soybeans, and it can refer to arcane financial products not traded on any exchange, like credit default swaps, which can be negotiated between two hedge funds.Often, the bet is not central to the underlying asset’s role; a bet on the coin toss in a football game rather than the outcome of the game itself would be a derivative bet, for example. Or a contract to hedge the weather risks affecting crop prices, rather than the future prices of those crops, would also be considered a derivative.Driven by companies’ increasing desire to hedge risks, the derivatives markets have been growing rapidly. Since 2004, the notional value of interest rate, equity and credit derivatives has risen 44 percent, to $283.2 trillion, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.“The notional amounts are eye-popping,” said Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance in Chicago.The two exchanges, situated a few blocks from each other in Chicago’s downtown Loop, have storied histories. The board of trade once financed the formation of three regiments and an artillery battery for the union army during the Civil War, and the exchange’s first building was torched in the Chicago Fire of 1871. The mercantile exchange began as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board, later branching out to frozen pork-belly futures and live-cattle futures contracts.While a half-century older, the board of trade was slower to move to electronic trading and to issue public stock, causing it to lose ground to the mercantile exchange. The move to electronic trading, led by the Chicago Merc, has made the board of trade’s clubby floor-trading world less relevant.“The C.B.O.T. had to be dragged into the 21st century kicking and screaming,” Ms. Tavakoli said.Tuesday’s announcement took some in the financial world here by surprise because the two exchanges, despite their intense rivalry, had discussed combining off and on for more than three decades. The ice began to thaw between them after they struck an agreement in 2003 for both to use the Chicago Merc’s clearinghouse, the board of trade’s chairman, Charles P. Carey, said in an interview.After his exchange finally went public last year, the newly issued stock provided a currency to consider such a deal. “When we had member organizations,” Mr. Carey said, “the hurdles were insurmountable.”Last December, over dinner at Gene & Georgetti’s, a popular steakhouse here, Mr. Duffy and Mr. Carey began to discuss a deal seriously. The talks accelerated over the last eight weeks, Mr. Duffy said.The combination is expected to save $125 million annually in the second year after the deal closes, mostly through cuts in administrative and technology areas, the companies said. The exchanges will combine their trading operations into one trading floor at the board of trade.But the mercantile exchange clearly prevailed over its rival. Mr. Duffy will become chairman of the combined organization, with Mr. Carey, vice chairman. Craig S. Donohue, chief executive of the mercantile exchange, will head the CME Group. The mercantile exchange will have 20 of the 29 board seats.The deal faces regulatory scrutiny and a stiff breakup fee of $240 million if either exchange walks away. Regulators are expected to examine whether the combined entity can leverage its share of the futures and derivatives market into pricing power.The merger “will create a mammoth enterprise with extraordinary pricing power,” said Meyer Frucher, the chairman and chief executive of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. “Ironically, it may create more opportunities for others.”Mr. Duffy and Mr. Donohue said that with an increased focus on electronic trading, the merged exchanges will make markets more transparent and more liquid for investors.Mr. Donohue said the CME Group would compete more aggressively to build the exchanges’ derivatives market in Europe and Asia. Some traders said it would face tough sledding against Euronext’s London-based derivatives business and the Deutsche Börse’s Eurex derivatives market.Jay Feuerstein, who heads Xenon Capital Management in Chicago, a hedge fund that focuses on trading futures contracts, said: “It will be tough for the mercantile exchange to take on the European exchanges and beat them. If they decide to offer some of the products that the Chicago exchanges offer, they have some built-in competitive advantages.”Mr. Feuerstein added, “I am going to trade where there is the deepest liquidity, the cheapest transaction costs and the least credit risk.”Still, while the deal could increase the CME Group’s reach overseas, the combination could stifle plans by Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange to increase its derivatives business in the United States. Euronext agreed to merge with the Big Board this summer, explaining in part that the move could create revenue opportunities related to derivative operations, some of which included plans to grow in the United States.The combination of the two exchanges “makes them into a very, very big competitor indeed,"" said Lynton Jones, a founder of Bourse Consult in London. “Euronext has been trying to get into U.S. markets without much success. They thought with the clout of the N.Y.S.E. behind them, they might do something. But I don’t see what that could be now.”'"

"'06-10-18,'1','Intel also delivered a fourth-quarter forecast roughly in line with expectations. Mr. Bryant said he expected revenues for the fourth quarter to be $9.1 billion to $9.7 billion; analysts’ forecasts call for $9.5 billion.Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said the company’s retrenching efforts were paying off and that it was regaining market share lost to A.M.D. Intel ended the second quarter with its lowest market share in four years. The company’s share of the global chip market fell to 11.4 percent in the second quarter, down from 13.2 percent in the first quarter.“We believe we gained overall share this quarter, based on record shipments of servers and mobile processors,” Mr. Otellini said. “Our goal has been to regain share throughout this year and that remains our goal.”But some analysts said Intel’s progress in stemming market share losses would not be clear until Advanced Micro announced its quarterly earnings Wednesday.Before Intel’s results were released, its shares fell 71 cents, to close at $20.90, after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.Adam S. Parker, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said he believed Intel was still facing intense competition and would continue to slip through next year. “It’s a mixed-bag quarter for Intel,” he said. “I don’t see the market share gains they’re talking about.”In contrast to Intel, Mr. Parker said he expected Advanced Micro to announce revenue growth of 10 percent to 13 percent.The third quarter represented the first full quarter of sales since Intel released a new lineup of chips designed to perform faster and more efficiently. Mr. Otellini said the company had already sold six million chips based on the new design.Mr. Bryant, the chief financial officer, said the company’s server business led growth during the third quarter. Intel’s digital enterprise group, which develops products for businesses, was the biggest loser, posting a 22 percent decline in revenues, while the mobility group, which makes processors for notebook computers, saw revenues rise 3 percent.In September, Intel announced that it would lay off more than 10,000 employees over the next few years. Mr. Bryant said the company was on track to reduce its work force by 5 percent by the end of the year, for a total of 95,000. The company’s goal is to reduce its work force to 92,000 by the middle of next year.Before the results were released, Intel shares fell 71 cents, to close at $20.90, after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.'"
"'06-10-18,'1','Mr. Semel said the company needed to focus on three areas: narrowing the gap between Yahoo and Google in revenue from search advertising; extending its leading position in display advertising; and expanding in new areas like social networking, video and mobile data services.Search revenue, he said, would substantially increase when Yahoo completed a long-delayed computer system called Project Panama, which will use a new way to determine how ads are placed on search result pages.Mr. Semel announced that the first customers had started using the system. But only after all of the company’s search advertisers have converted to the new system, sometime after the end of the year, will Yahoo introduce the new auction method, which is the part of the system meant to improve revenue.Company shares, which had fallen sharply after Yahoo announced its slow ad sales last month, rose in after-hours trading yesterday. They reached $24.83, up 3 percent from their Tuesday close.Youssef H. Squali, an analyst for Jefferies & Company said the initial rollout of the Panama system showed that Yahoo might be poised for a turnaround.“This is a challenged story for the next six months,” Mr. Squali said, “but we think that Yahoo is a 2007 stock.”But other analysts were more concerned. “Yahoo has a great deal of headwind,” said Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. He said he was concerned that Yahoo only recently began to talk about the rise in competition.“This kind of excess inventory they talked about doesn’t happen overnight,” he said. “Let’s hope they can fix it. But at this point I can’t say I’ve heard enough to say there is a convincing plan.”Yahoo earned $155 million in the third quarter, down from $253 million in the period a year ago. The two years are not comparable because of a change in the way stock options are accounted for. On a per-share basis, Yahoo earned 11 cents a share, which met analyst expectations.For the fourth quarter, Mr. Semel said the slowdown would continue. In display advertising, sales will increase only as fast as the overall online market. Until recently, Yahoo has been gaining market share in the advertising market.“That is not where we should be,” Mr. Semel said.And the picture is bleaker in search advertising, where Mr. Semel predicts only 5 percent growth in revenue.Mr. Rashtchy estimated that search advertising over all is growing at a 30 percent annual pace.Mr. Semel said Yahoo was doing better in the hot category of social media than many critics had given it credit for. Its Flickr photo-sharing service has 20 million monthly users, he said, and its Yahoo Answers service — where users respond to questions posed by other users — has 60 million users.“If Answers was owned by two guys in a garage and had 60 million users in a year, there would be a lot of press about it,” Mr. Semel said in an interview.Responding to the deal by Google to buy YouTube, the biggest site for user-uploaded video, Mr. Semel said he did not regret not buying the company.“I came out with a grave concern about how severe the copyright violations could be,” he said. “It could be a gnarly problem if lawsuits come. And I did not want to put my company in that type of risk.”'"
"'06-10-18,'1','Buyout firms are engaged in an unprecedented feeding frenzy, gobbling up publicly traded companies like never before. While buyouts can set lagging businesses back on the right track, regulators and shareholders must be watchful to ensure that managers demand fair value for the companies.In a typical buyout, a firm or consortium of firms purchases all the public stock in a company and takes the company private. The expression “leveraged buyout” refers to the large debt that usually finances this process — the way a homebuyer makes a down payment on a much larger mortgage.The $33 billion acquisition of the hospital chain HCA earlier this year ranks as the largest leveraged buyout ever. Two firms recently bid $15 billion for Harrah’s Entertainment, the world’s largest casino operator. These deals are happening across the economy, as everyone from wealthy individuals to investment banks hunt for high-return investment opportunities. Even pension funds have gotten into the business, helping to fuel the trend.According to Thomson Financial, buyout firms have spent $275 billion so far this year taking companies private, or over a quarter of the $1 trillion total for mergers and acquisitions. In the previous 20 years the highest share was 14.1 percent.Leveraged buyouts have something of a bad reputation for what, in its worst form, is something like corporate looting. In those cases, a company’s balance sheet would be quickly loaded with high levels of debt to pay the buyers exorbitant dividends and management fees. They would then flip the debt-ridden company as quickly as possible, either to another buyer or through a public offering.Done correctly, a buyout can be a very productive way to unlock a business’s real potential. Once a company is privately held, management can ignore the short-term dictates of the stock market and focus on the investments needed for long-term growth. A recent Harvard Business School study found that when bought-out companies were put back on the equity market they outperformed other initial public offerings and the market as a whole.The main concern for shareholders, however, is the initial sale price. Corporate management can face conflicts of interest when the terms of a bid are better for top executives than shareholders. And management often leads a buyout itself, which discourages other prospective buyers from submitting competing bids and keeps the price artificially low.'"
"'06-10-18,'1','“I can’t wait to put people on the drug,” Dr. James Underberg, a clinical assistant professor at New York University medical school who participated in a clinical trial of Januvia. Januvia is the third major new diabetes drug approved since the summer of 2005, and potentially the most important, analysts and doctors say. The drug works in a different way than existing treatments, and its pill form makes it more convenient than Byetta, a treatment approved last year that has some of the same benefits as Januvia but must be taken by injection.Analysts predict that Januvia, either as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with an existing diabetes drug called metformin, will have worldwide sales of nearly $2 billion by 2010. Merck hopes to win approval for that combined drug early next year.Optimism about Januvia has helped push Merck shares up 38 percent this year, compared with an 11 percent gain for the average large drug stock. Merck shares closed yesterday at $43.96, up 20 cents — at their highest level since the company withdrew its arthritis drug Vioxx in September 2004 after a study linked Vioxx to heart attacks and strokes.Executives at Merck declined to comment on their plans for advertising Januvia to consumers. Unlike several other major drug makers, Merck has not committed to waiting at least six months before advertising new drugs so that doctors have a chance to learn about new therapies before patients begin asking for them.But physicians like Dr. Underberg are already enthusiastic. “It doesn’t cause weight gain, it doesn’t cause episodes of hypoglycemia, and the side effects otherwise are pretty moderate,” he said.Hypoglycemia is a potentially dangerous condition in which blood sugar levels drop too fast. In severe instances, it can cause fainting or even coma. Several older diabetes drugs can cause hypoglycemia by pushing the pancreas to produce large amounts insulin quickly.In contrast, Januvia and Galvus are the first in a newer class of drugs called DPP-IV inhibitors, which work by enhancing levels of a natural protein called GLP-1. The protein stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin and discourages the liver from making glucose. But the DPP-IV inhibitors work only when blood sugar levels are already elevated, such as after a meal, sharply lowering the risk for hypoglycemia.“The approval of Januvia marks an important advance in the fight against diabetes,” Dr. Steven Galson, director of the F.D.A.’s center for drug evaluation and research, said in a statement. “We now have another new option that treats the disease in an entirely new way.”Diabetes is a disease in which blood sugar rises uncontrollably from a lack of, or resistance to, insulin, a hormone normally produced in the pancreas. In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas is unable to produce insulin.Type 2 diabetes is linked to obesity and inactivity. Typically, the disease progresses over several years as the pancreas gradually loses the ability to produce insulin, and drug treatments lose their effectiveness. Eventually, many patients wind up injecting themselves with insulin to control their blood sugar. Severe, late-stage diabetes sharply raises the risks of many medical problems, including heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease and blindness.Jay Galeota, general manager of Merck’s global diabetes division, said Merck planned to ship Januvia to pharmacies and offer samples to doctors’ offices quickly. The company expects to market Januvia to both doctors and patients almost immediately, he said.“We’re confident that we’re going to communicate the science of Januvia in a very wide way,” he said. “We’re expecting very rapid uptake right away.”While there are several major classes of diabetes medicines already on the market, many have side effects that discourage patients from taking them, including weight gain and nausea. As a result, the market is ripe for new treatments, doctors and analysts say.In clinical trials that examined Januvia in 2,719 patients, the most common side effects were sore throat, diarrhea and colds, the F.D.A. said.Richard Evans, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said he expected Januvia and Galvus to rapidly replace an older class of drugs called sulfonylureas. The newer drugs are similarly effective but much less likely to cause weight gain and hypoglycemia, he said.“Everybody knows that sulfonylureas are kind of a losing game,” he said. While Galvus and Januvia are very similar, Januvia may have an edge because it clearly works as a once-a-day pill, while Galvus was initially formulated to be taken twice daily, Mr. Evans said. Novartis, the manufacturer of Galvus, now claims that its drug is effective when taken once daily, but doctors may be skeptical of that claim, he said.Tony Butler, an industry analyst at Lehman Brothers, said he expected that Januvia would have sales of $271 million next year, rising to $1.1 billion by 2010. Mr. Butler said sales of the Januvia-metformin combination pill would be $500 million more in 2010.'"
"'06-10-18,'1','Wall Street had not expected the Labor Department report to show such elevated core prices. Economists had forecast a 0.2 percent increase in the core index for September. By contrast, the overall index, including food and energy, fell 1.3 percent last month, more than in any month since mid-2003.Despite that decline, the core-index figures raised a question of whether inflation has started to moderate, as some other statistics had suggested. It may also dampen expectations that the Fed will lower interest rates any time soon.“This is a warning for economic forecasters not too get too sanguine,” said Gregory L. Miller, chief economist of SunTrust Banks. “Sometimes we get these indicators that remind us we’re not in control.”On Wednesday, the Labor Department will release another barometer of inflation, the Consumer Price Index. Economists expect September’s data will show a 0.2 percent rise in the core rate, according to a survey by Bloomberg News. That would mean that inflation is running well above a level that Fed members have said they consider healthy.In the last two months, the Fed has stopped tightening monetary policy and has held its benchmark short-term federal funds rate at 5.25 percent. With the economy slowing, many economists and investors have been betting that the Fed may cut rates in the foreseeable future.A fresh sign that the economy is cooling came yesterday, when the Commerce Department reported that industrial production unexpectedly fell 0.6 percent in September.Still, members of the Federal Reserve’s policy-setting Open Markets Committee, including the Fed’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have said they remain concerned about rising prices. And minutes from their Sept. 20 meeting, released last week, show that uncertainty over inflation was a subject of much discussion at the Fed.Economists noted that the September jump in the core index of producer prices was largely a result of rising auto prices and was probably not a major concern. Reversing a recent downward trend, auto prices rose in September at the fastest rate in 15 years. That added more volatility to the index, whose fits and starts from month to month can make reading the broader trend difficult.“Once you sort through the noise, there’s very little inflation,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR. “Just as last month’s numbers didn’t tell you we’re having significant deflation at the core producer level, this month’s number doesn’t tell you the opposite.”'"
"'06-10-18,'1','McClatchy and E. W. Scripps posted third-quarter profits yesterday that sustained analysts’ estimates, but their stock prices fell anyway.Net income at McClatchy rose 34 percent, to $51.8 million, or 64 cents a share. Profit before one-time items was 68 cents a share, exceeding the 46-cent estimate of a Goldman Sachs analyst, Peter Appert. Revenue more than doubled, to $680.9 million, from $292.6 million a year earlier.The results at McClatchy were buoyed by its $4.1 billion purchase in June of much of the Knight Ridder newspaper chain, adding The Miami Herald, The Charlotte Observer and 18 other papers.“The Street threw out the income statement,” a UBS analyst, Brian Shipman, said of McClatchy’s report, “and focused on advertising growth rates, and they were soft and softening. They said the fourth quarter isn’t looking any better than September, so that means the fourth quarter is looking bleak.”McClatchy, based in Sacramento, Calif., took on $3 billion in debt to finance the Knight Ridder acquisitions. It also received $310 million by selling its stake in CareerBuilder.com, which it received as part of the Knight Ridder deal.'"

"'06-10-18,'1','“We don’t have the courage to defeat them,” said John Yotoma, a 38-year-old Sudanese corporal who lay shivering in a hospital tent here, bullet wounds in his arm and groin. “We didn’t have enough ammunition. We just ran away.”For months Sudan has been building up troops in Darfur, adding thousands of men in key garrison towns, preparing for an assault on the non-Arab rebel groups that refused in May to sign an agreement to end the war.One rebel faction signed, but others have vowed to continue fighting the government and its allied tribal militias, whose brutal counterinsurgency has been called genocide by the Bush administration and many others.The Sudanese government has vowed to crush the remaining rebel factions, and has forcefully rejected a Security Council resolution authorizing a United Nations peacekeeping force of more than 20,000 troops and police officers in Darfur to replace an overmatched and under-equipped African Union force.In August, Sudan made a counterproposal, saying it would use its own troops to quell the uprising. That position was quickly rejected by much of the world, and raised fears that the government was prepared to unleash a brutal assault that could rival or surpass the bloody battles that had killed at least 250,000 people, many from war-related hunger and disease, and had pushed 2.5 million from their homes.But so far, the Sudanese Army seems to have faced mostly humiliating defeat, as it did in the Oct. 7 attack near Kariari, a village on the border. The International Crisis Group, an independent conflict-prevention organization, also says that the government has been taking major losses in the recent fighting.It is virtually impossible for journalists to speak to soldiers inside Sudan. They are not allowed to give interviews, and foreign journalists who photograph or film them are subject to arrest on serious charges, including espionage.Yet the Sudanese soldiers here in Iriba, safely across the border in Chad, seemed eager to tell their stories and gripe about the tough life they faced on the front, their doubts about the legitimacy of their government’s fight against the rebels in Darfur and their low morale.They described the brutal assault by the rebels on Oct. 7 as one that caught them by surprise.The attack began around 3 p.m. Listless from fasting for Ramadan, most soldiers were napping or busy preparing the meal that at sundown would break the ritual fast. Mr. Rahal said he was cooking some soup when he heard the first gunfire, and saw more than 100 pickup trucks with heavy weapons barreling toward the camp.He grabbed his rifle, taking a position in a nearby trench. He fought for about 20 minutes, he said, until he emptied his gun’s magazine. The soldiers had been running low on ammunition for some time, Mr. Rahal and other soldiers said, and they had asked their commanding officer to request more munitions. But during their monthlong stint at the front, the bullets never arrived.When Mr. Rahal found himself facing fire with an empty gun, he decided to flee.“I just dropped it and ran away,” he said.But he didn’t get far before he felt a stab in his right calf, then a searing bolt of pain up his thigh. He dropped to the ground and lay still, hoping no one would come to finish him off. When it seemed the coast was clear, he tried to stand up, but couldn’t.“I had so much pain in my leg I could not walk,” he said.So he crawled. Using his forearms, he pulled himself west, toward the border. Just before dark he was picked up by some Chadian soldiers, he said, who brought him to the Chadian border town of Bahai, then shipped him to the hospital in Iriba.About 40 soldiers were taken to the hospital for treatment, and 90 more were taken to the local jail, where they were placed in a guarded courtyard. Their status is unclear. They have been visited by Red Cross officials, but they are not prisoners of war or illegal migrants. Unsure of their fate, they while away their days in prison playing cards and talking.“Can’t you see how bored we are?” said Moussa Mahmoud Yassin, a 42-year-old soldier from Khartoum, the Sudanese capital. “We have nothing to do.”Like most of the soldiers here, he said he did not intend to go back to the military, and thought the war in Darfur was pointless.“We all just want to go home to our families,” he said.The battle was a rout for the rebels, the soldiers here said, with the Sudanese Army taking heavy casualties. No one had time to count the bodies, but of the 750 Sudanese troops that were attacked, as many as half were killed, according to Sudanese soldiers here.The attitudes and general despondence of the Sudanese troops held here underscores why Sudan, despite its large military, well supplied by arms bought from China with Sudan’s growing oil wealth, has relied primarily on brutal Arab militias to carry out its grim counterinsurgency campaign against the rebels in Darfur.It was a strategy Sudan perfected in its 20-year civil war in the south, where it used Arab tribal militias as a paramilitary force. The militias terrorized southern Sudan, razing villages, raping women and kidnapping children. The militias in Darfur, known as the janjaweed, have carried out a similar campaign.Many of the Sudanese soldiers said they hoped that the United Nations would send a peacekeeping force to Darfur soon, contradicting their government’s staunch position against such a force, arguing that any foreign troops would be seen as occupiers bent on re-colonizing Sudan.“We wish the U.N. would come and take over,” said Waleed Mugammed, a 23-year-old private from Khartoum. “I don’t want to go back to Darfur.”'"
"'06-10-18,'1','Green stared grimly from the sideline as the Cardinals blew a 20-point second-half lead without their defense giving up a touchdown. The Bears recovered two fumbles and returned them for scores, and Devin Hester scored the game-winning touchdown on an 83-yard punt return.Neil Rackers still could have won the game for Arizona, but he missed a 40-yard field-goal attempt with 52 seconds to play as several of his teammates threw their helmets to the ground in disgust.Green lost his temper at the postgame news conference, slapping a microphone to the floor, and adding a few expletives as he discussed losing to the undefeated Bears (6-0).“We let them off the hook,” said Green, a habit the Cardinals have perfected.Green’s future may be tenuous, but Leinart’s looks bright. He completed 24 of 42 passes against the Bears, throwing for 2 touchdowns and 232 yards against one of the league’s best defenses.Making only his second start, Leinart was poised in the pocket, released the ball quickly and accurately, and looked as comfortable as he did at Southern California, where he won a national championship and the Heisman Trophy.Already, Leinart has shown a willingness to become the team’s leader, as evidenced by his comments after Monday’s loss.“How are we going to react next week, are we going to tank, or are we going to go out there and win a key football game?” Leinart said. “That’s my job as the quarterback, to get this team up and continue to work hard.”While the Cardinals are a long way from playoff contention, Billick is trying to keep the Ravens atop the tough American Football Conference North, with Cincinnati (3-2) and Pittsburgh (2-3) in pursuit.This is Billick’s eighth season as Ravens coach, but they have missed the playoffs the last two years, and five seasons have passed since they won Super Bowl XXXV against the Giants. Billick’s job security was in doubt after last season, but the Ravens hoped that acquiring quarterback Steve McNair from Tennessee would provide the missing link for their anemic offense. But Baltimore remains a team led by its defense.McNair sustained a concussion and sprained neck Sunday when the Ravens lost, 23-21, to Carolina. But McNair is expected to start when the Ravens visit New Orleans on Oct. 29, and Billick will call the plays, realizing that he is taking a gamble by firing an offensive coordinator during the season.“I have an obligation to this organization to do what I think is in the best interest of this team, regardless of how difficult those decisions are,” Billick said. “Jim Fassel has been a valuable and loyal coach to me. Clearly, in order for us to expand on our 4-2 start, we have to have more offensive productivity. It was my opinion, going forward, to get where we want to go, I needed to step back in on a day-to-day basis.”Billick declined to discuss if Fassel had trouble coexisting with others on the Ravens’ staff, like the quarterbacks coach Rick Neuheisel.“There was no single incident, no episode, nothing specific that brought about this change,” Billick said. “It was a collective evaluation on my part that something dramatic needed to be done.”COLTS ACQUIRE MCFARLAND The Indianapolis Colts’ leaky run defense got some help yesterday when the Colts acquired tackle Anthony McFarland from Tampa Bay for a 2007 second-round draft pick in a rare midseason deal.

"'06-10-18,'1','Merrill Lynch followed its Wall Street rivals yesterday by reporting third-quarter earnings that were stronger than expected, fueled by its debt and equity markets business. Merrill also joined its peers in taking more risk in allocating its capital.Excluding the benefit of the merger of its asset management unit with BlackRock, the firm earned $1.9 billion, or $2 a share, up 43 percent from the quarter a year ago and up 23 percent from the second quarter. A group of 17 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expected Merrill to report $1.47 a share.Including a one-time gain of $1.1 billion from the BlackRock deal, Merrill earned $3 billion, or $3.17 a share. Net revenue, excluding the merger impact, was $7.9 billion, up 19 percent over the same quarter in 2005 and down 3 percent from the previous quarter.Merrill is more aggressively using its own capital to bet on trends in the market as well as using its balance sheet to take companies private. In July, Merrill joined Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and Bain Capital in the $32 billion acquisition of HCA, the biggest buyout ever. It has also been investing in people and systems to allow it to take more risk in trading its own capital.Trading in fixed income, currencies and commodities, a segment that has been a major driver of Wall Street profits in recent years, increased significantly in the third quarter to a record $2.1 billion, up 26 percent from a year ago.

"'06-10-18,'1','CHICAGO, Oct. 17 (AP) — Harmful reactions to medicines, usually attributed to accidental overdoses and allergic reactions, send more than 700,000 Americans to emergency rooms each year, government research shows.The results, from 2004-5, represent the first two years of data from a national surveillance project on outpatient drug safety. The project was developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission.The study is to be published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.“This is an important study because it reinforces the really substantial risks that there are in everyday use of drugs,” said Bruce Lambert, a professor at the college of pharmacy at the University of Illinois, Chicago.The study’s authors and other experts agreed that 700,000 was probably a low estimate because bad drug reactions were likely to be misdiagnosed.The medicines most commonly implicated in the reactions included insulin for diabetes; warfarin, an anticoagulant, and amoxicillin, an antibiotic used for many infections.'"
"'06-10-18,'1','The United Technologies Corporation, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Carrier air-conditioners, said third-quarter profit increased 21 percent, driven by sales of aircraft parts and elevators.Net income rose to $996 million, or 99 cents a share, from $821 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales climbed 12 percent, to $12.2 billion, from $10.9 billion.United Technologies benefited from rising commercial construction, which spurred sales at its Otis elevator, Carrier and fire and security units. Demand from airlines and the military bolstered results at Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand aerospace and Sikorsky, where the company said it encountered “production challenges” to meet a record number of orders for Black Hawk helicopters.Its profit topped the 96 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call, but its shares fell $1.30, to $65.49, partly because of profit margins at Carrier and Sikorsky that were weaker than some analysts had expected.“Sikorsky is a surprise, they’re struggling a little bit,” said Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst at S.

"'06-10-18,'1','JERUSALEM, Oct. 17 — The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, warned Tuesday that the current Palestinian political crisis was intolerable, and suggested he would dismiss the Hamas-led government if the rival factions could not agree soon on a national unity government.“To maintain the status quo is impossible,” Mr. Abbas said in remarks broadcast on Palestinian television. “As the person in charge, I am obligated to consider all options that could get us out of this crisis.”Mr. Abbas’s speech, delivered from the West Bank city of Ramallah, was the clearest signal yet that he was prepared to act against the Hamas government. With Israel and Western governments cutting off the flow of money to the Palestinian Authority, the Hamas government has barely functioned since coming to power more than six months ago.Mr. Abbas said he still sought a national unity government that would include his secular Fatah movement and Hamas, the Islamic radical group. The two parties agreed on such an arrangement more than a month ago, but the talks broke down over issues that include the recognition of Israel, which Hamas rejects.Mr. Abbas said that if no agreement was reached soon he might dismiss the government and replace it, at least temporarily, with technocrats.'"
"'06-10-18,'1','The initiative not only helps former prisoners with academic, financial-aid and admissions counseling, but also assists with job and housing problems. In addition, it offers a course in computer skills and in preparing for the math and English sections of the City University entrance exams, said Debbie A. Mukamal, the institute’s director.Post-prison programs like the College Initiative — and like College and Community Fellowship, a similar effort that is part of CUNY’s Graduate Center — were developed in response to a drastic reduction a decade ago in college programs in the nation’s federal and state prisons, specialists in prisoner rehabilitation say. At that time, with crime rates having climbed, many elected officials worked to make sentences and prison conditions tougher.In 1994, Congress removed prison inmates from eligibility for Pell Grants, a major federal program of aid to low-income students that was the financial backbone of most in-prison college programs. Many states, including New York, followed the federal lead and removed prison inmates from their own college aid programs.As a result, about 25,000 inmates taking part in such programs with Pell Grants had their “education abruptly ended,” according to a study by Kenneth Mentor, an associate professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. By 1997, only 8 college prison programs remained active nationwide, compared with as many as 350 in previous years, Mr. Mentor said.In New York State, the number fell to 4 programs from nearly 70, according to the Bard Prison Initiative, one of the state’s 9 current programs, involving 13 prisons. Most are financed by the schools involved or by churches and other nonprofit groups.Mr. Guillen and Ms. White are among 327 people whom the College Initiative program has helped to enroll in senior or community colleges since 2002, mostly at CUNY. Twenty have received associate or bachelor degrees, and 144 continue to pursue degrees, including nine on the master’s or doctoral level.Even though half the 327 who began the program did not enroll for a second semester, Ms. Rubenstein said the effort’s record was one of accomplishment.“This is a population that faces many difficult issues,” she said. “Many have had a lot of time in prison, sometimes 15 to 20 years,” and often find after starting college that they have to refocus on getting “other pieces of their lives in place, like employment or dealing with family issues.” She said she expected many of the dropouts to resume college.Most program participants at CUNY colleges attend the New York City College of Technology in Brooklyn, the Borough of Manhattan Community College and La Guardia Community College in Queens, as well as Lehman.Nearly half of the people attending colleges this semester are majoring in studies related to social work; nearly half who were enrolled last spring were, typically, older than 35. About 20 percent of all those who have begun college with the program’s help have been women.Ms. White fatally stabbed the man when she was 24, saying in a recent interview, as she had at her trial, that he had been choking her in a struggle after she refused to have sex with him. The jury rejected her justification defense, convicting her of first-degree manslaughter.At Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a women’s prison in Westchester County whose college program was restarted in the late 90’s with private money, Ms. White earned an associate’s degree from Marymount Manhattan College. She had 24 more credits toward a bachelor’s degree when she was paroled two years ago. Despite her college experience, she was in the dark about how to continue college outside prison, she said.“I didn’t know my options,” she said. “In Bedford Hills, they gave me a list, I picked out the classes and I showed up. I didn’t have to fill out anything. I didn’t have to know the requirements for financial aid.”The College Initiative program guided her through the process, and now she attends evening classes at Lehman while working days for Exodus Transitional Community, a group that helps former prisoners reintegrate into society. She hopes to have her bachelor’s degree within two yearsThere were no college programs in the various prisons where Mr. Guillen served his term. Attending Lehman in the evening, he works during the day for Episcopal Social Services, and his job includes returning to prisons — this time to run inmate peer-support groups. Like Ms. White, he sees his future not only in helping prisoners rejoin society, but in deterring young people from crime to begin with. With 96 completed credits, he expects to have his bachelor’s degree in May.When he was paroled in 2002, Mr. Guillen recalled, he had no doubt that he would make a second try at a college education. The College Initiative program, he said, “helped me put my foot in the door.”'"

"'06-10-19,'1','“I support our troops and I voted for the war, but we shouldn’t stay the course, as Mr. Corker wants,” Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., the Democratic candidate for Senate in Tennessee, says in one advertisement.Mr. Ford’s Republican opponent, Bob Corker, is shown against a backdrop of wartime scenes, saying, “We should stay the course,” a phrase that Republicans once described as a rallying cry for the campaign.Taken together, the discussion on the campaign trail suggests just how much of a problem the Iraq war has become for Republicans. It represents a startling contrast with the two national elections beginning in 2002 with the preparation for the Iraq invasion, in which Republicans used the issue to keep Democrats on the run on foreign policy and national security.The development also suggests that what has been a classic strategy of Mr. Bush’s senior adviser, Karl Rove — to turn a weakness into a strength — is not working as well as the White House had hoped.“As the Iraq war gets more unpopular, the environment for Republican candidates erodes,” said Mark Campbell, a Republican strategist who represents several Congressional candidates, including Representative Jim Gerlach of Pennsylvania, who is fighting for re-election in one of the toughest races.“Only in an election year this complicated can Republicans be happy that Mark Foley knocked the Iraq war off the front page,” Mr. Campbell said.A senior strategist familiar with Republican polling who insisted on anonymity to share internal data said that as of midsummer it was clear that “stay the course” was a self-defeating argument.At that point, the strategist said, Republicans started trying to refine their oratory or refocus the debate back to discussing terrorism, where Republicans continue to say they wield the stronger hand and where candidates are running advertisements that Democrats describe as effective.Democrats, seeing similar data in their polls, advised candidates to confront Republicans aggressively, in the view that accusations that Democrats would “cut and run” would not blunt Democrats’ efforts to mock Republicans as wanting to “stay the course.”“For the first time in modern memory, Democrats are actually on the offensive when it comes to national security,” said Matt Bennett, a founder of Third Way, a moderate Democratic organization that has been briefing Democrats on discussing the war and national security. “It is really stunning.”As of this week, party officials said, Democratic candidates in at least 17 of roughly 35 closely contested Congressional seats and at least six of eight Senate races considered close are running television advertisements against the Iraq war, presenting viewpoints that extend to calling for a troop withdrawal.More broadly, Democrats in all parts of the country, in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Mexico are embracing the war issue.“It’s not just the Northeast and the West Coast,” Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said. “It’s places like Virginia and Tennessee. Iraq and foreign policy are to a large extent albatrosses around the Republicans’ neck this year. And they don’t know what to do about it.”Republicans and Democrats said the White House effort to turn the war into an affirmative Republican issue was undercut by the increasing violence there, along with more American deaths that have brought the war home in the form of mournful articles in local newspapers.That complicated the White House effort to present the Iraq war as part of the antiterrorism effort, and it has contributed to support for the war reaching record or near-record lows.In the New York Times/CBS News Poll taken from Oct. 5 to Oct. 8, two-thirds of respondents said they disapproved of Mr. Bush’s handling of the war and 66 percent said the war was going somewhat or very badly.In the poll, 45 percent said Democrats were more likely to make the right decision on Iraq, compared with 34 percent of Republicans.The White House counselor, Dan Bartlett, said Mr. Bush had always emphasized flexibility in tactics to achieve victory in Iraq. Mr. Bartlett said the president’s recent added emphasis on adaptability had been prompted by the violence in Iraq and reactions to it, not because Republicans were on the defensive.“The public sees what’s happening in Iraq, they see the persistent violence, and they want to make sure that we’re adapting,” Mr. Bartlett said.He said the White House and the Republican Party were not about to cede the traditional advantages on national security to Democrats. Mr. Bush, he added, would step up his attacks on their national security credentials at campaign appearances in Pennsylvania and Virginia on behalf of two of the most endangered candidates, Senator George Allen of Virginia and Representative Don Sherwood of Pennsylvania.Mr. Bartlett said Iraq remained a winning issue in the broader context of the war on terrorism, which the party would continue to hit hard.Mr. Bush tried to do that on Wednesday in an interview on ABC News, telling George Stephanopoulos, the interviewer, that when voters go to the polls on Nov. 7 “they’re going to want to know what that person’s going to do, what is the plan for a candidate on Iraq, what do they believe?”When Mr. Stephanopoulos asked Mr. Bush whether the increasing violence in Iraq was similar to the Tet Offensive in 1968, the Vietnam War campaign that is often cited as turning American opinion against the war, Mr. Bush said such a comparison “could be right,” suggesting that terrorists were aiming for a similar result.Mr. Bush’s aides said he would continue to criticize Democrats on the war even if his words were not echoed by Republican candidates the way they were in 2002 and 2004.In this environment, several Republicans said they had given up on trying to win an advantage on the war and would be satisfied in at least wrestling Democrats to a draw on it.“When you lay out arguments in a clear way, you can argue this thing to sort of neutral at worst and, possibly, a slight advantage,” said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist who is advising several candidates this year.Mr. Schriefer said the best case that Republicans could make now was that “we can’t afford to leave until the job is finished.”Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, which has polled extensively on attitudes toward the war, said Pew figures suggested that one hope for Republicans earlier in this campaign — that Democrats would be hurt if they were perceived as criticizing the war without offering a strategy for withdrawal — had not been borne out.“They are not getting punished for not offering an opinion,” Mr. Kohut said. “The Democrats have an advantage on this issue, without having to say much about it.”Republicans and Democrats said they could not name any examples of Republicans’ trying to use the war as a campaign issue.But examples of the war being used by Democrats were abundant this week. In a debate in New Jersey, Thomas H. Kean Jr., the Republican challenger to Senator Robert Menendez, was repeatedly asked — 27 times, according to a statement put out by Senate Democrats — whether he would have voted for the resolution authorizing the Iraq war.In Florida on Wednesday, Ron Klein, the Democratic challenger to Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., an embattled Republican, attacked Mr. Shaw with an advertisement that said the congressman “even refuses to question Bush’s handling of the war in Iraq.”And in Rhode Island, Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat who is making a strong challenge to Senator Lincoln Chafee, one of the six most-endangered Republicans, began running an advertisement urging the dismissal of Mr. Rumsfeld.“Chafee refuses to call for his firing,” the commercial said.'"
"'06-10-19,'1','As American soldiers continued intensive patrols of Baghdad neighborhoods to try to stop the capital from slipping out of control, the military announced on Wednesday that 11 service members had died Tuesday, making it one of the deadliest days for the American military since the start of the war. The death on Wednesday of another American brought October’s total to at least 70, putting this month on track to be the third deadliest of the conflict.Two news conferences in Najaf, one attended by Mr. Maliki and Mr. Sadr, and one attended by Mr. Maliki alone, produced no concrete agreements that might herald a truce by the Mahdi Army.While Mr. Maliki cited “positive results” from his talks with Ayatollah Sistani and with Mr. Sadr, he offered no details. He said only that he had met with Ayatollah Sistani “so that that the security and political situation can be stabilized, and allow the government to turn its attention to reconstruction.”“We are in a difficult security situation,” Mr. Maliki said. “All the political and religious figures in the country are talking about safeguarding our citizens and our homeland, stopping the bloodshed, and rebuilding the country. Everybody is waiting impatiently for these things.”In his comments, Mr. Sadr, who rarely appears in public, restricted himself mainly to the broad disavowal of sectarian killings that he has made in the past, even as evidence has mounted of the Mahdi Army’s involvement in death-squad killings in Baghdad and elsewhere.“I speak out now to condemn sectarianism of all kinds, including kidnapping and sectarian killing,” he said. “I call for the unity of all Iraqis, and Sunnis and Shiites to join together to rebuild Iraq and rescue the country from the seas of blood that are spilled every day.”But the cleric, a volatile figure whose power rests on his command of thousands of militiamen and a political faction that provides a critical margin of support to the Maliki government in Parliament, rejected American demands for an early breakup of the militias, which have thrown the country into chaos.“Only the Iraqi government has the right to act in these matters,” he said. “No one else has any right to intervene, neither the Americans nor any other country.”For the Americans, the public pronouncements by the two leaders may have been of less weight than the fact that Ayatollah Sistani had stepped into the crisis for the first time after months of apparent disengagement from Iraq’s volatile politics. Always careful not to thrust himself directly into political disputes, he has wielded an immense but shadowy power from the cloistered precincts of his home in Najaf.More than once, the aging, infirm ayatollah has proved himself capable of pulling fractious Shiite political groups together when their rival ambitions have threatened to fragment Shiite political power.In August 2004, at the height of the second uprising that year that Mr. Sadr led against American forces, he flew back to Iraq from a hospital bed in London and within a matter of hours forged an agreement that won Mr. Sadr’s agreement to withdraw his fighters from Najaf’s Golden Mosque in return for American agreement not to storm the shrine and to allow Mr. Sadr to slip out of the city unharmed.For Mr. Maliki, the talks in Najaf had the air of an almost desperate move to defuse tensions over the militias, which have angered the Bush administration.The tensions reached a new point on Monday when Mr. Maliki, who took office in May, used a telephone call with President Bush to seek assurances that the United States did not intend to oust him. The White House said after the call that Mr. Bush had given the Iraqi leader a pledge of his full support.But barely a day later, Mr. Maliki pressed the American military to free Mr. Sadr’s aide. American spokesmen said they were under orders to make no official comment on the release, but their remarks to reporters left no doubt that patience with Mr. Maliki, at least among commanders, was wearing thin.American officers said the raid in which they arrested the cleric, Sheik Mazin al-Saidy, was carried out on the basis of intelligence that suggested that he had led a Mahdi Army unit involved in death-squad killings and assassinations.Iraq’s national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, declined to comment on the negotiations that led to the sheik’s release, but said the request, made by the prime minister himself, was part of a broader strategy to deal with Mr. Sadr politically.“We believe there is room for political engagement with Moktada, and anything which would disrupt this political engagement will not be very constructive,” Mr. Rubaie said.One factor that may have weighed into the American decision to release the cleric may have been the desire not to allow the incident to torpedo Mr. Maliki’s hopes of persuading Mr. Sadr to restrain his militias and thus avoid the showdown with the Americans that some American commanders have said is inevitable if the Mahdi Army is not disarmed.American determination to uproot all militias, whether Sunni or Shiite, is central to hopes of quelling the wave of sectarian violence that has led to record levels of civilian casualties in recent months, and to heading off the threat of civil war.A fresh demonstration of the militias’ potential for destabilizing wide parts of the country came last weekend, when Shiite militiamen went on a killing rampage in and around the town of Balad, murdering 38 Sunnis in reprisal for the beheading by Sunni extremists of 19 Shiite workers.Residents in the area said that some of the Shiite killers belonged to the Mahdi Army and had been dispatched from their stronghold in Shuala, where Sheik Saidy had been captured Tuesday.The fighting subsided with the arrival of American and Iraqi troops on Sunday, though sporadic killings continued, with more than 60 people dying in four days, the American military said. A fact-finding commission of political and community leaders met Wednesday in Balad to investigate the killings.The spike in American deaths comes at a sensitive moment in American politics, only a few weeks before midterm elections. Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, said the sudden surge in troop deaths would not compel President Bush to alter his military plan in Iraq.“No, his strategy is to win,” Mr. Snow said in Washington. “The president understands not only the difficulty of it, but he grieves for the people who have served with valor. But as everybody says correctly, we’ve got to win. And that comes at a cost.”Ten of the 11 service members who died Tuesday were killed in enemy attacks, including bombings and shootings. The 11th died of “non-hostile” causes, military officials said.Six of the deaths on Tuesday occurred in or near Baghdad.One soldier was shot while on patrol in northern Baghdad; another died when a bomb exploded next to his vehicle just north of Baghdad; and four soldiers were killed when a bomb exploded near their vehicle west of Baghdad, the military said.Three soldiers were killed while on a combat mission in Diyala Province, north of Baghdad, the military said, and a marine died Tuesday from wounds sustained during combat in Anbar Province.An American soldier died Wednesday south of Baghdad when his patrol was attacked by small-arms fire, the military said.The two deadliest months for American forces since the beginning of the war have been associated with major offensives.About 137 American troops died in November 2004, the same month as the second siege of Falluja, where the Americans battled Sunni Arab rebels. In April 2004, a bloody month that saw the first siege of Falluja and pitched battles between the Americans and Mr. Sadr’s militia in Najaf, 135 American troops died.The military has not conducted any major operations this month.'"
"'06-10-19,'1','In interviews this month about the elections, the overriding concern here was, in fact, the war in Iraq. But many residents said they were not seeking dramatic change.In the big races here, polls show commanding leads for the incumbents: Gov. Bob Riley, a Republican, and Representative Bud Cramer, a conservative Democrat who is running uncontested. Statewide, of the four Republican members of Congress in contested races, none faces serious challenge. Alabama’s seats in the Senate, both held by Republicans, are not up for election until 2008 and 2010. The close races here are for lieutenant governor, attorney general and secretary of state.Even so, the concerns expressed in interviews were less on local affairs than national ones.While many here have friends or relatives serving in Iraq, the town has also benefited from military contracts, which lead to high salaries, low unemployment and rising real estate values.“As much as people hate to say it, when the country is at war, it makes our area more productive and creates jobs,” said Bob Wagner, 52, an engineer for a military contractor who also serves on the City Council.This year alone, new or expanding companies have brought 3,000 jobs and $175 million in investment to the area. A 3,800-acre research park abutting the Redstone Arsenal Army base is the second largest in the country.In the last midterm election, Mr. Wagner, a registered Republican and former marine, said his greatest concern was to “make sure America stood up to our enemies.” He added, “When 9/11 hit I was all gung-ho to go to Afghanistan.” On Iraq, he said he trusted the administration to pick the best course.“I think there will be a time to move the troops out,” Mr. Wagner said, “and I expect our leaders to have that information and act on it.”In addition to the war, he said another concern was property taxes: he does not think they are high enough.With the community’s rapid growth, Mr. Wagner said, “I’m worried about how we bring more money into the area” for schools, roads and other infrastructure.Northern Alabama, which benefited from New Deal programs in the 1930’s like the Tennessee Valley Authority, was once largely Democratic but now regularly splits the ticket, voting for Republican presidential candidates since 1980 while sending conservative Democrats to Congress. Madison’s churches, including large Baptist and United Methodist congregations, are thriving but not very politically active.“Dissatisfaction with the war came late to Alabama,” said David J. Lanoue, chairman of the political science department at the University of Alabama. “Instead of the president’s approval declining to 35 percent, it declined to 50 percent or slightly above.”Dr. Lanoue added that the state Democratic Party had been weakened by years of defeat, and was hindered by district lines that favor incumbents. Republican candidates also benefit from the coattails of Governor Riley, he said.Still, some residents of Madison, often those who have relatives in the military, say the Iraq war is changing their minds about a lot of things.Helen Lee, 55, twice voted for President Bush, but now said he lacked the right experience to send troops to war. Like many residents, she comes from a family of servicemen, including her father, grandfather and husband; her son is on inactive status in the Marine Corps while he attends college.Mrs. Lee is a registered Independent who says she votes mostly Republican. In the last midterm elections, in 2002, the Sept. 11 attacks were fresh in her mind, she said, and her biggest concern was for national safety. Now, Mrs. Lee said she had lost confidence in Mr. Bush.“Bush is not listening to his active-duty military people,” she said. “Bush and his advisers never served. You don’t go in and ‘take somebody out.’ He’s ignoring history, including centuries of hatred.”Aaron Beale, 26, a marine corporal on inactive reserve, is also impatient about Iraq. Mr. Beale said that four years ago he supported Mr. Bush and the plans for war, but his feelings have changed. Though he agreed with the push to remove Saddam Hussein, he said: “The war has gone on so long because we don’t have enough troops. I’ve had friends killed because we’re doing patrol missions with our hands tied. We can’t defend ourselves.”In the coming election, Mr. Beale said that he wanted Democrats to win majorities in Congress, but that he was not tied to either party. “I used to be closer to the Democrats,” he said, “but now it doesn’t matter to me, as long as we get someone who knows what he’s doing.”While he waits to be redeployed, Mr. Beale, too, is benefiting from the booming local economy: he is working as a personal trainer, largely for the successful military contractors and their families. “It’s all a Catch-22,” he said.In a bungalow in Madison’s historic district, Michael Murch, 39, an engineer who works on missile simulation, said that he was most concerned about terrorism and Iraq, but that people should have expected the war to go on this long. “A lot of people choose not to accept that,” Mr. Murch said. In the long run, he said he expected the war to reduce the threat of terrorism, even if it meant higher risk along the way.Like some others, Mr. Murch said he felt sheltered in Madison, but that in the last four years he had become more concerned about some national issues, including same-sex marriage — which he described as “an irritation” rather than a voting issue — and illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants have become “integral to the economy, but they’re starting to strain some parts of the country,” he said. “You can’t round them up and throw them out. We can’t live without them. But I’d like to stop the flow. That would be a voting issue.”Mr. Murch said the war had hurt some parts of the local economy, because financing for some research and development projects had gone to buying military equipment. But over all, he said that he thought the economy was strong and that he was planning an addition to double the size of his house. “It feels good to me because I’m not having some of the problems that they have in the rest of the state,” he said. Even if engineers in Madison get caught in budget shifts, he added, “There’s an abundance of jobs.”'"
"'06-10-19,'1','The mayor’s statement, which was read to Bloomberg employees by Peter T. Grauer, the chairman of the company, came amid rumors that the company might soon be sold to free up Mr. Bloomberg’s vast personal wealth for philanthropic causes.It also came amid speculation — repeatedly denied by the mayor — that he would consider running for president in 2008, a bid that might seem more plausible if he severed all his personal ties to a company he controls.The mayor had previously seemed to invite speculation that he would sell his stake in the company.“I will not go back to the company,” The New York Post quoted him as saying in November 2004. “What I would like to do is eventually I will sell because if I don’t my estate will have to, and I want to run a foundation.”In the statement read to employees yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg, 64, reiterated his intention to devote himself to philanthropy, but suggested that he could give generously while holding onto his stake in Bloomberg L.P.“Although there will come a day (I hope later rather than sooner) when I or my estate will have to sell, I have complete confidence that the best days of the company still lie ahead,” he wrote.His statement to company employees was the talk of political circles.“He can have the company and still run,” said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who said of the statement, “I don’t read it either way. If he decides he wants to run, the point of his strategy should be to announce, ‘I don’t expect to win. It doesn’t make any difference if I don’t win. I am going to use this opportunity to educate the public and tell you what you should be receiving from the president.’ ”Stu Loeser, Mr. Bloomberg’s chief spokesman at City Hall, said yesterday that the mayor “has said he is not running for president, and his next career will be in philanthropy.” He declined to comment on the mayor’s personal finances.Mr. Bloomberg has said repeatedly that he intends to devote his life to philanthropy after leaving office as mayor in 2009, and has suggested that selling his stake in Bloomberg would be part of that transition. His stake is expected to be worth at least $6 billion.Since running for his first term as mayor in 2001, Mr. Bloomberg has given up management responsibility of Bloomberg L.P., which has 9,000 employees.The company was founded in 1981 after Mr. Bloomberg left Salomon Brothers, where he had been chief of information systems. Using his partnership proceeds, he designed a system of dedicated computer terminals that delivered financial data to bond traders. Nine years later, the company was leasing 10,000 of these terminals each year for about $1,200 each.By the late 1990’s, Bloomberg had eclipsed more established competitors like Telerate, and its boxes had become nearly omnipresent on Wall Street. The service grew to include news as well as data and also incorporated a system for sending messages to other Bloomberg users.Although the Internet is changing the way financial information is spread and used, Bloomberg continues to claim a large portion of the $10-billion-plus market for financial data. In June, David Anderson, editor of the trade publication Inside Market Data Reference, estimated that Bloomberg had a 31 percent market share, compared with 23 percent for its rival Reuters, which bought the Telerate service last year. Bloomberg L.P. also operates the Bloomberg news service.Ms. Czelusniak said the company continued to grow, and that its sales and employment had increased this year.'"
"'06-10-19,'1','When you add up the energy resources of the American West, one of the biggest items in the ledger is oil shale — rock formations containing deposits that can be distilled, by heating, into oil. The estimate of the petroleum locked up in these deposits is enormous: perhaps 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil, most of it in the Green River Formation, which lies beneath Colorado, Wyoming and Utah.The processes for extracting oil shale are still hugely expensive — which is fortunate, because the potential environmental costs are staggering. You can pump oil from oil shale by heating the underground formations, with untold effect on groundwater. Or you can dig it all up, cart it away and heat it somewhere else, scarring vast tracts of the West.None of this has stopped Congressman Richard Pombo of California — champion of the idea that we can drill our way to energy independence — from throwing yet another economic bone to the energy sector. In a little-noticed provision of the much- reviled Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act — which the House passed in June and the Senate will take up when Congress returns — Mr. Pombo lowered the royalty rate for oil shale from 12.5 percent to 1 percent. Should the day arrive when the price of shale oil becomes competitive, this could turn out to be an extraordinary giveaway of federal revenue (most oil shale lies under federal land) and a huge incentive to wreak environmental damage.None of this is surprising. Mr. Pombo, who is chairman of the House Resources Committee and is facing a tight race for re-election, has been well- financed by oil and gas producers. He has done his best to give away public resources and throw away prudent restraints on energy exploration.We believe that this country must pursue energy independence. But unlike Mr. Pombo, we believe that there is a vibrant new economy to be found in conservation and that is where our future lies. When we try to envision the America that Mr. Pombo has mapped out for us, all we can see is a nation committed to devouring itself, one barrel of oil at a time.'"
"'06-10-19,'1','Macintosh sales accounted for 58 percent of revenue in the quarter, spurred in part by the new school season’s huge demand for notebook computers, the company said. In September, Apple expanded its line of Macs and completed a transition to Intel-based microprocessors.In a conference call with analysts, the chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, spoke of “the best Mac shipments by far in any quarter in Apple’s history.”The company said it shipped 1.6 million Macintosh computers, up 30 percent from a year earlier. Revenue from desktop and portable Macs increased 37 percent, to $2.2 billion.Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, said: “This strong quarter caps an extraordinary year for Apple. Selling more than 39 million iPods and 5.3 million Macs while performing an incredibly complex architecture transition is something we are all very proud of.”An analyst at Piper Jaffray, Eugene A. Munster, seemed to agree. “It’s an impressive quarter,” he said. “They blew away even the highest expectations on the Mac side.”Mr. Munster said the strong sales of Macs proved the validity of the iPod’s “halo effect,” meaning that iPod customers are increasingly first-time Macintosh customers.Apple added 10 retail stores during the quarter, for a total of 165, and has begun pilot programs to sell Apple products in Best Buy stores.According to the market research company IDC, Apple’s share of the United States computer market grew to 5.8 percent from 4.3 percent in the quarter the year before. Revenue from music products, including the iPod and the iTunes music service, was more than $2 billion in the quarter, up from $1.48 billion a year earlier.The company sold 8.7 million iPods in the quarter, for $1.56 billion in revenue, an increase from 6.5 million iPods and $1.21 billion in revenue a year earlier.This quarter, Mr. Oppenheimer said, Apple is forecasting revenue of $6 billion to $6.2 billion and earnings of 70 cents to 73 cents a share.But it faces considerable challenges related to its mishandling of stock-option grants, and it is unclear how many quarters will have to be restated. In June, the board began looking into options practices, joining more than 100 other companies, including many in technology industries, that are investigating the backdating of stock options to inflate their value.Apple said that it had found 15 instances of improperly backdated options, and that it had “serious concerns” about two former executives, whom it declined to name.Earlier this month, the board said Mr. Jobs knew of some instances of options backdating, but did not benefit from those grants. Fred D. Anderson, a board member, resigned recently after a special committee of directors disclosed that it had found irregularities with stock-option grants made between 1997 and 2002, a period when he served as chief financial officer. At the same time, the committee cleared all current employees of any impropriety.“The investigation found no misconduct by any member of Apple’s current management team, and that includes Steve,” Mr. Oppenheimer said Wednesday.In regular trading, before the report was released, Apple’s shares rose 24 cents, to $74.53.'"
"'06-10-19,'1','Turkey questioned the competence of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s security staff after it rushed him unconscious to a hospital in Ankara on Tuesday after a drop in his blood sugar level and accidentally locked him in his car. As they arrived at the hospital, Mr. Erdogan’s driver and bodyguards jumped out of the car and slammed the doors, activating the automatic lock system, with the car key left in the ignition. As the prime minister lay unconscious inside, they reportedly struggled for about 10 minutes to break the thick window of the armored car, aided by workers at a nearby construction site who brought a sledgehammer and a chisel. The newspaper Hurriyet called it “a security scandal,” while another paper, Sabah, asked, “What if the prime minister was having a heart attack?” Mr. Erdogan, 52, above, was treated for about nine hours and discharged. Doctors said he had had a drop in blood sugar, caused by exhaustion and fasting for Ramadan.'"
"'06-10-19,'1','Senegal has increased the price of electricity by 15 percent, infuriating consumers already angry with President Abdoulaye Wade’s government after months of chronic power cuts. Regular blackouts, lasting days in some areas, have disrupted the economy and fueled public anger against Mr. Wade’s government. The power cuts are largely due to problems purchasing increasingly expensive fuel to run oil-fired generating plants. Residents deprived of fans and refrigerators during the hottest part of the year, when daily temperatures rise above 90 degrees, were shocked by an unannounced price increase on their latest electricity bills. “I thought it was a mistake,” said Tidiane Tairou, who runs a small hairdressing boutique equipped with two electric razors. “Sometimes they cut from morning to night, and at the end of the month you still get a bill even though you haven’t been able to work.”'"
"'06-10-19,'1','TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Oct. 18 — A judge on Wednesday barred election supervisors from posting signs in polling places explaining that votes cast for former Representative Mark Foley would go to the substitute candidate.The judge, Janet E. Ferris of Circuit Court in Leon County, issued her decision days before voters can begin casting ballots under the early voting system of Florida.Judge Ferris, ruling on a complaint by the Florida Democratic Party, said the Legislature had not authorized such postings in its law on replacement candidates. The law requires the original candidate’s name to be the ballot if the change is made after the primary results have been certified.“The court is not at liberty to question the Legislature’s decision or its judgment in enacting the statute,” the judge wrote. “And there can be little doubt that it understood the confusion likely to result where voters know that the person reflected on the ballot is no longer seeking the position.”Interpreting the statute “as permitting the proposed intrusion into the polling place,” the judge added, would be “an extrapolation far beyond the Legislature’s words.”'"
"'06-10-19,'1','Verizon Communications, the telecommunications company, said yesterday that its board had approved the spinoff of its print and online directories business to stockholders as a new public company named Idearc Inc.Though the directories business is very profitable, Verizon has decided to focus on its fast-growing cellular operation and on rewiring its traditional phone network with fiber optic lines that can deliver cable TV and far faster Internet connections — an initiative that will cost tens of billions of dollars.The spinoff decision comes nearly a year after Verizon first disclosed it was considering a sale of the directories business or a distribution of shares in it to its shareholders.One share of Idearc (pronounced EYE-dee-ark) will be distributed as a dividend for every 20 shares of Verizon stock held by an investor on Nov. 1. The distribution is scheduled to occur Nov. 17 and is expected to qualify as a tax-free transaction for shareholders. A proportional, taxable cash distribution will be paid to investors with fewer than 20 shares or holdings not divisible by 20.Idearc, which had revenue of $3.15 billion in 2005, would be based in Dallas and employ about 7,100 people. The operation prints 1,200 yellow or white page phone books with a total circulation of 116 million copies, including 1,100 Verizon-branded directories. The company says its online directory and search arm, SuperPages.com, has been queried for listings more than two billion times in 2006.It was not immediately clear what price Idearc’s shares might fetch on the market.'"
"'06-10-19,'1','The AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, reported third-quarter net income of $15 million yesterday as it raised fares and benefited from a decline in jet fuel prices.Earnings of 6 cents a share contrasted with a net loss a year earlier of $153 million, or 93 cents, the company said. Excluding a cost to reduce the value of fuel hedges, profit was 45 cents, exceeding analysts’ 42-cent average estimate.It was the first time since 2000 that the company, the world’s largest airline, had reported consecutive quarterly profits. Results were aided by nine first-half price increases that increased the average fare per mile 7 percent in the third quarter. Sales rose 6.6 percent, to $5.85 billion.“This could set the stage for the fourth quarter, with lower fuel costs and the industry doing a bit better than projected right now,” said Raymond Neidl, a Calyon Securities analyst who is based in New York. Mr. Neidl has an add rating on AMR stock.Shares of AMR, which is based in Fort Worth, rose $1.80, or almost 7.5, to close at $25.90. The stock has more than doubled in the last year.“The outlook for the fourth quarter is for continued strong traffic and a very busy holiday season, which is obviously good news,” the airline’s chief executive, Gerard J. Arpey, said in a letter to employees yesterday. “We have a shot at our first annual profit in over five years.”'"
"'06-10-19,'1','For the 53 million Americans that receive Social Security checks, that will raise the average monthly payment by $33, the Social Security Administration said.While overall consumer prices fell last month by 0.5 percent, the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.2 percent. It was the third consecutive month that the core index grew by 0.2 percent and an indication to many economists that underlying inflation may be peaking.With core prices up 2.9 percent compared with last September, well above the 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent level that central bankers consider ideal, the economists cautioned that it is still not clear whether the Fed will have more tightening to do next year.“The fundamentals for inflation still look mildly unfriendly,” said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. “When people talk about inflation turning, they’re forgetting about the lags. Inflation doesn’t turn with the economy. It usually takes a couple of quarters.”As the economy continues to slow, the Federal Reserve’s forecast is that inflation will slow as well. The central bank has said that slower growth, led by a decline in the housing market, will help pull inflation back down to tolerable levels.Indeed, a report from the Commerce Department showed yesterday that building permits fell by 6.3 percent in September, to the lowest rate since October 2001.The number of housing starts last month increased 5.9 percent.The rise in new home construction did surprise economists, but it is not likely to foreshadow any immediate bounce-back in residential construction. Construction activity is often volatile for a number of reasons, particularly the weather.Building permits, therefore, are considered to be a better barometer of the strength of the housing industry because they measure how much demand builders are expecting.“Even a cursory glance at the awful permits numbers should disabuse all but the most incurable optimists” of the notion that the new housing market will improve soon, Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist with High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research report.In another sign that investors do not believe the Fed will raise rates any further, interest rates on long-term bonds fell yesterday for the third consecutive day. And that view was echoed by several Wall Street analysts.“The surge in core inflation is abating,” a team of economists from Goldman Sachs wrote in a research report.As long as future inflation readings do not look any worse than yesterday’s report, and economic growth continues to slow at a moderate pace, the Fed can afford to wait for the effects of two years of interest rate increases to take hold.Most economists believe that when the Fed gathers next week, it will leave interest rates untouched for the third time in a row.“From the Fed’s point of view, slower growth opens up a little bit of a gap,” said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist with PNC Financial.The Labor Department report showed that on a seasonally adjusted basis, consumer prices rose at slower rates in September on a number of goods and services like clothing, food and household furnishings.The price of transportation, including gasoline and vehicle purchases, was the only major category of the price index that actually declined in September.High rental costs kept the core price index elevated in September. Compared with September a year ago, housing prices, which are tied to a measure of rents rather than what homes are actually selling for, rose 4.1 percent, faster than any other component of the index except medical care.In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the average weekly earnings for ordinary workers, adjusted for inflation, rose by 1 percent in September. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent.'"
"'06-10-19,'1','After almost every member of the C.I.A. strike force of 1,500 exiles was killed or imprisoned, Mr. Quintero went on the run inside Cuba. He and his allies were in shock, he said at a 1996 conference of Bay of Pigs veterans, recorded in the book “Politics of Illusion: The Bay of Pigs Invasion Reexamined.”“We thought the Americans worked the way John Wayne worked in his movies,” Mr. Quintero said. “The Americans hated communism and, like John Wayne, they never lost — ever.” But he said 9 of every 10 Cubans decided to go with the winner after the Bay of Pigs.He made his way out of Cuba and wound up in Washington. He worked closely with Attorney General Kennedy on the anti-Castro movement.“Kennedy was obsessed,” he said at the 1996 conference, “that the Kennedy family had lost a big battle against a guy like Castro. He really wanted to get even with him.”Mr. Quintero continued working on operations against Mr. Castro, including assassination plots, according to declassified government documents. After President John F. Kennedy was killed in 1963, direct American support for most anti-Castro operations began to die down.By 1965, the White House had turned off the missions aimed at killing Mr. Castro. What Mr. Quintero did for the next decade is still secret. In 1977, he reported to the C.I.A. that one of its former officers had offered him $1 million to kill a Libyan dissident in Egypt.During the Reagan administration, as he testified at Colonel North’s criminal trial, Mr. Quintero was being paid $4,000 a month to make sure clandestine arms shipments got to the contras, the American-backed forces trying to overthrow Nicaragua, despite a Congressional ban on direct American support for them.Rafael Quintero Ibarbia, whose friends called him Chi Chi, was born in Camagüey, in the center of Cuba, on Sept. 16, 1940. His friends remember him as a short, smart man with a sharp, bitter sense of humor. His survivors include his wife, Dolores, and their children Alejandro, Marie and Rafael.As a teenager in the 1950’s, Mr. Quintero joined the underground resistance against Fulgencio Batista, the corrupt right-wing dictator of Cuba. After Mr. Castro’s rebels won power in January 1959, Mr. Quintero said, he was expelled from the vanguard of the revolution for refusing to join the Communist Party. He joined the anti-Castro Movement to Recover the Revolution and became part of the C.I.A.’s grand scheme to overthrow his government.The agency had assumed that the invasion would lead to an uprising. Few Americans understood that “there was a resistance long before the United States government decided to overthrow Fidel Castro,” Mr. Quintero reflected. “The resistance came first and then later the United States destroyed it.”'"
"'06-10-19,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 18 (Reuters) — Advanced Micro Devices, which makes computer processors, posted a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, but profit margins fell sharply, hurt by a price war with Intel.Advanced Micro said it expected fourth-quarter sales to rise from the previous quarter but did not elaborate. Wall Street had forecast fourth-quarter sales of $1.44 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.For the third quarter, Advanced Micro said net profit was $134.5 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $76 million, or 18 cents a share, a year ago. Advanced Micro was expected to have earned $116 million, or 23 cents a share, according to the average forecast of Wall Street analysts by Reuters Estimates.Gross margin fell to 51.4 percent, from 56.8 percent in the previous quarter. The company did not explain the sharp drop, but analysts said it probably resulted from the price war with Intel and a buildup of chips for Dell Inc., the PC maker, which Advanced Micro landed as a customer earlier this year.Advanced Micro shares rose initially in after-hours trading after the results were released, but then shed 12.3 percent, to $21.24. Shares closed at $24.23 in regular trading.'"
"'06-10-19,'1','•Advertisers want agencies “where the principals are connected to the business, where bureaucracy and big-agency folderol don’t distance key people from the decision-making,” said Mr. Jeary, who is president and chief executive at Partners & Jeary in New York.Advertisers are also seeking agencies that can provide them services in which independent, entrepreneurial agencies often specialize — services that go beyond the realm of traditional advertising like television commercials, Mr. Jeary said.Among those tasks, Mr. Jeary listed customer relationship marketing, which is aimed at persuading loyal consumers to keep buying brands they already like, and at creating campaigns centered on corporate social responsibility to burnish images as well as sell products.Mr. Jeary, who is 58, opened his agency recently after spending nine years as president at Della Femina Rothschild Jeary & Partners, also in New York. He knew Ms. Napier, chief executive at Partners & Napier in Rochester, “through the business,” he said, such as working together on committees for the American Association of Advertising Agencies.Ms. Napier, 47, whose agency also has an office in Atlanta, introduced Mr. Jeary to Mr. Edell, president and chief executive at Partners & Edell in Toronto. Mr. Edell and Ms. Napier knew each other because they had both led offices of Wolf Group Integrated Communications, a Canadian agency company that closed in 2004.Ms. Napier and other managers of the Wolf Rochester office bought it back to form Partners & Napier. Mr. Edell left the Wolf Toronto office in 2002 to open his own agency, which also operates an agency in Montreal, Cartier Edell, as a joint venture with a Quebec agency, Cartier Communication Marketing.“Sharon and I have been talking a lot about expanding, the future of our agencies, how we can work together,” said Mr. Edell, who is 57. “This is a great way to organize for growth.”Allying agencies in a network is no guarantee of effectiveness, Mr. Edell acknowledged. He recalled how one he belonged to existed solely, it seemed, to “go down to Florida in November to play golf, talk about what was bothering us and have a little awards dinner.”“We’d all get awards,” he said, laughing.Ms. Napier traced the genesis of the Partners Group to discussions that began a year and a half ago.“A structure like this can create deeper relationships by staying closer to the client,” Ms. Napier said, and perhaps contribute to reducing the account turnover that bedevils the agency industry.The agencies in the Partners Group will share resources in areas like accounting and media services. They will also offer their specialty services across the client rosters of all the member agencies. For instance, marketers interested in interactive advertising will be directed to Partners & Napier, while Partners & Edell will create corporate social responsibility campaigns.•Partners & Edell has 14 employees and clients like Ontario Power Generation; Puretracks, a Canadian music download service that is expanding into the United States; and the Scotia Capital unit of Scotiabank. Partners & Napier has more than 100 employees and clients like Bausch & Lomb, Constellation Wines and Eastman Kodak.Partners & Jeary has eight employees and clients like the Lung Cancer Alliance and OOH Vision Networks, which operates digital advertising signs in places like Subway restaurants.The executive named to succeed Mr. Jeary as president at Della Femina Rothschild Jeary & Partners was Jim Tenny, 52, a partner who has overseen business development and worked with Jerry Della Femina, the chairman of the agency, for more than a decade.Mr. Della Femina said he was considering replacing Mr. Jeary’s name on the agency with Mr. Tenny’s because “when you have your name on the door, you get all the calls.”Mr. Della Femina ought to know. For the last four decades, he has owned or led a skein of agencies that have borne his surname (examples include Della Femina, Travisano & Partners and his current shop) or his given name (Jerry & Ketchum).'"
"'06-10-19,'1','As shrinking transistor sizes make it possible for designers to put multiple processors on a single chip, and computing functions are increasingly hidden in consumer devices, Microsoft faces new challenges and opportunities.In recent years, the computing model centered on the desktop PC has increasingly given way to new, more specialized markets like video games and cellphones. As Microsoft has moved to enter these markets, it has increasingly designed hardware, software and packaging that are made by independent contractors but marketed under the Microsoft or Windows brand.At the same time, new coalitions have emerged, like Apple’s decision to use Intel microprocessors, or Microsoft’s switch two years ago from Intel chips to PowerPC microprocessors designed and manufactured by I.B.M. in its Xbox system.The explosion of chips with an increasing number of “cores,” or multiple processors, is bringing parallel computing — the ability to divide tasks for faster processing — into the consumer electronics market. That could give companies like Microsoft a competitive advantage by controlling both hardware and software and the way they interact.“This is a historic time in the computer industry,” said David A. Patterson, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. “We’re in the middle of a revolutionary change toward parallel computing that will absolutely involve both hardware and software.”Mr. Thacker, 63, has been at the forefront of technology advances in the past, having been part of the group at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center that designed the Alto, the first modern personal computer, and the Ethernet office network during the 1970’s.He said computer designers were increasingly able to do on a single chip what previously took an entire computing system.“There is a wheel of reincarnation” in the industry, he said.After working at Xerox, Mr. Thacker joined a Digital Equipment Corporation research laboratory where he led the design of an experimental computer called Firefly, a model for some ideas just now being commercialized in single-chip designs.He joined Microsoft in 1999 to help design the tablet computer based on ideas he had helped pioneer at Xerox in the 1970’s in the form of an experimental notebook computer called the Dynabook. Several companies now make commercial products based on that design, and Mr. Thacker said Microsoft was working on a smaller education-oriented version that was not yet public.More recently he has moved back and forth between research and the product development side of the company, as his expertise is needed. Several years ago he did a stint working on the current Microsoft game console, Xbox 360, when a key engineer on the project became ill.In the chip design effort, another longtime Microsoft researcher, Rich P. Draves, who has worked in various areas including networking and security, will head the Redmond group.Whether and how the project might affect Microsoft’s continuing relationship with Intel is not clear.Mr. Thacker acknowledged that despite vast increases in computer power, ease of use still confounded computer designers.“It’s pretty hard for a geek to internalize the experience of an ordinary user,” he said, noting that his wife still avoids computers.Progress will be made there, too, he insisted.“Like everything that Microsoft gets into, we’re in it for the long run,” he said.'"
"'06-10-19,'1','The smartphone era is giving rise to a gaggle of new phones that promise everything from picture sharing to e-mail and messaging. A new entry is the T-Mobile Dash, a phone slim enough to slip into a vest pocket or evening purse but powerful enough to put in a full day’s work.Clad in rubberized metal, the diminutive Dash is less than a half-inch thick, with a full keyboard. It is compatible with most e-mail services and includes an instant-messaging application for the AOL, Yahoo and MSN systems.The Dash is a quad-band G.S.M. phone with added Wi-Fi, which means you can surf the Web and get e-mail even when you don’t have a cellular signal. You can take and send 1.3-megapixel pictures with its embedded camera, and it runs Windows Mobile 5.0, so it can open Word and Excel documents.Its price, $199 with a two-year contract or $349 with a one-year contract, puts the Dash on par with other midrange phones. T-Mobile subscribers can add a $29.99 monthly data plan for unlimited surfing at T-Mobile Wi-Fi hot spots. JOHN BIGGS'"
"'06-10-19,'1','With sardonic humor, a cool jazz score and engaging 3-D graphics, Culture Shock has even more style and wit than the original game. Unfortunately, the fun ends far too soon. This is not a full game but simply the first of six chapters, and you can finish the whole thing in four or five hours.On the upside, Telltale is promising to release a new episode every month from December through April. The handful of previous episodic adventure game series have doled out episodes slowly, and it is exciting to anticipate a short burst of Sam & Max wackiness every month.The monthly releases are part of a deal with GameTap, a video game subscription service that lets players choose from a library of 700 games spanning the history of video games. GameTap’s first foray into original game content is as co-producer of the Sam & Max games. While you can simply buy each game separately, subscribing also gives players the chance to watch episodes of the hilarious, short-lived Sam & Max animated television series, which GameTap includes in their animation section.Culture Shock is great because it beautifully recreates the feel of the first game. This was not an option open to Lexis Numérique when it set out to make a sequel to its puzzle game Missing: Since January. The original game could best be described as a fascinating mess. Fortunately, Evidence: The Last Ritual has improved on the formula.As in Missing, the conceit of Evidence is that a serial killer who calls himself The Phoenix has created a CD-ROM disk containing intricate puzzles. Solving the puzzles could save the life of a kidnapped woman. These puzzles often involve finding names or locations, and the player must frequently leave the game to search for this information on the Internet, entering The Phoenix’s taunting clues into a search engine like Google, looking up historical figures on Wikipedia or seeking out locations with MapQuest.The game is patterned after Alternate Reality Games, free online games that also use Web sites and e-mail to blur the line between game and reality, but the experience is more structured in Evidence. (A guide to current Alternative Reality Games can be found at unfiction.com.)Each puzzle setting is a bizarre collage where you can affect certain elements with the mouse. The creepiest puzzles are those that involve the kidnapped woman. In one you see her with her eyes closed, perfectly still. Click on her face and she begins to cry.It is disturbing to realize that The Phoenix actually filmed her in various poses for his puzzles and then made you complicit in her torture by forcing you to manipulate those images. These puzzles are the most haunting in the game, but for the most part the player is simply asked to manipulate floating letters or video clips.You are helped in your puzzle-solving by a handful of correspondents who will send you e-mail advice. You are also given tools throughout the game that allow you to analyze images and break codes.Many of the puzzles in the first game seemed to have been lifted from old arcade games like Pac-Man, but in this game puzzles are, for the most part, cerebral. Most involve piecing together information or deciphering hidden messages, and only a few make serious demands on the player’s eye-hand coordination. Puzzles are clever, but some are brutally difficult.Often I had to resort to a document the publisher sent me with solutions for all the puzzles. Many times, even knowing the answer, I could not fathom how I could possibly have solved it on my own. If you’re very smart, very determined and a very good Internet researcher, it can probably be done; if not, the game is fun when you have something on hand to get you past the roughest parts.The main flaw in Evidence is not in its puzzles but in its storytelling. Evidence makes the mistake of many narratives: the only interesting character is the villain. As you solve puzzles, The Phoenix “rewards” you with short scenes from two documentaries, one involving an investigation into a series of killings and the other following a woman trying to find her long-lost brother. But even shown in one- and two-minute clips, they are generally tedious.Characters are generic, and the story fails to grab the viewer. A similar problem is seen in the blandly written e-mail messages you receive from fellow investigators. It is as if the designers felt their story could not be convincing unless it was as colorless as possible.The story gains momentum when the two documentaries finally intersect, and even becomes somewhat engrossing when you begin to track down The Phoenix, but Evidence never feels like much more than a gussied-up puzzle game.If the developers make a third game, I hope they work as hard to engage players in the story as they do to confound them with mind teasers. A couple of appealing good guys would help. They don’t have to be a trench-coat-wearing dog and a crazy rabbit, but it might be worth considering.'"

"'06-10-19,'1','Steven Levy, the author of “The Perfect Thing,” is madly in love. So what if the object of his affections is inanimate and very, very petite? It makes great company and is fun to fondle. It makes him feel good and bolsters his self-confidence. And size is no problem: the more it shrinks, the more “adorable” it becomes.Mr. Levy is also acutely image conscious about his taste in music. He may be a baby boomer (he refers to top record-company executives as “nasty cats”), but forget the Paul McCartney concert tickets: he prides himself on a cutting-edge sensibility. He seeks out songs by musicians “young enough to be grandchildren of the Beatles” and prefers artists “off the radar of anyone whose name is inked on a mortgage.” His example of mortification is to be caught with Michael McDonald in your iPod library.And he shows other signs of insecurity. His position as chief technology correspondent for Newsweek ought to underscore his authority on this subject. But he is overly fond of emphasizing his backstage access to Steve Jobs, and of locutions like “I once found myself in a heated discussion with Bill Gates about. ...”At least he can claim to have been the first person to hand Mr. Gates a Microsoft-unfriendly iPod and asked “Have you seen this yet?” As Mr. Gates absorbed every detail about the rival product, Mr. Levy says, “I could almost hear the giant sucking sound.”Mr. Gates’s interest in the Apple iPod could not have surpassed that of Mr. Levy, who has written an entire book about one item and even modeled it on that device’s hallowed image. The cover of “The Perfect Thing” looks as much like an iPod as it can, given the necessity for pages and binding. And the book’s structure is iPod-mimetic too. Mr. Levy has deliberately mimicked the shuffle feature so that different editions of “The Perfect Thing” present their chapters in different orders. This has less novelty than it promises. There are plenty of books with chapters that address separate themes and don’t follow any logical progression.'"

"'06-10-20,'0','In September 2003, Mr. Grasso was forced to resign as chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, the world’s largest stock market, amid an outcry over the disclosure of his $139.5 million compensation package, all of it tied to accrued pension and retirement savings. John S. Reed, Mr. Grasso’s temporary successor, commissioned an inquiry into Mr. Grasso’s pay. That report was passed on to Mr. Spitzer, who sued in 2004. Since then the two sides have been embroiled in a drawn-out series of legal skirmishes.The ruling is a major legal setback for Mr. Grasso, who for the last three years has battled to make the case that the exchange’s board was well aware of all aspects of his pay and approved the package accordingly.Justice Ramos also ruled yesterday against Mr. Grasso’s claim that he was terminated and thus due an additional $95 million in severance pay. And the judge dismissed a countersuit for disparagement that Mr. Grasso had filed against his temporary successor, Mr. Reed.In his ruling, the judge was responding to several legal motions filed by Mr. Spitzer, claiming that Mr. Grasso violated his contract by withdrawing pension savings before his retirement and failed in his duty as chairman of the board by not keeping his fellow directors informed of his escalating pension.Mr. Grasso said in a statement: “Today’s ruling is riddled with errors. One month ago, the Appellate Division told Justice Ramos not to try this case himself until the Appellate Division had decided important legal questions before them. Today, Justice Ramos somehow rejected the testimony of dozens of directors that they approved every dime they paid me, and decided that these men and women did not know what they were doing.”Mr. Grasso said that he had instructed his lawyers to appeal and that he looked “forward to the jury trial that the state constitution promised me.”For Mr. Spitzer, who leads his Republican opponent in the race for New York governor by a wide margin, the ruling is a welcome riposte to the criticisms he has faced that in place of winning in the courtroom he has bullied companies and executives into reaching settlements.“I have maintained since the beginning that the principles at stake in this issue were clear and the facts were egregious,” Mr. Spitzer said in an interview yesterday. “At every turn the government perspective has been vindicated. The defendants have done nothing more than scream louder and louder and their arguments are vacuous and wrong.”In his ruling, Justice Ramos said he wanted to reach a payment solution within the next 30 days.In the unlikely event that Mr. Grasso follows the court judgment and writes a $100 million check, Mr. Spitzer would be expected to drop the case, as he could claim that he had received the amount he had originally asked Mr. Grasso to return. Mr. Grasso would still be a wealthy man, getting to keep tens of millions of dollars in compensation from his more than three decades at the exchange.While having to return a significant portion of his pay package carries its own financial punishment, it is the judge’s sweeping rejection of Mr. Grasso’s long-held contention that the exchange board had been aware of his growing pay that represents a more resonant defeat.Justice Ramos said it was “shocking” that the board could have been “unaware of a liability of over $100 million,” and he said that Mr. Grasso violated his fiduciary duty as a director to keep his board fully apprised of how quickly his pension benefits were accumulating. “Mr. Grasso’s duty is to be fully informed and to see to it that the board was fully informed,” he wrote. “He failed in this duty.”Between 1999 and 2002, as Mr. Grasso’s annual pay soared to a high of $31 million, his pension plan, a supplemental executive retirement plan, or SERP, grew at an even faster clip, topping out at over $80 million in 2003, when Mr. Grasso made the decision to withdraw his funds.That decision, which according to the depositions of several directors he made because he was fearful that another board would prevent such a withdrawal, set in motion the events that would lead to the public controversy over his pay and his eventual resignation. In the subsequent years, all the participants have been deposed over the matter, with many directors on the wider board claiming that they had no idea how fast Mr. Grasso’s SERP had grown.In his decision, Justice Ramos draws the crucial conclusion that Mr. Grasso did not inform members of his board about his escalating SERP. “Mr. Grasso’s failure to disclose the amount of his SERP thwarted the compensation committee from performing its duty,” he wrote. “Year after year, it made decisions to pay him without knowing his true compensation.”At the crux of the judge’s ruling is his decision that Mr. Grasso must return the $87 million in pension savings that he withdrew from the exchange before he retired. And it also supports a similar argument made by directors like Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Goldman Sachs chief and current Treasury secretary who led the campaign for Mr. Grasso’s ouster. In his decision, the judge said that the pension withdrawals that he made in 1995 and 1999, totaling $35 million, were unlawful transfers and should be recognized as loans.Lawyers from Mr. Spitzer’s office calculate that Mr. Grasso would owe interest of about $15 million on that sum. Mr. Grasso will also be required to return money from a separate retirement account that is not yet vested.That brings the total to close to $100 million, representing a significant portion of the $185 million he was paid as head of the stock exchange from 1995 to 2003.'"
"'06-10-20,'0','OPEC ministers agreed to reduce their production to 26.3 million barrels a day from 27.5 million barrels a day starting Nov. 1, according to a statement released after the meeting.The cut in production goes deeper than the reduction of one million barrels a day that was widely discussed before the meeting, and will be based on what producers are actually pumping rather than on the group’s existing quotas.“What we are trying to do is get the market in balance,” Mr. Naimi told reporters shortly after landing in Doha.“There is disequilibrium between supply and demand,” he said. “We are trying to bring back the market to its normal equilibrium, and the price will take care of itself.”Oil futures rose in New York after Mr. Naimi’s comments. Light crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $58.50 a barrel, up 1.5 percent.By acting Thursday, the oil ministers were seeking to establish a new floor on the market around $60 a barrel and convince oil traders and hedge funds that the group was ready to defend that level. But OPEC’s decision to prop up oil prices is certain to frustrate consumer countries at a time when gasoline prices had been falling.OPEC is eager to cut production because it expects lower global demand next year and a sharp rise in supplies from producers outside the cartel.Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said OPEC was also prompted to act because of the higher-than-expected oil stock levels in industrial nations.“The market is taking this seriously and it suggests there is a price that OPEC is willing to defend,” he said.But as usual with OPEC, it remains to be seen whether the cartel’s members can stick to their commitment to cut production.The oil ministers of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates said the cartel might make further cuts in December. Venezuela’s representative said OPEC might need to trim its output by another 500,000 barrels a day in December.Analysts, traders and refiners had expected a harsh hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico, which led to a strong buildup in oil stocks to make up for potential shortages and encouraged traders to bid up the price of oil in anticipation of possible disruptions.But with benign weather this summer, the market is now brimming with oil and crude oil stockpiles in the United States are well above their five-year average.The emergency meeting was an opportunity for OPEC’s representatives to end weeks of confusion. Many of OPEC’s top representatives acknowledged that the group needed to show it was united to prevent further declines in prices.“The credibility of OPEC is at stake,” Chakib Khelil, Algeria’s oil minister, said to reporters.OPEC was not supposed to meet until December, but the momentum for an emergency session picked up recently as many ministers began to fear that they would no longer be able to control the slump in oil prices.“Everyone has to remember that we are all in the same boat,” Shokri Ghanem, Libya’s oil minister, told reporters. “If anyone rocks the boat, we will all lose in the end.”'"
"'06-10-20,'0','Coca-Cola said yesterday that its net income rose 14 percent in the third quarter as the company increased beverage sales in China and in Europe during the World Cup soccer tournament.Net income increased to $1.46 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.28 billion, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. The company said sales rose 6.9 percent, to $6.45 billion, from $6.04 billion.Global soda volume increased 5 percent, the most since 2000, as the company pushed calorie-free Coca-Cola Zero and put World Cup soccer players’ faces on cans of Sprite and Coca-Cola. The company depends on soft drinks for 80 percent of its sales, and focused on overseas markets to lift soda volume while consumers in the United States cut back.“It’s very encouraging to see soda sales going up so much,” said Marc Inboden, who is an investment manager at Beese Fulmer & Pincoe in Canton, Ohio. “They are starting to really turn it around, with these international markets making up for the softness in the U.S. and Japan.”Profit in the latest period was helped by a tax gain of $41 million, or 1 cent a share, related to a 2003 agreement with a Latin American bottler, Coca-Cola said.The results were better than the 59 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial, and stock in the company rose 95 cents, to $44.91 a share.European shipments surged 10 percent, the biggest gain in at least three years, helped by promotions surrounding the World Cup in June and July. Latin America shipments jumped 7 percent.'"

Francis IV that he and Mr. Becker, his former boss, made changes to make their department seem more profitable than it was.“You knew what you were doing was illegal?” Judge Francis asked.Citibank, a unit of Citigroup Inc., discovered the scheme during an internal investigation.Mr. Gile is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 12.'"
"'06-10-20,'0','The Rev. Jesse Jackson acknowledges that minorities have made lots of progress in the last few decades. But he is still frustrated by the slow pace.So Mr. Jackson is stepping back into the arena. In January, his Rainbow/PUSH Wall Street Project, which he founded 10 years ago to prod American corporations into investing in minority businesses, will introduce the Small Business Institute. The institute will have a two-part goal: to teach entrepreneurship skills to teenagers, immigrants and minorities, and to prompt financial institutions to provide them with easier access to capital.“The ghettos and barrios are underserved markets with untapped spending power,” he said, “so we’re going to take Wall Street to Main Street. We give microloans in third world countries; why not in East Harlem?”The need for assistance, he argued, is every bit as great as it was before civil rights legislation ended formal discrimination. Most studies of small business show that minorities are starting businesses at twice the rate of whites, he noted, and that ghetto businesses commonly employ people from the neighborhood.Still, he asserted, white restaurateurs like Danny Meyer — who started the Union Square Cafe and a succession of other Manhattan restaurants — have little trouble opening restaurants in New York, yet the Woods family, which runs the popular Sylvia’s Restaurant in Harlem, still has only one restaurant in New York. Percy E. Sutton, a black former Manhattan borough president, had to go to more than 50 banks before he could get a loan to buy a black radio station, Mr. Jackson said“Huge pension funds don’t hire too many minority-owned money management firms; the legal fees for mergers like Citibank and Chase do not go to black or brown firms,” he added. “And the current administration isn’t even enforcing E.E.O.C. and contract compliance,” he said, referring to the laws that govern hiring practices and that require a percentage of federal contracts to be set aside for minority-owned businesses.'"
"'06-10-20,'0','At first glance, the market-beating returns of hedge funds are impressive. But on closer inspection, things look less showy. Performance measures are based on voluntary reporting by hedge funds and thus tend to reflect outperformers rather than laggards and losers. And even some of the winners’ outsized returns are overstated because they are not adequately adjusted to reflect the huge risks that go hand in hand with big gains.In addition to those concerns, Jenny Anderson of The Times has now articulated another: the strong possibility that hedge funds’ returns are juiced by insider trading.Over the past several years, largely unregulated hedge funds have become a towering presence in the stock market, now accounting for roughly half of all trading on the New York and London exchanges. More recently, they have become major players in the debt market as lenders to companies, buyers of banks loans and investors in tricky derivative securities tied to companies’ credit quality.The loan market is far larger than the stock market, and as such, of vast importance to the performance of the overall economy — a fact that on its own should entice regulators to inquire more about hedge funds’ potentially destabilizing positions and activities. A more immediate problem is that loan-market participants routinely deal in confidential information, including all of the details a company must divulge to qualify for a loan and frequent — nonpublic — financial updates while a loan is outstanding. With virtually no government oversight and generally fewer institutional controls than banks, hedge funds that are active in both equity and debt markets face huge temptations to trade on insider information.Ms. Anderson reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether certain hedge funds improperly traded the shares of Movie Gallery, a movie rental chain, after taking part in a confidential conference call for the company’s lenders. Such an investigation may be just the tip of an iceberg. Even if it doesn’t uncover any wrongdoing, it has opened a window on how information travels on Wall Street.On Monday, Senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. and several other administration officials and members of Congress, soliciting views on how Congress could improve hedge fund transparency. The replies will, at the least, create a record of officials’ ability and willingness to respond to the obvious problems posed by hedge funds — before those problems become crises.'"
"'06-10-20,'0','Although Pfizer’s stock price was off slightly yesterday, as it forecast essentially flat revenues through 2008 as key drug patents expire, its shares and those of other big drug makers — including Merck — are up sharply this year, after a half-decade of weakness.The American Stock Exchange index of drug makers is up 12.5 percent in 2006, compared with a 9.5 percent rise for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Pfizer has gained almost 19 percent this year and Merck is up nearly 40 percent.The industry has not entirely shaken off its doldrums, mainly because it continues to have problems finding new drugs to replace those it loses to patent expiration.“This is an industry built on new drug approvals — patents run out for everyone, and research and development productivity remains the key to long-term success,” said Scott Henry, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. “No one’s out of the woods yet.”Pfizer’s prediction of flat revenue the next two years was based on the coming expiration of patents on two of its top-selling drugs, the antidepressant Zoloft and Norvasc, a treatment for high blood pressure.Pfizer also said today it was postponing the widespread rollout of Exubera, its inhaled insulin, until January — more than six months after federal regulators approved the drug. Exubera, which analysts had predicted would be a blockbuster, now appears to be running into widespread resistance from doctors concerned about its potential risks to the lungs.Even so, Pfizer said that its earnings per share would rise by 7 to 9 percent in both 2007 and 2008, as it cuts costs and reduces the number of shares outstanding with share buybacks.And the company has so far successfully defended Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering medication that is its largest and most important drug, from the impact of the patent expiration in June on Merck’s Zocor, a similar cholesterol-lowering drug. To save money, insurance companies have tried to switch patients from Lipitor to the new generic versions of Zocor, known as simvastatin, which is much cheaper than Lipitor.But Pfizer reported that its Lipitor sales rose 15 percent in the third quarter, to $3.3 billion, including $2.1 billion in the United States.Over all, Pfizer said its third-quarter sales rose 9 percent, to $12.3 billion. Profits hit $3.4 billion, or 46 cents a share, compared with $1.6 billion last year.Factoring out the impact of certain charges, Pfizer reported earnings of $3.9 billion for the quarter, or 54 cents a share — well ahead of Wall Street’s estimates of 45 cents a share.“Pfizer had a good quarter,” Ms. Ryan said. “They obviously exceeded forecasts for earnings and revenues, and Lipitor had a strong quarter.”David L. Shedlarz, the vice chairman of Pfizer, said the company was pleased with its results for the quarter and planned to continue to cut costs through 2008. “We’re being very realistic about the prospects for our company,” he said. “We’re aggressively moving to transform the company, to lower the cost base and make it more flexible.”Lilly, the sixth-largest American drug maker, said that its sales rose 7 percent, to $3.9 billion, while earnings gained 10 percent, to $874 million, or 80 cents a share. Sales of Zyprexa, Lilly’s biggest drug, rose 5 percent, to $1.09 billion.Analysts say that sales of Zyprexa, a drug for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, has been helped significantly by the Medicare drug plan. . Patients over 65 who had previously been on Medicaid are now covered by Medicare, and Lilly is able to charge significantly more to Medicare than Medicaid, analysts say.'"
"'06-10-20,'0','The report found that contract officers “did not retain adequate documentation to verify expenditures,” nor did they keep records about whether the contract went through the normal procedures for competitive bidding.As a result, the report concluded, the inspector general could not determine whether the contract was properly awarded. Since that contract has expired, however, the inspector general did not recommend any punishment for the violations.Since winning its first “strategic communications” contract in 2004, the Lincoln Group has secured more than 20 contracts from the Pentagon worth tens of millions of dollars.The company came under scrutiny late last year when news reports disclosed that Lincoln Group employees were working with the military to write favorable news articles about American operations in Iraq.Under the terms of the contract, members of a military information operations task force would write summaries of news events and editorials, called storyboards, which Lincoln Group employees would translate into Arabic and pay Iraqi newspapers to publish.The inspector general’s report concluded that the Lincoln Group successfully placed hundreds of these articles in the Iraqi news media.Despite criticism of the operation from within the Pentagon and from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, a military investigation in Iraq completed this year found that the propaganda program was not in violation of Pentagon policy.In recent months, the Lincoln Group has won a string of new contracts for work both in Iraq and Afghanistan. Last month, the company was awarded a two-year, $12.4 million contract to monitor English and Arabic news outlets for military officials in Baghdad and to produce talking points and public relations material for American commanders there.A statement from the company released on Thursday said that the Lincoln Group’s work is performed “ethically and effectively” and that the company “continues to win contracts because of the firm’s performance in hostile and challenging environments.”Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement on Thursday that the inspector general’s report “shows that the Pentagon cannot account for millions paid to the Lincoln Group for their propaganda program.”“Broader policy questions remain about whether the administration’s manipulation of the news in Iraq contradicts our goal of a free and independent media there,” said Mr. Kennedy, who had requested the inspector general’s investigation.'"
"'06-10-20,'0','In 1978, The New York Times said that Mr. Eilts was “one of the few ambassadors really trusted” by Mr. Kissinger, whose suspicion of career diplomats was well known. Mr. Eilts at that time conducted his own shuttle diplomacy, traveling back and forth to Washington every few weeks to brief policy makers.Diplomatic ties with Egypt were restored in 1973, and Mr. Eilts was named ambassador. He played an intricate role in setting up Mr. Sadat’s landmark trip to Jerusalem in 1977.“No American knew Sadat better,” William B. Quandt wrote in “Camp David: Peacemaking and Politics” (1986). The two conversed at all hours on a private phone line Mr. Sadat had requested.On July 30, 1978, Mr. Eilts sent a flash cable to President Jimmy Carter saying that Mr. Sadat was at the end of his patience over what he considered Israeli intransigence. President Carter decided it was time for a summit meeting, and on that day invited both leaders to Camp David, where they negotiated a historic agreement.Hermann Frederick Eilts was born in Weissenfels Saale, Germany, on March 23, 1922. His family brought him to the United States when he was 4, and he grew up in Scranton, Pa., where his father worked for the railroad.He became an American citizen in 1930 and graduated from Ursinus College in 1942. Before being drafted into the Army in World War II, he briefly attended the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, where he took a student job researching the legal status of Sudan under British and Egyptian control and became fascinated.He served in Army intelligence in World War II in North Africa and Europe, earning medals including a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star. After his discharge, Mr. Eilts earned a master’s degree in Middle Eastern studies from the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington; it is now part of the Johns Hopkins University.While there, he met Helen Josephine Brew, a former Navy Wave who was specializing in the Far East. He persuaded her to switch to studying the Middle East, and they married after he entered the foreign service. She survives him, along with his sons, Frederick, of Wichita, Kan., and Conrad Marshall Eilts of Bahrain, and four grandchildren.Mr. Eilts was ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1965 to 1970. In his first tour there in the 40’s, he had many meetings with the founder of the kingdom, King Abdul Aziz. The trust he established at the highest levels of the Saudi leadership enabled him to press for their support for the Israel-Egypt peace process, although unsuccessfully.The Christian Science Monitor reported in 1981 that in 1976 Mr. Eilts was the target of assassins. The news emerged after intelligence reports declared that a “hit team” was pursuing President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Eilts told the newspaper that the authorities had “irrefutable” evidence that he had been a target five years earlier.“The pattern was exactly the same in both cases,” he said. “Hit teams are discovered and then come the Libyan denials, with a demand that we produce the evidence.”Mr. Eilts retired from the foreign service in 1999 and started an international relations department at Boston University, where he taught. In his diplomatic career, he taught at the Army War College in Carlisle Barracks, Pa., where he was also deputy commandant.Not all of Mr. Eilts’s negotiations concerned war and peace. In 1976, he negotiated an agreement to lend Egypt money at low interest rates to buy new garbage trucks for the city of Alexandria.'"
"'06-10-20,'0','Like Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut’s novel “Slaughterhouse-Five,” Nikola Tesla is unstuck in time in “Violet Fire,” a new opera that received its American premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night. Tesla, an inventor and a pioneer in electricity and radio broadcasting, appears alone in the prologue, set after the demolition of his visionary World Broadcasting Tower in 1917.He next appears as an aged recluse feeding pigeons in Bryant Park in this continuous 85-minute piece, which was workshopped in Philadelphia in 2004 and had its premiere at the National Theater of Belgrade this year. In scenes that follow, he is lauded as mankind’s benefactor by Mark Twain, celebrated as an otherworldly seer by the author Margaret Storm and reproached by his socialite friend Katharine Johnson for being an unwitting herald of doom.What “Violet Fire” clearly aspires to is the kind of nonlinear portraiture Philip Glass achieved in early operas like “Satyagraha” and “Akhnaten.” Jon Gibson, who composed the music, would seem to be well suited to the task: he is a longtime member of Mr. Glass’s ensemble, and his own music has been built on a foundation of early Minimalism.Much of “Violet Fire” is based on tiny melodic and rhythmic cells repeated at length. Some numbers, set to perky dance rhythms, sound more like musical theater tunes than any conventional operatic style, Minimalist or otherwise. The energetic young Serbian conductor Ana Zorana Brajovic and a dozen accomplished local freelance musicians made the most of Mr. Gibson’s simple, colorful melodies, with playing that was unfailingly secure and attractive.But Mr. Gibson’s music was seldom sufficient to support the weight of Miriam Seidel’s weighty, wordy libretto. One poignant number, performed twice by a reporter who encounters Tesla in the park, was the high point of this collaboration. Elsewhere, Mr. Gibson’s simplistic accompaniment was overtaxed by vocal lines crammed with exposition and jargon.The cast was well stocked with young Violettas, Cherubinos and Taminos. But evaluating their merits from that perspective was pointless, since the singers were amplified with headset microphones. Scott Murphree, a tenor, sang the role of Tesla with genuine presence and impeccable diction, and looked like Jeremy Irons in period garb. As Twain, the baritone Peter Stewart also got his words across.The rest of the cast and the chorus, mostly Serbian, performed valiantly, but would have benefited from the use of supertitles. Nenad Nenic as the Reporter, Dragana Stankovic as Johnson and Ana Lackovic as Storm handled their parts with obvious commitment. The role of the White Dove, a source of inspiration for Tesla, was simultaneously sung by Mirjana Jovanovic, a soprano, and danced by Joanna Kotze, who moved with an appealingly pigeonesque angular grace.'"
"'06-10-20,'0','Of course, we can hold them, interrogate them, cause suffering and harm to them and their families even if they are innocent, even if they know nothing about terrorist activities and even if they are taken by mistake.It is an abomination that President Bush has been allowed to frame this discussion in terms of how we treat the guilty.Without due process, we don’t know if they are guilty. The president has signed a bill that fundamentally allows the United States government to torture possibly innocent people.The question was never about how we treat the guilty (although that is a valid question in a country that has a Constitution). The question should always have been about how we determine guilt and are we harming the innocent.Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, speaking for the Bush administration, states cynically that those who oppose the new Military Commissions Act “would gingerly pamper the terrorists who plan to destroy innocent Americans’ lives.”This demagogy is insulting to our intelligence.The issue is not about coddling evil; it is about preserving fundamental checks and balances.While many of those held at Guantánamo are bad men intent on bad deeds, hundreds of other detainees have been quietly released without charges or apology or compensation after years of captivity and harassment.If these individuals had been granted basic habeas corpus rights, this shameful injustice would have never occurred.To those who say it’s better to be safe than sorry, I’d ask:If it were your father or son who was spirited away, jailed without charges and repeatedly intimidated, degraded and, yes, tortured despite his innocence, would you still think that our government was acting in your best interests?It is really sad to see that the president and the Republican Congress are unwittingly doing exactly what the terrorists aspire to do themselves: chipping away at the pillars of liberty and freedom of the Western world, one law at a time.In this particular instance, the American judicial system has been torpedoed.The president and the Republicans may have won a battle with the Democrats, but they should take a step back to see that we are slowly losing the war on terror by compromising on the principles and ideals laid down in the United States Constitution.As an Australian citizen concerned about the welfare of my fellow citizen David Hicks, who is one of the hundreds of inmates at Guantánamo Bay, I am horrified at the new American law on military tribunals.Your editorial quite correctly points out that these new laws do nothing for the reputation of the United States as a democratic society and should be of great concern to all Americans.The idea that if you don’t like the decision of the umpire (the Supreme Court, in this case), you just change the rules to suit your purpose may work on some sporting fields, but it should not be used by a national government to undermine the justice system.What a sad day for the United States, and for the rest of the world witnessing this event, that a bill has been signed into law that allows torture.Yes, the United States has been a shining light of freedom and democracy; now it is quickly becoming a rogue state, characterized by a lust for war, hoping to achieve the quelling of dissent by indoctrination inside the United States and by violence outside of it.'"
"'06-10-20,'0','If you’ve read Dr. Seuss, you know the danger in letting a furry, fast-talking creature with a long tail have the run of your house while your mother is away. In addition to the prospect of future therapy, you have to cope with the immediate destruction this critter leaves in its path.I don’t mean the Cat in the Hat. This is the mouse in the overalls.That tiny tornado is the star of “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,” from Manhattan Children’s Theater. Not to be confused with last summer’s Theaterworks/USA revue of the same title, this is not a musical but a play with incidental music. The lively score, by Michael Vitali, has a klezmer feel but somehow recalls the theme from “Jaws” at the moment the mouse first approaches. If this seems incongruous, you must not have read “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,” the picture book that inspired all this theatrical activity.Laura Joffe Numeroff, the book’s author, suggests that if you give a mouse a cookie, it’s going to want a glass of milk, and if you give it the milk, it’s going to want a napkin, and if you give it the napkin, it will request a mirror and ... you get the idea. The tale, while charming, is a bit of a one-note joke if you’re over 6.Not so the play. In Jody Davidson’s witty adaptation, the silently perplexed boy of the book has become an ingratiating young narrator (Chris Alonzo) and his visitor such a hyperactive chatterbox that you suspect that this little mouse is on meth. (He’s just high on life.) Ms. Davidson has even provided a hilarious tale within the tale, when the boy reads his Jungleman comic book aloud in a vain attempt to pacify the mouse. (SharOn Halevy and Margot Stern alternate the rodent role.)Just as the book derives much of its power from Felicia Bond’s illustrations, the hourlong show, directed by Laura Stevens, abounds in physical comedy. Cully Long’s set creates the appropriate perspective with hugely oversize props, and the animal star does a nimble routine with its own reflection. Even if you don’t want to see a mouse in the house, you shouldn’t miss this one in the theater.'"
"'06-10-20,'0','Most of these lawmakers were accused of having stickier fingers than a kid with a chocolate chip cookie. The latest addition to the sorry lineup is Assemblyman Brian M. McLaughlin of Queens, although if federal racketeering charges brought against him this week are proved true, he had his hand in a lot more than a cookie jar. According to the indictment, he had a trough, one worth $2.2 million.There may be a silver lining to this unpleasantness. As disgraced lawmakers slouch toward prison, they may gain intimate knowledge of aspects of the criminal justice system that have long been controversial. They may then want to pass along their insights to former Albany colleagues.For example, if Mr. McLaughlin becomes a convicted felon, he will lose his right to vote; he will not regain it even when he is released from prison on parole.Restrictions of this sort are a touchy subject. All states except Vermont and Maine prohibit prison inmates from voting. Eleven states impose various types of lifetime bans. One result is that black Americans are disenfranchised in numbers disproportionate to their share of the population. All told, more than five million Americans, regardless of color, are banned from voting because of their criminal records.Their numbers grew so rapidly during the stern lock-’em-up years of the 1980’s and 90’s that some states began to rethink their policies. Over the last decade, 16 of them have eased voting restrictions, a liberal advocacy group called the Sentencing Project said last week. Still, it said, United States disenfranchisement laws “remain some of the most restrictive in the world.”And yet, while a New York State inmate may not vote, he is in effect considered a voter when the Legislature draws its districts. This practice shifts some political power to rural areas upstate from city neighborhoods downstate.Why does it happen? Because the federal census counts inmates as residents of the district where they are imprisoned, not where they last lived.In this state, most inmates come from New York City but serve their time upstate. Counting them as residents of sparsely populated upstate counties seems to have helped the Republicans hold onto their majority in the State Senate. An analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative, a group based in Massachusetts, has concluded that perhaps seven upstate Senate districts would have to be reconfigured if prison inmates were not considered part of the local population.Some experts have urged the Census Bureau to rethink its policy. A Democratic state senator from Manhattan, Eric T. Schneiderman, has proposed a bill that would require state prisons to record inmates’ last addresses. The Legislature, under his bill, would then use that information in drawing new district lines.Don’t expect grand changes soon. Still, these may be issues for someone like Mr. McLaughlin to think about should he shuffle off to prison.Who knows? It’s not impossible that he will face state charges someday to go along with the federal case. Should everything go wrong for him, he may yet get a chance to ponder what it is like to be deemed a resident of, say, Wyoming County.If that name is unfamiliar to you, it is home to a little place known to most New Yorkers as Attica.'"

"'06-10-21,'0','This year, there are 33 open House seats, including three that are vacant at the moment but had been held steadily by one party, and polls suggest that Democrats have a good chance to capture enough Republican-held districts to put them well on their way to tilting the balance of power in Washington.Surveys show Mr. Perlmutter in command of his race against his Republican opponent, Rick O’Donnell, in the contest to succeed Representative Bob Beauprez, a Republican who is running for governor.In races for 20 other Republican open seats, recent polls show the Democrat leading in at least 8, putting the party more than halfway to the 15 seats needed to capture the House. Just one of 12 Democratic open seats appears at risk, and even that is considered a long shot.The state-of-play shows why leaders of both parties pleaded with incumbents who were contemplating leaving the House to stick around, begging them to pass up career changes, more time with the grandchildren or a run for the Senate.Grabbing open seats has proven critical in past Congressional realignments. In the watershed election of 1994, House Republicans converted 22 Democratic open seats; in the Watergate election of 1974, House Democrats flipped 13 Republican seats. Now, for Democrats to seize the majority, the open seats will be crucial. “You have to win the open seats by a rather substantial proportion because, unless you have a nationalized race, the incumbents are going to win,” said John Samples, director of the Center for Representative Government at the Cato Institute.It is a testament to the partisan makeup of most Congressional districts that even with such a strong political tide running against the Republican majority, Democrats are still trying to assemble enough victories to gain control of the House.But Colorado’s Seventh, which ranges from industrial Commerce City through bedroom communities to the old Gold Rush town of Golden, is a textbook swing district drawn to foster competition. Mr. Perlmutter was considered a top prospect for the new seat in 2002, but said he decided not to run to tend to a young family and a law practice. In 2004, Mr. Beauprez was solidly ensconced, but when he started publicly pondering a run for governor in 2005, Mr. Perlmutter got serious about a race.The benefits of incumbency can be both large and small — from visibility and the ability to help individual constituents to an aura of political invincibility that discourages challenges and keeps donations flowing.Mr. Perlmutter, who represented part of the House district as a state legislator, still had to win a tough and expensive primary to get into the general election, though it ultimately helped raise his profile. Mr. O’Donnell, a lifelong resident of the district who lost a primary to Mr. Beauprez in 2002, escaped a primary this year. But he quickly discovered he had work to do to become known.“Over the summer, I would knock on people’s doors, and they would say, ‘Who are you? What are you running for?’ ” Mr. O’Donnell said. “A couple hundred thousand dollars in TV ads takes care of that.”In their closely watched race, Mr. O’Donnell has sought to emphasize a hard line on immigration and raise the specter of Democratic tax increases while Mr. Perlmutter has pressed the need for change in Republican-controlled Washington and emphasized stem-cell research, an issue he has personalized, saying it represents the potential for treatment of his daughter’s epilepsy.If there were a year not to be an incumbent, Mr. O’Donnell argues, this is it with the Republicans he hopes to join in the House facing an electorate anxious about the war in Iraq, frustrated with the Congress and angry over constant scandal.“This year, I am thrilled to be an open-seat candidate,” Mr. O’Donnell said.Yet Mr. Perlmutter and his Democratic allies have worked to tie Mr. O’Donnell to the Bush administration and an unpopular war. In doing so, they have saddled Mr. O’Donnell with the disadvantages of incumbency while he lacks the long-term relationship with district voters that might help a sitting lawmaker.In a new advertisement broadcast this week by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on behalf of Mr. Perlmutter, a beaming Mr. O’Donnell was shown leaving Air Force One with President Bush as the president arrived for a fund-raising visit this summer. “Another vote for George Bush’s agenda,” says the advertisement.Mr. O’Donnell and his aides acknowledge that in the Denver area, where snow is already falling this year, it is tough sledding for Republicans. “I am under no illusions,” he said. “It is going to be painstaking, vote by vote by vote.”Republicans hardly needed added trouble in a year when the party controlling the White House traditionally suffers. But their task was greatly complicated by the departure of three veteran lawmakers in safe seats who exited under ethical clouds and left their local ballots in shambles.Tom DeLay, the former House majority leader under indictment in Texas, quit after winning his primary and state Republicans lost a legal fight to replace him on the ballot, forcing them to put their hopes in a difficult write-in campaign. The name of Mark Foley, who resigned over sexually explicit e-mail to former pages, will remain on the ballot in his Florida district, though votes cast for him will go to another candidate. Representative Bob Ney of Ohio, who recently pleaded guilty to corruption charges, dropped out of his race but left his replacement contending with the fallout from his bribery scandal. Democrats could conceivably win all three seats.In Arizona, Representative Jim Kolbe, who is retiring, refused to endorse the conservative Republican who won the primary to replace him, putting Republican retention of that seat in jeopardy. In Colorado Springs, Republican divisions over the candidate to succeed Representative Joel Hefley, who is retiring, have national Democrats examining whether to make a serious run at that solidly Republican seat.“In a year like this, the only Republican open seats that are certain to stay Republican are rock-solid, overwhelmingly Republican districts,” said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan Congressional handicapper.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee just bought advertising time in the race for a Nevada open seat that was previously considered out of reach, and party strategists are looking into investing in others where Republicans are showing signs of weakness.“We are trying to figure out the combination on the lock of the gerrymandered districts,” said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, campaign committee chairman.Republicans are fighting back, spending on television advertisements for Mr. O’Donnell and others in open seat races. But they are also being forced to spend in places like Idaho, where they had expected to avoid a fight. Party officials predict that in the end, many of the seats will remain in Republican hands.'"
"'06-10-21,'0','PEORIA, Ill., Oct. 20 (AP) — Caterpillar said Friday that its third-quarter profit rose 15 percent. But after reducing its forecasts, shares fell 14.5 percent.The company lowered its full-year earnings forecast, citing high operating costs and lower-than-expected sales, and said it expected a slowdown next year as well when new diesel engine emissions regulations take effect.The company also cautioned that the weak residential housing market in the United States and a decline in sales of truck engines would restrain revenue growth next year.During a conference call with analysts, Caterpillar officials called next year’s slowdown a pause, not the end of a sales surge that has doubled the company’s annual revenue since 2002. Energy exploration, mining and infrastructure improvements remain strong worldwide and will continue to generate demand for the company’s earth-moving machines, the officials said.For the third quarter, net income grew to $769 million, or $1.14 a share, from $667 million, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest period included about $80 million in legal expenses, most to settle a dispute with the truck and engine maker Navistar International over licensing and supply agreements.Sales rose 17 percent, to $10.52 billion from $8.98 billion a year earlier, helped by higher prices and increased volumes for both machines and engines. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased revenue by $97 million.Stock in Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, fell $10.02, to $59 a share.The company said it expected full-year revenue of about $41 billion, up about 13 percent from 2005. Caterpillar forecasts profit of $5.05 to $5.30 a share for 2006, with growth coming from higher prices and sales volume.'"
"'06-10-21,'0','The Dow rose 0.35 percent for the week, while the S.& P. gained 0.22 percent and the Nasdaq fell 0.64 percent.The Dow had shown triple-digit point gains in each of the previous three weeks. Despite the overall gains in the market, the S.& P. stands about 10.4 percent below its high close of 1,527.46 and the Nasdaq is even further off, about 54 percent.Light, sweet crude settled down $1.68 at $56.82 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid skepticism about whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would fully implement a greater-than-expected production cut.The pledge to curb output by 1.2 million barrels a day, announced after an emergency meeting in Doha, Qatar, came after oil prices had fallen by about $20 since topping $78 a barrel in mid-July. Some oil cartel members warned output could be trimmed further when the group met in December.But many analysts think that OPEC will have difficulty enforcing the production cut in its entirety because oil prices are still twice as high as they were just three years ago.“It’s clear there will be some production cutbacks,’’ said Andrew Lebow, a broker at Man Financial. “But is it going to be 1.2 million barrels? That’s probably unlikely.”OPEC has a history of producing above its official quota when prices are high and analysts are reluctant to accept the cartel’s intentions at face value.Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Company, is concerned that falling oil prices could indicate the economy is slowing too quickly. He contended that while earnings reports have been sound over all, companies are coming in with more guarded forecasts.“Caterpillar today was sort of a splash of cold water on the notion that this economy is in the perfect place and will continue to be in the perfect place,” he said.Caterpillar fell $10.02, to $59 despite a 15 percent increase in its third-quarter profit. Though the company sold more construction and mining equipment, it warned increased operating costs and weaker-than-expected sales would cut into its full-year profits.Google, the Internet search company, rose $33.61, to $459.67 after its profit nearly doubled and revenue surged 70 percent during the third quarter, which is traditionally slower, as people spend less time in front of a computer during the summer months.Investors heard from other Dow components yesterday to cap off a busy week of earnings reports.3M rose $2.07, to $78.47, after posting a 6.4 percent increase in its third-quarter profit amid renewed strength in its business of making films for liquid-crystal display television and computer screens.The drug maker Merck advanced $1.15, to $45.64, after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue, though earnings were down 34 percent and sales were flat.In other corporate news, SanDisk, which makes flash memory chips, fell $12.58, to $49.15, after reporting a 4 percent decline in its third-quarter profit and forecasting prices would fall by as much as 20 percent in the fourth quarter.Arch Coal was down $2.22, to $32.04, after the company lowered its full-year profit forecast because of weakness in the domestic market. The company also said its third-quarter profit nearly tripled as operating costs fell.Bonds showed little movement yesterday, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury falling 1/32, to 10021/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 4.79 percent, up from 4.78 percent late Thursday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.'"
"'06-10-21,'0','NOT since the days of khaki colonialism has buying Africa been so sexy, so fashionable,” wrote Richard Kim this week on The Notion, the blog run by The Nation magazine. (thenation.com)Madonna went to Malawi this month to adopt a 13-month-old boy. “Price tag for this celebrity accessory du jour: $3 million to antipoverty programs and $1 million to produce a documentary on the plight of Malawi’s children,” Mr. Kim wrote. “But don’t worry, if an African baby is too pricey for you (and conjures up undesirable associations to Angelina Jolie or slavery), then you can buy Red instead.”Needless to say, Mr. Kim is less than enamored of the “(Product)Red” campaign, in which Gap, Apple, American Express and other companies offer products under the Red brand and give part of the profits to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. (joinred.com)It’s the “part” part that makes Mr. Kim see red. The campaign, created by the singer Bono and Bobby Shriver, a California politician and member of the Kennedy clan, is intended to allow companies to make a profit after deducting their donations.Mr. Kim has been following recent news coverage of the campaign and came upon a quotation from Mr. Shriver in The New York Times, that read in part: “We don’t want anyone to be thinking, ‘I’m not making money on this thing,’ because then we failed. We want people buying houses in the Hamptons based on this because, if that happens, this thing is sustainable.”'"
"'06-10-21,'0','In August, Peter A. Darbee, chairman, chief executive and president of PG&E, owner of Pacific Gas and Electric, broke rank with his peers by supporting a measure in California that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are widely blamed for global warming. Mr. Darbee discussed his decision and other initiatives in an interview on a recent visit to New York. Following are excerpts:Q. Why do you support California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which will require utilities and other companies to make their operations even more energy efficient?A. I dove into the issue with our senior team more deeply than other executives. We engaged in a process of scientific inquiry. Out of that we developed a conviction that the earth is warming, that mankind’s responsible and the need to take action is now. I’ve always been one who’s been driven by my conscience as to what is the right thing to do. And we came to the conclusion that that was the right thing to do.Secondly, the thought was, as a leader, what you want to do is anticipate trends in the business environment and then position a company optimally within that context.Rather than sitting there and denying that global warming is a problem and climate change is a problem, my reaction was to accept it and to go with the flow to understand the trend, and then say, how can I position PG&E to deal with that challenge, and then how can I turn a challenge into an opportunity.Q. What do you say to critics who contend that this bill will make California’s economy less competitive? A. In the past, California has stepped out and been a leader on environmental legislation, and its economy has continued to grow probably faster than the average state economy in the United States. California will find a way to continue to grow, notwithstanding this piece of legislation.Q. How can California and companies based there achieve the goals mandated by the bill?A. Take a look at Fetzer winery as an example. Ninety-five percent of their waste they can keep on-premise and reuse, 5 percent they ship off, and that is a dramatic reduction. When I went there, their whole building was constructed with energy-efficiency in mind. The walls are pretty thick, and if you look up at the skylights, they have windows that open up at night and let the cool air in, cool down the place. The cool air goes into the walls, and then they close those skylights in the morning, and then they put reflector material up to reflect the heat. They have essentially very little need for air-conditioning at all, because the energy that was lost from the walls is then reabsorbed during the course of the day.'"
"'06-10-21,'0','Tony leaped to his feet, brandishing a werewolf mask with gray synthetic fur and enormous white rubber fangs. He stuck his fingers through the snout holes, poking at the blood-red tongue. Harrison’s face paled, and my stomach churned.“When you get home, you need to cut a hole in the mouth so you can breathe,” Tony advised. “Take it from me, I know about these things.” He handed the mask to Harrison, winking. “This is serious business, kid.”I watched with a mix of childlike fear and full-grown wonder as Harrison donned the werewolf mask and the accompanying clawed gloves. Suddenly, my angelic child turned into a terrifying monster.“Grrr!” he growled, clawing at my heart. I recoiled, and Harrison laughed hysterically.I tried to regain my composure by conjuring my due diligence on Halloween. If the All Hallows’ Eve holiday is serious business at Halloween Adventure, it is big business nationwide, and this year promises to be bigger than ever. A study by the National Retail Federation says consumers are expected to spend $4.96 billion on Halloween costumes, candy and related paraphernalia, up from $3.29 billion last year.“The spending increase is largely due to a surge in celebrating,” notes a recent National Retail Federation news release. “According to the study, nearly two-thirds of consumers will celebrate Halloween this year, a noticeable rise over the 52.5 percent that celebrated in 2005. In addition to a rise in celebrating, per-person spending is also increasing: the average consumer plans to spend $59.06 on Halloween, compared to $49.48 last year.”I took devilish delight in the news of Halloween’s boom because it is by far my favorite holiday. Like Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Halloween celebrations usually begin the weekend before the designated date of the holiday. But unlike Christmas, Halloween doesn’t require you to do battle in shopping malls to buy gifts for other people, or attend religious services at midnight. Although Halloween comes the day before All Souls’ Day, a Christian holiday, it is unapologetically pagan in origins. No one’s making a list to see if you’ve been naughty or nice. You can be either one, or both. You can be anything you want to be.Even so, I found the surge in Halloween celebrations rather surprising given all the real life terrorism, wars and horrors around the world. But Tony insisted there was plenty of historical precedent. “People drink in bad times, people drink in good times,” he noted. “It’s the same thing with Halloween. People dress up in bad times, people dress up in good times.”Halloween Adventure is part of a privately held Philadelphia-based concern called Masquerade. According to Tony, Masquerade opens as many as 100 temporary stores each Halloween season, and is currently planning to franchise permanent locations in major cities. Along with operating Halloween Adventure as a year-round business under the moniker buycostumes.com, the company also owns a location next door devoted exclusively to merchandise for people who fancy the Goth look.Tony took Harrison and me on a whirlwind tour of the store to find costumes for my wife, Alison, and our King Charles spaniel, Steffi. In 2004, the National Retail Federation estimated that more than two million people dressed in Spider Man costumes. This year, the organization says the most popular costumes for the second year in a row are princess costumes followed by pirate costumes and witch costumes, with Spider Man ranking fourth.“Halloween’s all connected to the movies,” Tony explained as he wielded a rubber saber. “ ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ is a big hit, so pirate costumes are big again. The other thing that’s big is sexy costumes.”Tony escorted us to a lower floor section that featured outfits produced by Playboy Enterprises and Leg Avenue, a leading lingerie company. Along with bunny costumes, they included a Hugh Hefner smoking jacket and pipe ensemble for males, and for females, “Sexy Scholar,” “Racy Referee” and “French Maid” costumes. “You have to have the right shape and the right attitude to wear this stuff,” Tony noted.Before Harrison and I left home that morning, my wife had expressed a preference for what she called a “milk maid” or a “yodel girl” costume. But after examining the offerings in the sexy section, Harrison vetoed both ideas. He insisted that his mother would be more appropriately attired as “Glinda the Good Witch” from the Wizard of Oz. Carrying on the same theme, he chose a “Bewitched” outfit for Steffi from the store’s large selection of pet costumes.Realizing that I was now the only family member without a costume, Tony ushered us to a section of larger than life-size fruit and animal outfits. Among them were a banana, a lobster, a chicken and a rat “caught” in a giant metal trap. “Back when we were kids, we used to make our own costumes,” Tony recalled. “All you had to do was get a sheet and cut holes in it and you were a ghost.”Harrison yanked my arm, shaking his head in disapproval. “Dad, ghosts are so old school,” he said. “They’re the most boring thing you can be for Halloween.”“Old school?” I said, sighing. “What am I going to be?”Harrison grinned, and led Tony and me back upstairs to the horror section. He pointed to an adult size werewolf costume identical to his. My eyes welled. In hopes of being an enlightened parent, I had always resisted the temptation to ask my son to dress like me. I was overwhelmed that he would ask me to dress like him, even if it was in a werewolf costume. I quickly donned the mask and gloves.“Not really, Dad,” he replied. “It’s just better than being a ghost.”As we headed for the cash register, Harrison declared that he wanted to make our house look really haunted on Halloween. With Tony’s guidance, we bought a couple of skulls, some fake blood and a giant centipede to adorn our front doorstep. I was tempted by — but ultimately passed on — a lump of “human brains” packaged in Styrofoam and plastic like a pound of hamburger meat in a supermarket case.Harrison and I left the eerie bluish glow of Halloween Adventure, staggering under the weight of our purchases and blinking our eyes in the afternoon glare. I’d just spent more than $300, about $75 a person counting Steffi. That was 25 percent more than the average consumer spends. But I felt my extravagance was more than justified by the prospect of father and son werewolves trick or treating with Glinda the Good Witch and a “Bewitched” King Charles spaniel.'"
"'06-10-21,'0','Twenty years ago the city’s Parks Department fenced off a vacant lot in East Harlem and announced that it planned to build a park named for Ronald E. McNair, one of the astronauts who died aboard the Challenger space shuttle.For years nothing happened. The lot became an illegal dumping ground for contractors, who used it to dispose of building material, and at night as a safe haven for drug users, who would periodically cut through the chain-link fence on the perimeter.But yesterday, on the eve of what would have been Dr. McNair’s 56th birthday, the Parks Department held a ceremony at the lot and announced the opening of McNair Playground, designed with custom-made play equipment that incorporates a space theme.The playground, costing $2 million, on East 122nd Street near Lexington Avenue, had its original groundbreaking on Oct. 23, 1986, when Mayor Edward I. Koch presided at the ceremony.Dr. McNair, a physicist who in 1984 became the second African-American to make a space flight, died aboard the Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, when the shuttle exploded 73 seconds after takeoff. Six other astronauts also died in the accident, which was caused by the failure of an O-ring seal in the solid fuel rocket.'"
"'06-10-21,'0','DOWN, BUT STILL UP Falling energy prices helped bring consumer prices down by half a percentage point in September, the Labor Department said, although the so-called core inflation rate — excluding food and energy prices — rose 0.2 percent, as it did in July and August.Economists and stock traders took the Consumer Price Index report, and another that said the number of new building permits fell in September for the seventh consecutive month, as evidence that the economy was slowing and that higher interest rates would not be needed soon.That optimism was tempered by the Labor Department’s news that the core consumer inflation rate is running at 2.9 percent for the year — the highest level in almost 11 years.Federal Reserve policy makers will discuss interest rates on Tuesday and Wednesday; they are expected to keep rates at 5.25 percent.DOUBLING DOWN With sales growth in the United States slowing, Wal-Mart agreed to pay $1 billion for Trust-Mart, a group of Taiwanese-owned supermarkets in China, to become the biggest foreign chain in that rapidly expanding market.Acquiring Trust-Mart, which has more than 100 stores across China, pulls Wal-Mart even in China with Carrefour, the giant French retailer.The purchase also reverses Wal-Mart’s recent pullback abroad. In the last year, Wal-Mart has pulled out of Germany and South Korea, and has failed to make much headway against strong competitors in Japan and Britain.By more than doubling the number of stores Wal-Mart owns in China, this deal will help it secure lower prices from suppliers. That, in turn, could lead it to double in size again by 2010, one analyst said.DOUBLING UP The Chicago Mercantile Exchange agreed to buy its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, for $8 billion, creating a global derivatives goliath that dwarfs other capital markets.The merged exchange would meld the Mercantile Exchange’s strengths — as a major market for interest rate contracts, currencies and livestock — with the Board of Trade’s dominance of Treasury bond futures, grain contracts and now ethanol.Executives at both companies said they had been engaged in serious merger talks almost as soon as the Board of Trade first sold shares to the public a year ago.Once the merger is completed, probably in the middle of 2007, the exchanges will consolidate in the Board of Trade’s landmark 44-story Art Deco tower in Chicago.THE FINAL OPTION Dr. William W. McGuire, who built the UnitedHealth Group into one of the nation’s two largest health insurers, was forced to resign and give up a portion of the $1.1 billion he holds in stock options.A law firm hired by UnitedHealth to investigate its stock option grants concluded that the program was riddled with poor controls and conflicts of interest that permitted executives to backdate their options grants to maximize their compensation.Dr. McGuire’s departure came amid a federal investigation into whether more than 100 companies backdated stock options. Backdating lets companies pretend to have given options to managers just before stock prices jump, assuring the executives quick profits without having met performance goals that would benefit all shareholders.Scores of companies are rushing to restate their results to reflect lower profits and higher taxes attributable to suspicious options grants.REGULATOR FALLS Lester M. Crawford, former chief of the Food and Drug Administration, pleaded guilty to conflict of interest and lying about stock he and his wife owned in companies the agency regulates.Dr. Crawford sold stock in several companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Medtronic and Boston Scientific, before the Senate approved his nomination in July 2005. But he and his wife, Catherine, retained shares in Sysco, PepsiCo and Kimberly-Clark, each of which has businesses regulated by the agency. Prosecutors said Dr. Crawford also owned options to buy 41,500 shares in Embrex, a biotechnology company regulated by the F.D.A.Dr. Crawford is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 22. He faces a maximum of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine on each of two counts.REAL ESTATE FRENZY Building permits and other indicators suggest a slowing real estate market, but that did not deter Tishman Speyer Properties from offering $5.4 billion to buy 110 apartment buildings in Manhattan, one of the biggest real estate transactions ever.The 11,232 apartments, in developments called Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, were built after World War II as affordable housing for returning veterans.Metropolitan Life, the insurance company that owns the apartments, said it expected to complete the sale before the end of the year.'"
"'06-10-21,'0','ON the streets of London and other cities in Britain, an incongruous sight has become increasingly common: young Muslim women covered from head to toe in black robes, including the niqab, a veil that obscures the face except for the eyes.The niqab sets these young women off not just from most passers-by, but even from Muslim women who choose to wear the simple headscarf, or hijab, which covers only the hair and neck. And it is causing discomfort even in multicultural Britain. When Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary, declared earlier this month that the niqab made positive relations between Muslims and non-Muslims more difficult because it was “such a visible statement of separation and difference,” he struck a chord with many British voters, only 22 percent of whom think that Muslims have done enough to fit into mainstream society.Having spent time getting to know young British Muslims, I believe that comments like Mr. Straw’s will be counterproductive. That is because the niqab is a symptom and not a cause of rising tensions. Few young Muslim women in Britain are forced by their families to wear the niqab. British Muslims come predominantly from South Asia, where the prevalent school of Islam, Hanifi, makes no insistence on a woman fully veiling herself. Indeed, only one of the four schools within Sunni Islam, Hanbali, which is followed in Saudi Arabia, requires women to completely cover up.The young British South-Asian Muslim women who veil Saudi-style are rejecting not just mainstream British society, but their parents’ and grandparents’ accommodation with its values. Ghulam Rabbani, an imam in East London, told me he was proud to be both British and Muslim but that some “misguided” youngsters in his congregation did not share that view. Khalil Rehman, one of Mr. Rabbani’s congregants, told me he was worried about his children’s generation. The young women who choose to wear the niqab, Mr. Rehman told me, are “rebelling against what their parents tell them to do, they’re trying to differentiate themselves.”Frustrated by unemployment rates more than double those of members of other religious groups, put off by stereotyping in the news media, and estranged from British foreign policy, many alienated Muslims have turned to more overt forms of religiosity to express a contrarian identity. Says Murad Qureshi, the only Muslim councilor in London’s Assembly: “Girls are choosing to reaffirm their Muslim identity because the community feels a sense of besiegement.”'"

"'06-10-21,'0','So in “Manhattan Casanova,” which opens on Friday as the fall mainstage production at Hudson Stage in Briarcliff Manor, the characters behave a little differently.Dr. Charlotte Kaplan (Elizabeth Hess) and John Casey (James Kiberd) are equally forceful, verbally gifted and commitment-phobic. They meet at a neighborhood cafe where she is sitting alone, reading Gabriel García Márquez’s “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” She resists his efforts to strike up a conversation.John: “You’re the first person to notice that.”John isn’t a bad guy, really. He sincerely loves women and knows how to make them happy: by doing romantic things (e.g., reciting French poetry) and trying to be whoever their ideal man is. Unfortunately that rings hollow for him (since he’s not being himself), which may be why his attentions are short-lived. Thus the title.“The label tells you one thing about the person, but it’s not a totally derogatory term,” says Dan Foster, a Hudson Stage co-founder. “You would never call it ‘Manhattan Womanizer.’ Casanova is a more benevolent term.”Yes, Ms. Bader’s play does seem to be conceived from a woman’s mindset, he said, “but it’s an enlightened woman’s point of view.”Olivia Sklar, another Hudson Stage co-founder, is pleased with the production, which recently moved rehearsals from Manhattan to Westchester.“It feels like the first really sexy piece we’ve done,” she said. She describes it as a “delicious, witty romantic comedy” but hastens to add that the play is also deep, as all good comedy is.Sometimes the laughs come from the pain. “Manhattan Casanova,” like some other works of popular culture (HBO’s “Sex and the City” comes to mind), does not present the urban singles game as particularly pleasant.“It says that it’s a jungle out there,” Mr. Foster said. New York may be so huge that the relationship possibilities seem endless, he added, but “you do have to make an emotional leap, putting yourself out there to be judged” over and over again.Not everyone involved can speak from recent experience. Mr. Foster, who lives in Croton-on-Hudson, has been married for 21 years to the actress Liz Callaway (she originated the role of the wife in “Miss Saigon” and replaced Betty Buckley in “Cats”). Ms. Sklar, who also lives in Croton-on-Hudson, has been married for more than 30 years to Dr. Peter Powchik, a psychiatrist (who, she said, is looking forward to seeing his profession portrayed in a comedy). Ms. Bader is celebrating four years of marriage to Roger Berkowitz, a political studies and human rights professor at Bard College.Ms. Bader met her husband online, incidentally, but points out that she had already written a draft of “Manhattan Casanova” before she met him. Any resemblance to former boyfriends living or dead is out of the question.Directed by Richard Caliban, “Manhattan Casanova” is something of a departure for Hudson Stage, which was founded in 1999 by three actors. (Mr. Foster, who now directs, refers to himself as a “recovering actor.” Denise Bessette is the third co-founder.)“We wanted to kind of break the mold a little bit,” Mr. Foster recalled, describing the company’s goal as “making challenging choices but remembering that you are there to entertain.”Their first plays were presented in what is now the Julie Harris Theater at the Clear View School in Briarcliff Manor. A year and a half ago, Pace University invited Hudson Stage to become a company-in-residence and renovated a space for its productions. The Woodward Hall Theater, on the Pace campus in Briarcliff Manor, is the company’s present home.The founders stress that they consider a season’s balance important. The last mainstage production was Gina Barnett’s “After All,” a futuristic social drama set in postapocalyptic New York. The spring 2007 play is “The Retreat From Moscow,” William Nicholson’s portrait of the end of a marriage.Hudson Stage also does staged readings throughout the year. The next, on Dec. 8, is Jeff Wanshel’s “Modern Entrepreneurs,” described as two one-acts about manipulative relationships. In January, a project involving Briarcliff High School students will be directed by a Bard student. In April, the Tony Award-winning actress Judith Ivey will direct a reading of Kathryn Rossetter’s “Starving, Hysterical, Naked,” which deals with second-class citizenship and contemporary culture’s obsession with winning.For the moment, though, the mood onstage is dark, brittle comedy. “Manhattan Casanova” pits a compulsive seducer against a woman whose idea of pillow talk is, “I don’t need morning-after maintenance.”'"

"'06-10-22,'0','EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Oct. 21 — Youri Djorkaeff’s free kick sailed through D.C. United’s penalty area and seemed magnetically drawn to the head of a wide-open Jeff Parke. With a swift snap of his neck, Parke, a defender for the New York Red Bulls, got the ball past United goalkeeper Troy Perkins, only to see it ricochet off the crossbar.The near goal, which occurred in the waning moments of Saturday’s Major League Soccer playoff game between the Red Bulls and United, was New York’s last chance to salvage a tie on its home turf at Giants Stadium. It also provided a fitting snapshot of the Red Bulls’ frustrating day.Despite several good scoring chances and an evenly played match against United, the top-seeded team in the Eastern Conference, the Red Bulls could not find that finishing touch and lost, 1-0, before an announced crowd of 8,630. The teams will finish this two-game, total-goals series next Sunday in Washington.“I just wished that there was a gust of wind that came down and pushed it a little bit down,” Parke said of his late-game header. “Yeah, it did sum up our day. Not getting it done, basically. Just falling a little short.”While the Red Bulls could not capitalize on any of their scoring opportunities, United made the most of one of its few good chances.'"
"'06-10-22,'0','“People think there is no culture in Nashville,” Trotz said. “It’s a very, very cool city, from the singers and the artists in town to the movie stars. And it’s just a little town compared to New York and Chicago.“Now I think it’s a lot easier sell when talking to free agents.”It certainly surprised Arnott, a Stanley Cup winner with the Devils in 2000.“It’s so beautiful there to live, the fans are unbelievable, and it’s just a great city to play in,” Arnott said.In the past three seasons, the Western Conference champion has been one of the lower-seeded teams.Kariya’s Anaheim Mighty Ducks made the finals as the seventh-seeded team in 2003, and the Calgary Flames were seeded sixth the next year. This spring, the eighth-seeded Edmonton Oilers reached the Stanley Cup finals against the champion Carolina Hurricanes, who missed the playoffs in 2004.“It’s like winning the lottery,” Kariya said. “Making the playoffs is the key. You have to give yourself a chance to win.“The additions we made this summer made us that much better. I think it’s an organization going in the right direction.”The Predators got off to a rough start this season, dropping their first three games before beating Phoenix at home. Nashville then went on a three-game trip and made a rare sweep of the Islanders, Rangers and Devils.Tomas Vokoun rebounded from a rocky stretch to provide strong goaltending. Vokoun allowed 13 goals in his first two games before stopping 91 of 93 shots in his next three outings.“Paul being here and Vokie re-signing was a big factor in me coming here because I knew I’d get a chance to play with Paul, and everyone knows you need a top goalie to win,” Arnott said. “I want a chance to win again and I thought that this team would be the best way.”SCHEDULING PROBLEMS Schedule changes might be coming.After receiving complaints that only one out-of-conference division visits each city each season, N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the league would explore possibly changing the format instituted last year after the lockout.“When we implemented the emphasis on divisional play last year, we figured we’d look at it for a couple of years,” Bettman said. “Interestingly, all the research we have shows much more support for keeping what we have than changing it. But we know that particularly out West, there’s a sensitivity to the issue.“We’re going to look at it again after the season and see what changes make sense.”This season, the Atlantic Division is the only one from the East that will make appearances in Pacific Division arenas. That means the reigning rookie of the year, Alexander Ovechkin of Washington, will not be traveling to Pacific Division cities, nor will the Buffalo Sabres, who started 7-0.Instead of having every team travel to every city, the N.H.L. offers up eight games among division rivals.“If we played a 100-game schedule, which we’re not advocating, then we’d get everybody in,” Bettman said. “For everything you do, there’s a tradeoff.”SWITCHING CAPTAINS The change of captains has done nothing to hurt the Dallas Stars at the start of the season.Shortly after he signed a long-term extension, Brenden Morrow was named the Stars’ captain, and Mike Modano exchanged the C on his sweater for an alternate A. Modano was the captain for two seasons before being replaced by Morrow, a forward who has been with Dallas since 1999, when he was only 20.The Stars took the move in stride and jumped out to a 6-1 start this season.“There really was not any awkwardness,” goalie Marty Turco said of Modano, the face of the franchise since 1988. “I think that’s a tribute to him and his actual leadership that seems to come in question from the outside, but not ever has from within. He’s our player, he’s our guy and he has been for a long time. And we need him to be, to keep pushing forward in this division and this year to be successful.“I think just having both those guys be great leaders, great friends, made everything go smooth and the best part about it is it hasn’t stopped us one bit. It’s made us stronger and it’s about our team identity and really as simple as that, and we didn’t misconstrue how that all went down.”With Modano still in town, the newcomers Eric Lindros and Jeff Halpern adding a larger veteran presence, and Jere Lehtinen and Turco already in place, Dallas emerged as an early contender for the Western Conference title.The Stars fell, 2-0, at San Jose on Tuesday for their first loss.NOLAN CRITICIZES CROSBY Ted Nolan waited nine years to get back in the N.H.L. Now that he has found a place behind the Islanders’ bench, he is making sure his voice is heard.After a 4-3 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Thursday, Nolan wasted no time in taking a shot at the Penguins’ poster boy, Sidney Crosby.Crosby, a 19-year-old star forward, drew a hooking penalty on the Islanders’ captain, Alexei Yashin, during overtime that led to Sergei Gonchar’s winning goal. It was Pittsburgh’s third power-play goal in eight chances, and it had Nolan seething.“I think for a world-class player, for a guy of his caliber, he’s diving every time someone touches him,” Nolan said of Crosby, who had 102 points last season, his first.Nolan also felt Crosby should have been called for slashing just before Yashin committed his foul. As a result of the contact, Yashin had to ice his thumb, which was bleeding, while he sat in the penalty box.“No question in my mind, he should have been called for a slash before Yashin had a chance to hook him,” Nolan said. “I’m not saying Yashin’s wasn’t a penalty; I’m just saying there should have been a penalty before.“If Yashin maybe acted like Crosby and dove, maybe he would have gotten that call.”The Penguins and the Islanders meet seven more times this season.“I don’t need to defend myself,” said Crosby, who has not been penalized for diving this season. “I think my play more than shows the type of player I am. I’d be worried if I went out there and did that, but I don’t.”'"
"'06-10-22,'0','Mr. Mack and Mr. Samberg have both repeatedly denied any improper conduct. Earlier this month, the S.E.C. informed them that it would not bring any charges.Now, it is the S.E.C. that is under scrutiny. Two Senate committees — Finance and Judiciary — are investigating how diligently the S.E.C. pursued its Pequot inquiry, whether Mr. Aguirre’s firing was an attempt to silence him, and whether senior S.E.C. officials gave special treatment to Mr. Mack by not taking his testimony when Mr. Aguirre wanted to. Mr. Mack, a major fund-raiser for President Bush’s 2004 campaign, was eventually interviewed last August, after Congress began asking questions.The congressional inquiry centers on dozens of pages of internal S.E.C. documents that Mr. Aguirre turned over to Congress and were obtained by The New York Times. The documents, including e-mail messages from Mr. Samberg and his associates, as well as contemporaneous e-mails from investigators, provide the first inside look at the case, and shed light on why the two Senate panels are interested in the matter.The primary focus of the congressional inquiry is the S.E.C.’s investigation into Pequot’s purchase of stock in Heller Financial, a financial services firm, and the dispute over taking Mr. Mack’s testimony. The documents say that Pequot became the nation’s biggest purchaser of Heller stock in the four weeks before the company was acquired by GE Capital in July 2001. Mr. Samberg bet $44 million on Heller and wanted to invest even more, according to the documents, but his trader could not fill all the orders.The file shows that after Mr. Aguirre was blocked from questioning Mr. Mack about the Heller deal, Mr. Hanson, the S.E.C. branch chief, acknowledged in e-mail messages that he had discussed Mr. Mack’s “political clout” and the “juice” of his lawyers with officials at the commission.In an exchange of e-mails in the summer of 2005, Mr. Hanson said that he had merely been trying to “alert folks above me,” and that politics did not influence S.E.C. decisions. Mr. Aguirre replied: “Bob, this is spin. You told me it would be tough to take Mack’s testimony because he has political clout.”In the documents, S.E.C. officials argued that Mr. Aguirre was not justified in taking Mr. Mack’s testimony because he could not show that Mr. Mack had inside information or a clear motive for giving it to Mr. Samberg. But Mr. Aguirre said he was only asking for permission to interview Mr. Mack, not bring charges.The file portrays the S.E.C. as a place where stock exchange referrals of suspected insider trading can languish for years without serious investigation.In the Pequot case, senators are examining how the S.E.C. handled a total of 18 referrals. In addition to the Heller deal, they include an investigation involving federal prosecutors into whether the hedge fund bought Microsoft options based on inside information. E-mails show that Mr. Samberg solicited information about the software company’s financial performance from a Microsoft manager he was recruiting shortly before Pequot invested in the company.“I shouldn’t say this, but you have probably paid for yourself already!” Mr. Samberg wrote to the former Microsoft manager as he was preparing to join Pequot in 2001.None of the 18 referrals, including the one involving Microsoft, led to an enforcement action, according to people briefed on the matter.Mr. Aguirre’s documents have surfaced amid rising concern on Capitol Hill about the lightly regulated world of hedge funds. The chairman of the finance committee, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said last week that after questioning S.E.C. officials about the Pequot investigation, “my initial concerns haven’t been put to rest by what I’ve learned so far.”The file is not a full record of Mr. Aguirre’s investigation, and it is silent about what happened in the inquiry after he left the commission. In the papers, Mr. Aguirre acknowledged before his firing that he had not proved that Pequot had engaged in insider trading, or that Mr. Mack ever had inside information about Heller.Since The New York Times first reported Mr. Aguirre’s allegations last June, the inspector general for the S.E.C. reopened his investigation into the firing after it was disclosed that he had not interviewed Mr. Aguirre. The inspector general, whose conduct is also being examined by the Senate, declined to comment.Mr. Aguirre declined to be interviewed for this article, but in an Aug. 21 letter, he told the banking committee, which oversees the S.E.C., that he had little faith in either investigation. “The same I.G. who did the first whitewash would do the new one,” he wrote. “The senior enforcement attorneys who pretended no grounds existed to take Mack’s testimony will now pretend to take Mack’s testimony.”In a statement, Jeanmarie McFadden, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said: “Mr. Aguirre’s allegations against John Mack are irresponsible and without any evidence whatsoever to support them. John Mack had nothing to do with the S.E.C.’s decision if or when it would seek his testimony. As soon as he was asked, John Mack immediately agreed to provide his testimony and was subsequently advised that the S.E.C. would take no action regarding him in this matter.”Jonathan Gasthalter, a Pequot spokesman, said in a statement: “The S.E.C. staff conducted an extensive, two-year investigation of Pequot’s trading and that investigation is over. During the course of the S.E.C.’s investigation, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York reviewed the firm’s 2001 trades in Microsoft and concluded that no action was warranted.”Officials at the S.E.C. declined to comment on the Pequot investigation and its outcome. But Walter G. Ricciardi, deputy director of enforcement, said that if investigators uncovered evidence that supported an insider trading case, they would pursue it vigorously. He denied Mr. Aguirre’s contention that referrals from the stock exchanges languish, saying that the commission’s staff follows up on three-quarters of the 350 to 450 referrals received each year.“Insider trading is a very big priority for us,” Mr. Ricciardi said. “We recognize that the integrity of the marketplace is at stake.”The following account is largely based on the investigative files and letters Mr. Aguirre sent to Senate investigators in August.According to these records, two days after joining the commission in September 2004, Mr. Aguirre was assigned to look into suspicious trading by Pequot in an information management company shortly before it was acquired in 2003.In a matter of months, Mr. Aguirre said he discovered 13 referrals involving Pequot that had not been fully investigated by the S.E.C. Eventually, he would look into 18 referrals, including one older one where Pequot suddenly began buying the stock of Heller Financial.That referral soon became the focus of the S.E.C.’s Pequot investigation.What intrigued federal investigators, Mr. Aguirre said, was that before buying Heller stock, Mr. Samberg apparently did not follow the financial services industry or Heller. Mr. Samberg’s bet had paid off: On July 30, 2001, the GE Capital Corporation announced that it was buying Heller, sending Heller’s stock up 50 percent. Pequot made $18 million on the deal, primarily by investing in Heller, but also by short-selling GE Capital’s parent, General Electric, which dropped on news of the buyout.After the deal was announced Mr. Samberg sent an e-mail containing six “smiley” faces, Mr. Aguirre said.According to Mr. Aguirre, Mr. Samberg told the S.E.C. in May 2005 that he had six reasons for buying Heller stock, including the company’s strong financial model, analysts’ reports and speculation that Heller might be a takeover candidate.But Mr. Aguirre says that when Mr. Samberg testified a second time in June, he was less certain, saying he had “no recollection specifically of how I started the Heller investment other than to know that I had been doing this for many years and recognized these opportunities when they come up.”Mr. Samberg said he could not recall seeing any newspaper articles about Heller or point to any specific analysts’ reports he had read about the company, according to an e-mail Mr. Aguirre sent to his supervisor, Mr. Hanson, on June 27, 2005. Nor did Mr. Samberg remember speaking with others at Pequot about the deal, Mr. Aguirre wrote. After Mr. Aguirre was fired, the S.E.C. interviewed Mr. Samberg a third time, but the files do not reflect what he said.Beyond Mr. Samberg’s testimony, Mr. Aguirre said his suspicions were fueled by Pequot’s trading in Microsoft.In early 2001, Mr. Samberg sought financial information on Microsoft from a product manager at the company, David Zilkha, whom he was trying to recruit, according to Mr. Aguirre.“Might as well pick your brain before you go on the payroll,” Mr. Samberg wrote in an e-mail message to Mr. Zilkha on Feb. 28, 2001. After expressing unhappiness with Pequot’s research on Microsoft, Mr. Samberg asked: “Do you have any current views that could be helpful?”On April 6, 2001, Mr. Samberg pressed Mr. Zilkha about Microsoft’s upcoming earnings report. “Any tidbits you might care to lob in,” Mr. Samberg asked in an e-mail, after noting “the recurring indications from knowledgeable people” that Microsoft’s earnings might fall short.Mr. Zilkha responded the next day, saying he would get back to him “ASAP.”There is no record of Mr. Zilkha’s response or evidence that he passed information to Mr. Samberg.Mr. Aguirre told the banking committee that between April 9 and 11, 2001, Mr. Samberg bought 30,000 options contracts, apparently believing Microsoft “would beat its earnings, the reverse of his belief stated in his e-mail.”A little more than a week later, on April 19, Microsoft reported better-than-expected earnings, sending its stock sharply higher the next day. Mr. Samberg made a $12 million profit on his Microsoft options, Mr. Aguirre said. The next day Mr. Samberg sent Mr. Zilkha, still three days away from joining Pequot, the gushing e-mail that said, “you have probably paid for yourself already.” On Mr. Zilkha’s first day on the job, Mr. Samberg alerted others to the new employee’s “great p.& l.” — or profit and loss — based on his Microsoft “input.”Mr. Aguirre told the banking committee that “critical gaps in the evidence” prevented the S.E.C. from charging anyone with insider trading in connection with the Microsoft investigation. The Justice Department also took no action.Mr. Zilkha, who no longer works for Pequot, declined to comment. But his lawyer, Henry Putzel III, issued a statement: “David Zilkha worked in a nonfinancial capacity, primarily in marketing for the MSN division of Microsoft. For approximately five months before his employment at Pequot, Mr. Zilkha was on family leave from Microsoft. David Zilkha never obtained and did not communicate any material, nonpublic information, nor did he attempt to do so.”The Zilkha e-mail messages fed Mr. Aguirre’s belief that Mr. Samberg might have had nonpublic information when, around the same time, he invested in Heller Financial. His suspicion fell on Mr. Mack, a longtime friend of Mr. Samberg’s who was Pequot’s chairman for several weeks in June 2005. “There are hundreds of Pequot e-mails referring to Mack, including a dozen in July 2001,” Mr. Aguirre wrote in a June 2005 e-mail message to S.E.C. officials.None of those e-mails show Mr. Mack passing on any tips about the Heller deal. Nor do they prove that he even knew about the deal before Pequot started buying Heller stock on July 2, 2001.But what the e-mails and trading records do show, Mr. Aguirre believed, was enough circumstantial evidence to warrant taking Mr. Mack’s testimony — a standard procedure in such a situation, he said — and to issue more subpoenas to Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank that advised Heller during its talks with G.E. Mr. Mack became chief executive of Credit Suisse in July 2001.In e-mails to S.E.C. officials in the summer of 2005, Mr. Aguirre made his case, noting that Mr. Samberg and Mr. Mack were close and trusted each other, and that Mr. Mack was allowed to invest in hot Pequot funds and financings. In addition, Mr. Aguirre speculated that Mr. Mack might have learned about the upcoming Heller-GE Capital deal while negotiating his job with Credit Suisse. Mr. Mack began at Credit Suisse on July 12, 2001, a little more than a week after Pequot began buying Heller stock. Pequot continued to buy Heller stock in the following weeks.“Samberg’s aggressive buying of Heller suggests he received the tip shortly before July 2,” Mr. Aguirre said in an e-mail to Mr. Hanson, his S.E.C. supervisor. And Pequot’s e-mails show that Mr. Samberg and Mr. Mack spoke after the market closed on Friday, June 29, according to Mr. Aguirre. “That matched perfectly with Samberg’s decision to begin buying Heller with a vengeance the next trading day after he spoke with Mack,” Mr. Aguirre said in his letter to the banking committee.The committee files show that until late June of last year, S.E.C. officials appeared to support Mr. Aguirre’s investigation. Around that time, Mr. Aguirre said, his supervisors authorized him to contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a federal prosecutor about the investigation.But when Morgan Stanley was considering hiring Mr. Mack as chief executive, Mr. Aguirre said, a regulatory official at the investment bank called to ask if Mr. Mack was a serious target in the Pequot investigation. The official “explained that the prospect of such an action against Mack could affect Morgan Stanley’s decision whether to rehire him as its C.E.O.,” Mr. Aguirre told the banking committee.Before answering, Mr. Aguirre said, he consulted with his two supervisors, Mr. Hanson and Mark Kreitman, an assistant director of enforcement at the agency. According to Mr. Aguirre, Mr. Kreitman favored telling Morgan Stanley that Mr. Mack was indeed a target, but first he informed his boss, Paul R. Berger, an associate director of enforcement, by speakerphone.With Mr. Aguirre listening in, Mr. Berger quickly overruled Mr. Kreitman, saying in effect that the S.E.C. would most likely not file charges against Mr. Mack and that nothing should be said to Morgan Stanley, Mr. Aguirre said.Mr. Aguirre was stunned. He told the banking committee that after the call, “The usual routines and protocols went out the window.” Suddenly, Mr. Aguirre said, he was excluded from senior staff meetings about the Pequot investigation. And subpoenaed records that ordinarily would go directly to him were instead directed to Linda Thomsen, the agency’s chief of enforcement, he said.Mr. Berger, now a lawyer at Debevoise & Plimpton, declined to comment.For the next two months, Mr. Aguirre pressed his superiors for permission to take Mr. Mack’s testimony. He failed to change their minds.“I need greater specificity than the information provided here,” Mr. Kreitman wrote in a July 25, 2005, e-mail to Mr. Aguirre. Mr. Kreitman said the evidence of motive “may have substance but it’s too vague.” And while contacts between Mr. Mack and Mr. Samberg “were potentially significant,” they were not “aberrational.”“I have indicated repeatedly that concrete evidence of when Mack obtained access to material nonpublic information re the G.E./Heller deal is the sine qua non for focused investigation of Mack,” Mr. Kreitman wrote.To Mr. Aguirre, this standard had not been applied to other executives he had subpoenaed. Just as troubling, he said, were references by Mr. Hanson to the power of Mr. Mack and his lawyers, who included former S.E.C. officials.“Mack’s counsel will have ‘juice,’ as I described last night — meaning that they may reach out to Paul and Linda (and possibly others),” Mr. Hanson told Mr. Aguirre in an e-mail on Aug. 4, 2005. The reference apparently was to Mr. Berger and Ms. Thomsen.Three weeks later, on Aug. 24, Mr. Hanson again acknowledged Mr. Mack’s status. “Most importantly the political clout I mentioned to you was a reason to keep Paul and possibly Linda in the loop on the testimony,” Mr. Hanson wrote. But he added: “As far as I know politics are never involved in determining whether to take someone’s testimony. I’ve not seen it done at this agency.”Mr. Aguirre disputed Mr. Hanson’s account, calling it “spin,” and added: “An artificially high barrier has been set for his exam. I do not think this is proper.”Mr. Ricciardi of the S.E.C., speaking generally, said, “Every day enforcement deals with powerful people and we treat them equally with an appropriate level of fairness for the people being investigated and fierceness for the investors we protect.” He also said that lawyers representing possible targets often approach top enforcement officials. “They don’t have to be a famous lawyer, and they don’t have to have a famous client,” he said.An S.E.C. spokesman declined to provide comments from Mr. Kreitman, Mr. Hanson or Ms. Thomsen.By the end of August, Mr. Aguirre was complaining that the Heller investigation “has slowed to a snail’s pace.” He was fired about a week later while on vacation.In late August of this year, Senator Grassley, the finance committee chairman, wrote to the S.E.C. chairman, Christopher Cox, raising questions about how the agency handled the investigation. He wrote that congressional investigators had found that the S.E.C.’s Heller inquiry had stopped, and had resumed only after Congress began looking at the matter.Senator Grassley also took the inspector general’s office to task, saying it had shown little interest in Mr. Aguirre’s contention that Mr. Mack’s political clout was a factor in not taking his testimony last year.The inspector general “closed its inquiry, claiming it found no evidence that S.E.C. officials had referenced Mack’s political clout,” Mr. Grassley wrote, adding, “Contrary to the I.G. report, however, documentary evidence exists and corroborates” that assertion.'"
"'06-10-22,'0','But personal finances are, well, personal. People who are already in retirement, or who have predictable near-term costs like college tuition, might keep more than 20 percent of their money in C.D.’s.Under the Bank of America offer, if your combined deposits dip below $25,000, you would revert to basic rates for online trading. Bank of America already charges its banking customers relatively little for online stock trades: $5 to $10, depending on the type of bank account. That compares with $14 for online brokerage customers who don’t also bank there. Online stock trades at $5 to $10 are competitive with rates offered by discount online brokers like E*Trade and TD Ameritrade.The bank’s offer is available immediately in the Northeast and will be rolled out nationwide by next spring. If keeping $25,000 in cash seems reasonable to you, the next step would be to examine the fine print and compare it with the competition’s.To begin with, Bank of America is allowing 30 free trades a month, but that applies only to orders that are entered on its Web site for stocks and exchange-traded funds. There is a charge to buy bonds or options online, or to place stock trades over the phone.If you buy mostly stocks and E.T.F.’s — and always enter the orders online — the 30-trade rule will probably suit you just fine. Only 4 percent of American investors trade more than 10 times a year, according to Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.So if you trade 10 times a year, you could save $100 to $200 by switching from your current online broker. If you have an account at TD Ameritrade, for example, you pay a flat $9.99 for an online stock trade, making for an easy comparison. In this case, the savings for 10 free trades a year would be $100.Some online brokers charge less than $9.99, but they have various rates based on a host of considerations, including the number of shares being traded, the amount of assets in the account and the frequency of trades.For example, Fidelity’s cheapest rate for an online stock trade is $8. You can qualify for it with as little as $25,000 in assets — but only if you trade at least 120 times a year. If you have $25,000 and trade at least 36 times a year, the cost is $10.95 a trade. Fidelity’s top rate for online stock trades is $19.95. So if you don’t qualify for one of its lower rates based on either the size of your account or the frequency of your trading patterns, you would save about $200 a year if you made 10 free trades at Bank of America, and maintained its deposit account minimum.Of course, the cost of trading isn’t everything. Some people stick with a particular brokerage firm because they prefer its Web site or the range and convenience of its mutual fund offerings. Bank of America’s online brokerage firm offers investors 1,300 mutual funds that do not charge sales fees, but people who invest regularly in mutual funds may want to make sure that their favorite fund families are included.As for the Web sites’ capabilities, Fidelity and Charles Schwab were both well-rated in an online investor customer survey last year by J. D. Power & Associates. TD Ameritrade and E*Trade were ranked somewhat lower, but the Web sites appear to be designed for different types of investors. While Fidelity’s and Schwab’s sites are geared more toward buy-and-hold investors, TD Ameritrade’s and E*Trade’s sites are aimed at frequent traders.Bank of America’s brokerage Web site wasn’t included in the rankings of the J. D. Power survey, because the sample size was too small, said James Lohmann, an analyst at J. D. Power. But he said that customers ranked Bank of America’s brokerage site as about average for the industry. Currently, Bank of America’s online brokerage customers have free access to research from Standard & Poor’s, Argus Research, Briefing.com and Thomson Financial.Finally, if you’re not already banking at Bank of America and are thinking of moving your deposits from another bank, you should compare all the fees and services at the banks as well, said Barbara Roper, the director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, based in Washington. “Don’t be seduced by just one product,” she said.For example, she advised bank customers to consider where they typically use automated teller machines, to determine if they might pay more or less in A.T.M. fees, and whether the interest rates might be higher or lower on their C.D.’s.SHE also reminded customers who keep their bank and brokerage accounts at one company to be prepared for cross-selling, the industry’s term for marketing many different types of financial products and services to customers.“Often when customers are given the trade-off between the convenience of one-stop shopping and the loss of privacy that goes with that, people will choose the convenience,” Ms. Roper said. “But they should factor in how comfortable they feel with all of that data gathered in one place, and recognize that it will be used for cross-marketing.”Bank of America executives say that they hope to make up for the losses from free stock trades by selling more mortgages and C.D.’s, and charging interest on margin accounts, the loans that brokers make to customers to buy stock.“We are highly confident that this offer won’t cost us, that it will be accretive from a revenue and earnings standpoint from the beginning,” said Tim Maloney, the president of Banc of America Investment Services. “Our own research has shown that a very high percentage of our customers would like to consolidate their financial affairs with fewer, or even with one provider.”Mr. Maloney said the offer had already accomplished something else he considers important. He said that when he demonstrated the company’s online trading system this month in Bryant Park in Manhattan, “many people remarked that they didn’t know that Bank of America was in the investment business.” After the buzz generated by the offer of free trades, he said, “America knows that we’re in the investment business.”'"
"'06-10-22,'0','When the cover band took a break at Swine on the Vine, guests crowded around the beer bong, eager to take their turn guzzling a can of beer poured down a funnel. A young man shook a portable outhouse because he knew his buddy was inside.The dress code was preppy enough for a polo ground: women in pearl necklaces, lightweight wrap sweaters and jeans tucked into riding boots. Men favored oxford shirts with sunglasses strung around their necks. Jeff Kimbell, a lobbyist who is a former club president, wore a belt buckle made from a car’s gearshift handle (with options for “drive and reverse,” he said suggestively). Josh Overbay, who works for the United States Chamber of Commerce, wore a camouflage hat that said, “Support Wildlife. Drink Wild Turkey.”“Girls love to hate them,” observed Bridget Bunner of the Capital Club’s 100 men. Ms. Bunner, a 23-year-old fund-raiser for Democratic Congressman Alan B. Mollohan of West Virginia, added, “They’re the kind of guys their moms want them to marry.”This summer, members sent each other Internet links to a Smirnoff ad on YouTube that parodied every cliché of the WASP elite, down to their seersucker suits and the popped collars of their polo shirts. It featured three blondes in pearls and tennis clothes, with young men rapping “where my WASP’s at?” and calling haters “jealous because our families run the nation.” Capital Club members said it reminded them of themselves.Members of the club have connections throughout government, and in some cases are wired right into the brain trust at the White House: the Republican lobbying firm DCI Group, which has strong ties to the Republican Party chairman Ken Mehlman and the White House senior adviser Karl Rove, has sponsored its parties. But club members insist their gatherings are not about networking or advancing anyone’s career or political agenda.“If you want networking,” said Jonathan Grella, 32, a public relations executive and Tom Delay’s former press secretary, “go to a fund-raiser or a charity event, or go to Sally Quinn’s house.”Even if this generation had a version of Ms. Quinn’s house, the Capital Club partygoer would rather not drop by. “There’s no one talking about issues in the beer line,” said Jessica Clement, who dates a past president of the club and works for the DCI Group.Jessica Cutler, the former congressional staff member whose blog, written under the pseudonym Washingtonienne, exposed several Washington men’s sex lives, said she attended one party — uninvited — in 2004, and that was enough for her. But Washington is not like New York, she said, and there are not many opportunities for the young and ambitious to establish themselves on the social scene.“Either you’re dealing with college kids,” she said of Washington’s night life, “where you feel you’re the oldest person there. Or you feel like you’re way too young to be there because they’re all old men.”Still, the Capital Club seems contrived, Ms. Cutler said. “It feels like these guys are young and they just came up with it, as opposed to it being an institution.”“That didn’t appeal to me,” she said, “but I can see why it appeals to the D.C. type. They do want to be on the board of the museum.”Many members do come from privileged backgrounds; Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour’s son, Reeves, is a member, as are West Virginia Rep. Shelley Moore Capito’s son, Moore, and Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss’s son, Bo, a lobbyist, all Republicans. Billy Bush, President Bush’s cousin and a host of “Access Hollywood,” is a former member, as is John Breaux Jr., a lobbyist whose father is the former Democratic Louisiana senator.But the club is, in some ways, populist. Annual dues are only $250. Anyone who buys a ticket can come to the parties. The cost for Swine on the Vine for nonmembers was $50 for men, $40 for women. At the end of the year, the club donates about $5,000 to charities like the American Red Cross.“I hate when we get painted with that picture of a bunch of bratty kids or of a privileged young Republicans’ club,” said George Vincent, 25, a real estate developer. “I know a lot of the guys fit that, but not all. The Republican part works, but I’m not pretentious.”The club was formed in 1980 — the year Ronald Reagan was elected president — by five graduates of the University of Virginia and Washington and Lee, with the intent of recreating their fraternity parties.“The first one, as it has been described to us, was three kegs of beer in a hotel ballroom in Crystal City, Virginia,” said Mat Lapinski, 26, the current club president and a lobbyist with a Washington law firm.The Clinton years were not good for the club; according to some members, it tried to become too exclusive, restricting access to its parties. It could hardly refill its membership ranks. The return of the Republicans to Congress in the mid-90’s marked the club’s resurgence.The club says 60 to 70 men try to join each year for the dozen spots that open up. A thousand people went to the Sinatra Soiree in July, where the “summer ahoy” dress code must have prompted a run on the J. Crew catalog. More than one guest carried a polo mallet as a walking stick.Even with the polls this month showing Democrats threatening the Republican majority in Congress, and the House leadership under attack, members insisted that a shift in the balance of power in Washington would not dim the club’s appeal, or its party-hearty spirit. The next gathering, a Halloween costume affair on Oct. 28, is 10 days before Election Day. Some members said they were looking forward to it as a timeout from the tense political season.“It wouldn’t matter if the Democrats controlled Congress or if Ralph Nader were president,” said Mr. Kimbell, 35, the former president. “The club isn’t about politics. It is precisely the opposite, as it gives members an opportunity to get away from politics for at least a little while, listen to some live music, throw down a few shots of Patrón and have a few howls with the boys. And perhaps enjoy the fruits of some of our lady guests.”The parties aren’t so wild that anyone will be forced to issue a public apology the next day. This being Washington, Capital Club members are aware that once you damage your reputation, it’s not easy to repair it. A lesson was learned from an experience with the Madison, a women’s club similar to the Capital Club, after a member told The Hill newspaper that she “would be the ultimate trophy wife.”The same article called the Madison the female equivalent of the Capital Club. The Capital Club rushed out an e-mail message to the Madison’s board insisting they “do not want the Madison to be referenced as the female equivalent to the club.”Mr. Lapinski, the Capital Club’s president, said: “We have always welcomed everyone to our events. And some members worried that referring to the organizations as equivalents would have a negative impact on attendance at our events by our friends in the Junior League and other non-Madison ladies.”When the sun went down at Swine on the Vine, a few couples retreated to blankets by the bonfire, but the majority jammed together in front of the stage to hear the band, as if they were at a high school dance. Men on the sideline fired up cigars.At the end of the night, 10 empty kegs were lined up as people danced to the last song, Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’.” A young man stumbled out of the darkness while rebuttoning his untucked white shirt. Guests left in pairs, holding hands, while some single women consoled each other. “He’s a dirtbag,” one said.“I just want to get out of here,” her friend said.A boisterous group piled into the Hummer limo, and all of the cars headed back to Washington together.'"
"'06-10-22,'0','I am concerned that The Times has joined a chorus that unfairly targets public school spending in general and designated aid to the 31 special needs districts as the cause of the current fiscal crisis in New Jersey (“Crunch Time on Property Taxes,” editorial, Oct. 15). Surely, this crisis has multiple causes.We should celebrate New Jersey’s willingness to spend $11,500 per pupil for the next generation. This investment is also the engine of economic growth and productivity. Not coincidentally, New Jersey recently edged past Connecticut as the state with the highest per capita income.We should be equally proud that New Jersey’s poorest children in the special needs districts are finally getting a fair shake thanks to the courageous, three-decade bipartisan effort of the New Jersey Supreme Court. This is a historic achievement.To help hard-pressed homeowners, New Jersey might explore what Maine has done by providing a “circuit breaker” that reduces property taxes for people whose tax exceeds 4 percent of their income. Revenue for such measures could be found by raising taxes for the very wealthy, who have benefited most from rising income and tax cuts in recent years.John C.

"'06-10-22,'0','Giving the Trombone Its Due Respect Your EldersRe “In the Back, by the Tuba, a Star Is Born” [Oct. 8]:Daniel J. Wakin, in his exhaustive article on Charlie Vernon and Christian Lindberg as modern solo trombonists, might have mentioned a few precursors of this “rare moment in the spotlight for an instrument that receives little respect.”In 1815, F. A. Belcke, after two solos with the Gewandhaus orchestra, had a 30-year career as a trombone soloist. Apparently he inspired two other trombonists as soloists: C. T. Queisser and Moritz Nabich. Meanwhile, in New York, Felippe Cioffi began a solo trombonist career, and in Paris, Antoine Dieppo became a renowned trombone soloist and teacher. But it was Davis Schuman, in 1947, who played the first full-length trombone recital. I had the pleasure of working with him in the 1949 Yaddo music festival, where he demonstrated his invention, an angled slide, instead of the original straight slide. (Unfortunately, his creation never caught on with trombonists, perhaps for fear of poking a colleague in the ribs!) And hey — let’s not forget Tommy Dorsey!Les Dreyer New York The writer is a violinist with the Metropolitan Opera.Sharon Waxman’s article “Cyberface” [Oct. 15] argues that animated figures are becoming as expressive as SAG members. Your photograph of the actress Ilana Rogel emoting looks like the actual expressions of a real human being. The cyberface, however, looks exactly like that of an actress who is way too familiar with the Botox needle. Lines are magically erased and the expression looks about as much like a real person’s as, well, as that of an over-Botoxed actress. If this technology heralds the end of flesh-and-blood actors, then perhaps the actors are as much to blame as the technology. After all, haven’t they inured the public to expressionless expressions, thereby paving the way for cyberfaces?S. T. Vanairsdale’s article “Graffiti Cinema Turns Moody” [Oct. 15] failed to note that the first documentary film dealing with New York’s subway graffiti was my “Stations of the Elevated,” filmed in 1977. It was released in 1980 and shown at the 1981 New York Film Festival. It was this film, first shown at the Mannheim Film Festival, that “helped make the nascent graffiti movement a subject of fascination around the world.” It has had a long life; next spring it will be rereleased on DVD together with my new follow-up film, “Spray Masters,” which presents the key writers of the time and their work today.'"
"'06-10-22,'0','Could it be that corporate cash accumulated because of the surging number of companies that had initial public offerings in the 1980’s and 1990’s? After all, newly listed companies typically hold large amounts of cash just after their I.P.O.’s, and they often raise even more money in secondary offerings.But the professors found that this could not explain the long-term trend, because the cash increases were most pronounced at companies that had not recently gone public.The professors also rejected another possible explanation: that the cash hoards resulted from a growing share of corporate income from foreign operations. During much of the period studied, multinational corporations based in the United States would have incurred hefty tax bills had they repatriated the cash held by their foreign divisions. But the researchers found that cash holdings grew just as quickly among companies with no foreign income.So what is the main cause of the climb in corporate cash? Upon analyzing a dozen factors that economic theory suggests could play a role, the professors found that the biggest was an increase in risk — as evidenced by factors like unpredictable cash flow. Corporations have become less able to count on steady cash flow from year to year, according to the professors, and despite the growth of a complex derivatives market, companies can’t adequately hedge this risk without holding more cash.This helps to explain why so few companies are paying out their bigger cash hoards as dividends. Because companies are loath to cut or eliminate a dividend once they start paying it, they won’t establish or increase a dividend unless they are highly confident that they can stick with it through thick and thin. But that confidence is precisely what is missing at a growing number of companies.The professors’ analysis casts an entirely new light on valuation measures that rely on cash levels — gauges like cash-to-assets or cash-to-sales ratios. An investor who relies on such measures often assumes that companies with more cash are less risky, because they have more of a buffer against rainy days.But this assumption may well be wrong, Professor Stulz asserted in an interview, if the companies holding more cash have more rainy days than companies holding less cash.To properly compare two companies on the basis of cash holdings, Professor Stulz says, you should first compare their risk, as measured by factors like the volatility of their cash flows. Only if a company is holding more cash than is justified by its risk can we conclude that it is genuinely more conservative.Professor Stulz says he is not aware of any investment firms that now conduct the econometric calculations needed to make these assessments. And he concedes that those calculations would be complex. But without them, contrasts of companies’ cash levels amount to little more than comparisons of apples and oranges.'"
"'06-10-22,'0','Although last week was balmy, building owners are required to provide heat on cold days, beginning Oct. 1, and there have been a string of days when the temperature dropped into the 40’s and low 50’s since then. Ms. Mendlowitz said her doctor told her the cold was aggravating her arthritis.On Tuesday, she said, the condominium developers, the Chetrit Group, provided her with a single space heater “the size of a toaster” to heat her huge seven-room apartment on the 15th floor, which has a view of Central Park. It provided enough heat to warm the bathroom floor, she said.The apartment is listed for $6 million, but Ms. Mendlowitz is under no pressure to buy: the rent-regulated tenants left in the building are protected from eviction.Neill Coleman, a spokesman for the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, confirmed that a series of heat complaints had been received from tenants in the building and said that inspections would be carried out.“Owners need to provide heat after Oct. 1,” he said. “They can’t rely on what the weather might or might not be.”Carrie Chiang, a broker at the Corcoran Group, said that about half of the 33 available apartments were in contract and were expected to start closing soon. Larger classic two-bedrooms, with more than 2,000 square feet of space, are being offered at around $3 million and up, and several studios are available starting at $767,000.Officials at the Chetrit Group, a private family-owned company, declined to comment on the tenant complaints. One building employee said the new heating system and newly restored elevators could not be turned on until Con Edison upgraded the electrical service. Tenants said that wiring within the building had also not been completed.Ms. Chiang said 4 or 5 of the 15 remaining tenants in the building had agreed to buy-out offers and would soon leave. But others plan to stay.Amelia Betancourt, a teacher who lives in a Classic 6 on the second floor, said her family had lived in the building since it opened in 1929, when her great-grandparents rented an apartment. “I am not leaving,” she said. Her rent is about $1,700 a month, she said.“It has been such a disruption in our lives,” she said. “We can forget about celebrating Thanksgiving here or Christmas here. But we know there will be an end.”No New Condominiums at the Old Sutton HotelLIKE a ghost haunting the Internet past, the Web site of the Sutton East Condominium still shows the layouts and prices of its 78 apartments on East 56th Street near First Avenue, with their Poggenpohl cabinets, Sub-Zero refrigerators and granite countertops. Prices are as high as $2.9 million for a two-bedroom penthouse with terrace.But none of this is to be. Kenneth S. Horn, the developer and president of Alchemy Properties, has notified would-be buyers, including eight with signed contracts, that his plans for the condos have been abandoned, and the building, until recently known as the Sutton Hotel, has been sold. It is once again to be operated as a hotel for long-term guests. Deposits were returned.“It was flip-flopped,” Mr. Horn said. “Sometimes in business these things happen.”Behind the sale, he said, was a shift in the real estate market. As hotels were sold and converted into condos in the last few years, a shortage of hotel rooms developed, and the value of hotels soared, along with rates for Manhattan hotel rooms, making hotels potentially as valuable as condominiums, with less risk to developers.Mr. Horn’s condominium plan was actually the second to be abandoned in recent weeks when a building was sold to hotel operators. At the Web site of 485 Fifth Avenue at Bryant Park, would-be buyers are still greeted with the message “Visionaires Are Welcome” and the offer of a “couture concierge.”But Visionaires beware. The building, a former office building on the east side of Fifth Avenue near East 41st Street, was sold last month by the Carlyle Group and Belfonti Capital Partners to an affiliate of Global Hyatt, the hotel holding company, for $136 million. When they bought, the price was reported to be $88 million.The Sutton opened in 1929, with Nathanael West, the novelist, as its first manager. Mr. Horn paid $52.3 million for the 17-story building last year and drafted a condo conversion plan with a total value, once all the apartments were sold, of $99.6 million. Instead, he sold the building last month to Korman Communities, an operator of long-term-stay hotels, for $88 million, after a modest renovation was completed.When the building was sold, Mr. Horn said, the hotel was getting $5,000 to $6,000 a month per room. Now the hotel is open again and has been renamed the AKA: Sutton Place.Monthly rates range from $11,850 to $14,800 and nightly rates from $695 to $895.'"
"'06-10-22,'0','THERE’S something about the first glimpse of the Taos Mesa as you travel north from Santa Fe, up the narrow canyon of the Rio Grande past Embudo. A series of long, sweeping bends brings you over a brow, and suddenly the view ahead opens out onto empty, bare land, with a smoky gorge cut into it like the Great Rift Valley of Africa. Ten miles off stands a bulk of dark, brooding mountains. One of the biggest, bald Taos Mountain, sits bolted to the plain like a remonstrance. At its foot the town of Taos spreads like litter glinting in the sun.It would be impossible to live at the foot of that mountain for a thousand years, as the Indians of the Taos Pueblo have done, and not come to think of it as sentient — the Kong of northern New Mexico. This was, in a sense, why the painters who “colonized” the area in the early 1900’s came. As one of them, Maynard Dixon, put it: “You can’t argue with those desert mountains — and if you live among them enough — like the Indian does — you don’t want to. They have something for us much more real than some imported art style.”This was the creed of the American modernists who clustered in Taos in the early decades of the last century: Taos would be a fount of a new Americanism in art, an ever-flowing alternative to Europe. But Taos also had its appeal for Europeans. Lawrence, Aldous Huxley, Carl Jung and Leopold Stokowski were only a few of the European artists and thinkers who found their way there. The reason they went was because of one pioneering American woman.It was from the foot of Taos mountain that Mabel Dodge Luhan — heiress, patroness, columnist, early proponent (and victim) of psychoanalysis, memoirist and hostess — planned the rebirth of Western civilization. She moved to Taos from the East Coast in 1917 and fell in love not only with the place but also with Tony Lujan (later anglicized to Luhan), a chief in the nearby pueblo. She promptly left her second husband, married Tony and expanded a house on the edge of town, turning it into an adobe fantasy castle (what Dennis Hopper, who owned it in the 1970’s, would later call the Mud Palace), and began to invite scores of cultural luminaries. The idea was to expose them to the Indian culture she believed held the cure for anomic, dissociated modern humanity. After dinner, drummers and dancers from the pueblo would entertain the household.Today her house is a museum, guesthouse and literary shrine all in one. For anyone on the trail of Lawrence, it’s the first of three essential ports of call. As I make my way up the groaning narrow stairs, the sense not just of history but of peace hits me: no TVs, no telephones. Instead, the deep quiet of an old, applianceless home. There are a bathroom with windows that Lawrence painted in colorful geometric and animal designs in 1922 to protect Mabel Luhan’s modesty, and floorboards across which Ansel Adams, Alfred Stieglitz, Georgia O’Keeffe and Thomas Wolfe creaked. (In fact Wolfe stayed only one night. He arrived late and drunk, decided he didn’t like it and fled the next morning.)With its kiva fireplaces and gleaming cabinets of books, the Mabel Dodge Luhan House is a strange mix of adobe curvaceousness and a country house fit for an Agatha Christie mystery. Behind it, sage scrub sweeps up to the hills. Before, a rough-hewed colonnade gives onto a courtyard of uneven flagstones. At each corner of the main building giant adobe buttresses keep the walls up, as if they might otherwise slump like wet sand.I’ve been a few times, and it’s a fascinating place to stay, with all the rooms eccentrically different. My favorite is Luhan’s solarium at the top of the house, a glassed-in room where in spring you can watch blizzards of fluffy seeds float among cottonwoods and birches gauzy with new leaf. Through the trees to the north, the blue massif of Taos Mountain looms.Luhan particularly set her sights on Lawrence, seeing in him her ideal spokesman. She pleaded with famous friends to intercede and even sent Lawrence’s wife, Frieda, a necklace steeped in irresistible Indian magic. Her schemes worked, and Lawrence arrived in 1922. But relations between Luhan and the Lawrences soon soured, and she packed them off to a ranch she owned in the mountains 17 miles north of Taos.The last time I was at the Lawrence ranch, just after Christmas, snow lay on the ground, the roofs were crisp with a frozen bed of it and long gray icicles hung from the gutters like beards on old-time Russian mystics. The bottoms of the clouds drifted through the big ponderosas. My mother was with me, visiting from England, and was overawed to be standing in the home of her early-adulthood hero. Why did he ever leave, she kept musing aloud, as we peered through the windows into the locked cabin. Behind us an ancient ponderosa stirred and let down a shiver of crystalline snow that glittered in the high air.Lawrence was here three times from 1922 to 1925 and spent only 11 months in total in New Mexico. But the ranch was the only home he ever owned. With her undaunted generosity, Luhan gave it to him. The Lawrences, however, didn’t like feeling indebted, and in return they gave her the manuscript of his novel “Sons and Lovers.” It was a move they would regret when they discovered that as much as they loved the ranch, it was worth $1,000, whereas the manuscript might have fetched $50,000.The ranch seems to have less to do with the Southwest of the Indian that Lawrence was looking for than with that of the cowboy. Three old log cabins with dark planks, low roofs and rough board doors have the look of the haven of one of those cantankerous old white mountain-men in a Western. And, in fact, there is a rather cantankerous, though extremely helpful, old man who looks after the place — so independent-minded he preferred to go unnamed.Under a spitting rain on this afternoon, he is not in evidence at first but soon emerges in a reluctantly friendly mood.“Just ’tween us,” he begins, “I don’t think much of Lawrence.” Not a great opening. But he turns out to be not only salt of the earth, but also a mine of information, ambling up from his office to show me around the cabins.“Back in the old days, people used every part of an animal they killed. This used to be a blood floor,” he explains, speaking of the three-room cabin the Lawrences lived in. Apparently cow’s blood was mixed with adobe to make a smooth, slick floor. “Wood was too expensive.”The blood has gone, replaced by boards. But outside there’s a painting of a buffalo that’s fading on the cracked adobe wall. It was painted by Trinidad Archuleta, an Indian from the Taos Pueblo, who signed his name “TRNRDOD.”“I sure as hell wouldn’t have got along with him,” the old man says of Lawrence. “Woman-beater. Frieda knew him for what he was. She was a mother to him.”And it seems this man knew not only Frieda Lawrence, but Luhan and Dorothy Brett, too, an English aristocrat and painter who doggedly followed Lawrence around the world. “Yes,” he says, “I was friendly with all the three women.”Next door to the Lawrences’ house is a cabin maybe eight foot square, with nothing but a bed, a table and a small stove. Here Lady Brett spent her days and even stayed on after Lawrence had gone — until her death in 1977. Hard of hearing and permanently armed with a long ear-trumpet, she had probably fallen in love with Lawrence and followed him to New Mexico after a disastrous affair with the writer and editor John Middleton Murry, whose wife, the writer Katherine Mansfield, had died only three months before. (The gossip of one time becomes the literary history of the next.)Lawrence had his own reasons for coming to New Mexico. For years he had dreamed of founding a utopian community, to be called Rananim, and hoped to do it there. He was also a consumptive, and what he called his “savage pilgrimage,” his worldwide search for a civilization answering to humanity’s spiritual needs, was in part a search for a good climate. New Mexico, unlike Texas and California, welcomed tuberculosis sufferers. High, dry, clean air — just what the doctor ordered. With Lady Brett next door, and Lawrence and Frieda in the main cabin, this was as close as Rananim ever came to reality: three Europeans flung up a mountain north of Taos.Here Lawrence not only wrote under a lofty pine later immortalized by O’Keeffe in “The Lawrence Tree,” he also began to dabble in painting himself, signing his canvases “Lorenzo.” Today, there are nine Lawrence oils that hang in La Fonda Hotel on Taos plaza. They were exhibited in London in 1929, but the show was closed at once on grounds of obscenity (a move prompted mostly by Lawrence’s notoriety as the author of “Lady Chatterley’s Lover”; the paintings are tame), and the pictures were condemned to be destroyed. Lawrence promised to whisk them away from British soil, and they were spared. After Lawrence died, Frieda Lawrence continued to live in New Mexico, and the paintings wound up in the hands of Saki Karavas, the longtime owner of La Fonda, who died in 1998.I met Mr. Karavas on my first visit to New Mexico. Clad typically in a silk robe and with a cheroot in hand, he struck a cultivated figure and rarely rose before noon. He kept the pictures in his office, a small cluttered room behind the reception desk.The leering faces, the swaths of muddily painted human flesh and the rather awkward postures of the figures — something like Gauguin on a very bad day — didn’t make for the best décor, but Mr. Karavas had high hopes for them. One day, either a museum would offer some staggering sum or the British government would acquiesce to his long-cherished dream of returning the Lawrence oils to England in exchange for Britain’s return of the Elgin Marbles, taken from the Parthenon in 1806, to Mr. Karavas’s native Greece. He had letters of response to his offer from various British prime ministers framed on the walls: “The P.M. Mrs. Thatcher regrets that the quid pro quo you suggest is not acceptable. ...”Lawrence died in Provence in 1930, and five years later Frieda Lawrence arranged for his ashes to be shipped to Taos, where she was building a mausoleum at the ranch. It seems she and Mabel Dodge Luhan had divergent plans for his ashes. Luhan thought Lawrence would have wanted them scattered, while his wife, who died in Taos in 1956, intended them for the shrine. To end the debate, she is said to have tipped the urn into a batch of fresh cement, ensuring that the remains wound up in her memorial.According to some locals, Frieda Lawrence then declared of Lady Brett and Luhan: “Now let’s see them steal him.”In many ways Luhan’s message to the world worked. She put Taos, where she died in 1962, on the map as one of the pre-eminent centers of American modernism. It is astounding that such a small, formerly obscure place should have drawn such major figures of 20th-century art, and even European royalty, including Prince Peter of Greece in the 1950’s. Meanwhile psychoanalysis spread, as she wished. And under Mr. Hopper’s stewardship in the 1970’s, the old house continued to be host to a glowing countercultural guest list, including Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen.There is something slightly off about declaring love for a land not your own, the kind of thing Edwardian aesthetes went in for. But there are some places — Provence and Venice, for example — that exert a power over the imagination that is a kind of love and seems available to people from anywhere, even rainy Britain. Northern New Mexico is one such place.When British friends ask me why I’m living in New Mexico, I can’t answer without reference to Lawrence. He may have gone out of fashion, but he opened the way not just in literature, but in geography, too. Many Europeans have followed him. Sometimes it feels as if he made Taos’s corner of the world a little corner of Europe. He may have been incurably restless, but I can understand my mother’s bewilderment at why he ever left. As Lawrence put it: “It is the ghosts one misses most, the ghosts there, of the Rocky Mountains, that never go beyond the timber. I know them, they know me: we go well together.”The Mabel Dodge Luhan House (240 Morada Lane, Taos; 800-846-2235; www.mabeldodgeluhan.com) operates as a bed-and-breakfast year-round. There are no TV’s or telephones, some rooms have shared bathrooms, and there are some steep narrow stairs in the main house. Accommodations in the annex are more modern. Wherever you stay, you can feast at the incredible breakfast buffet in the old dining room. Rates are $95 to $220.La Fonda Hotel (on the plaza in Taos, 800-833-2211; www.lafondataos.com) has some furniture originally painted by D. H.Lawrence, and his oil paintings are here. Rates are $159 to $229.WHERE TO EAT AND DRINKJoseph’s Table (505-751-4512, www.josephstable.com) moved from its hole-in-the-wall premises a few miles down the highway to downstairs in La Fonda a few years ago. Its reputation as one of the best Southwestern restaurants has only been amplified since the move. Dinner for two could easily set you back $100, not including wine or tip. Unmissable.A favorite is Taos Pizza Out Back (712 North Pueblo Road, 505-758-3112; http://marketplace.taosnews.com), a scruffy, intimate, charming place just north of downtown, with imaginative pizzas and superb soups at very reasonable prices.The indispensable reading on Lawrence and Mabel Dodge Luhan in New Mexico is Lois P. Rudnick’s scholarly but readable “Utopian Vistas: The Mabel Dodge Luhan House and the American Counterculture.” Otherwise, there’s Luhan’s “Edge of Taos Desert: An Escape to Reality” and Lawrence’s “Mornings in Mexico,” which covers both old Mexico and the Southwest in general.The Albuquerque airport is well served by most major airlines. From there, rent a car and drive two and a half hours north to Taos, passing through Santa Fe.'"
"'06-10-22,'0','Delta is the latest airline to enter the increasingly competitive flat-bed race.Realizing it had to bolster amenities to compete for premium customers, Delta Air Lines plans to install lie-back seats in the BusinessElite cabins on all its Boeing 777 aircraft by 2009. The year after, the company hopes to also have lie-flat seats on its 767’s.Delta, which is operating under bankruptcy protection, says it will cost $2 million to put the seats in each 777. The seats will go to 6 feet 3 inches and have an entertainment unit with on-demand digital video and music.“Of course, we have to get our costs down, which we are doing,” said Betsy Talton, a Delta spokeswoman. “But we also have to invest in a product that our customers want to fly.”British Airways was the first to introduce lie-flat seats, adding them to its business class cabins on long-haul flights in 2000.'"
"'06-10-22,'0','Love and skill are lavished on the simplest dishes — tiny, tender lamb chops, neglected freshwater fish like perch and pike-perch (sander), eggs poached in red wine (oeufs en meurette), toothsome squab, black currant sorbet, even snails — great fat ones, bubbling happily in their shells, bathed in garlic, parsley, butter and Pernod. Here is the food most of us travel to France to taste, and who can resist it once tasted? Here, too, are the little regional wines we search for — especially Beaujolais, 60 of them, including 30 from Fleurie itself, one of the 10 designated crus known for excellence.Americans of my vintage (b. 1934), weaned on the red-tablecloth food of the Italian south, were later taught that it was uncool, compared with the blander specialties of Milan and Venice. But we were also taught that in Italian cooking, the quality of ingredients is everything, and it is the south — the Mezzogiorno — that produces the juiciest fruits, the briniest clams and tuna, the best buffalo-milk mozzarella cheese, and the world's most sumptuous tomatoes, known as San Marzanos and raised near Mount Vesuvius, just south of Naples.Alfonso and Livia Iaccarino (she of the zippy white patent-leather boots) grow herbs, lemons and peaches, artichokes and eggplants and, of course, prize tomatoes, plus the olives for their own tangy, fruity oil, in a sun-kissed garden facing the Isle of Capri near their restaurant on the Sorrento peninsula. In their lovely pastel dining room, they serve fresh, understated, unmistakably Italian food in great profusion — ravioli with caciotta (a sheep's milk cheese), wild marjoram, barely heated chopped tomatoes and basil; rolls of baby sirloin filled with raisins, pine nuts, parsley and garlic, atop a ragout of wild endive; rabbit simply but exquisitely grilled with herbs; squid and baby octopus of a very high caliber. The tufa cellar, first excavated by the Etruscans, is stocked with wines from all around the world.I'll take a pass here on El Bulli; for one thing, you don't need me to tell you about it, and for another, Arzak is more to my taste. It is nicely poised between an older, French-inspired style of innovation, as represented by Juan Mari Arzak, who trained in the nouvelle cuisine kitchen of the Troisgros brothers in Roanne (where I myself spent a few happy days long ago), and the new wave of ground-breaking Spanish cooking, as exemplified by Ferran Adrià and his disciples, including Mr. Arzak's daughter, Elena.The result is an enriched, reinvigorated Basque cuisine that retains a sense of tradition and place. One fine Easter day, my wife, Betsey, and I ate our Paschal lamb — a custom throughout Christendom, and especially among the sheep-herding Basques — at the Arzaks' 110-year-old roadside tavern, rated three stars in the Michelin guide. Rather than run-of-the-mill gigot, however, a faintly gamy deboned chop came to the table wearing a tissuelike coffee-flavored “veil” — a taste-enhancing shroud made by baking a layer of café con leche between sheets of Silpat pan liner. With the pan juices poured over the meat, partly melting the “veil,” you get a sauce remarkably reminiscent of American red-eye gravy.Arzak's food is modern and entertaining like that, often witty, never overwrought, limited largely to local ingredients — white tuna, fresh figs, fino sherry. Or a hyperfresh egg, seasoned with house-made truffle oil, wrapped in plastic film, poached and served with a slim txistorra sausage made not just with the traditional paprika but with dates as well. The egg emerged looking a little like a flower, and cutting into the ravishingly milky white revealed a richly orange yolk. Magic.I'm an unapologetic classicist, no particular fan of foams and chemical legerdemain in the kitchen (although I have maintained a fondness for the then-revolutionary cuisine of Haeberlin, Bocuse and Guérard since encountering it for the first time in the 1960's). I can still find refined food that tastes like what it is, to quote Curnonsky's maxim, at Paris three-stars like Taillevent, but no place there or elsewhere excels Comme Chez Soi in this genre — and at Comme Chez Soi you dine in a superb décor of warm, tawny wood in the style of the great Belgian practitioner of Art Nouveau, Victor Horta. Nor is price a minor matter: a set-price meal is served at lunch and dinner, for 67 euros (about $85, at $1.30 to the euro), no snip but a real bargain in these days of watery dollars.There is originality, even alchemy, in Pierre Wynants's sole stuffed with crab, which comes to the table with shrimp in a tarragon sauce, but there is no trickery. Betsey and I feasted years ago on a saddle of lamb that was merely perfect, a triumph of technique.Even on the small menu, generous to a fault, there is no dearth of imagination or regional and international inspiration; on one recent visit, it included a shimmering green pea soup with oxtail and Chimay beer, filets of eel with Espelette peppers from the Basque country, chicken with turmeric and apple chutney and the silkiest, most delicate floating island of my life, better even than my sainted grandmother's.Clubbish in location, in looks and for the most part clubbish in clientele, wonderful Wilton's in fact affords a cheerful, courteous welcome to all who show up in properly sober clothes, ready to pay the sobering prices. The best English food (as opposed to the best food in England, which is so grandly cosmopolitan these days) is still that which has been least messed about with. That is just what Wilton's delivers. “Noted since 1742 for the finest oysters, fish and game,” it says of itself, with every justification.You might start with a half-dozen oysters. They will set you back a pretty penny, but then they are imposing creatures, five inches across, pale beige rather than silver-gray, in shells as flat as saucers. They come from West Mersea, on an island off the Essex coast, from beds that are harvested exclusively from rowboats, lest oil or gasoline pollute the waters. They are opened by London's best oysterman, Patrick Flaherty, a 40-year veteran when I last checked. None of the briny juices escape. No nasty bits of shell creep in. Then maybe a wild salmon from the Spey in Scotland (increasingly rare), or a snowy hunk of halibut — “a nice piece of fish,” as I once heard Rex Harrison call it.But whole Dover sole is the overwhelming choice of English connoisseurs: brushed with melted butter, sprinkled with salt and pepper, turned quickly on the grill so that the grill bars burn a dark lattice pattern into the fish, then cooked under the intense heat of the broiler for roughly 12 to 15 minutes. Perfectly simple, simply perfect and entirely sufficient. This is the porterhouse steak of fish. No sauce is needed, partly because cooking the fish whole (“on the bone”) helps to keep it moist. You may well come across an occasional apostate who insists upon tartar sauce (much too robust, in my view) or hollandaise (too rich). In game season, both partridge and grouse are exemplary.I envy the Swedes their social conscience, their gift for design and urban planning and their fish. Especially their fish. And among their fish — sole, cod, plaice, scallops, langoustines — especially their unmatched herring. Leif Mannerstrom, who owns and cooks at this charming former warehouse of the Swedish East India Company, built on the waterfront in 1775, is so widely admired for his knowledge of things piscatorial that he is pictured on a national postage stamp, and more than 10,000 people come from all over Scandinavia each year for his Christmas-season feast of 16 herrings.Matjes, pickled, fried or bathed in mustard-and-dill-sauce — the richly flavored herring — is, of course, available all year long at Sjomagasinet, to be devoured with well-aged, Cheddar-ish Vasterbotten cheese, with or without cumin, and icy draughts of O. P. Anderson, Gothenburg's favorite aquavit. And all year long, Mr. Mannerstrom turns out a definitive version of Janssons Frestelse, or Jansson's Temptation, a confection of scalloped potatoes, onions and herrings cured in the style of anchovies, which I find an inspired combination of salty and creamy flavors.I can hear you sputtering from here. What? Fly all night to Argentina to eat in a parilla when every big city in the United States boasts steakhouses promising (some even delivering) prime U.S.D.A. beef? Well, this is grass-fed beef, raised on the vast ocean of chlorophyll called the Pampas. It's different. Some, including me, would say better, with a rounder flavor, leaner texture and sweeter fat. You eat in a handsome wood-and-leather room in the redeveloped Puerto Madero docklands area, and drink from a wine-wall stocked with fine Mendoza reds like those of Nicolas Catena.Octavio Caraballo, the owner, supplies all the beef from his own ranch, or estancia. We flew there with him — big guy, bigger cigar, even at 8 in the morning — on his private plane, admired the spread and ate beef (what else?) for lunch. The selection was bigger at dinner back in town, with medallón de lomo (tenderloin) and cuadril (rump) and ojo de bife (rib-eye) covering every inch of the big grills. Little “bombon” sausages and sweetbreads, too.Warning: They will ply you with so many delicious breads, so many salads and such superb cheese and olives and peppers, that you might not be able to do justice to the beef. Which would be tragic.I have lived in Asia and eaten more than my share of Chinese food, Lord knows, but I remain a man of the West, not the East, and I still find the Chinese passion for “gristly, slithery and squelchy textures,” as the English writer Fuchsia Dunlop calls them, hard to cope with. Delicacies like sea cucumber and bird's nest have little taste, Asian friends tell me, but great “kou gan,” or mouth feel, which escapes me.Hence I tread lightly here. I would happily fly to Shanghai to eat the seraphic — yes, seraphic — soup dumplings at Nan Xiang, or the snails with chopped, spiced pork at tiny Chun. But I would be more likely to go to Jean-Georges Vongerichten's glamorous place on the Bund, the best of all his places, in my view, where the food is a little Eastern, a little Western.A year ago, as I reported in the Travel section, Betsey and I ate a nearly flawless meal there. A single Kumamoto oyster wreathed in Champagne jelly was followed by raw tuna brightened by Thai chili paste. Then cubed raw kingfish with Taiwanese mangoes and chili-lemon granita was utterly irresistible — peppery, sweet and acidic, yellow and orange and red, all at once. A second trio, equally satisfying, comprised crab dumplings with black pepper oil and tiny local peas; seared sweet scallops from Dalian, nestling with clams in a tomato jus; and superbly fresh snapper with crunchy cucumber strips. Vaut le voyage, as Michelin would have it.This, I think, is the only truly remarkable restaurant I have ever discovered solely on the recommendation of a friend of a friend. Dubious, Betsey and I made our way there one night years ago and liked it so much that we went back 72 hours later. It was not the décor, which is shabby, or the service, which can be surly, and certainly not the menu, which is very nearly useless. It's the food, stupid, the seafood.Enormous king crabs fresh from the Indian Ocean, awash in butter, and seasoned with garlic and pepper until they make the lips tingle but not sting, draw an eager crowd of Mumbai businessmen and Bollywood stars to this little establishment on a crowded, noisy alley in the old Fort district. If you like, your crab will be brought to the table before cooking, still alive and dangling from a string held by a waiter.These are among the world's choicest crustaceans, and I say that as someone who lives 25 miles from the Chesapeake. But Ravi Anchan has plenty of other savory delights up his sleeve, including tender little pomfret (a kind of butterfish) barbecued in the style of Hyderabad, with black pepper; deep-fried squid; and gorgeous, never-frozen tiger prawns grilled with mint. Don't mind the waiters; insist and they will bring what you want.Among Sydney chefs, Tetsuya Wakuda, with his confit of Tasmanian ocean trout, and Neil Perry of Rockpool, with his mud crabs, get most of the international ink, and rightly so; they are as gifted as any of their counterparts in Europe or America. But I would head from my Qantas jet for Billy Kwong, my favorite neighborhood restaurant (whose neighborhood, unfortunately, is exactly 9,758 miles from mine). This is the trim, dark, bustling domain of Kylie Kwong, a 36-year-old wunderkind whose mile-wide smile and black-framed glasses are as well known Down Under as is Jacques Pépin's cherubic face Up Here.Her food is delicious, and her place gives off none of those Chinese-speakers-only vibes that plague us Anglophones; Ms. Kwong, Australian-born, speaks no Chinese herself. So order to your heart's content, in English, and flail away as the plates arrive, rat-a-tat: prawn wontons, little flavor bombs bursting with the tastes of shellfish, black vinegar and chili oil; star-anise-flavored tofu and black cloud-ear fungus, with Thai and Vietnamese herbs; chive crepes with smoky caramelized eggplant salad; steamed line-caught blue-eyed cod with ginger and shallots; spectacularly crisp-skinned duck with a sauce made from ruby grapefruit; and sung choi bao — wok-fried mouthfuls of moist, gingery pork and vegetables, wrapped in crisp lettuce leaves. The inspiration is Cantonese, absorbed by Kylie at her mother's table, but the execution is all her own.I have shortchanged Turkey, Thailand and Japan. I know, and I apologize. Put it down to limited space and inadequate depth of knowledge. There should be enough here to hold you — hopefully to set you soaring — for a few weeks or months, or even years.'"
"'06-10-22,'0','Maybe arrogance left them in a lull. Destiny had picked them, right? The American League was superior, wasn’t it?Leyland seemed to play into the theme of overconfidence in the third inning when he trusted Justin Verlander to face the serial brute Albert Pujols.“I pitched to him, and obviously he burned us,” Leyland said.Pujols put an uppercut on a two-run homer that left the Leyland faithful in the right-field stands asking, “What was he thinking?”It was a quiet rumble of discontent, though. After all, the Tigers have a habit of teasing giddy anticipation with bursts of folly.There is still plenty of time for the Tigers to find themselves, for Leyland to refocus the team with a scolding if necessary. Detroiters believe in Leyland’s resuscitation skills because they know a little bit about rebirths.Of all small-town Jims — a guy reared an hour away in Perrysburg, Ohio — Leyland is urban renewal.“When I heard Jimmy Leyland when he first came to town, how he talked about winning and championships and revival, I knew people didn’t believe him,” Detroit Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick said on Friday. “But there is a spirit of can-do here. You can change the culture.”The city’s hope brokers played host to the Super Bowl in February, but that was a party for everyone else. The Super Bowl is a gilded squatter, plopping down, not moving for a week, so every outsider in a limo can pull up to indulge. The World Series is local, not global, and it’s a party for the people.“It’s interesting to me,” Kilpatrick added, “how this issue of a baseball team has turned into an example of hope for the city.”Leyland’s Tigers are reflective of what can develop from a renovation of ideas. For three years, General Manager Dave Dombrowski had to overpay players like Pudge Rodriguez in an effort to lure talent to this losers’ abyss. Dombrowski assembled a collection of castoffs and spare parts.• To pull together a team of square wheels, Detroit didn’t need street cred. The Tigers needed blue-collar cred. They needed Leyland.“He’s often referred to as a blue-collar type of person, and sometimes as an old-time baseball manager,” said Jim’s brother, the Rev. Thomas Leyland, in an e-mail message yesterday.Rev. Leyland understands Detroit. He is the pastor at St. Rose Parish in Perrysburg, but he spent four years at the University of Detroit.“Although I realize that Detroit and the area have many economic classes of people, and although I realize that things have changed since my undergraduate days, there is a kind of basic no-nonsense quality in the people,” said Rev. Leyland, adding that his brother had a big heart “as do the people of mid-America, in my experience.”Detroit has been trying to survive a cycle of failure with its shrinking auto industry, with its futile team. Somehow, out of a stubborn belief in each other, a World Series contender was born. Somehow, in a city seemingly destined to despair, there are construction cranes downtown. Reparation is far from completion, but at least now there is a team to love and a manger to identify with.That’s what made Game 1 so baffling. The Tigers bore no resemblance to Leyland. In fact, the Tigers looked like a team in costume — like the fans who, on Friday, played dress up in a Magglio Ordóñez lookalike contest, complete with curly wigs.The Tigers can reclaim their identity in Game 2. They’re good at transformation. They’ve taken notes on Leyland’s comeback.After he burned out in Colorado six years ago, Leyland retreated to the grassroots of baseball, to fundamentals, hitting backyard fungos to his son as a Little League parent.“I think what it did is it made me realize that watching my son play made me more nervous than managing in the major leagues,” Leyland said Friday. “I don’t know if that’s why I came back for sure or not. But it’s kind of hard to believe that a year ago I was throwing batting practice to a bunch of 13-year-olds on some kind of field that looked nothing like Comerica Park.”Embrace it, and it can embrace you right back. When the Tigers closed out its American League division series victory over the Yankees, Leyland walked to the backstop, leaned through the netting and kissed his wife.A lovestruck fan pushed against the net loops for a smooch, too. And so Leyland obliged by giving the guy a peck on the bill of his Tigers cap.He was in no mood to hug anyone after Game 1. But Leyland is a sap beneath the gristle and smoke, blemishes and hollow cheeks. He is Detroit.“I think the team is emblematic of the city,” Kilpatrick said. “Just a bunch of hard-working guys no one expected to win.”'"

"'06-10-23,'1','ATLANTA, Oct. 23 — For years, there had been talk of building a civil rights museum in Atlanta, but no decisions had been made as to where it would be, what it would include and how much it would cost.One of those questions was answered today when the chairman and chief executive officer of the Coca-Cola Company, Neville Isdell, said it would donate 2.5 acres of land for the project in the heart of the downtown tourist district.The land, which Mr. Isdell said was valued at $8 million to $11 million, is part of a downtown parcel that includes the city’s new aquarium and the new World of Coca-Cola, to open next May. The hope is that the aquarium, which has had more than three million visitors since it opened last November, will boost traffic for the area’s other attractions, including CNN and Centennial Olympic Park.Mayor Shirley Franklin, who endorsed the idea of the civil rights museum after she was approached by Andrew Young, the former mayor, and Evelyn Lowery, founder of the Women’s Organizational Movement for Equality of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said similar projects in other cities had cost between $50 and upwards of $100 million. Still, no specific plans for the museum have been announced and Coca-Cola’s gift would be the first contribution to the effort.“It’s something that I’ve been talking quietly to people about, including Mr. Isdell, recognizing that it takes a long time to put these things together,” Mayor Franklin said.'"
"'06-10-23,'1','The Wm Wrigley Jr. Company, maker of Doublemint chewing gum, Altoids breath mints and Life Savers hard candy, has reached outside its founding family for the first time in 114 years and selected William D. Perez, a consumer products industry veteran, as its new chief executive.Mr. Perez, who was chief executive of the household products manufacturer S. C. Johnson & Son for eight years, most recently served a brief tenure as chief executive of Nike, but left abruptly after clashing with that company’s founder, Philip H. Knight.In his new post at Wrigley, Mr. Perez once again finds himself leading a company whose previous chief executive will remain heavily involved. Bill Wrigley Jr., who is stepping down as chief executive, will stay on as chairman of the board and hold the new title of executive chairman, overseeing the company’s long-term expansion efforts.By ceding much of his authority to an outsider, Mr. Wrigley is breaking with the paternalistic tradition of the company that his great-grandfather founded in 1891. Analysts said that Mr. Perez’s success in his new job will depend largely on how much autonomy he is given.Mr. Wrigley gave no indication today that he would fade quietly into the background. In an e-mail he sent to employees, Mr. Wrigley wrote that he will remain “actively engaged” in managing the company. He called the appointment of Mr. Perez “an historic and important milestone” in the history of the company, which is based in Chicago.'"
"'06-10-23,'1','Many ideas — new and not so new — are being discussed in Washington, like a sectarian division of Iraq (which the current government and many Iraqis oppose); and starting talks with Iraq’s neighbor, Iran (which the Iraqi government is already doing, but the United States is not). Some of these ideas look appealing simply because they have not been put to the test.However the broader strategy may be amended, nothing can work if Baghdad becomes a war-torn Beirut. Baghdad security may not be a sufficient condition for a more stable Iraq, but it is a necessary condition for any alternative plan that does not simply abandon the Iraqis to their fate.It is hard to see how any Iraq plan can work if the capital’s citizens cannot be protected.The current operation is called Together Forward II, the second phase of an effort begun in July to reduce violence in Baghdad. The name reflects the core assumption that the Iraqi government is to be an equal partner in regaining control of its capital. Necessarily, the security plan requires an integrated political and military approach, since its goal is not to vanquish an enemy on a foreign battlefield but to bring order to a militia-and-insurgent-plagued city.But the early returns have raised searching questions as to whether the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is truly prepared to tackle the mission.“It is a decisive period,” said Maj. Gen. J. D. Thurman, the commander of the Fourth Infantry Division and the senior commander of the American forces in Baghdad.“They either seize the opportunity or they don’t,” he said. “If they don’t, then our government is going to have to readjust what we are going to do, and that is not my call.”Since it would take several months to secure and begin reconstruction in the dozen or so strife-ridden neighborhoods that are the focus of the plan, American commanders said the viability of the strategy could not be properly assessed before the year’s end. So far, however, the plan has been short on resources as well as results. The Iraqi Defense Ministry has supplied only two of the six Iraqi Army battalions that General Thurman has requested.That is not just a question of numbers. Some American military officers say they believe the Iraqi Army may be more effective than the Iraq police, and more trusted by local citizens. Yet several Iraqi battalions have deserted rather than follow orders to go to Baghdad, according to American military officials. In the case of these units, summoning them to the Iraqi capital was tantamount to demobilizing them.Some of the Iraqi police forces the Americans must work with have been infiltrated by militias. One Iraqi National Police unit has already been withdrawn from the streets and a training program has been instituted to improve the others. The Americans are carefully monitoring a number of police stations that they say have made common cause with some of the militias and intend to report them to the Iraqi government.The original concept behind the plan was that American forces were to hold cleared areas for 60 to 90 days, during which the process of economic reconstruction would begin. Then American forces would turn the sectors over to Iraqi police and army units, freeing up American troops to tackle security challenges elsewhere in the city. Without sufficient Iraqi forces, however, this process has been hampered and it has been more difficult to prevent militias and insurgents from sneaking back into cleared areas.“What takes the combat power is the holding piece,” said General Thurman. “We can do the clearing. But once you clear if you don’t leave somebody in there and build civil capacity in there then it is the old mud-hole approach. You know the water runs out of the mud hole when you drive through the mud hole and then it runs back in it.”Delays in Iraqi government programs to improve electrical, sewage, water and health facilities have also hampered the effort. It had been expected that such Iraqi programs would begin before Ramadan, the monthlong holiday that is about to end. But the programs are now projected to start in November. In the absence of large-scale Iraqi programs, the Americans have sponsored some smaller efforts to improve sanitation and repair services, programs that have generated jobs and helped lower the unemployment rate in the city.While the sectarian violence would be far worse if not for the American efforts, the number of murders in the Baghdad area has not decreased as hoped. Fifty-two bodies were found in General Thurman’s sector, which includes Baghdad and large swaths of territory north and south of the city, during the first week of August, when the security operations began. During the week that ended Oct. 14, the body count was 176. For the week that ended Oct. 21, the body count was 143, a noteworthy decline but still more than at the start of the operation.There are a number of ideas being discussed in private to fix the plan. Americans still hope to receive additional Iraqi Army forces next month. They also hope to persuade the Iraqi government to purge police stations infiltrated by militias. Iraqi deployment areas may also be realigned.American forces have already shifted some forces to new high-violence sectors and may make further adjustments. Shrinking the military zone controlled by the American Baghdad-based division, which now extends south to the cities of Najaf and Karbala, has also been discussed as a way to increase the density of American troops in the capital.Erecting more barricades to section off parts of the city has been proposed by some officers. So has legitimizing some neighborhood watch organizations. That idea cuts against the policy to abolish militias but has been advocated by some military officials as a useful expedient.Keeping the Army’s Fourth Division in place in Baghdad instead of rotating it home when it is to be replaced by the First Cavalry Division would substantially increase the number of American troops in the city. But there have been no indications that such an idea is under serious consideration.In the final analysis, American officers say, much is in Iraqi hands. The American military is looking toward the Maliki government to finally disband the militias and reintegrate them into Iraqi society. It is not clear if the Iraqi government will follow through on such a step since some senior Iraqi officials have said the militias cannot be broken up until the Sunni-based insurgency is brought to heel.American officials also say that the Iraqi government needs to more strictly enforce bans on the possession of illicit weapons and accelerate its reconstruction and job creation programs.“Part of our problem is that we want this more than they do,” General Thurman said, alluding to the effort to get the Iraqis to put aside sectarian differences and build a unified Iraq. “We need to get people to stop worrying about self and start worrying about Iraq. And that is going to take national unity.”“Until we get that settled I think we are going to struggle,” he added.'"
"'06-10-23,'1','Others think that even if such a ruling were to galvanize Republicans elsewhere, it would barely register in New Jersey. Mr. Menendez and his Republican challenger, State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr., have both supported some benefits for domestic partners, but have said they believe marriage should be between a man and a woman.Yet even those who study the court’s daily moves concede that they have no way of knowing what the justices will do or when they will do it. In fact, the court has no deadline; unlike the United States Supreme Court, it can carry cases over from one term to the next. One decision issued in August, for example, came 20 months after oral arguments. And court officials say a retired justice may vote and even write opinions in cases that he or she heard.The New Jersey Supreme Court, widely known as one of the most liberal state high courts in the nation, is also seen as among the most independent — a point that supporters of gay marriage have emphasized as appellate courts in three other states ruled this year that their constitutions do not include such rights for same-sex couples.The Court of Appeals of New York, the state’s highest court, rejected a similar case in July. Gay-marriage proponents have since lost cases before the Supreme Court of Washington State and an intermediate appeals court in California. Other state courts had rebuffed similar constitutional challenges before, and 19 states have enacted constitutional amendments banning gay marriage.While Vermont and Connecticut provide for civil unions, which extend some legal rights to same-sex couples, only Massachusetts — in a 2003 State Supreme Court decision with national reverberations — has recognized a right for them to marry.New Jersey authorizes domestic partnerships, allowing registered partners to make critical medical decisions for each other, for example, and requiring insurance companies to offer health care benefits to the partner of a beneficiary. The case before the court seeks marital rights like entitlement to property acquired during the relationship, financial support when the relationship ends and recognition as a family member for government benefits.It was brought by seven couples who claim that the state’s refusal to give them marriage licenses violates their rights to equal treatment under the State Constitution.There is no explicit ban on same-sex marriage in New Jersey, but lower courts have said that the state’s marriage laws apply only to heterosexual couples and that nothing in the Constitution compels extending them to gays and lesbians.David S. Buckel of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, who with Mr. Lustberg argued the plaintiffs’ case, said gay-rights advocates were optimistic about the appeal because New Jersey’s high court long ago departed from the federal courts’ more restrictive definition of equal protection. “The court is not afraid of controversial issues,” he said.Public opinion here also appears to have shifted since the Massachusetts ruling excited a nationwide backlash. In a Rutgers-Eagleton poll of 803 New Jersey residents in June, 50 percent said they supported legal recognition for gay marriage, while 44 percent opposed it. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus four percentage points. In 2003, when the poll asked state residents the same question, 43 percent of state residents supported gay marriage and 50 percent were opposed.“It seems to be an issue that has passed,” said Ingrid W. Reed, a political scientist at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. When the New Jersey Legislature authorized domestic partnerships in 2004, Ms. Reed said, “there wasn’t a huge energized polarization about the issue, considering how early we did it.”“It seemed to require a public campaign to keep it before the public,” she added, “and that doesn’t seem to be in place in New Jersey.”Still, John Tomicki, the executive director of the League of American Families, a group promoting conservative social policies, said conservatives would fire back if the court took it upon itself to redefine marriage. Mr. Tomicki said some opponents of gay marriage speculate “that the court is deliberately sitting on the decision until Justice Zazzali is confirmed and, if they could, holding the decision until after the election.”Many gay-marriage advocates wish the court would wait until after Nov. 7, fearful that the decision they want could endanger the re-election prospects of Mr. Menendez, who is in an unexpectedly tight race, or more broadly hurt Democrats’ chances of taking control of Congress.“There’s an awful lot of propaganda right now from radical Republicans,” said Barbra Casbar, president of the state chapter of the Stonewall Democrats, a national gay political organization. “They’re desperate to fire up their base.”Even in New Jersey, Ms. Casbar said, a decision favoring gay marriage might spark enough conservative outrage to affect election results. “In a very close election that’s possible,” she said. “Senator Menendez is having it a lot tougher than he thought.”Both sides said Chief Justice Poritz — who, at least until Thursday, controls the assignments and timing of opinions — appeared to favor legalizing gay marriage. But the court’s seven members have shown few consistent ideological patterns. New Jersey has a long tradition, regardless of who is governor, of alternating appointments between Democratic and Republican justices.Mr. Tomicki, of the League of American Families, questioned whether Chief Justice Poritz could participate in court business after her retirement on Thursday, but a court spokeswoman, Winnie Comfort, said former justices had done so before.Mr. Lustberg, the plaintiffs’ attorney, said he thought the court would seek to avoid any challenge to Justice Poritz’s vote by issuing the decision before she steps down.For now, they and the small circle of obsessive court-watchers here are stuck staring at the Supreme Court’s Web site, www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm, where a list of decisions to be issued the next day is posted each weekday at 10 a.m.'"
"'06-10-23,'1','But despite his earlier pledge to reimburse the state for any errands the employee performed that were not related to her security, Mr. Hevesi made no such reimbursements until his Republican rival, J. Christopher Callaghan, raised the issue.Mr. Hevesi then sent the state a check for nearly $83,000, saying that that was enough to cover all of the driver’s expenses, even those related to security.Citizens Union called Mr. Callaghan, the former Saratoga County treasurer, an able public servant but said that it felt that he lacked the experience needed to be comptroller. So it did not endorse Mr. Callaghan for the post either.Is the Spitzer campaign looking to the Republican ticket for job applicants?During a debate Friday between the two candidates for lieutenant governor, David A. Paterson, left, the Senate minority leader and the running mate of Eliot Spitzer, suggested as much.“One of the things, if the voters see fit to elect Eliot Spitzer, people like Scott Vanderhoef would be very interesting to him,” Mr. Paterson, a Democrat, said in his debate with Mr. Vanderhoef, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor. Mr. Vanderhoef, the Rockland County executive, is running alongside the Republican nominee in the governor’s race, John Faso.“You don’t have to change parties to work in the Spitzer administration,” Mr. Paterson continued. “He’s going to get qualified Republicans and Democrats, because we’re going to have to clean up this mess together.”The comment came right at the end of the debate, which was on the Albany radio show of Fredric U. Dicker, a New York Post reporter. Afterward, Mr. Vanderhoef said, “I anticipate being part of the Faso administration, that’s kind of been what I’ve been working on.” But he did say that Mr. Paterson “was trying to flatter me, and it worked.”Jonathan Tasini never got very far with his antiwar challenge to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primary last month. Now the Working Families Party is picking up that banner, though in a somewhat friendlier way.The party sent an Internet antiwar commercial via e-mail last week to more than 100,000 New York voters, urging them to vote for Democratic candidates on the Working Families Party ballot line — as opposed to the Democratic Party line — as a way of sending a message that they opposed the war. The e-mail missive includes a letter from the rock musician Bob Seeger supporting the party’s effort, which it calls “Bring Them Home.”Party leaders said they wanted to hold Mrs. Clinton accountable for voting in 2002 to authorize military action in Iraq, as well as other candidates whom they endorsed, like Mrs. Clinton, and who initially supported the war. Mrs. Clinton’s name will appear on both the Democratic Party line and the Working Families Party line on the Nov. 7 ballot.“Our difference with Senator Clinton is a difference in degree — her phased redeployment doesn’t go far enough, fast enough,” said Dan Cantor, executive director of the Working Families Party. “If we could get 300,000 or 400,000 votes on our line, it would surprise her, and it would be a real signal to her and to Democratic congressmen who supported the war.”The party has a special interest in winning more votes to its ballot line: If it can accumulate more votes than the Conservative Party, which now occupies the fourth slot on the ballot, it can move up from its fifth place on the ballot.

In May, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted the firm and two of its name partners on criminal charges involving $11.3 million in suspected illegal secret payments allegedly made to individuals who served as plaintiffs in more than 150 lawsuits over several years. The firm has denied the allegations.Since then, numerous lawyers have left to start up new practices or to join other firms. They include the prominent trial lawyer Patricia M. Hynes, who joined Allen & Overy late this summer as senior counsel.Since 1973, Mr. Gluck has served as a litigation partner in Fried Frank’s New York office, where he has been involved in bankruptcies and companies restructurings.

"'06-10-24,'1','“He was talking about next year, and this is this year.”Barber also showed his focus remained squarely on this season. He entered the game needing 57 yards to maintain his status as the league’s rushing leader. He had that midway through the second quarter, accumulating 85 first-half rushing yards en route to a game-high 114 yards. The Cowboys managed 69 yards on the ground.Barber also was a threat as a receiver out of the backfield, grabbing a team-high four receptions for another 32 yards. Barber accounted for 146 of the Giants’ 328 yards from scrimmage.“He played super,” Manning said. “The offensive line did a good job of opening holes, and he did a great job of finding them.”Dallas entered the game with the league’s top-ranked rushing defense, allowing an average of only 67 yards a game. But that lofty distinction bore a caveat. The Cowboys faced the Washington Redskins and the Tennessee Titans when those teams were missing their top backs: Clinton Portis and Travis Henry. Dallas had not faced what most would consider a premier running back, never mind an elite one like Barber.“Tiki does a super job of preparing himself, physically and mentally,” Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said. “I expected him to play well against the league’s No. 1-ranked rush defense, and he did.”Barber did not score — he still is without a touchdown this season — but he was so effective with each touch of the ball, the Giants’ other offensive options found more open space.The Giants’ first score came only five plays into the game. Barber already had unsettled the Cowboys’ defense with a 5-yard pass reception, a short run off right tackle and an 11-yard burst up the middle. The defense was softened and keying on Barber when Manning made the Cowboys pay with a 50-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress for a 7-0 lead.Barber kept alive the Giants’ next drive by snaring a pass in the flat on a crucial third-and-7 play in the second quarter. He then squirted free for a 12-yard gain to the Dallas 25. Jay Feely’s 31-yard field goal four plays later gave the Giants a 12-0 lead.The Giants held their breath over Barber only once, when he crumpled to the ground with 3 minutes 44 seconds remaining in the first half after being whacked across the facemask by the left forearm of the Cowboys’ DeMarcus Ware.Barber lost the ball, and the fumble gave the Cowboys possession at the Giants’ 14. But the threat was extinguished when Drew Bledsoe was intercepted at the goal line by Sam Madison.Barber was left dazed on the play and spent a couple of minutes being attended to by the trainers. But he said he was fine.“He just caught me hard,” Barber said.Barber seemed to relish his exit from the Texas Stadium field, and acknowledged afterward that it was probably “the last time here.” But several dozen fans hanging over the Giants’ tunnel entrance implored him otherwise with chants of “M.V.P.” and “one more year!”Barber, as usual, only smiled broadly in return.'"
"'06-10-24,'1','A former printing-plant employee admitted leaking copies of the Inside Wall Street column from Business Week magazine as he pleaded guilty to insider trading charges yesterday, in a case that the authorities have cited as a sprawling illegal stock-trading scheme.The employee, Nickolaus Shuster, 25, entered the plea in Federal District Court in Manhattan in an agreement with prosecutors that could earn him leniency for substantial cooperation in the wide-ranging plot to gain insider information through multiple methods.Mr. Shuster pleaded guilty to insider trading as well as conspiracy to commit insider trading. Prosecutors said they plan to use Mr. Shuster, who has forfeited the $20,000 he earned through the scheme, to strengthen their case against others accused of making more than $6.7 million through the trades.The government said that two former Goldman Sachs employees made most of the money in the scheme, relying on tips from an analyst with information about Wall Street deals and a grand jury member who knew about an inquiry of accounting fraud accusations against Bristol-Myers Squibb and several of its executives.The case came to the attention of authorities when regulators noticed an unusually high volume of trading before a merger announcement and discovered that a 63-year-old retired seamstress in Croatia — the aunt of one defendant — had made more than $2 million.As part of his plea, Mr. Shuster said he was hired in October 2004 by two men involved in the wider plot to get a job in a Wisconsin printing plant where Business Week was produced. He said one of two men he met in Manhattan’s Union Square showed him the magazine column “they wanted me to steal.” He said the men paid him between $500 and $1,000 each time he stole information for him.“I knew what I was doing was wrong,” Mr. Shuster told Magistrate Judge Debra C.

"'06-10-24,'1','Mr. Olmert overrode opposition from some liberal members of his coalition to bring in Israel Beiteinu, a party led by Avigdor Lieberman, 48, a Soviet immigrant who advocates annexing Jewish settlements in the West Bank and transferring most Arab citizens of Israel to a future Palestinian state.The prime minister said he planned to make Mr. Lieberman a deputy prime minister responsible for “strategic threats” against Israel, a portfolio that would include monitoring Iran, which Israel regards as its most dangerous enemy.The alliance agreed to by Mr. Olmert and Mr. Lieberman was expected to be formalized with cabinet and parliamentary approval in the next several days, though it could still face some opposition, particularly from the left-leaning Labor Party. Mr. Lieberman reaffirmed his opposition to territorial concessions, saying that the right has been in power for most of the past three decades in Israel, but, “We were unable to prevent withdrawals.”Mr. Olmert’s centrist Kadima Party was elected just seven months ago. His center-left coalition government has not only been reeling since the summer’s inconclusive war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, but also cannot point to any significant achievements.In announcing the deal with Mr. Lieberman, the prime minister noted that since Israel was founded in 1948, it has had 31 governments.“In other words, the average term of office for an Israeli government has, for a very long time, been less than two years,” Mr. Olmert said. “Is this reasonable? Is this evidence of stability? Does it promise continuity?”While the existing coalition was not in imminent danger of collapse, it would be tested in coming months on issues like the approval of the 2007 budget. Budget deliberations have led to coalition breakups in the past.Mr. Olmert’s coalition has consisted recently of four parties that hold 67 of the 120 seats in Parliament. While this provides a working majority, it would evaporate if any of the coalition partners left, something that happens with regularity in Israel’s volatile politics.Mr. Lieberman’s party holds 11 seats, which would give the governing coalition 78 seats, or nearly two-thirds of the Parliament. By bringing a far-right party on board, Mr. Olmert also hopes to neutralize the other right-wing factions that account for much of the opposition in Parliament.However, the expansion also means that Mr. Olmert’s new government would span the ideological spectrum, including liberal, centrist, right-wing and religious parties. With such divergent factions in the government, Mr. Olmert would have little or no chance of building consensus about political solutions to the continuing struggles with the Palestinians.The left-leaning Labor Party has expressed the strongest opposition to Israel Beiteinu’s inclusion in the coalition.Shelly Yacimovich, a Labor Party legislator, said her party joined the government based on “the desire for a peace process, the desire for a social-democratic agenda and for a friendly and egalitarian relationship with Arab Israelis.” Mr. Lieberman, she said, “represents the complete opposite of all these things.”But Isaac Herzog, a Labor lawmaker who serves in the cabinet, told Israel Radio that his party had “no choice but to remain in the government, because you have to allow government stability.”In 2004, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dismissed Mr. Lieberman from his post as transportation minister because he strongly opposed Mr. Sharon’s plan to withdraw Israeli soldiers and settlers from Gaza.The burly Mr. Lieberman immigrated from Moldova in 1978 and was first elected to Parliament in 1999.His party draws support from the Soviet immigrants who account for roughly one million of Israel’s seven million people, and it made a strong showing in the elections in March.In recent weeks, Mr. Lieberman has pushed a proposal that would change Israel’s government from a parliamentary system to a presidential system, similar to that of the United States.In the Gaza violence on Monday, Israeli forces waged a gun battle with a group of armed Palestinians and killed six, including a man the Israeli military said was Ata Shinbari, a leader of the Popular Resistance Committees, a group responsible for much of the recent rocket fire out of northern Gaza.Mr. Shinbari was among five men in his family in their late teens or 20’s who were killed in the gun battle, in the town of Beit Hanun, according to Palestinian medical workers. Several Palestinians were also wounded.'"
"'06-10-24,'1','ATLANTA, Oct. 23 — The Coca-Cola Company said Monday that it would donate two and a half acres of prime land near the downtown tourist district to a proposed civil rights museum that would hold, among other exhibits, the papers of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Mayor Shirley Franklin, who endorsed the idea of the museum after she was approached by Andrew Young, a former mayor, and Evelyn Lowery, founder of the Women’s Organizational Movement for Equality of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said similar projects in other cities had cost $50 million to upwards of $100 million.Still, no specific plans for the museum have been announced, and Coca-Cola’s gift would be the first contribution to the effort.“It’s something that I’ve been talking quietly to people about,” Ms. Franklin said, “recognizing that it takes a long time to put these things together.”Neville Isdell, the chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, said the land was valued at $8 million to $11 million. It is part of a downtown parcel that includes the city’s new aquarium and the new World of Coca-Cola museum, to open next May. The hope is that the aquarium, which has had more than three million visitors since it opened last November, will increase traffic for the area’s other attractions, including the CNN Center and Centennial Olympic Park.'"
"'06-10-24,'1','Seeking to crack down on the sometimes-violent world of video piracy, the city is beginning an aggressive campaign to hold building owners liable for illegal distribution activities on their property and to make the recording of movies in theaters a crime, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday.According to officials at the Motion Picture Association of America, New York is a center for pirated DVD’s, many of them illegally recorded with portable cameras at movie theaters. The association estimates that New York City theaters are the source of nearly half of the camcorder-generated pirated DVD’s tracked in the United States, and 20 percent of pirated movies seized globally.“Video piracy is not a victimless crime — it kills jobs,” Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference. The mayor, who has made courting the film industry a priority for his administration, added that revenues from such piracy supports criminal gangs. In addition, the counterfeit DVD business has attracted its share of violence in recent years, with several shootings connected to DVD robberies in Midtown.Using tactics the city employed to go after counterfeiting in the apparel industry, officials at the association, the Police Department and the city’s Office of Special Enforcement will work to identify buildings where piracy operations are located and take legal action against landlords and owners.Under nuisance abatement laws, according to John Feinblatt, the city’s criminal justice coordinator, the city can essentially take control of the properties, shutting down offices, floors or entire buildings, depending on how they are being used, and suing the landlords, which could result in substantial fines. The legal actions could also force landlords and owners to post bonds and to submit new tenants for city approval.'"
"'06-10-24,'1','Mr. Cromer’s precisely detailed production trains a clear gaze on the two souls trapped in a marriage that has slowly curdled, as the shared happiness of Doc and Lola’s youth, baldly symbolized by the little puppy that ain’t comin’ back any time soon, has given way to solitary helpings of disappointment. In the tight confines of the Victory Gardens Greenhouse Theater, the audience is almost sharing morning coffee with the bustling Lola (Linda Reiter), the gentle Doc (John Judd) and their boarder, Marie (Maggie Corbett), whose nubile beauty and healthy sexuality unsettle both of them in different ways.Scuttling quickly around her kitchen and living room (designed in acutely drab detail by Kevin Hagan), Ms. Reiter’s Lola is refreshingly softer-hued than Booth’s memorably bleating Lola. Inge did not exactly understate Lola’s loneliness — must she shanghai both the postman and the milkman with assaults of small talk? — but Ms. Reiter, who bears a resemblance to Judi Dench, shares some of that great actress’s natural warmth, too. She dignifies the character with the graceful depth of feeling she brings to the role, in particular in the telling silences that punctuate the stream of chipper talk. The vision of Lola at the front door, slowly turning back to face her empty living room as if it were the gallows, reveals the anguish of her daily solitude in a manner that goes beyond her homely language.If the skills of a fine actress are required to save Lola from either bathos or sheer silliness, the role of Doc poses its challenges, too. Mr. Judd, who appeared as Laurence Olivier in “Orson’s Shadow” Off Broadway (a role he created for Mr. Cromer’s production at the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago), performs with a contained economy that suggests the inward energies Doc must devote to waging a moment-by-moment battle against the furies in his soul. These are unleashed in the play’s climactic scene, in which a fallen-off-the-wagon Doc subjects his cowering wife to a torrent of cruel abuse. Mr. Judd performs it with a harshness that is harrowing to watch; squirming in your seat, you almost forget the scene’s essential staginess.But you don’t, quite. “Sheba” was Inge’s first successful play, and he would show a more graceful touch in “Bus Stop” and “Picnic,” in which the pathos that paved his work like linoleum — and the clotted sexuality sometimes spilled across it — was spread around to a wider variety of characters. Concentrated heavily in the characterizations of Doc and particularly Lola, it retains a slightly mawkish flavor, even in Mr. Cromer’s emotionally trenchant production.“Sheba” was Inge’s first success, but not his first play. That was “Farther Off From Heaven,” written in 1947 under the inspiration of “The Glass Menagerie,” which Inge had seen with Williams himself, who had befriended him and encouraged him to try his hand at drama. (Inge was working as a critic in St. Louis at the time.) Ten years later, Inge reworked the play as “The Dark at the Top of the Stairs,” but blurred traces of Williams’s influence are still evident.The central character, a frazzled Midwestern mother and wife named Cora Flood (Cheryl Graeff), is like Amanda Wingfield stripped of the Southern graces that disguise the hint of cruelty in her desire to force her offspring into joining the rough flow of life. Like Amanda, Cora has a pathologically shy daughter, Reenie (Kelly O’Sullivan), whom she cattle-prods into sociability; a sensitive son, Sonny (Edward Heffernan); and an essentially absent husband, Rubin (Tim Decker), a salesman on the road a lot. Mr. Kiely’s cast largely does well by the sometimes obvious material, although Ms. Graeff’s crabbed Cora could use more warmth.The play was bold for its time, with its sober and complex depiction of marital dissatisfaction and the fraying fabric of American family life. But today the strained subplot involving the suicide of a minor character — a Jewish boy nicely played by Jurgen Hooper, who takes Reenie to a local party — registers as a fatally histrionic touch that breaks the spell of small-town frustration. (This doomed and exotic fellow even has a movie star for a mother, who doesn’t come to the funeral.)Inge did not have a gift for the bold stroke, as Williams and Miller did in vastly different ways, Williams with his heady lyricism and outsized but still richly human characters, Miller with his taste for stark moral inquiry. (Inge’s shrill screenplay for “Splendor in the Grass” has dated none too well.) The strident bids for a richer-hued theatricalism — Doc’s drunk scene, the spinster schoolteacher’s hysteria in “Picnic,” the suicide in “The Dark at the Top of the Stairs” — sort of stick out like palm trees on a Kansas prairie.Inge came from Kansas, and his writing is most moving when it sticks to the prosaic rhythms of his characters’ lives and the homespun flavor of their talk. There’s nothing to do about those palm trees now, of course, but when fine actors instill his everyday folk with the warm blood of real humanity, as they do in particular in the Shattered Globe’s “Sheba,” you can at least squint a little and pretend you don’t see them.'"
"'06-10-24,'1','Avid iPod users who wonder if they are putting their hearing at risk may find some relief in a new study that tries to arrive at guidelines for safe listening levels.The key to avoiding hearing damage, the researchers say, appears to be limiting not so much how long one listens to music but how loud it is played. The study was presented at a recent conference on noise-induced hearing loss in children.The researchers, who are audiologists, concluded that the average young person could listen to a player at 70 percent of full volume for four and a half hours without much risk. They also said that if people used the earphones that come with the devices they could listen to music at an 80 percent level for 90 minutes a day without great risk.But listening to the music full blast for just five minutes can affect hearing, they said.The guidelines, the study said, are generally applicable to other music players. The study also found that it does not much matter whether listeners use headphones that cover the ears or go into them. The real risk, the researchers said, may come when people listening to music do so in a noisy environment. There is a tendency then for them to turn up the volume of the music player. Earphones that block outside noise may be helpful.The study was prepared by Brian J. Fligor of Children’s Hospital Boston and Harvard, Terri Ives of the Pennsylvania College of Optometry School of Audiology and Cory Portnuff, a graduate student at the University of Colorado.'"
"'06-10-24,'1','Even so, the disappearance is deeply troubling for the military and comes at a time of tense relations between it and the Iraqi government. Military officials have grown increasingly frustrated with the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki for delaying moves to control the militia groups that are dragging Iraq toward civil war.The two top American officials in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the commanding general, and Zalmay Khalilzad, the ambassador, are scheduled to give a news conference on Tuesday to try to smooth relations.The news of the soldier also comes two weeks ahead of midterm elections in the United States, in which the recent rise in violence in Iraq, particularly against American soldiers, has been an issue affecting the prospects of Republican candidates.The recent spike in American casualties continued Monday, with the military announcing four more deaths, including that of a civilian police adviser. The deaths included a marine in Anbar who was killed in “enemy action” on Saturday, and two soldiers killed in separate bombings in western and southeastern Baghdad on Sunday.The police adviser was killed Sunday, and four soldiers were wounded in eastern Baghdad. October, with a week to go, already has the highest American death toll of any month this year.At least nine Iraqis were killed in and around Baghdad on Monday, and the authorities found eight bodies around the capital, an Interior Ministry official said.Few soldiers have been separated from their units over the course of the war, but there was at least one instance this year.In June, two American soldiers were captured and a third was killed in an ambush in Yusufiya, a town south of Baghdad that is one of Iraq’s most hostile. The bodies of the captured soldiers were found about a week later. They had been brutalized.The military poured resources into that rescue effort, dedicating 8,000 troops, American and Iraqi, to search for the soldiers. The search drained troops away from Baghdad.Amara, a tribal city in the southeast corner of Iraq that was the scene of intense fighting between Shiite militias last week, was afflicted by a spate of assassinations on Sunday and Monday. Residents said the killings were probably committed by tribe members taking revenge for the more than 25 police officers and militiamen who died in street fighting on Friday.Five Iraqis were killed Monday and two on Sunday, said Col. Abed Zughayer of the Amara police. The dead included police officers and members of the Mahdi Army, a sprawling Shiite militia whose soldiers are powerful local forces in the provinces as well as in the capital.Perhaps as troubling, about 200 members of the Nawafil tribe, a large tribe whose home is the marshes around Amara, arrived in the city on Monday afternoon to lend support to a senior commander of a special police force, Col. Mohamed Hadi, according to Colonel Zughayer.The authorities on Monday found the body of a brother of a Mahdi Army commander. The brother’s seizure by the police last week set off the spasm of violence that paralyzed Amara for a day. The man’s body was disfigured; dogs had eaten part of it, said Ali Abu Trab, the office manager for the governor of the province.The local authorities in Amara contacted the office of the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr in Najaf, south of Baghdad, to ask him to call for calm. Mr. Sadr is the head of the Mahdi Army, but his control of regional branches of that militia has slipped.The colonel said the city has been relatively quiet, but that the Mahdi Army still controlled swaths of the eastern half of the city, which is divided by the Tigris River.He said that a nighttime curfew had been imposed starting at 10 p.m., but that few were heeding it.Prime Minister Maliki issued a statement on Monday warning militias, particularly in Amara, to stop the violence. “The Iraqi government hereby warns all groups with illegal weapons to refrain from any armed activities that undermine public security,” he said, according to The Associated Press. “Let everyone be informed that orders have been issued to the armed forces to stop any transgression against state power.”'"

"'06-10-25,'1','But the ruling passed along the thorniest question, of whether true equality demands the same name, to the Legislature, saying “such change must come from the crucible of the democratic process..”Within minutes of the court’s 3 p.m. announcement, three Democratic Assemblymen, working with Garden State Equality, a gay rights organization, said that they would introduce a bill demanding marriage.But reaction from their fellow legislators was guarded, with some saying privately that civil unions, not marriage, would be the likely result. In a joint statement, Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. and Senate President Richard J. Codey, both Democrats, called the 180-day deadline “unreasonable” and said, “The only remaining issues now confronting the Legislature are ones of terminology and clarification.”For people involved in the legal battle over gay marriage, the decision is an important shift from three recent court rulings in New York, Washington state and California that essentially rejected gay couples’ claims on marriage and the benefits it confers. And by issuing a nuanced and complicated 90-page ruling that left observers struggling to declare who won and who lost, the court may have neutralized gay marriage as an issue in the Nov. 7 elections, when eight states will consider ballot measures to ban same-sex marriage.“The decision certainly minimizes what the radical right thought they might have had as a mobilizing tool in the last days of the election,” said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy organization.Nathaniel Persily, who teaches law and political science at the University of Pennsylvania and who recently co-wrote a paper titled “Gay Marriage, Public Opinion and the Courts,” praised the justices for “an incredibly smart and politically astute opinion.”“The Court has placed itself exactly where a majority of the American people are,” Professor Persily said. “A majority of Americans are in favor of equal rights for gays tantamount to marriage, but a majority is also against calling that relationship marriage.”At the same time, he added: “This must be seen as a win for gay rights. They did not get the name they want, but they are getting more rights than could have been imaginable just a few years ago. Who would have thought 50, 20, even 10 years ago that a unanimous state supreme court would have said that gay relationships are entitled to equal rights as heterosexual relationships?”But conservative groups opposed to same-sex marriage blasted the ruling as an example of the justices essentially trading judicial robes for legislative pens.“The court is holding a legal gun to the head of the state Legislature, and saying, ‘Listen, there are two bullets, you get to pick the bullet: either gay marriage or civil unions,’ ” said Matt Daniels, president of Alliance for Marriage, an organization based in the Washington area that supports a federal Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. “And that is not democracy. That is court-imposed policy-making that takes this out of the hands of the people.”Until now, courts in many other states — including the Court of Appeals in New York in July — had rejected similar lawsuits by same-sex couples, with the common rationale being that only the legislative branch can define or redefine marriage. No legislature has yet done that, though several states, including New Jersey, have enacted domestic partnership laws to grant gay couples some benefits in recent years.Nineteen states have adopted constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. Most others have statutory bans, but New Jersey and four other states do not. In addition to Massachusetts, where more than 8,000 gay couples have gotten married in the past three years, Vermont and Connecticut authorize civil unions, which generally offer the same legal protections, if not the same societal status, as marriage.Wednesday’s ruling caps a legal journey begun in 2002, when seven couples who had been denied marriage licenses in their towns filed the lawsuit now officially known as Lewis v. Harris. Two lower courts rejected their constitutional claim, with the Appellate Division ruling in June 2005, that marriage between members of the same sex was neither a fundamental right nor one covered by the constitution’s equal-protection clause.Many gay-marriage advocates thought New Jersey’s high court, which heard the case Feb 15. was their best shot at victory.It is regarded as one of the most liberal and independent in the country, having been among the first to strike down a ban on sodomy and rule in favor of adoption rights for gay couples.The 4-3 split on Wednesday did not break along traditional political lines: the majority included all three justices appointed by the Democratic former governor, while the three dissenters, who backed the more far-reaching solution of opening marriage to gays, were named by a Republican.“We do not have to take that all-or-nothing approach,” Justice Albin wrote of the marriage question in the majority opinion.“We cannot find a legitimate public need for an unequal legal scheme of benefits and privileges that disadvantages same-sex couples,” he said. “We cannot find that a right to same-sex marriage is so deeply rooted in the traditions, history, and conscience of the people of this state that it ranks as a fundamental right.”The court also expounded about the importance of equal treatment to protect children, diverging from the rulings of other state courts, which had said protecting procreation was one rationale for limiting marriage to heterosexual couples.“There is something distinctly unfair about the State recognizing the right of same-sex couples to raise natural and adopted children and placing foster children with those couples,” Justice Albin said, “and yet denying those children the financial and social benefits and privileges available to children in heterosexual households.”In the dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz argued that the semantic distinction of marriage versus civil unions was itself a meaningful one, arguing that the institution “bestows enormous private and social advantages.”Agreeing that same-sex couples deserve the same rights and benefits as heterosexual ones, she wrote that she “can find no principled basis, however, on which to distinguish those rights and benefits from the right to the title of marriage.”'"
"'06-10-25,'1','The latest statistics on the state of the housing market show continued signs of weakness: Americans are paying less for previously owned homes than they were a year ago and the number of such homes sold continues to fall.The National Association of Realtors reported today that the average price of a previously owned home fell to $220,000 in September, down 2.2 percent from September 2005. At the same time, the pace of home sales slowed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 million, down 1.9 percent from August. That is the slowest pace since January 2004.Sales fell even further when compared with September 2005. In the past year, existing home sales slid 14.2 percent, the realtors association said.The new sales numbers suggest a housing market that is downshifting, but it remains unclear just how much further sales and prices will fall.

She faces up to one year in jail when she is sentenced in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.Some jurors said they were reluctant to send a gray-haired woman with a cat and not much money to jail over what appeared to be scribbles that most people would have crumpled up and thrown in the trash.Other jurors argued, however, that because the doodles had been made by the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, who died in 1982, they were irreplaceable artifacts.“As much as she looked like a little grandmother, she was also a smart woman who knew what she was doing,” said Marty New, a professor of theater at New York University and a media consultant, after the verdict.'"

"'06-10-25,'1','The plea is as disturbing — and arresting — as a hostage video from Iraq. In a navy blazer and preppy Oxford shirt, the actor Michael J. Fox calmly asks viewers to support stem cell research by voting for several Democratic candidates in Maryland, Missouri and Wisconsin, while his body sways back and forth uncontrollably like a sailor being tossed around in a full-force gale.In short, Mr. Fox’s display of the toll Parkinson’s disease has taken on him turned into one of the most powerful and talked about political advertisements in years.Republican strategists who saw how quickly the commercial was downloaded, e-mailed and reshown on news broadcasts certainly thought so. Rush Limbaugh rushed in to discredit Mr. Fox, though he mostly hurt himself. Mr. Limbaugh, the conservative radio talk show host, told his listeners that the actor either “didn’t take his medication or was acting.” Mr. Limbaugh later apologized for accusing Mr. Fox of exaggerating his symptoms, but said that “Michael J. Fox is allowing his illness to be exploited and in the process is shilling for a Democrat politician.”Republicans cobbled together a response ad that did not mention Mr. Fox but attacked the ethics of embryonic stem cell research. It included testimonials by the actress Patricia Heaton (“Everybody Loves Raymond”) and James Caviezel, who played Jesus in Mel Gibson’s “Passion of the Christ.” At least in the advance version shown on YouTube last night, Mr. Caviezel’s introduction seemed either garbled or to be in Aramaic.The issue of embryonic stem cell research is divisive, but Mr. Fox is not. And that is one reason his advertisement had such resonance. He is a popular actor who played a young conservative Republican on the sitcom “Family Ties.” His illness was diagnosed in 1991, but he kept it secret until 1998. In 2000, he told his fans that because of his illness, he had to quit the hit sitcom “Spin City.” He founded the Michael J. Fox Foundation to advance stem cell research, lobbied Congress and made commercials to rally support for his cause.'"
"'06-10-25,'1','Both men are scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon in Federal District Court in Manhattan.“Robert Trosten denies that he intentionally engaged in any fraud and looks forward to establishing his innocence at trial,” Mr. Trosten’s lawyer, Robert G. Morvillo, said.Gary P. Naftalis, Mr. Bennett’s lawyer, said, “Mr. Bennett reaffirms that he is not guilty of any of the government’s charges and looks forward to his day in court.”If convicted on all counts, Mr. Trosten faces a maximum of 45 years in prison and a fine of $5.5 million. Based on the revised indictment, Mr. Bennett now faces a maximum of 110 years in prison and $16 million in fines.Once a major global clearinghouse for derivatives, Refco, based in New York, served more than 200,000 customers by buying and selling options products, including commodities, futures and government securities. Propelled to success largely under Mr. Bennett, who became chief executive in 1998, the company in 2004 drew a bid for a controlling stake by Thomas H. Lee Partners that valued the firm at $2.25 billion. It went public in August 2005 at $22 a share.The firm even held a highly regarded collection of photographs by the likes of Richard Avedon and John Baldessari in its New York and Chicago offices.Refco’s implosion began in early October 2005, when it disclosed in a press release that it was owed about $430 million by Refco Group Holding Inc., an entity controlled by Mr. Bennett.What has since emerged, prosecutors say, is a labyrinthine scheme that sought to hide customers’ trading debts by shuffling the losses every quarter to other entities.As customers lost money in the 1990’s through 2005, Mr. Bennett would have the firm’s parent, Refco Group Holding Inc., assume those debts. Rather than write off those losses, Mr. Bennett then transferred them to Refco Group Holding. By all appearances, Refco appeared to be owed money by its parent.From there, a series of loans among Refco Group Holding; another Refco unit, Refco Capital Markets; and several customers sought to keep the loans off the books. One of those customers, an Austrian bank, Bawag P.S.K., was ordered in June to pay at least $675 million for its role in the scheme.The scheme allowed Refco to appear healthy, setting the stage for the private-equity buyout and subsequent public offering, prosecutors said. Insiders also received more than $1 billion in cash after the sale of the stake to Thomas H. Lee.Mr. Trosten left the firm in October 2004, leaving the firm without a finance chief for about two months.When Refco filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 17, 2005, it was one of the largest filings in United States history. Major institutional investors, including TIAA-CREF and Oppenheimer Funds, were among those that lost millions as the firm capsized.'"

Meyerle, chairman of the New Jersey Coalition for Property Tax Reform. “They feel that they want to come up with a solution, and they do not want to disappoint the public. We need to let the process play out.”Since Gov. Jon S. Corzine opened the special session with a speech to the Legislature on July 28, four committees have met three times a week to study changes in aid to schools, the consolidation of some local government functions, altering benefits for public employees and the wisdom of changing the state’s constitution to add provisions that would provide relief for property owners.The sessions, which are mainly fact-finding hearings, have included testimony from experts from across the country, speaking through video conference links. The committees have also taken about a half-dozen trips outside the State House for town-hall-style meetings to hear from taxpayers. Lawmakers hope to have legislation in place by Jan. 1.Meanwhile, Mr. Corzine has made a few of his own suggestions. One would impose a 3 percent annual cap on increases in property taxes, which have grown by as high as 7 percent in recent years. Another is to allow municipalities to impose other taxes.New Jersey municipalities depend on property tax revenue, which statewide totals about $20 billion annually, to pay for things like education and police and fire departments. This has led to what many tax experts say is an overreliance on property taxes, which account for about 45 percent of the state’s total tax revenue. Nationwide, the average is 30 percent.Allowing municipalities to impose taxes might be the boldest suggestion yet to emerge from the sessions — and it is also one that has been all but rejected as a political nonstarter by lawmakers from both parties.Still, Mr. Corzine said through a spokesman, he hopes the Legislature will embrace the spirit of creative thinking.“Our hope — and everyone’s hope — is that we will have real, meaningful property tax reform,” said the spokesman, Anthony Coley. “Nobody has all the ideas. We’ll approach it together — Republican and Democrat, executive branch and legislative branch — and work to bring meaningful and lasting reform.”According to some tax policy experts, significant reform would mean reducing the state’s average tax bill, which was $5,826 last year, by about a fifth, or roughly $1,100. Early on in the hearings, lawmakers heard testimony that consolidating certain local government functions would most likely yield relatively modest savings.But lawmakers hope that a series of steps — including reducing school administration costs and the sharing of services like fire and police work by municipalities — can produce some significant savings. “There are no silver bullets, but there are lots of silver pebbles,” Mr. Wisniewski said. “We have a lot of history to undo.”Mr. Wisniewski noted that the administrative costs associated with running 616 public school districts in New Jersey are about five times that of schools in Maryland. Similarly, he said, there are several municipalities in New Jersey with populations consisting of several dozen people. In such cases, he said, it might make financial sense for their municipal services to merge with those of bigger neighbors.“I don’t think there’s a unique way for Town A or Town B to fill a pothole,” he said.Even in Trenton, much of the buzz surrounding the property tax sessions has been blunted by the fall campaign season. But once those races are decided, property taxes will again take center stage — where they are likely to remain until next fall’s legislative elections, when all 120 lawmakers face re-election. Those races are likely to become a tax-weary electorate’s verdict on how well lawmakers fared this fall.“As soon as the Nov. 7 elections pass, property taxes will be the biggest story in the state,” Mr. Rebovich said. “And it will stay that way.”'"
"'06-10-25,'1','LONDON, Oct. 24 (AP) — Third-quarter profit at the energy company BP declined 3.6 percent, slumping on lost Alaskan production, higher taxes in Britain and a sharp drop in gasoline prices, the company said Tuesday.BP, which has had a string of problems in the United States, also lowered its forecast of average daily oil production in 2006 because of asset sales and snags at several oil fields.The first of the major oil companies to report quarterly earnings this week, BP said net income in the quarter was $6.23 billion, compared with $6.46 billion in the third quarter of 2005. Revenue climbed 4 percent, to $70.7 billion.Production for the period averaged 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, down 0.2 percent from a year ago and down 5 percent from the second quarter.The results reflected BP’s problems in the United States. The company halved production at its Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska, the largest in the United States, after severe pipeline corrosion and a small leak were uncovered. Production has now reached 400,000 barrels a day, double the low point but still below the previous average of 450,000 barrels a day.It has also delayed the opening of its Thunder Horse platform in the Gulf of Mexico — damaged by Hurricane Dennis last year — from 2007 to the middle of 2008 because of equipment failures. The platform is the largest in the gulf and is expected to produce about 240,000 barrels of oil and 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.The company’s shares gained 1.1 percent, to close at 608 pence ($11.40) in London trading.The value of BP’s shares has fallen 20 percent since April as the company struggles to restore its profile in the United States after investigations into refinery explosion in Texas in March 2005 that killed 15 workers and accusations that it manipulated crude oil and gasoline markets in the United States.'"
"'06-10-25,'1','The biggest problem during the last decade has been imported headstones, mostly from China and India, which cost about half as much as those made in Barre (pronounced BEAR-ee).“The labor costs in China are significantly lower than they are here, and it’s taking its toll on the American manufacturers,” said Pennie Sabel, president of the International Cemetery and Funeral Association, a trade group.Barre’s manufacturers describe the quality of the imported stones as poor and say it shows, but to the typical customer the only difference is price. Further, Chinese companies are also producing black granite headstones, which are becoming more popular than gray ones.Amid the tough times, there is one kind of granite business here for which the times are flush. Cochran’s Inc., for instance, is a headstone broker that works directly with Chinese headstone manufacturers. Peter Burke, a Cochran manager, said the ability to get intricately carved specialty headstones from the Chinese had doubled the company’s profit margin on such stones, which, like others, are transported directly from China to a Barre warehouse where the lettering and finishing work are done.“If we weren’t doing this,” Mr. Burke said, “we wouldn’t be doing so good right now. Everyone’s saying, ‘China’s bad, it’s hurting us.’ It’s not.”Imports aside, there is another factor putting pressure on Barre: while people joke that the monument business will never have a lack of customers, the popularity of cremations has certainly cut into the number of them.“It hurts,” Ms. Sabel said. “People have a concept that if you cremate a body you don’t need a memorial,” although manufacturers here have recently started making headstones that open in the back, allowing families to place urns inside on a shelf.Limited space at cemeteries, as well as rules they adopt to maintain their appearance, is also weakening manufacturers’ bottom line, since it means fewer chances to make large, elaborate headstones and mausoleums.“Cemetery lots are smaller,” said Louis P. Monti Jr., a monument dealer from Marlborough, Mass., who attended a trade show here in August. “They want to make things as small and easy to maintain as possible.”Elgio Zorzi, 87, who started working in quarries as a teenager, who later founded Adams Granite in Montpelier and who retired in 1985, no longer recognizes the industry, both for its mechanization and for its international reach. Nor did he ever think he would see what has become a commonplace: a vast departure of the city’s young men for occupations elsewhere, often with a stop first for college.“They’re all going to Burlington and not coming back,” Mr. Zorzi said of teenagers flocking to the University of Vermont.This is not the only place reeling from foreign granite competition. Elberton, Ga., is the South’s counterpart to Barre, with deep granite quarries that yield gray stone and a rich tradition of headstone manufacturing.“What’s hurting us is the Chinese and the Indians,” said Tom Robinson, president of the Elberton Granite Association, which represents about 150 headstone and memorial plants. “We can’t really put a number on it, but there’s no question we’ve lost jobs because we don’t have the volume of sales we used to have.”“I think we’re battling back with a focus on selling Elberton products, fast delivery and good quality while doing business with people you know,” Mr. Robinson said. “There are no surprises here.”Like Elberton, Barre is trying to reposition itself. The industry is fighting back by pointing to its reputation and educating consumers about the difference between the cheaper imports and Barre’s granite and craftsmanship.“You can almost smell the roses on this headstone,” Richard Tousignant, a salesman at Adams Granite, said of one local product. “This is the best craftsmanship in the world. It’s worth it. Would you want your grandparents’ monument to be something made in China?”'"

"'06-10-25,'1','But she only recently began to research whether the lift and its securing system have been crash-tested so they would not come unmoored in an accident. Because Mrs. Gold needs the lift to get around, she has not dwelled on the issue until now.Confusion and concern about basic safety issues for disabled drivers is a continuous challenge for the mobility industry, which is trying to promote quality standards after decades of improvisation. For example, drivers confined to wheelchairs are legally allowed to drive, but safety standards for such drivers have lagged behind.Experts say progress cannot come soon enough as aging baby boomers and improved public access for disabled people are certain to increase the demand for modified vehicles. “Years ago, you didn’t see as many people out, because they didn’t have as many places to go,” Mrs. Gold said.At least 400,000 converted vehicles are on the road now, industry estimates say.“We need a more empowered consumer,” said Stephen Sundarrao, the associate director of the Rehabilitation Engineering and Technology Program at the University of South Florida in Tampa. He says he often encounters disabled drivers whose desire to drive may override safety concerns, a tradeoff he regards as ill advised.“They think, ‘In order to be independent, I’ll take a bigger risk and drive without an air bag or a restraint system or a head rest,’ ” Mr. Sundarrao said. “There’s a balance. You want to increase options for the individual, but what you see happen is sometimes there are compromises.”The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which sets standards for motor vehicles, allows certain exemptions for vehicles used by disabled drivers. The exemptions include alterations to air bags, seats, signaling systems, steering wheels, brake pedals and head rests.Mobility dealers must register with the agency, but many safety decisions are left to the consumer and the dealers, who do structural changes and install equipment.The group most active in trying to promote standards is the National Mobility Equipment Dealers Association, an organization in Tampa that offers programs, supports crash-testing research and responds to consumer inquiries. Dana Roeling, the executive director, says the association’s mission starts at the point of sale, educating the auto industry and consumers so that disabled drivers will select the type of vehicles — usually a van, sport-utility vehicle or large sedan — that can be modified.The investment can be considerable. Changes to floors, roofs and doors can cost a minimum of $10,000. Driving systems can range from hundreds of dollars for simple aids to thousands for high-tech components.The association’s recommended practices include individual equipment fittings and driving evaluations. Some financing agencies for disabled drivers require these fittings and evaluations. But even after a consumer invests a lot of time and money, Mr. Sundarrao says that some safety aspects can slip between the cracks.A quality assurance program, developed by the association, is the only accreditation program in the field. Its aim is to teach mobility dealers how to conform to federal standards and use reputable practices for installing equipment and making structural changes. To maintain a certificate, dealers must submit to on-site inspections and periodic audits by an outside engineering firm.“This is the only organization that gives out information for members to do things properly,” said Jacques Bolduc, a mechanical engineer in Montreal and a consultant to the association. “The level of awareness has gone way up in the last five years, but there are still a lot of horror stories out there.”One major area affecting disabled drivers is wheelchair design. Some drivers can transfer from wheelchairs into normal or customized driver’s seats, but many are driving in wheelchairs not meant for that purpose. Shoulder and lap seat belts do not often fit wheelchair-bound drivers properly.“Quite honestly, we’re seeing a lot of people in wheelchairs who are getting seriously hurt in relatively minor events,” said Prof. Lawrence W. Schneider, head of the biosciences division at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. “Wheelchairs are also getting bigger and fancier and heavier, and harder to secure.”Professor Schneider says that the main consumer guidelines are the safety standards recommended by the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America. The standards, known by the reference code WC19, address crash-worthiness, head rests, back supports and securing devices of wheelchairs that are used as seats in vehicles.Another set of standards, recommended by the Society of Automotive Engineers, known as J2249, applies to wheelchair “tie-downs,” the parts that anchor wheelchairs to the floor, and occupant restraint systems.Mr. Bolduc and Professor Schneider say that air bags are often removed or disconnected from vehicles because people assume that a driver is positioned too close to the steering wheel or that hand controls can be projected during an accident. Research indicates that those assumptions are not always true, both men say.Spokesmen for two major auto companies say they routinely offer technical advice to mobility dealers. “We want to assist the aftermarket — we can’t do their designs for them, but we can offer engineering assistance,” said John Lubinski, the product development engineer for special vehicle engineering at the Ford Motor Company.Joseph Langhauser, the mobility program manager at the General Motors Corporation, says his company operates a hot line providing information on safe air bag deployment and other matters.Here are tips for disabled drivers who are shopping for a new vehicle:¶Be certain that the mobility dealer is a member of the National Mobility Equipment Dealers Association and is certified under the quality program. Contact the association (nmeda.org) to see if there are any complaints about the dealer.¶Ask questions about safety exemptions that a dealer might suggest. “Ask, What am I giving up?” said Mr. Langhauser of G.M.¶Ask about crash-test data for modified vehicles and for systems that secure wheelchairs, ramps and lifts stored in the car. Inquire about components mounted on the steering wheel, column and dashboard.¶For wheelchair-bound drivers, check to see if the chair and tie-down system conform to the WC19 and J2249 standards.¶Be discerning. “Go to someone who has access to information and engineers and understands the consequences of modifications for safety and durability,” Mr. Bolduc said. “That doesn’t mean the company has to be big. Some of the best ones out there have five employees. It all boils down to this: You want to get somebody who somebody is watching.”'"
"'06-10-25,'1','“I don’t think we have any aspirations of coming into the series and immediately running up front,” said Jim Aust, the chief executive of Toyota Racing Development in the United States.Michael Waltrip Racing will be one of only three Toyota-powered teams next season, along with Bill Davis Racing and Team Red Bull. Mr. Aust and other Toyota officials said they expected these teams to spend most of 2007 catching up to the Chevrolets, Fords and Dodges.Toyota and the other manufacturers will need to provide two models of a race car, not just one. The Car of Tomorrow, safer and boxier than those that have been in the series, will be used in 16 of the 36 Nextel Cup races next year.“I don’t think they’ve underestimated the challenge,” Mr. Davis said in a recent interview.Mr. Aust said he would be satisfied if the Toyotas would consistently run next year in the Top 15 at Nextel Cup races. Regular Top-10 finishes are the goal for 2008, he said, with a title contention eyed for 2009.“If it means we struggle some days, some weeks, some weekends, that’s just the price of playing poker at the Nascar table,” said Jim Farley, the vice president of marketing for Toyota Motor Sales.Simply by joining the series, Toyota accomplished an enormous objective: to get many of the estimated 75 million Nascar fans in the United States to notice Toyota and, of course, buy one.Toyota does not need much help selling the passenger version of the Camry, the No. 1-selling passenger car in the United States. But Toyota would like to sell more pickup trucks, and the company thinks that Nascar fans are an ideal target. “We’re not racing Camrys to sell Camrys,” Mr. Farley said.Referring to Nascar fans, he added: “We’re looking at this as a real opportunity for consumers to get to know the company.”The redesigned 2008 Tundra, a big, brassy truck, will be unveiled in February at about the time of the Daytona 500, the most prestigious race on the Nextel Cup schedule. Toyota will have already started a marketing blitz aimed at Nascar fans.Michael Waltrip said that he and his 59-year-old brother, now a television racing commentator who has not quite slammed the door on his racing career, have taped an ad in which they thank Toyota for another chance to race. The series wins, too.Mr. Waltrip said: “There are going to be more eyeballs on the sport because of Toyota. The sport is going to get a bump.”Toyota said it hoped its presence in Nextel Cup racing could also generate more teamwork among the estimated 400,000 Americans who have jobs with Toyota or one of its suppliers.“We need something like Nascar to connect with each other as a family,” Mr. Farley said.Toyota officials say they know that some stock-car fans would like to see the company spin its wheels on the track. Toyota builds seven models at eight plants in the United States but is viewed by some as an outsider.But villains have been racing stock cars forever. Dale Earnhardt, the brash driver known as the Intimidator, drove a black Chevrolet and often won races by nudging other cars out of his way. He was hated for a long time before he was loved.“We understand we’ve got work to do with the die-hards, the old-time Nascar fans,” Mr. Aust said. “We hope they get to understand why we’re in it, and they can see that these guys aren’t such bad guys after all.”The 2007 lineup of Toyota drivers is just as American as the drivers in Chevys, Fords and Dodges. Mr. Waltrip landed the former champion Dale Jarrett, and Bill Davis Racing has signed Jeremy Mayfield. Red Bull’s top driver is 22-year-old Brian Vickers, who has been a teammate of Jeff Gordon’s for two years.The nose of the racing Camry had to be redesigned to fit Nascar specifications one month after Toyota announced in January that it planned to join the Nextel Cup series. But Toyota Racing Development quickly made up lost ground.Toyotas kept pace with other stock cars at a test in August at Brooklyn, Mich. The results were encouraging enough for Mr. Waltrip and Mr. Davis to say they are optimistic that they can be more competitive in 2007.“They’re managing their expectations,” Mr. Davis said of Toyota officials.Bill Elliott, the ex-champion, was among those who had predicted that Toyota would start slowly. During a call before a recent race at Fontana, Calif., Mr. Elliott sounded as if he had changed his mind.“It’s a perfect time to come in,” he said of Toyota’s entrance. “You are going to be able to jump-start a little quicker than you would be starting on a clean sheet of paper.”The Toyota teams will have the three-month stock-car off-season to do so. Mr. Waltrip understands it will probably take longer to win over those Americans who prefer to watch more traditional American cars race.“Any time there’s change, or something new or different, people will push up against it,” Mr. Waltrip said. “We know how it stacks up.”'"

It isn’t a date and it isn’t a penalty if it doesn’t. You’re trying to add a degree of formality and finality and punishment” that were not there.Clearly exercised, Mr. Rumsfeld continued: “You’re looking for some sort of a guillotine to come flowing down if some date isn’t met. That isn’t what this is about.”“No one can predict the future with absolute certainty, so you ought to just back off, take a look at it, relax.”Mr. Rumsfeld said that “honorable people are working on these things together — there isn’t any daylight between them.”And he advised reporters at the Pentagon, “I wouldn’t waste a lot of newsprint trying to find daylight between everybody on this.”But asked to describe or define any of the benchmarks, Mr. Rumsfeld repeatedly described the American-Iraqi negotiations as continuing and unfinished.“It is not something that starts and ends,” he said. “It isn’t going to be tied up with a ribbon and announced there it is!”As reporters continued to press, asking whether he was backing away from what General Casey and Ambassador Khalilzad had seemingly announced, Mr. Rumsfeld continued to insist on the fluid nature of the process.“Are they meeting and having discussions on these things? Yes. Have they been meeting for some weeks and months? Yes,” he said.“But can I say that they the prime minister and the government have come down and said, ‘Yes we will do this, we won’t do that’? No.”The benchmarks, he concluded, were not “something revealed or chipped in stone.”Mr. Rumsfeld also partly dodged a question about whether American troops standing between warring Shiite and Sunni militias was an example of “mission creep.”“That’s a very complicated question,” he said, before noting that President Bush had said the United States must work to prevent a civil war.“I agree with the president,” Mr. Rumsfeld said, before repeating, “I agree with the president.”'"
"'06-10-26,'1','Housing developers are drastically cutting prices to move a backlog of unsold homes off the market, new statistics from the Commerce Department suggest. The median sale price of a new home in September 2006 was $217,000, 9.7 percent lower than in September 2005, the report said — the steepest year-to-year drop in more than three decades.The lower prices evidently had the desired effect: the number of new homes sold jumped by 5.3 percent in September compared with August, and inventories fell by 2 percent.Even so, the statistics depict a housing market that has slumped considerably from the lofty levels of a year ago. Though better than the month before, the sales volume figure for September was still 14.1 percent lower than in September 2005.And the supply of unsold homes — 6.4 months’ worth at the current pace of sales — remains uncomfortably high for developers.“It will take a long time for builders to clear their backlog,” wrote Dimitry Fleming, an economist with ING, in a report today. “Don’t rule out further price declines.”'"
"'06-10-26,'1','WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 — A liberal gay rights group said Wednesday that one of its employees, acting anonymously, had created the Web site that first published copies of unusually solicitous e-mail messages to teenagers from former Representative Mark Foley, which led to his resignation.A spokesman for the group, the Human Rights Campaign, said it first learned of its employee’s role this week and immediately fired him for misusing the group’s resources. The scandal surrounding Mr. Foley, a Florida Republican, has been a burdensome distraction for members of his party in the month before the midterm elections, and some Republicans have speculated that the e-mail messages were planted by a Democrat.The rights campaign’s spokesman, David Smith, said the employee, whose name he declined to disclose, was a junior staff member hired last month to help mobilize the organization’s members in Michigan. “The minute we learned about it we took decisive action,” Mr. Smith said.The Miami Herald and other news organizations have acknowledged obtaining copies of the same e-mail messages months ago but declining to publish them because of their potentially ambiguous contents.After the messages appeared on the Web, at stopsexpredators.blogspot.com, the Web site of ABC News followed with its own independent report. The ABC News report resulted in the disclosure of more sexually explicit electronic messages that Mr. Foley sent to other former Congressional pages.In the aftermath of the scandal, the creator of the sex predators Web site declined requests sent by e-mail to identify himself. Instead, he posted a message urging the news media to ask questions about “when the Republican leadership knew about it, what they did, how they were connected, what favors took place, etc.”'"
"'06-10-26,'1','The enemy we face in Iraq has evolved over the past three years. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, a sophisticated and violent insurgency took root. ...We learned some key lessons from that early phase in the war. We saw how quickly Al Qaeda and other extremist groups would come to Iraq to fight and try to drive us out. We overestimated the capability of the civil service in Iraq to continue to provide essential services to the Iraqi people. We did not expect the Iraqi Army, including the Republican Guard, to melt away in the way that it did in the face of advancing coalition forces.Despite these early setbacks, some very important progress was made in the midst of an incredibly violent period. Iraqis formed an interim government that assumed sovereignty. The Iraqi people elected a transitional government, drafted and adopted the most progressive democratic constitution in the Arab world, braved the car bombs and assassins to choose a permanent government under that constitution, and slowly began to build a capable national army.Al Qaeda and insurgents were unable to stop this progress. They tried to stand up to our forces in places like Falluja, and they were routed, so they changed their tactics. In an intercepted letter to Osama bin Laden, the terrorist Zarqawi laid out his strategy to drag Iraq’s Shia population into a sectarian war. To the credit of the Shia population, they resisted responding to the horrific violence against them for a long time. Yet the persistent attacks, particularly last February’s bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, one of Shia Islam’s most holy shrines, eventually resulted in sectarian reprisals. The cycle of violence in which Al Qaeda insurgents attack Shia civilians and Shia death squads retaliate against Sunnis has sharply increased in recent months, particularly in Baghdad.As the enemy shifts tactics, we are shifting our tactics as well.Americans have no intention of taking sides in a sectarian struggle or standing in the cross-fire between rival factions. Our mission is to help the elected government in Iraq defeat common enemies, to bring peace and stability to Iraq and make our nation more secure. Our goals are unchanging. We are flexible in our methods to achieving those goals.On the military side, our commanders on the ground are constantly adjusting our tactics to stay ahead of our enemies. We are refining our training strategy for the Iraqi security forces so we can help more of those forces take the lead in the fight and provide them better equipment and firepower to be successful. We’ve increased the number of coalition advisers in the Iraqi ministries of Defense and Interior so they can better plan and execute security operations against the enemy. We have changed our force structure so we can better respond to the conditions on the ground. ...Most recently, we have moved additional coalition and Iraqi forces into Baghdad so they can help secure the city and reduce sectarian violence. After some initial successes, our operations to secure Baghdad have encountered greater resistance. Some of the Iraqi security forces have performed below expectations. Many have performed well and are fighting bravely in some of Baghdad’s toughest neighborhoods. Once again, American troops are performing superbly under very difficult conditions. As we fight this enemy, we’re working with the Iraqi government to improve the performance of their security forces, so they can regain control of the nation’s capital and eventually assume primary responsibility for their country’s security.A military solution alone will not stop violence. In the end, the Iraqi people and their government will have to make the difficult decisions necessary to solve these problems. ...We’re pressing Iraq’s leaders to take bold measures to save their country, and we’re making it clear that America’s patience is not unlimited. Yet we also understand the difficult challenges Iraq’s leaders face, and we will not put more pressure on the Iraqi government than it can bear. ...I know the American people understand the stakes in Iraq. They want to win. They will support the war as long as they see a path to victory. Americans can have confidence that we will prevail because thousands of smart, dedicated military and civilian personnel are risking their lives and are working around the clock to ensure our success. A distinguished independent panel of Republicans and Democrats, led by former Secretary of State Jim Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton, is taking a fresh look at the situation in Iraq and will make recommendations to help achieve our goals. I welcome all these efforts. My administration will carefully consider any proposal that will help us achieve victory.It’s my responsibility to provide the American people with a candid assessment on the way forward. There is tough fighting ahead. The road to victory will not be easy. We should not expect a simple solution. The fact that the fighting is tough does not mean our efforts in Iraq are not worth it.To the contrary, the consequences in Iraq will have a decisive impact on the security of our country, because defeating the terrorists in Iraq is essential to turning back the cause of extremism in the Middle East. If we do not defeat the terrorists or extremists in Iraq, they will gain access to vast oil reserves and use Iraq as a base to overthrow moderate governments across the broader Middle East. They will launch new attacks on America from this new safe haven. They will pursue their goal of a radical Islamic empire that stretches from Spain to Indonesia.I know many Americans are not satisfied with the situation in Iraq; I’m not satisfied, either. And that is why we’re taking new steps to help secure Baghdad and constantly adjusting our tactics across the country to meet the changing threat.But we cannot allow our dissatisfaction to turn into disillusionment about our purpose in this war. ...'"
"'06-10-26,'1','With Mr. Bush and Mr. Maliki clearly focused on their domestic political audiences, the political tumult in both countries carries the potential to drive them further apart.Mr. Bush’s comments were the latest iteration in a recent rhetorical evolution that has seen him move from vowing to “stay the course” in Iraq to promising flexibility. But Mr. Bush also said, “We cannot allow our dissatisfaction to turn into disillusionment about our purpose in this war.” He said eight separate times, in various formulations, that he was committed to getting the job done.When asked whether the United States was winning in Iraq, Mr. Bush said, “Absolutely, we’re winning” — a declaration that prompted a volley of statements from Democratic leaders, who accused Mr. Bush of being “in denial” about Iraqi violence.Mr. Bush indicated no major changes in his overall strategy in Iraq, saying he continued to support Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and the generals overseeing the war. But he also spoke in terms of a conflict that would be long, hard and bloody. Asked whether the United States would seek permanent military bases in Iraq, Mr. Bush said that would be up to the Iraqi government, adding, “Frankly, it’s not in much of a position to be thinking about what the world is going to look like 5 or 10 years from now.”It was the second time this month that Mr. Bush had held a news conference at which he took pains to explain his war plan, which has come under increasing criticism even from fellow Republicans. Many of them fear that the administration’s failure to squelch the violence in Iraq is seriously harming the party’s prospects for retaining control of Congress. Mr. Bush on Wednesday emphasized that he was well aware of the graphic images Americans were seeing nightly, as well as the many unfulfilled promises and predictions made by his administration over the course of the conflict.“We overestimated the capability of the civil service in Iraq to continue to provide essential services to the Iraqi people,” Mr. Bush said. “We did not expect the Iraqi Army, including the Republican Guard, to melt away in the way that it did in the face of advancing coalition forces.”Mr. Bush said that as of last spring, he had expected that he would be able to reduce the American troop commitment by early next year. There are currently more than 140,000 troops in Iraq. He portrayed the decision against reducing troops by early next year as an example of his willingness to alter his approach.Before taking questions from reporters, Mr. Bush offered an opening statement that amounted to a kind of scorecard for Iraq, in which he acknowledged disappointments as well as successes. Among successes, he listed the capture of Saddam Hussein, free elections, and economic progress for farms and small businesses. Among the developments he called “not encouraging,” he listed “the bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad, the fact that we did not find stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, and the continued loss of some of America’s finest sons and daughters.”Mr. Bush alluded to a theory embraced by White House aides that the public would support a conflict in which it could see a clear path to victory. “It’s my responsibility to provide the American people with a candid assessment on the way forward. There is tough fighting ahead,” Mr. Bush said, adding, “The fact that the fighting is tough does not mean our efforts in Iraq are not worth it.”Campaigning in Cincinnati on Wednesday, Vice President Dick Cheney echoed the president’s remarks. “We’ll be flexible,” he said. “We’ll do all we can to adapt to conditions on the ground. We’ll make every change that is necessary to do the job, to finish the job, and to bring the troops home with the honor they’ve earned.”Aides to Mr. Bush have acknowledged that the rising violence in Iraq was depressing support for the war. And the bad news was being amplified in Democratic campaign ads declaring the war a failure. In all, Democrats have had 220 ads mentioning Iraq, running them 46,402 times at a cost of at least $41.6 million since January, according to an analysis by the Campaign Media Analysis Group. Republicans have run 48 ads on the Iraq campaign 11,677 times, costing at least $8.5 million.Asked about debate among Republicans over whether the president was helping by calling attention to Iraq, the White House spokesman, Tony Snow, said that Mr. Bush was obliged to do so. “Everybody’s talking about it, everybody’s writing about it, all of his critics are on television talking about it,” he said. “It’s important for the president’s voice to be heard in his own words.”While Mr. Bush has said repeatedly that the two parties’ approaches to Iraq should be a major issue in November, he acknowledged Wednesday that ultimately one person should be held responsible for progress in the war. “The ultimate accountability,” Mr. Bush said, “rests with me.”'"
"'06-10-26,'1','But Mr. Kissell is one of a dozen Democratic candidates for the House, and a few for the Senate, who are making at least some headway in tapping voter anxiety about trade.In Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine, a Republican in a race against Representative Sherrod Brown, is being hammered for his support of trade bills. In upstate New York, Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, chairman of the House Republicans’ campaign committee, faces stiff opposition over the same issue.If many pro-trade Republicans lose on Election Day, President Bush, who has had trouble winning approval of trade deals in the past, could face even tougher odds.“If the Democrats do as well as it appears, you’re going to see more resistance to trade agreements,” said Mickey Kantor, a top trade negotiator under President Bill Clinton, who corralled a hundred or so Democrats for the trade deals of the 1990’s.By contrast, only a handful of Democrats voted for the deals negotiated by Mr. Bush, in an environment of Congressional economic populism that has led to other fights, including widespread criticism of China’s economic practices and broad opposition to foreign purchases of American companies.The antitrade climate has recently persuaded Republicans to avoid putting lawmakers like Mr. Hayes on the spot. In September, they pulled bills opening up trade with Vietnam, Peru and a number of poor countries. There is talk that especially if the Democrats win a majority in either chamber, Republicans may try to pass these bills in a lame-duck session before the new Congress arrives in January.“At the very least, Democrats are going to demand new requirements on enforcement of labor, environmental and corruption problems with our trading partners,” Mr. Kantor said. “I would welcome that.”Trade is not the only issue here in North Carolina’s Eighth Congressional District, which spreads across the piedmont in the center of the state and encompasses old and new high-tech industries, farms, the prosperous banking corridors of Charlotte and people who work at Fort Bragg, where support for the Iraq war and for Republicans remains high.Even some Democrats concede that Mr. Hayes has done well for many of his constituents, especially farmers and the defense industry. He also points with pride to his efforts in getting state and county financing for Castle & Cooke and the Dole Food Company to build a corporate research center on the site of the razed Kannapolis mill.Further, his record on free trade is not easy to simplify. The Democratic campaign has focused on his last-minute decision to cast the deciding vote for the Central American Free Trade Agreement last year, when he yielded to blandishments from Republican leaders after vowing to vote no. Mr. Kissell says the vote was a “flip-flop” that broke faith with constituents, but Mr. Hayes argues that the late concessions he wrung from the Bush administration changed the nature of what he was voting for.Among the promises, he says, was one that led to an agreement with China later in the year imposing American quotas on 36 types of textile imports. Another brought a clause in the Central America accord that requires that future clothing imports from Nicaragua include interior lining made in the remaining mills of his home state.“I got commitments the length and breadth of which I had never seen for my district,” Mr. Hayes said. “So it’s not a flip-flop. I voted for a whole different piece of legislation than the one that had been discussed up to that point. It was a tremendous leap in the right direction for this district.”The congressman says his views on trade have evolved over the years from one of reflexive opposition to one of accepting some of the reality of global competition.“When I first went to Congress,” said Mr. Hayes, who is now concluding his fourth term, “my outlook was to vote no and stop these trade agreements. Well, obviously that wasn’t working. Do you take something that’s not working and hope for better results? I don’t think so. Or do you slow down free trade and in the meantime bring additional opportunities to the district?”To demonstrate, Mr. Hayes stumped the farm areas of his district on Monday with Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns to tell voters that the Central America agreement had cleared the way for more soybeans, cotton, hogs and chickens to be exported.“It’s awfully easy to denigrate free trade,” Mr. Johanns told a farm group in Monroe, southeast of Kannapolis. “This agreement was very much in favor of the United States farmer.”Though Mr. Kissell’s chances may not be great, Democrats say he could pull an upset, given his creative insurgent tactics. He got a lot of publicity, for example, from a stunt selling gasoline at $1.22 a gallon to remind voters of the price when his opponent first took office eight years ago.And when news reports showed that Mr. Kissell had $88.94 in his campaign account, compared with $1 million for Mr. Hayes, he merrily announced that he was sorry it was not zero. An additional $150,000 quickly came in, along with promises of help from two popular North Carolina Democrats, former Senator John Edwards and former Gov. Jim Hunt.In interviews, both candidates said national issues like the scandals in Congress and the Iraq war were not foremost in the minds of constituents. Mr. Kissell treads lightly on the war, and also takes a hard-line stance on immigration, opposing legalized status for any illegal immigrants.Mr. Hayes looks confident, a man who can draw on his family’s role here. Traveling across the area in a pickup truck, he loves to point out landmarks: the hometown of the country singer Randy Travis, a friend’s agricultural processing plant, a new titanium factory.“Welcome to Oakboro, where they have the biggest Fourth of July parade in the district,” he said as the place whizzed by. “There’s Stanly High School, where we just stood up an R.O.T.C. unit the other day.”Asked about the mood of the district, he said with a smile, “Well, they like their congressman.”In the 19th century the piedmont was a place of farming, and in the 20th a place of manufacturing. In the 21st century, he said, it will retool to new industries and businesses.The campaign against him, he said, is out of a Democratic playbook.“ ‘You got to attack Hayes on trade,’ ” he said. “ ‘That’s the way to get him.’ Whoever the candidate is, they latch on to that.“Meanwhile, we continue doing the same thing. We’re here, we talk to them, we listen. They don’t necessarily think you’ll solve their problems, but they want to know you’re interested.”'"

"'06-10-26,'1','Last year, in fact, it was Chrysler that propped up Mercedes as it stumbled amid quality problems that threatened to tarnish the image of its expensive luxury cars.Now it is Chrysler that has acknowledged it needs a restructuring, its second in six years. Its Detroit business model, based on mass-market sales of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, has not shifted quickly enough to keep it competitive as gas prices have risen.“The goal is to create a strategy that assures the sustained profitability at Chrysler and DaimlerChrysler,” Bodo Übber, DaimlerChrysler’s chief financial officer, said during a conference call with industry analysts and journalists. He added: “We don’t exclude anything here.”Mr. Übber continued, “We at first are doing the analysis, then we are talking about it, and we draw our conclusions.”His careful language prompted immediate questions about whether Chrysler was up for sale. To one, Mr. Übber replied, “I can only repeat myself — first analysis, second measures, third is conclusion. That is what my statement is.”He added: “Any speculation is what you are doing. I don’t do any speculation.”Officials at Chrysler maintained later Wednesday that the company was not in danger of being abandoned by the German parent that had wooed it so forcefully almost a decade ago. Indeed, DaimlerChrysler’s chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, who ran Chrysler until a year ago, has emphasized his intent to fix Chrysler, not dump it.But a potential suitor exists: Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault and Nissan who tried unsuccessfully this summer to explore a possible alliance with G.M., has made no secret of his desire to add a North American partner to his union.Beyond Mr. Ghosn, the most likely candidate might be a company from China, whose automakers are eager to expand into North America, said Ron Pinelli, an industry analyst with Autodata of Woodcliff Lake, N.J.But “all the Chinese would want would be the dealers and the brand names — they don’t want the factories or the employees,” he said.Chrysler’s situation now is in sharp contrast to 1998, when it was an auto industry darling, known for taking risks with styling and earning some of the biggest profits in the industry on vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Ram pickup.The merger was the brainchild of a former Daimler-Benz chief executive, Jürgen Schrempp, who envisioned a global company that could share purchasing, manufacturing and development while keeping separate identities for both Chrysler and Mercedes.The deal, however, has never paid off on the scale that Mr. Zetsche imagined, and indeed, Chrysler has bounced back and forth between its traditional identity as the third-biggest American player and its goal of joining Mercedes among a small group of foreign brands with clear identities and buyer loyalty.Indeed, Chrysler won buyers two years ago with its 300C sedan, with a transmission and other technology from Mercedes. The 300C seemed like a promise of a new, more nimble company.But Chrysler continued to rely heavily on S.U.V.s and pickups for nearly three-quarters of its sales, the highest percentage in the industry, leaving it unprotected earlier this year when $3 a gallon gas prices stalled those sales and sent buyers to more fuel-efficient vehicles.As a result, Chrysler’s revenue plummeted by 23 percent along with its sales in the third quarter. The company, which had insisted its fortunes would improve during the second half of the year, instead surprised analysts a few weeks ago by disclosing it expected to lose $1.5 billion.Earlier this week, Chrysler acknowledged that it has kept as many as 100,000 vehicles in its order bank, a separate supply of cars that have not been assigned to dealers and are not included in its inventory figures, which are already high by industry standards.The company’s problems led it to create what it is calling “Project Refocus,” an effort to re-examine every aspect of the way Chrysler does business, from manufacturing to purchasing and its overhead costs.The company is striving to cut the equivalent of $1,000 out of the cost of every vehicle, a difficult task given that Chrysler is introducing eight models this fall. It is much easier for companies to cut costs before new models are introduced.Another difficult task would be setting a value on Chrysler as a separate company, as well as determining the mechanics of a possible breakup. The original agreement between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler did not set forth terms for a split — a reflection of the confidence Mr. Schrempp and Chrysler’s chief executive at the time, Robert J. Eaton, felt about the merger’s long-term success.But even the faintest possibility of a division is likely to put more pressure on Chrysler’s employees, including its union members. Chrysler executives were upset earlier this fall when the U.A.W. broke off talks on health care concessions similar to those granted at General Motors and at Ford Motor.At the time, the union’s president, Ron Gettelfinger, said an analysis by the U.A.W.’s financial adviser showed Chrysler was not in dire enough shape to require the givebacks.Now, the bad news could spur both sides back to the table — and create even more turmoil for residents of the Motor City, who have already been battered by an unrelenting deluge of dire developments this year.“How are people supposed to work when there’s all this craziness going on?” Mr. Pinelli asked. “It’s so unsettling when you don’t know what’s coming next.”'"
"'06-10-26,'1','PARIS, Oct. 25 — Eager to win approval for a deal to purchase Euronext, John A. Thain, chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, said Wednesday that he would be open to having more Europeans on the board of the combined exchange.In an interview here, Mr. Thain also hinted that he might raise his offer. The original bid, announced in June, was worth about $10 billion and its value has climbed along with the share price of the Big Board’s parent NYSE Group. Mr. Thain is seeking to ease fears in France of American domination of a trans-Atlantic exchange.The question of European representation “is still open, and it is still a topic of discussion,” he said. “We have a deal, and we spent a lot of time negotiating the current structure,” but “that doesn’t mean there can’t be changes to it.”In return for making the board of a combined exchange more European, Mr. Thain reiterated that he wanted a rival bidder, Deutsche Börse, to drop out and contribute its share-trading activities to N.Y.S.E.-Euronext. He also said he would like the exchange in Milan to join the new company.But in an important shift, Mr. Thain said he might consider changes to the board even if Frankfurt and Milan did not take part.'"
"'06-10-26,'1','CHICAGO, Oct. 25 (AP) — The Boeing Company said Wednesday that its third-quarter earnings fell 31 percent and that its 787 jet program would be more expensive than expected.Quarterly profit was hurt by a charge for discontinuing the in-flight Internet service Connexion. That offset higher jet sales and a 19 percent increase in total revenue, reflecting a thriving commercial plane business that led Boeing to raise its outlook for 2007 earnings and revenue.But investors focused on the company’s comment that its 787 jet program was receiving increasing pressure over weight and supplier-related issues. It will also have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more than anticipated this year and next on research and development for the plane, which is scheduled to be delivered in 2008.“Weight remains a dogged issue,” the chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said on a conference call.Net earnings for the period were $694 million, or 89 cents a share, down from $1.01 billion, or $1.26 a share, a year earlier.Results included a charge of $280 million, or 22 cents a share, to exit the Connexion business. Earnings suffered in comparison with a year earlier, when the company had 93 cents a share in gains from tax benefits and asset sales.Revenue rose to $14.7 billion from $12.4 billion, bolstered by a 45 percent increase in commercial airplane sales.'"
"'06-10-26,'1','The timing is no coincidence: Cathy Ruse, a spokeswoman for Missourians Against Human Cloning, said the group specifically bought advertising time during Game 4, when Suppan was scheduled to pitch. The Cardinals led the Detroit Tigers, two games to one, in the best-of-seven series.Suppan’s agent, Scott Leventhal, said Wednesday evening that Suppan had approved the use of the ad. Leventhal said earlier in the day that he would try to have the ad withdrawn because it would be a distraction to Suppan’s team. But after speaking by telephone with Suppan in the Cardinals’ clubhouse, Leventhal said that Suppan had given his permission for the ad to be used during the game.Austin Ruse, the husband of Cathy Ruse and also a member of the group, said that Suppan’s comments were taped at his home this week and that they were picked up by the group Tuesday and inserted into the ad. “He was the last piece to fall into place,” Austin Ruse said. “He shot it. He said it was ready. We slipped it in.”Tony La Russa, the Cardinals’ manager, was asked Wednesday his opinion of Suppan’s involvement and his policy about players involving themselves in such causes.“Our organization encourages guys to get involved in something beyond just baseball,” La Russa said. “I just like the fact that guys make a commitment.”La Russa has involved himself in social causes, including the protection of animals.Suppan, 31, is a right-hander who went 12-7 in the regular season with a 4.12 earned run average and is 1-1 in the postseason with an E.R.A. of 1.86. He hit a home run against the Mets in the National League Championship Series and was named the most valuable player of that round.He will become a free agent after this season, and his performance in the postseason has probably enhanced his value.Like Kenny Rogers of Detroit, a veteran who is 3-0 in the playoffs, Suppan has enjoyed a season of revival and has spurred discussion in the postseason. With Rogers, the topic was a substance he had on his pitching hand during a victory in Game 2 on Sunday.Involvement of baseball players in politics is unusual but not unprecedented.Curt Schilling of the Boston Red Sox endorsed President Bush for re-election in 2004, an autumn in which the Sox won the Series; his Red Sox bosses endorsed Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic challenger.Jim Bunning, a former pitcher for the Tigers and the Philadelphia Phillies, is a Republican senator from Kentucky.The stem-cell research issue has moved to the center of the Missouri Senate campaign between Jim Talent, the Republican incumbent, and Claire McCaskill, the Democratic challenger. Talent opposes the amendment; McCaskill supports it.The actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson’s disease — one of many conditions that researchers hope to cure through stem-cell research — has taped a commercial supporting McCaskill and her stand on the issue.Because that ad ran during an earlier World Series telecast, the opponents of the amendment decided to respond with the ad featuring the athletes.Cathy Ruse said her group paid $135,000 to broadcast two ads during the game on stations carrying the game in Missouri — one a 60-second version, the other a different 30-second ad. Suppan appears only in the longer version.She said that members of her group who happened to be neighbors of Suppan told the group he was sympathetic to their views. Leventhal confirmed that Suppan felt passionately about the stem-cell issue and was aware of the ramifications of becoming involved in a political issue when he made the advertisement.“Jeff has been in this game a long time,” Leventhal said. “He knows what he is doing.”Connie Farrow, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Coalition for Life-Saving Cures, a group that favors the amendment, said that even though Suppan was one of her favorite Cardinals pitchers, she disagreed with his statements in the ad and would prefer to rely on the opinions of medical experts on questions of science.“He’s wrong — respectfully, I say that,” Farrow said in a telephone interview. “I would ask Jeff Suppan why Missourians don’t deserve to be treated the same as other Americans when it comes to health care.”When the ad is broadcast, it will be seen only on stations serving Missouri; viewers in other parts of the country will see local advertising for their region instead.'"
"'06-10-26,'1','Mark W. Everson, the commissioner of the I.R.S., has repeatedly warned that the agency will crack down on religious organizations that violate laws barring charities of any type from involvement in partisan political activities.This election cycle, additional accusations of such violations have been made against religious organizations in California, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio.Whether the I.R.S. has responded to those complaints is unknown; the agency is barred by law from disclosing its investigations.All Saints Church, an Episcopal congregation in Pasadena, Calif., has said it was under investigation, but no other church named in complaints that have become public has acknowledged an I.R.S. inquiry.Despite a report last year by the Treasury Department’s inspector general that concluded political considerations had played no role in the I.R.S.’s selection of nonprofit groups for review, the agency’s silence regarding its investigations has led to accusations of political bias.“From what we know, the I.R.S. has gone after liberal organizations primarily, the N.A.A.C.P. and the liberal church in California,” Ms. Sloan said, referring to the inquiry into All Saints Church. An I.R.S. investigation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was closed with no finding of wrongdoing.“Clearly, there are violations on the conservative side, and no action appears to be taken.” Ms. Sloan said. “If they’re being even-handed,” she added, “I certainly can’t tell.”Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington also filed a complaint with the I.R.S. last week against the Living Word Christian Center in Brooklyn Park, Minn., accusing its senior pastor of violating the law by openly stating his support for a Congressional candidate.“We can’t publicly endorse as a church, and would not for any candidate,” the senior pastor, the Rev. Mac Hammond, told his congregation during a service on Oct. 14 as he introduced Michele Bachmann, a Republican state senator who is running for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. “But I can tell you personally that I’m going to vote for Michele Bachmann,” he said.During her remarks that followed, Ms. Bachmann said that she had been called by God to run for the House seat after three days of fasting and praying with her husband.The Star Tribune in Minneapolis later reported that Mr. Hammond could not vote for Ms. Bachmann because he does not live in her district.Mr. Hammond did not respond to messages seeking comment.The Star Tribune quoted Mr. Hammond as saying he had “learned my lesson.”'"
"'06-10-26,'1','The Honda Motor Company, Japan’s third-largest carmaker after Toyota and Nissan, said yesterday that second-quarter profit fell 4.3 percent after a 30.6 billion yen ($257 million) loss on derivatives.“Honda’s management was trying to be clever and they failed,” said Edwin Merner, who oversees $1 billion as president of Atlantis Investment Research.Wrong-way bets on interest rate swaps have hurt Honda’s earnings at least four times in two years.Net income dropped to 127.9 billion yen, or 70.5 yen a share, in the three months that ended Sept. 30, from 133.7 billion yen, or 72.45 yen a share, a year earlier, Honda said yesterday. Honda’s earnings were less than its own forecast of 131.6 billion yen.The carmaker gets as much as 70 percent of its operating profit from North America and uses derivatives to hedge against currency and interest rate fluctuations.The impact of derivatives outweighed gains from a weaker-than-expected yen, which raised earnings by 43.7 billion yen.'"

"'06-10-26,'1','In the given auction, Li Xin (West) opened two hearts, showing at least 4-4 in the majors and 5-10 high-card points. After the takeout double by Greenberg (South), Feldman cue-bid three hearts to indicate a heart stopper and to ask his partner to bid three no-trump with a spade stopper.After any lead but a spade, three no-trump would surely have failed, but West gave Greenberg a chance by starting with his fourth-highest spade.South won the first trick with his spade king and could anticipate taking four hearts with the aid of a finesse of dummy’s ten, two or three diamonds, and one or two clubs. But both to gain some information about the distribution and to prepare for a possible squeeze, declarer led his remaining spade at Trick 2. The defenders took their three spade tricks, Liu Jing (East) discarding the diamond five and South throwing the diamond six and club five.West shifted to the club ten, and East ducked when declarer called for dummy’s king. Now South played a heart to his ace, led a heart to dummy’s ten and cashed the heart queen to give this end position:Needing four more tricks, declarer took the board’s diamond ace, then played a diamond. When East put in the ten, there was a lengthy pause. From his club-ten shift, it looked to South as if West had begun with 4-5-2-2 distribution, and if so, the diamond queen was about to drop. So declarer went up with his king and down in his contract. Was South unlucky, or did he miss an inference?China A gained 12 international match points, but would have lost 3 imps if declarer had finessed in diamonds. The match ended in victory to China A by 41 imps to 10, which converted to 25 victory points to 5. If Greenberg had made three no-trump, the score would have been only 20 v.p.’s to 10.Declarer missed an inference. If East had begun with 3-1-5-4 distribution, he would have thrown another club, keeping three diamonds and two clubs, not, as South assumed, two diamonds and three clubs.Note also that if declarer had played a heart to dummy’s ten at Trick 2, before exiting with a spade, he would have been able to take all four of his heart tricks, bringing East under pressure in the minor suits. In the above position, if South had already cashed his heart king, what would East have discarded? If the club jack, declarer could play a club to establish a trick there. And if East threw a diamond, his queen would appear on the second round of the suit.'"
"'06-10-26,'1','And if she had: Would it matter?With Americans spending $12 billion a year getting injected, stapled and snipped, cosmetic surgery long ago went mainstream. Yet there is one arena in which an accusation of having work done still stings, and that is in politics.In the 2004 presidential election, when it was suggested that John Kerry had undergone Botox injections to wipe away facial lines, the Democratic candidate did his best to furrow his brow and declare such talk nonsense. (No matter, his critics said, since he was guilty of something much worse: looking French.)Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California whose changes have been chronicled on Web sites like awfulplasticsurgery.com, denied rumors during his 2003 campaign that he had had a face-lift, making light of the talk by suggesting that people had him confused with Cher.Senator Clinton, too, could not let the accusation stand, calling Mr. Spencer’s remarks scurrilous and making it clear she had had no work done.Politicians clearly care about their looks. As Phil Gramm, the pugnacious former senator from Texas who ran for president in 1996, used to ask, “Can an ugly man be elected president?” (Mr. Gramm failed to win the Republican nomination.) But they seem to care even more that their looks are not perceived as artificial or that their interest in looking good might be held up as a potentially fatal example of vanity.Of course, politicians have long sought ways to convey youthful, healthy vitality. Gerald Ford’s advisers asked for a neutral backdrop for his debates, to downplay his thinning gray hair. Richard Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who served three decades in Congress, penciled his eyebrows to give them shape and definition. And every politician who has sat before the television lights has been slathered in makeup (remember Richard Nixon?).It is the rare public person who will allow his or her looks to be ridiculed, as Janet Reno, the former attorney general, did when she joined the cast of “Saturday Night Live” for a Will Ferrell sketch called “Janet Reno’s Dance Party.”Still, there is a fine line between primping and preening. The question is, in a plastic age, does surgery still cross that line?Dr. Cap Lesesne, a board-certified plastic surgeon, has been performing cosmetic surgery for two decades, but he said that it was not until about 10 years ago that he began to see politicians at his Upper East Side practice. In the past five years, he has treated at least 18 federal, state and local officials, he said. And, he said, he knows of six United States senators who have had plastic surgery.“Politicians want to come away looking younger, better, healthier,” he said, “but with something that does not say they have had plastic surgery.”Careful not to reveal details that would compromise his patients’ identities, he described one case that provided an illustration of the lengths public figures will go to hide “work.”“This person knew they were going to run for election in four years,” he said. So the politician would come in every six months leading up the election, gradually improving in appearance each time, but never so much as to arouse suspicion.Being in the public spotlight almost daily and worried about getting caught in the surgery act, “they have to go to extreme lengths,” Dr. Lesesne said. Surgeons, he said, can become co-conspirators in the deception by, for instance, going through the mouth to hide incisions.This squeamishness over plastic surgery by politicians does not seem to extend to voters abroad. Silvio Berlusconi, the former billionaire prime minister of Italy, had a turbulent time in office, but admitting to a face-lift and hair transplants was not one of the things that Italy’s voters held against him.Dr. Z. Paul Lorenc, also a board-certified plastic surgeon in Manhattan, thinks American politicians would be better off if they just admitted to what is often obvious to all.“I think it is silly,” he said. And what’s wrong with getting features youthified, he asked. “Politicians, in many ways, have it worse than celebrities,” he said. “There are so many pictures of them out there.” And unlike Hollywood royalty, they can not count on decent lighting.Obsession with looks by politicians and voters is hardly a new phenomenon. It may be an accident of history, but William Howard Taft, at 320 pounds, was the last obese president, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the last bald president, had to win World War II before he was elected.Even as far back as 1860, looks were raised in a letter to an aspiring presidential candidate.With a beard, “You would look a great deal better, for your face is so thin,” wrote Grace Bedell, 11. “All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease their husbands to vote for you and then you would be president.""The reply came back promptly four days later:“As to the whiskers, having never worn any, do you not think people would call it a piece of silly affectation if I were to begin it now?'"
"'06-10-26,'1','Kevin Kelly, who teaches at Seton Hall University’s family law clinic, said the ruling had potentially sharp implications for the daily lives of same-sex couples.“Health insurance is a huge issue,” Mr. Kelly said. “There are so many working couples, and if one partner has insurance and can extend it to their partner and kids, that’s going to be a huge benefit for the working poor.”Until now, he said, the struggle for equality in family life had been, at least publicly, fought by gay and lesbian couples with some financial resources.“For low-income people, it’s more of a hurdle. Now, they might not have to hire lawyers for adoptions and name changes, or to file complaints,” Mr. Kelly said.The current domestic partnership law in New Jersey, the court found, is far too limited to bridge the inequality gap between same-sex partners and married couples. The justices wrote that “the unequal dispensation of rights and benefits to committed same-sex partners can no longer be tolerated under our State Constitution.”Under the domestic partnership law, same-sex couples have some rights, like guaranteed hospital visitation, certain tax benefits and guardianship rights if a partner becomes incapacitated. But such partners do not have many of the rights central to marital partnerships, the court wrote.They cannot, for example, receive the same health benefit guarantees from employers as married couples or the right to change a surname without petitioning the court, the justices wrote.The domestic partnership law made it harder for same-sex couples to gain legal recognition as partners than for heterosexual couples to marry.Domestic partners must share a home and “agree to be jointly responsible for each other’s basic living expenses during the domestic partnership,” among other rules, none of which are required by the marriage statutes.The justices ordered the State Legislature in the next six months either to amend the marriage laws to include same-sex couples or to create a parallel structure granting the same rights to same-sex couples.The decision sends New Jersey down a path taken by Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut and California, all of which have enacted laws providing same-sex couples the rights granted to heterosexual married couples.Massachusetts has legalized same-sex marriages. Civil union laws in Vermont and Connecticut provide benefits equivalent to marriage, as does the law in California.Still, even with legal parity in those states, advocates for gay and lesbians say that significant inequality remains.The federal government, for example, does not recognize same-sex marriages or unions. That means such couples are not eligible for federal benefits, like Social Security payments granted to surviving spouses, family leave and the right to file joint tax returns. (The New Jersey court’s decision would not affect benefits granted by the federal government.)Still, for gay and lesbian couples in states that have moved toward parity with marriage, the change has been profound, said Mary Bonauto, who was the lead counsel in the court case that led to the legalization of same-sex marriages in Massachusetts.“Marriage laws touch on just about every area of law between birth and death,” she said.Since same-sex marriage was legalized in her state, some of the 8,000 couples that have wed have told her how their lives have changed. For instance, in cases where spouses have died, partners have been able collect final paychecks or make decisions about the body. One couple won the right from a state veteran’s cemetery to be buried next to each other, she said.Even something as routine as the “the unquestioned ability to probate the estate,” she said, has “given people enormous piece of mind.”'"
"'06-10-26,'1','But the ruling passed along the thorniest question, of whether true equality demands the same name, to the Legislature, saying “such change must come from the crucible of the democratic process.”Within minutes of the court’s 3 p.m. announcement, three Democratic Assemblymen, working with Garden State Equality, a gay rights organization, said they would introduce a bill demanding marriage.But reaction from their fellow legislators was guarded, with some saying privately that civil unions, not marriage, would be the likely result. In a joint statement, the Assembly speaker, Joseph J. Roberts Jr., and the Senate president, Richard J. Codey, both Democrats, called the 180-day deadline “unreasonable” and said, “The only remaining issues now confronting the Legislature are ones of terminology and clarification.”For people involved in the legal battle over gay marriage, the decision is an important shift from recent court rulings in New York, Washington state and California that essentially rejected gay couples’ claims on marriage and the benefits it confers. And by issuing a nuanced and complicated 90-page ruling that left observers struggling to declare who won and who lost, the court may have neutralized gay marriage as an issue in the Nov. 7 elections, when eight states will consider ballot measures to ban same-sex marriage.“The decision certainly minimizes what the radical right thought they might have had as a mobilizing tool in the last days of the election,” said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy organization.Nathaniel Persily, who teaches law and political science at the University of Pennsylvania and was a co-author of a recent paper titled “Gay Marriage, Public Opinion and the Courts,” praised the justices for “an incredibly smart and politically astute opinion.”“The court has placed itself exactly where a majority of the American people are,” Professor Persily said. “A majority of Americans are in favor of equal rights for gays tantamount to marriage, but a majority is also against calling that relationship marriage.”At the same time, he added: “This must be seen as a win for gay rights. They did not get the name they want, but they are getting more rights than could have been imaginable just a few years ago. Who would have thought 50, 20, even 10 years ago that a unanimous state supreme court would have said that gay relationships are entitled to equal rights as heterosexual relationships?”But conservative groups opposed to same-sex marriage blasted the ruling as an example of the justices essentially trading judicial robes for legislative pens.“The court is holding a legal gun to the head of the State Legislature, and saying, ‘Listen, there are two bullets, you get to pick the bullet: either gay marriage or civil unions,’ ” said Matt Daniels, president of Alliance for Marriage, an organization based in the Washington area that supports a federal Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. “And that is not democracy. That is court-imposed policy-making that takes this out of the hands of the people.”Until now, courts in many other states — including the Court of Appeals in New York in July — had rejected similar lawsuits by same-sex couples, with the common rationale being that only the legislative branch can define or redefine marriage. No legislature has yet done that, though several states, including New Jersey, and dozens of cities and towns have enacted domestic partnership laws to grant gay couples some benefits in recent years.Nineteen states have adopted constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. Most others have statutory bans, but New Jersey and four other states do not. In addition to Massachusetts, where more than 8,000 gay couples have married in the past three years, Vermont and Connecticut authorize civil unions, which generally offer the same legal protections, if not the same societal status, as marriage.Wednesday’s ruling caps a legal journey begun in 2002, when seven couples who had been denied marriage licenses in their towns filed the lawsuit now officially known as Lewis v. Harris. Two lower courts rejected their constitutional claim, with the Appellate Division ruling in June 2005 that marriage between members of the same sex was neither a fundamental right nor one covered by the constitution’s equal-protection clause.Many gay-marriage advocates thought New Jersey’s high court, which heard the case Feb 15, was their best shot at victory.It is regarded as one of the most liberal and independent in the country, having been among the first to strike down a ban on sodomy and rule in favor of adoption rights for gay couples.The 4-3 split on Wednesday did not break along traditional political lines: the majority included all three justices appointed by a Democratic former governor, while the three dissenters, who backed the more far-reaching solution of opening marriage to gays, were named by a Republican.“We do not have to take that all-or-nothing approach,” Justice Albin wrote of the marriage question in the majority opinion.“We cannot find a legitimate public need for an unequal legal scheme of benefits and privileges that disadvantages same-sex couples,” he said. “We cannot find that a right to same-sex marriage is so deeply rooted in the traditions, history, and conscience of the people of this state that it ranks as a fundamental right.”The court also expounded about the importance of equal treatment to protect children, diverging from the rulings of other state courts, which had said protecting procreation was one rationale for limiting marriage to heterosexual couples.“There is something distinctly unfair about the state recognizing the right of same-sex couples to raise natural and adopted children and placing foster children with those couples,” Justice Albin said, “and yet denying those children the financial and social benefits and privileges available to children in heterosexual households.”In the dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz argued that the semantic distinction of marriage versus civil unions was itself a meaningful one, arguing that the institution “bestows enormous private and social advantages.”Agreeing that same-sex couples deserve the same rights and benefits as heterosexual ones, she wrote that she “can find no principled basis, however, on which to distinguish those rights and benefits from the right to the title of marriage.”As the case now moves from the domain of the courts to that of the legislature, some parties are gearing up for a fight.Several Republican legislators — including State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr., who is in a close race to unseat United States Senator Robert Menendez — said on Wednesday that they would like to see an amendment to the State Constitution banning same-sex marriage. But with the Democrats in control of both legislative chambers, and Mr. Codey and Mr. Roberts voicing opposition, such a ban seems unlikely.At the same time, Garden State Equality, the gay rights group, began its lobbying campaign for marriage immediately after the decision, buying several weeks of television time for a new advertisement that began appearing on cable Wednesday night.The ad features a cancer-stricken police officer, Lt. Laurel Hester, recalling her fight for death benefits for her female partner. Ms. Hester, bald and struggling to breathe, taped the commercial before she died early this year. The ad concludes with words appearing on the screen that read, “Support marriage equality. Your gay neighbors are depending on you.”'"
"'06-10-26,'1','The next spring, the patron of the Cardinals, Gussie Busch, lit into them for their alleged nonchalance, treating them like serfs who had let down their baron.Flood, artistic and intelligent, had brooded all winter about his misplay. Now he was sure Busch was going to send him away, as owners had the right to do. But management held off until after the 1969 season, when Flood was included in a blockbuster trade with the Phillies.His refusal to be traded — even though the Supreme Court had allowed the owners to have their way with their vassals — became one of the most important acts by a professional athlete in America.“It’s been written, Curt, that you’re a man who makes $90,000 a year, which isn’t exactly slave wages,” Howard Cosell said to Flood on ABC. “What’s your retort to that?”This exchange is recorded in a new book, “A Well-Paid Slave: Curt Flood’s Fight for Free Agency in Professional Sports,” by Brad Snyder, published by Viking. Snyder has done excellent reporting on the complicated man, including claims that Flood, while adept with a pencil and sketch pad, did not paint the oil portraits attributed to him. Despite his personal flaws, Flood changed the way his business worked.Yesterday, Miller recalled how it took him three years to prod the brightest major leaguers into questioning the reserve system. In December 1969, at a meeting in Puerto Rico, Flood faced tough questions from representatives of the Players Association.Tom Haller of the Giants, a white man, wanted to know if Flood, an African-American, was motivated by labor issues or civil-rights issues. Flood accepted the challenge from Haller and replied that his thrust was about the right of athletes to choose their own employer. Snyder and Miller say Flood was motivated by race as well as economics.“I remember him as a stand-up guy,” Miller said yesterday, praising Flood as “bright, very social-minded” and able to push himself because of the discrimination he had faced as a young player.Flood eventually lost his Supreme Court case and made only a cameo return to the major leagues, living in Europe for part of a decade before coming home and dying of cancer in 1997. By then, Miller and players like Jim Hunter, Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally had challenged the reserve system, and won their cases. As of Tuesday, players and owners have agreed on a contract without any brinksmanship or labor stoppage.Miller is not a fan of the current luxury-tax system that made the Yankees pay $34.05 million for going above the limits in 2005. He said yesterday that unions should not allow leagues to set arbitrary ceilings on how much teams can spend, even with a so-called tax.He is also skeptical of the drug testing and the penalties that have gotten much steeper in the past year after pressure from Congress. Miller said that all sides lack scientific evidence of the dangers of steroids. If baseball were really interested in the players’ health, Miller added, it should ban tobacco and test for usage. Now there’s an idea.However, the old union man was happy with the prospect of peace and high salaries for five more years. “I see the minimum salary near $400,000,” Miller said, “and I remember how the minimum was $6,000 when we started. That’s magnificent.”Flood’s principle concerned freedom, not his relatively high salary. Miller helped advance both. The two men are among the most important figures in baseball history, but are not likely to be elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame via an oversight vote in the near future.The game goes on. With labor peace guaranteed, the Cardinals and the Tigers are playing another World Series in a new stadium with modern amenities. A man who lost track of a fly ball 38 years ago in St. Louis helped bring about this era of affluence all around.'"

They withdrew again without clashing with fighters there, authorities said, and apparently without finding the soldier.The brief incursion into the vast Shiite slum known as Sadr City took place as hundreds of people gathered in the district for Friday prayers, according to Sheikh Abdul Zahra al-Suwadi, the head of Mr. Sadr’s office in the area.American troops in armored vehicles, supported by helicopter gunships hovering overhead, stayed in the area about an hour, searching a mosque and a school, Mr. Suwadi said, but no fighting occurred.“We have been ordered by Najaf to not engage in any clashes with them, because we know they want to drag us into a conflict, but we are now a part of the political process,” he said.He was referring to the holy Shiite city of Najaf, Mr. Sadr’s base.

"'06-10-27,'0','A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers on Friday.IVANOV TAKES TOUGH LINE ON NATO: At a Kremlin meeting on Thursday, NATO’s secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, urged Russia to recognize Georgia’s right to territorial integrity and pressed for a de-escalation of tensions between the two countries. Russia’s defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, responded that the conflict was not between Georgia and Russia, but between Georgia and its former autonomous republics, Abkhazia and North Ossetia. (The newspaper wrote that Mr. Ivanov specifically emphasized the word “former.”) Mr. Ivanov also said that a plan by the United States to build a missile defense system in Eastern Europe has prompted Russia to take precautionary measures. Watching the transformation of NATO, the minister continued, required Russia to make adjustments to its defense policy.DUMA MAY RESTRICT GRAND JURIES: The State Duma is considering a law that would strip Russia’s grand juries of their right to immediately release those they acquit in cases involving terrorism and grave crimes. The courts already have little authority in Russia: their rulings can be overturned in later trials. The legislation currently before the State Duma would require a suspect acquitted by a grand jury to wait 10 days — the length of time needed for a court decision to take effect — before he or she could be freed.“STATE SECRETS” LEAKED IN KOZLOV CASE: Russia’s Prosecutor General opened a criminal investigation on Thursday into the disclosure of “state secrets” in connection with the investigation into the murder of Andrei Kozlov, deputy head of the Russian Central Bank. According the prosecutor’s office, a source close to the probe began leaking sensitive information to the media about a month after the murder. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, which is overseeing the investigation, said the leaked information was largely inaccurate, and called the actions of the prosecutor general’s office “juridical stupidity.”FEWER RUSSIANS WATCHING PUTIN ADDRESS: Interest in President Vladimir V. Putin’s annual on-air exchange with his constituents has been dropping since the event began in 2001. About 29 percent of Moscow’s television audience tuned in to this year’s question-and-answer session held on Wednesday, compared with 52 percent in 2001. The Kremlin, it seems, cares more about the type of questions submitted by viewers than ratings. According to one Kremlin source, Russians have stopped submitting questions on pensions and salaries, which shows that people are beginning to live better.PRIME MINISTER REBUKES CABINET AFTER PUTIN’S CRITICISM: Russia’s prime minister, Mikhail Fradkov, lambasted ministers after President Putin, in his televised meeting with constituents on Wednesday, criticized government officials for failing to take responsibility for past mistakes. Mr. Fradkov warned his colleagues that they could face severe punishment for their indiscretions. Above all, he criticized ministers’ slow handling of Russia’s alcohol crisis.MASS ALCOHOL POISONING IN PSKOV: As of Thursday, 16 people had died and 446 more had been hospitalized after consuming counterfeit and poor-quality alcohol in the Pskov region. On Wednesday the regional government declared a state of emergency after the mass poisoning. According to the region’s vice governor, the majority of those afflicted were alcoholics who consumed industrial alcohol. A regional government official said that the situation may be linked to a government crackdown on local bootleggers. The newspaper said that the problem extended beyond Pskov, affecting the entire country.NATIONALISTS AND ANTI-FASCISTS TO FACE OFF IN MOSCOW: The Russian Anti-Fascist Front, an organization headed by Russia’s foremost liberal activists, will hold a demonstration on the Day of People’s Unity on Nov. 4.

"'06-10-27,'0','Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday that opponents of the Atlantic Yards project, who have long protested the use of eminent domain, were “misguided” and called the suit a “delaying tactic.”“This is a project whose time has come,” Mr. Bloomberg said.Jessica Copen, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gargano, declined to comment, saying that Mr. Gargano’s staff had not received a copy of the suit.Joe DePlasco, a spokesman for Forest City Ratner, said the lawsuit was disappointing, but not unexpected. “We have tried everything in our power to negotiate fair and beneficial transactions,” he said. “However, a small group of people have either refused to speak with us or, for whatever reason, we have been unable to reach an agreement.”The Atlantic Yards project would include 8.7 million square feet of housing, office and retail space and a basketball arena for the Nets.If eminent domain were used by the state, it would be intended to complete the process of assembling property needed for the project, some of which the developer has negotiated to buy from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Forest City Ratner said yesterday that it controls 89 percent of the land needed to complete the project. Forest City said it has control of 93 percent of the condominiums and co-ops on the site and 66 percent of the commercial property.Forest City is also the development partner in building a new Midtown headquarters for The New York Times Company.The lawsuit comes at a time of heightened public scrutiny around the country of the use of eminent domain, with a groundswell of sentiment in some regions that it has been used too often to unfairly seize private property.Mr. Brinckerhoff said yesterday that the plaintiffs’ case was supported by a United States Supreme Court ruling in 2005 that said the city of New London, Conn., could proceed with a large-scale plan to replace a faded residential neighborhood with offices and commercial development, over the objections of 15 homeowners, who refused offers for their homes and wanted to stay.Even though those plaintiffs lost, Mr. Brinckerhoff said the case, Kelo v. New London, buttressed the arguments of the plaintiffs in Brooklyn because of what the Supreme Court said the government could not do, including using eminent domain simply to transfer property from one individual to another without sufficient public benefits.Daniel Goldstein, one of the plaintiffs and a member of Develop Don’t Destroy Brooklyn, said yesterday that the suit may heighten nationwide awareness of the conflict in Brooklyn and help raise money for the group’s legal bills.'"
"'06-10-27,'0','The ruling in New Jersey left it to the Legislature to decide whether to legalize gay marriage. Even so, the threat that gay marriage could become legal energized conservatives at a time when Republican strategists say that turning out the base could make the difference between winning and losing on Nov. 7. With many independent analysts predicting Republicans will lose the House and possibly the Senate, President Bush’s political team is counting on the party’s sophisticated voter turnout machinery to hold Democratic advances enough that Republicans can at least maintain control.“It’s a game of margins,” said Charles Black, a Republican strategist who consults frequently with Karl Rove, the chief White House political strategist. “You’ve got about 20 House races and probably half a dozen Senate races that are either dead even or very, very close. So if it motivates voters in one or two to go vote, it could make a difference.”Democrats predicted Thursday that the debate would not dramatically alter the national conversation in an election that has been dominated by the war in Iraq and corruption and scandal in Washington. But across the country, Republicans quickly embraced the New Jersey ruling as a reason for voters to send them to Capitol Hill.In Virginia, the court decision could not have come at a better time for Senator George Allen, a Republican whose campaign for re-election had been thrown off course by allegations that he had used racially insensitive remarks. The Virginia ballot includes a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Mr. Allen supports it; his Democratic opponent, Jim Webb, argues that the ban is unnecessary.On Thursday, Mr. Allen could be found in Roanoke at a rally held by backers of a ballot initiative to ban gay marriage. Victoria Cobb, an organizer of the events, said the New Jersey ruling was giving the cause “a new momentum.”“It’s an issue that’s going to play a big role in the next 12 days,” Mr. Allen’s campaign manager, Dick Wadhams, said in an interview.In Tennessee, another state with a proposal to ban gay marriage, Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., a Democrat running for the Senate, was sparring with Republicans over an advertisement in which the Republican National Committee asserts that Mr. Ford supports gay marriage — an assertion Mr. Ford says is wrong. On Thursday, he responded with his own advertisement, calling the Republican ad “despicable, rotten lies.”Mr. Ford says he will vote for the Tennessee gay marriage ban. With early voting under way, the Republican candidate, Bob Corker, is telling voters that he has already cast his ballot in favor of the gay marriage ban.And in Pennsylvania, where Senator Rick Santorum, the Senate’s leading Republican backer of a gay marriage ban, is fighting for his political survival, conservative advocacy groups were working furiously to revive the gay marriage debate. Pennsylvania does not have a ballot initiative.“It’s an important wedge issue to talk about between candidates where there are two distinct viewpoints on the issue,” said Joseph Cella, president of Fidelis, a national Catholic advocacy group that has embraced Mr. Santorum for his views on abortion and gay marriage. Mr. Cella said his organization, which was also working to pass a gay marriage ban in Colorado, was contemplating an advertising campaign.As of January 2006, 45 states had enacted some form of law — from a simple statute to a constitutional amendment — banning same-sex marriage. In addition to Virginia, Tennessee and Colorado, the states that have proposed constitutional amendments on the November ballot include Arizona, Idaho, South Carolina, South Dakota and Wisconsin.For conservatives, the debate brings back memories of 2004, when they rallied in opposition to a Massachusetts court ruling that same sex couples had a right to marry. The issue proved central in places like South Dakota, where Senator John Thune, a Republican, railed against activist judges in his successful campaign to oust Tom Daschle, then the Senate Democratic leader.This year, by contrast, conservatives have felt frustrated that the debate over gay marriage and the judiciary is no longer front and center.“I think they’ve been a little sedate,” Mr. Cella said. But in the wake of the New Jersey ruling, he said, conservatives “are really getting motivated, and this is a shot in the arm to propel that.”Democrats, though, insist they are not concerned.“It’s not going to be close to the issue it was in 2004,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. “In 2004 they scared people that the court ruling in Massachusetts would just change America and families dramatically. By 2006, it’s clear that hasn’t happened, and so the scare tactic, what motivated people to go to the polls, just isn’t there.”One place the New Jersey court ruling is not likely to have much of a political impact is, paradoxically, New Jersey, a largely Democratic state that does not have a proposed gay marriage ban on the ballot.The Republican Senate candidate, State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr., has been distancing himself from his party throughout the campaign, in which he has focused largely on economic issues, domestic security and alleged ethical improprieties on the part of his Democratic opponent, Senator Robert Menendez. A Kean spokeswoman said Thursday that theme is unlikely to change.“We’re going to stick with the issues that we’ve been winning on this entire campaign,” the spokeswoman, Jill Hazelbaker, said. Gay marriage, she said, “is not an issue that he’s not talking about, or that he’s trying to avoid. But in terms of our marquee issues that we’re winning on, I don’t think it rises to an issue that’s going to define the campaign.”'"
"'06-10-27,'0','“It’s an accounting shift from one quarter to the other, not something that is economically significant for us over the course of the year,” the chief financial officer, Christopher P. Liddell, said in an interview.This fiscal year, which ends in June, Microsoft said it expected to report revenue of $50 billion to $50.9 billion, and earnings per share of $1.43 to $1.46.After Microsoft reported its financial results, its shares rose for a time in late trading, as high as $28.54. In the regular session, the stock closed at $28.35, up 4 cents.“This was a good quarter, and the company gave pretty strong guidance for the year,” said Charles Di Bona, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “Microsoft is heading into a strong product cycle, and it looks as if Vista is going to be a bigger deal than a lot of people expected.“The longer-term question, though, is around Microsoft’s online services business. We’re in the midst of this huge online advertising boom, and Microsoft is going sideways.”In an interview this month, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, noted that the MSN and other Web sites gave Microsoft a solid online presence and that the company had a number of initiatives in place to improve the performance of that business.But the quarterly results at the online division underlined the challenge Microsoft faces. Revenue fell about 5 percent, to $539 million, and the business swung from a profit of $68 million a year earlier to a loss of $136 million.Microsoft’s overall revenue for the quarter rose to $10.8 billion, compared with $9.7 billion in the period a year earlier. Net income increased to $3.48 billion, or 35 cents a share, compared with $3.14 billion, or 29 cents a share, including a charge of 2 cents a share for legal expenses last year.The company’s earnings per share were 4 cents higher than the consensus estimate of analysts compiled by Thomson Financial, and revenue was a bit higher than expectations.In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Liddell, the chief financial officer, said that Microsoft would be looking selectively for acquisitions and that online services was an industry where Microsoft might make a move, though he did not elaborate.The Xbox game console and software unit is an area of investment that seems to be going according to the company’s plan. The entertainment and devices division, which includes Xbox, is still losing money but the losses are shrinking, to $96 million from $173 million a year earlier. The Xbox 360 machines went on sale last year, and six million have been sold worldwide. Software sales are going well, and Microsoft’s online game service, Xbox Live, has more than four million members.That business, Mr. Liddell said, is on track to become profitable in the 2008 fiscal year, which begins next July.'"

The average square footage of a house sold in September declined as well, pulling down the median price.While new-home prices across the country may not be falling quite as sharply as the reported numbers suggest, builders are also offering a variety of hidden price cuts in response to the much harsher housing climate that they now face.“We’re going to run our business as if it’s going to stay tough for a while,” said Richard J. Dugas Jr., chief executive of Pulte Homes, one of the nation’s largest residential builders. On Wednesday, Pulte said its profit in the third quarter fell by more than half, compared with the same period a year earlier.Indeed, profits are falling fast in many parts of the country for builders, who are rapidly scaling back on their future construction plans.The home builders’ association reported that 45 percent of builders and developers said they cut prices in September to maintain sales volume. That was up from only 19 percent a year earlier. Similarly, the association reported that 55 percent offered amenities like granite counters or upgraded kitchen cabinets for no additional cost. Only 19 percent did so a year earlier.The cost of those incentives was not reflected in the new-home price data, which suggested that builders were making even less money from each sale than the shrinking official prices would indicate.“Builders do not like to lower prices because it sends the wrong signal to potential buyers,” Patrick Newport, an economist with Global Insight, said in a research note. “How much incentives matter today is difficult to gauge — but in markets in which power is quickly shifting from sellers to buyers, they probably matter quite a bit.”Cancellations were also left out of the new-home statistics. The Commerce Department records a new home as sold when the buyer and builder sign a contract. The home builders association said that cancellations had jumped by 50 percent in the last year.“The cancellation rate is really big,” said Dave Seiders, chief economist of the association. “It’s exploded over the last year.”The new-home sales report followed a report that showed softness in the market for previously owned homes, which account for about 85 percent of all home sales.The pace of existing-home sales in September slowed 14 percent from a year earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 million. That was the lowest rate reported since January 2004.For new homes, the seasonally adjusted annual sales volume figure in September was 1.1 million — 14.2 percent lower than in September 2005.Another closely watched economic barometer released this morning — the Census Bureau’s report on durable goods orders — showed an unexpected 7.8 percent rise for September from August. Durable goods, which include things like dishwashers, are monitored by economists as a gauge of business investment.The upswing, however, was almost entirely a result of a surge in orders for aircraft. Boeing took orders for 175 planes last month, nearly tripling the nonmilitary aircraft component of the durable goods figure.Over all, the latest economic data pointed to continued but slower growth through the end of the summer. When orders for the transportation equipment sector were stripped out, the gain in durable goods orders was only 0.1 percent.'"
"'06-10-27,'0','“There’s a genuine recognition that we need to make some changes,” said Laure Aubuchon, head of international business development for the New York City Economic Development Corporation. Winning financial business is “so important to New York City,” she said. The financial services industry makes up 9 percent of the city’s work force and provides 31 percent of the tax base, she said.The rise of London has been particularly notable as a reflection of its geography. Some of the most rapidly developing markets and fastest-growing companies can be found in Asia and Russia, which are within time zones that can do business easily with London but not with New York.“In the 1980s and 1990s, large transactions did not get done without the United States capital markets,” said Michael Cole-Fontayn, a managing director with the Bank of New York in London. That is no longer true, he said.“The European and Asian capital markets are becoming deeper and more liquid by the day,” he said. “You can get a $5 billion stock global depository receipt offering or a $10 billion privatization satisfied outside the United States S.E.C.-registered markets.”TMK, a Russian pipe manufacturer, hopes to raise $1 billion in a November public offering. The company was approached by the New York Stock Exchange but chose to list on the London Stock Exchange.London “is the world’s biggest financial center and very internationally flavored,” Vladimir Shmatovich, the chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. And, he said, London is a closer flight to Moscow.Of course, Wall Street banks dominate London and have benefited from doing business with the new wealth of Russia, Asia and the Middle East. But because the banks do a growing amount of business outside New York, the city misses out on some of the taxes, the financial services jobs and the jobs that support those jobs.Beyond its location, London is attracting investors and companies because of a perception that regulatory scrutiny is more burdensome in the United States than in London. At the same time, while London does not use the euro, that common currency has helped bring depth to the capital markets of Europe, benefiting London.“At the moment, people are still arguing New York versus London,” said Shaun Springer, the head of Napier Scott, a headhunting firm based in London that specializes in trading jobs. In five years, he predicts, “there will be a real, visible gap,” with London taking the lead.So far, the only financial arena where New York is clearly being surpassed is initial public offerings. This year, through the end of September, companies raised £17.9 billion ($33.2 billion) in initial public offerings on London’s exchanges. In New York, initial public offerings raised $26.5 billion through September. By the end of 2006, more than $40 billion will be raised in Hong Kong, thanks to two oversize bank offerings. Hong Kong’s leadership in public offerings is not expected to extend to 2007, when the battle between London and New York will be fiercer than ever.Other trends seem to favor London. Syndicated lending grew 54 percent in Europe in 2005, but just 15 percent in the United States, according to Thomson Financial. Hedge fund assets in Europe grew 80 percent from 2003 to 2005, versus 28 percent in the United States, according to International Financial Services London, which promotes British banking business.High oil prices have in the past meant a flood of money from the Middle East into the United States. But cash-rich Middle Eastern families and governments are now looking to invest in Europe or Asia — through London or another financial center, rather than through New York.Not surprisingly, there are few people in New York willing to acknowledge London’s superiority.“I laugh, because if you were to dial back to the late 1980s, Tokyo was going to rule the world,” said Ms. Aubuchon of the city’s Economic Development Corporation. “I would never underestimate the power of Americans, when they get annoyed at being put down, to come roaring back.”To assist that comeback, Mr. Bloomberg’s office is spending $600,000 on a study by the McKinsey consulting firm on the issue.Many executives outside the United States say they could probably save them the time and trouble — the biggest problem is that it has become just too forbidding to do business in New York.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposed stricter rules on corporate controls, “is just one problem of many,” said Alan Yarrow, vice chairman of the German bank Dresdner Kleinwort, who is based in London. Others include the Patriot Act, the Department of Homeland Security and the perception that America does not welcome outsiders, he said.“Getting people into the country is becoming a problem,” Mr. Yarrow said. “You have to have a situation where clients can come and see you.”Many foreign companies and executives have a “fear of the United States: of litigation, of Sarbanes-Oxley, of the reach of the S.E.C., of the disclosure requirements and penalties associated with false disclosure,” said Mr. Cole-Fontayn of the Bank of New York.The New York markets, meanwhile, have not been lobbying hard overseas over these issues, some executives say.The London Stock Exchange “came after us very aggressively and did a good job of selling themselves,” said Christian Hogg, the chief executive of Chi-Med in Hong Kong, a Hutchison Whampoa division that began trading in May on London’s small capitalization stock market division, AIM.Nasdaq, however, never contacted the company, Mr. Hogg said.And companies pay more to list in the United States. A study by the consulting firm Oxera that was commissioned this summer by the City of London found that investment banks’ underwriting fees for listing a company in Europe were about half those for listing in the United States.But listing in London has had its challenges, Mr. Hogg added. Executives have to work hard to get brokers and analysts to notice their companies. “Nothing is guaranteed on Day 1 on AIM. It requires a lot of money,” he said.Company executives are not the only ones in finance choosing not to come to New York. Stricter entry rules after Sept. 11, 2001, mean that some of the world’s banking talent that would have gravitated to New York is going elsewhere.“Just getting into America, even if you’re British, is an issue,” Mr. Springer of Napier Scott said. “We’ve had candidates that arrived for an interview, were told they couldn’t leave a room in the airport and were put on the next plane back,” he said. Consequently, America is not experiencing the same explosion in specialized trading products that London is, he said. London, on the other hand, has a more open visa and work permit policy, he said.Mark Warms, the global head of sales and marketing for FXall, a large foreign exchange platform for institutional customers, said, “Certainly, you have to argue that London is the most culturally diverse financial center in the world.”London’s talent pool may be international and its finance business growing, but newly arrived Wall Street bankers may be astonished by some of its local traditions: most of the city’s bars, for example, close at 11 p.m., and most restaurants stop serving food around 10 p.m. Food delivery is still a rarity. Sending a FedEx package after 6 p.m. is difficult and the subway closes at midnight.Still, London’s growing financial business has put the end to one British tradition that few will mourn: “the food,” said Stanley Fink, the former chief executive and chairman of the Man Group, the investment and hedge fund giant. London has gone from “one of the poorer places in the world to eat to one of the best,” he said.There has been an explosion in high-end dining in London. “Over the last five years, London’s upscale restaurant offering has grown, largely as a result of the strength” of the financial district, said Iqbal Wahhab, the owner of Roast, a new restaurant, which uses only ingredients from Britain and features dishes like herring roe on toast.In perhaps another sign of London’s ascendancy, Mr. Wahhab said he was seriously considering expanding Roast — to New York.'"
"'06-10-27,'0','He said that if the Iranians stopped enriching uranium, American diplomats would talk to them. He also had a to-do list for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to get into America’s good graces: “Do not undermine the Siniora government in Lebanon; help Israel get back the prisoner that was captured by Hamas; don’t allow Hamas and Hezbollah to plot attacks against democracies in the Middle East; help inside of Iraq.”But within the administration, things are a little more nuanced, Bush officials said. One administration official distilled the internal deliberations this way, “On Syria, there’s a very healthy debate about whether we should talk to them; on Iran, there is no debate internally.”The American officials who agreed to speak about the internal discussions are all involved in that debate, with some opposed to any discussions with Iran, Syria and North Korea, and others saying that such talks should be considered.Among those inside the administration who are urging more engagement with Damascus, most come from the State Department’s Near Eastern Affairs bureau, including Assistant Secretary C. David Welch, the officials said.But, surprisingly, in recent months, the usually hawkish deputy national security adviser, J. D. Crouch, has been pushing for the administration to talk directly to Syria, officials say. “His style with the Syrians is that we need to be very strict with them,” one senior administration official said. “It’s not a friendly ‘Let’s go for coffee.’ More like, ‘Let’s directly deliver a very strong message to them.’ ”The administration officials would not speak on the record because they did not want to be identified when discussing internal deliberations.The original “axis of evil,” as defined by Mr. Bush, comprises Iraq, North Korea and Iran. But after the United States-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, Iraq was replaced by Syria, given the 2005 assassination in Lebanon of Rafik Hariri, a former Lebanese prime minister. American officials and some at the United Nations have said Syria had a hand in the Hariri assassination. The Bush administration and Israel have also accused Syria of supporting Hezbollah in its raid into Israel this summer, an attack that set off a monthlong war.Officially, the United States has diplomatic relations with Damascus, where there is an American embassy. But it is manned by a chargé d’affaires and not an ambassador; Mr. Bush recalled the ambassador to Syria, Margaret Scobey, after the Hariri assassination.There is less debate within the administration when it comes to Iran. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is believed to have pushed the White House as far toward dialogue with Iran as it would go when she prodded Mr. Bush in May to offer to join European talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.Ms. Rice herself has offered to sit at the table with the Iranians, but she includes the usual caveat: Iran must first verifiably suspend its uranium enrichment program.As for North Korea, American officials continue to espouse the view that the United States, by insisting on talking to North Korea only within the confines of a regional group, can better share the burden of power.Ms. Rice offered reporters the diplomatic version of that argument last week. “There’s this myth out there that we haven’t been willing to talk to the North Koreans,” she said. “What we’ve been unwilling to do is to negotiate bilaterally with the North Koreans, another agreement that they are going to be free to disregard because it will only be with the United States and not with states that frankly have more leverage than the United States, like China and South Korea.”But the administration will continue to take hits over not talking to its enemies until it can demonstrably show that this strategy has had results, diplomats said. Said one European diplomat in Washington: “They’ve isolated Cuba for 40 years, and you see how well that’s worked.”'"
"'06-10-27,'0','Vietnamese admission would leave Russia, Iran and Ukraine as the biggest countries that have not yet joined the W.T.O.Among international companies, the experience of Prudential P.L.C. of Britain is what they dream of emulating. Eight years after receiving the first license for a foreign company to offer life insurance in Vietnam since the end of its war, Prudential has captured 41 percent of the life insurance market. That compares with 38 percent for Bao Viet, the state-owned life insurer, 11 percent for Manulife of Toronto and smaller shares for other companies.The British Prudential has made large profits by investing insurance premiums in local stock markets, up more than 70 percent this year, and in the soaring real estate market and government bonds, which pay interest rates well above Vietnam’s 7 percent inflation rate.With strong ties to provincial and central government officials, Prudential has now received the first license for a foreign company to offer a broad array of loans, including mortgages and consumer loans — giving it an early edge against foreign banks that hope to get into the Vietnamese market next year.“It’s the first-mover advantage,” said Charlie E. Oropeza, chief executive of Vietnam operations for Prudential P.L.C., which has no connection to Prudential Financial of Newark.European and Asian companies have similar leads in other markets, even as the United States imports nearly $9 in goods from Vietnam for every $1 of goods it sells here. Groupe Lafarge of France, the world’s largest cement producer, has built a large, modern cement-grinding operation on the Saigon River near the renamed Ho Chi Minh City.Metro of Germany dominates retailing with a chain of eight Costco-like warehouse outlets that sell to mom-and-pop stores across the country. But Warren Hodder, Metro’s director of nonfood purchasing and merchandising in Vietnam, said that no American company had called upon him to sell its goods in his stores, although delegations for American beef and Washington State apples came in with sales pitches.American companies have been slow to move, partly because of the memory of the Vietnam War. The United States did not lift its embargo on trade with Vietnam until 1994, and did not establish formal trade relations until the end of 2001.So American companies now rank ninth in foreign investment in Vietnam, with just a quarter of the approved investment from Taiwan or Singapore.There could be another delay for Americans in coming months. Congress is scheduled to vote in mid-November on whether to grant permanent status to the current, but temporary, normal trade relations with Vietnam. If the measure fails, Vietnam would still be able to join the W.T.O., but W.T.O. rules would not apply to trade with the United States.What Vietnam really wants from the United States is high technology, including nuclear power plant technology. But Vietnam, like China, is restricted by American limits on the export of military-related technology.Vietnamese officials insist that any attempt to develop nuclear power is related to energy security rather than weapons. France, South Korea and Russia have each been lobbying hard for Vietnam to buy their nuclear technology, but American companies and government officials have been silent, said Le Dang Doanh, a senior economic policy adviser to the government here.“Vietnam is very interested to increase imports from the United States,” Mr. Doanh said, adding that the terms of trade in general favor the United States. “How many T-shirts must Vietnam export to buy a Boeing?”Some of the biggest changes under W.T.O. membership will start coming next April 1. That is the date when Vietnam has agreed to allow foreign banks to set up 100 percent foreign-owned subsidiaries.With nearly double-digit economic growth and just 6 million bank accounts among 84 million people, Vietnam is one of the world’s great untapped banking markets. Houses are commonly bought and sold with briefcases stuffed with cash. Mr. Doanh said, however, that while the banking industry might soon flourish, no foreign bank was likely to replicate Prudential’s success in life insurance.The brokerage industry is also attracting foreign interest. Foreign investors can currently set up brokerage accounts in Vietnam to buy and sell stocks. But there are strict rules to prevent this money from being diverted into other activities, like real estate purchases.Vietnam’s two stock exchanges, one in Ho Chi Minh City and a much smaller one in Hanoi, experienced feverish trading this year. Their combined index more than doubled from the start of the year until April 25, before sliding back somewhat since.'"
"'06-10-27,'0','Fresh from a leadership seminar in North Carolina run by Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski, Jürgen Klinsmann said yesterday that he remained a candidate for the vacant coaching position with the United States national soccer team.“Absolutely I’m interested,” Klinsmann, who led his native Germany to the World Cup semifinals this summer, said in a telephone interview from his home in Southern California. “I kind of needed some time to reflect after the World Cup. I’ve been in touch with Sunil and had several conversations, all very positive. Right now, I’m trying to do my homework, talking to people to find out more about how things work in the U.S.”Klinsmann was referring to Sunil Gulati, the Columbia economics professor who is also the president of the United States Soccer Federation. Gulati is conducting a worldwide search for a replacement for Bruce Arena, and is currently in Europe.In addition to Klinsmann, American officials have spoken to some of the top coaches in the world, a list that includes Sven-Goran Eriksson, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guus Hiddink and Gérard Houllier. Also believed to be under consideration are Peter Nowak and Frank Yallop of Major League Soccer. Nowak, who is from Poland, coaches D.C. United and Yallop, a Canadian, coaches the Los Angeles Galaxy.Gulati has said that he hopes to announce a new coach by the middle of November, and that the person would have to be familiar with the game and the players in the United States, be fluent in English, or willing to learn, and also be willing to learn Spanish.Klinsmann has also been mentioned as a possible successor to Ricardo Lavolpe, an Argentine, as coach of Mexico’s national team. Asked if he had spoken to Mexican officials, Klinsmann said, “No comment.”'"
"'06-10-27,'0','TOKYO, Oct. 26 (AP) — Nissan Motor, which drew the limelight earlier this year for discussing a possible alliance with General Motors, said Thursday that profit rose 31 percent in the July-to-September quarter, thanks partly to gains that offset sliding sales.Net income surged to 164 billion yen ($1.38 billion) in the period, from 125 billion yen a year earlier, the company, which is based in Tokyo, said in a news release. But sales slid 0.9 percent, to 2.324 trillion yen ($19.6 billion).The number of vehicles sold in the company’s second fiscal quarter dropped 7.6 percent, to 883,000 units as Nissan struggled to win customers with a fleet of aging models.The company also warned that risks to future earnings include toughening global competition, and high energy prices, although it said a favorable exchange rate, with the yen weakening against the dollar, would help balance the risks.In a bid to strengthen its market position, Nissan and its partner, Renault of France, entered talks with G.M. this year about forming a three-way alliance. The talks came undone after Nissan and Renault declined to pay a premium for reaping what G.M. said would have been a disproportionate share of the benefits.Nissan’s president and chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said he had obligations to stockholders to consider partnerships, but said it was a matter of how much value the alliance could create.'"
"'06-10-27,'0','Media and telephone stocks, buoyed by the earnings at Comcast, led the market’s gains.Clear Channel Communications, the radio broadcaster, rose after it said it might put itself up for sale.The Dow Jones industrial average increased 28.98 points, or 0.24 percent, to 12,163.66, reaching a fourth consecutive record even as Boeing and General Motors fell.The Nasdaq advanced to a five-year high, rising 22.51 points, or 1 percent, to 2,379.10, a level not seen since February 2001.As of Wednesday, with about half the companies in the S.& P. 500 reporting earnings, 73 percent have posted profits that exceeded analyst forecasts, while 12.5 percent reported results that trailed estimates.Stocks fell early in the session yesterday on a report that showed durable goods orders excluding transportation rose 0.1 percent in September, less than forecast. Economists expected a 1 percent gain.Total orders rose last month by the most in more than six years on demand for commercial aircraft and business equipment, the Commerce Department said. The 7.8 percent jump was almost four times the estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.Other Commerce Department data showed the median price of a new home dropped 9.7 percent from a year earlier and new purchases rose 5.3 percent, to an annual pace of 1.075 million.Initial jobless claims climbed 8,000, to 308,000, in the week ended last Saturday, the Labor Department said.The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure, fell to 305,250, the lowest in eight months, from 308,000.Comcast climbed $1.24, to $40. Third-quarter profit excluding gains related to its purchase of Adelphia was 26 cents a share. That beat the 19-cent average analyst estimate from Thomson Financial. Comcast added more new phone, digital-TV and high-speed Internet customers than analysts had predicted.Lower oil prices helped drive gains in stocks. The December contract for crude oil fell 1.7 percent, to $60.36 a barrel, in New York on speculation that American stockpiles are adequate to meet demand in the coming weeks.Exxon Mobil rose 61 cents, to $71.62. Third-quarter net income was $1.77 a share, beating the average estimate of $1.59, as oil prices reached a record last quarter.Clear Channel rose $3.13, to $35.48, after the company said it was considering a possible sale.Sprint added $1.18, to $18.90.

"'06-10-27,'0','There is more than one way to define friction, as the choreographer Andrea Haenggi clearly recognizes. In her new work, “Friction,” seen Wednesday at Dance Theater Workshop, the key is to think of it as an enemy of motion.Ms. Haenggi has described her experiments in choreography as visual-motion constructions. For her Dance Theater Workshop debut, she employs film and video — complete with movable screens and live action from hidden cameras — in an attempt to reconfigure the space. Unfortunately, the attempts are not all that fresh.“Friction,” a work for eight accompanied by an electronic score written by David Linton and performed live by Ben Owen, is an assault of sound and image. Karen Young’s high-concept costumes, which include deconstructed vests and white tanks woven with grotesque strands of braided hair, play with the friction of fabric and flesh.In the work, Ms. Haenggi’s point of departure is the corridor. During a pre-show demonstration of resistance and power in the theater’s cafe, she, Laura Quattrocchi and Sophie Bortolussi push against one another like wrestlers. A woman, wearing a raincoat, blue socks and pink sandals, stands in the crowd, making sure that everyone can see she’s holding a ticket. But her pink eyebrows do more than hint that she is also part of the cast.That dancer, Tori Sparks, takes a seat in the middle of a row, and after a film showing dancers crawling and walking past one another in hallways, springs up from her seat — along with two others in the crowd — undulating her hips with feral abandon. Here and throughout the piece, Ms. Haenggi’s violently thrashing choreography, except for a brief court dance, is hindered by similarity and repetition.Dancers push five screens with wheels from one side of the stage to the other. The screens also display live-feed video, in which the cast is shown changing costumes backstage. But the close-ups that result, shot from odd angles, appear to be recorded.'"
"'06-10-27,'0','“Wonder Women: Idols in Contemporary Art,” at the Katonah Museum of Art, is a train wreck of a show — a boring, messy pileup of artworks hitched to a curatorial premise that spun off the rails. Most of the work on display is not just fluff, it is pretentious fluff. The exhibition purports to critically “examine our worship of feminine idols,” but it does so with the depth and insight of Joan Rivers on the red carpet.The show is basically a lineup of paintings, photographs and printed images of women from film, pop music and fashion, most of the women instantly recognizable, some of them cult figures. Adoration of these women has inflated them to “divine proportions,” as the curator writes in the catalog, “made possible through the vast dissemination of cheap, mass-produced likenesses.” Showing more images of these “profane idols,” however, does not appear to be a remedy.The curator of the show, Suzanne Ramljak, has been hoisted on her own petard, falling into the trap of promoting the very cult of personality in today’s visual culture that she seeks to question. Mere protestations to the contrary do not make it so, for the art itself belies the critique. Few of the artists who are assembled here have anything to say about fame or the worship of feminine idols, preferring instead to indulge in the sweet leisure of idolatry. There is nothing wrong with that, but let’s be upfront about it.What was strange and revealing about this exhibition was just how many artists the curator found who have made pictures of feminine idols and movie stars. Is this a fad, or just an opportunistic attempt to cash in on the notoriety of the famous subject? Andy Warhol did it, becoming a star through his screen prints of celebrities. Perhaps that is what Candice Breitz is thinking, for in her videos here she acts out scenes by famous actresses from recent hit movies and pairs them with video footage of the originals.Warhol is represented by a single work, a unique 1979 black and red screen print of Georgia O’Keeffe, speckled with diamond dust and based on a Polaroid of the aging artist that Warhol probably took some time in the early 1970’s. He has cropped the Polaroid so that O’Keeffe’s face fills the frame. She looks ghostly, even kind of saintly, with her lined face left in shadow, while her clothes, eyes and the kerchief covering her hair are stained blood red. This is the best work in the show and worth lingering over.There is nothing to say about David Levinthal’s color Polaroid photographs of Barbie dolls in different funky outfits beyond “so what?” And the same goes for devotional paintings of Madonna as a butterfly by Dona Lief and a painting of Audrey Hepburn by Otto Duecker. Nor am I convinced that Lisa Bertnick’s digital inkjet illustrations of futuristic outfits on mannequinlike models have any depth of meaning or purpose. They look like the computer tinkering of a youngish woman enamored of fashion and clothes.'"
"'06-10-27,'0','THE first McDonald’s franchise is a museum in Des Plaines, Ill. The first Starbucks is still selling coffee in Seattle. But the first Carvel ice cream stand, which Tom Carvel opened here in 1936, has just been sold and will probably be torn down.The 1.45-acre lot where the shop sits was sold by the Yonkers-based Thomas and Agnes Carvel Foundation in mid-September for $3.5 million to a group that said it intended to develop the land. The group, which includes Abdol Faghihi, who runs the Carvel, wants to build three stores on the property, and though one of them may be a Carvel, it will not be the original.“It certainly has some value, and I am very emotionally attached to it, but financially it can’t afford to pay its taxes,” Mr. Faghihi said about the old shop. The Town of Greenburgh said the taxes were about $33,000 a year.As the story goes, Mr. Carvel, who sold ice cream from a truck, was driving along Central Avenue (now renamed Central Park Avenue) during Memorial Day weekend in 1934 when his truck broke down. As the ice cream began to melt, he offered customers two-for-one deals, and they liked the softer ice cream.Two years later, Mr. Carvel opened his store right where his truck had broken down. He also let his friend, the McDonald’s founder Ray Kroc, copy aspects of the building’s design, including the glass front and pitched roof. Mr. Carvel then entered the franchising business. Before he died in 1990, the Carvel company was sold and is now owned by Focus Brands, which also owns Cinnabon and Seattle’s Best Coffee.'"
"'06-10-27,'0','Verizon and Cablevision are each asking customers to buy into what they call their triple play — cable television, high-speed Internet service and phone service with unlimited, nationwide calling. The monthly price for the basic triple play offered by Cablevision is $90 for the first year and $115 after that. For another $19.95, Cablevision also offers 500 minutes of calls a month worldwide. Verizon’s price is a flat $95 a month. There is little difference in the number of cable channels offered.Joseph M. Lawless, 41, lives in Massapequa Park, the first Long Island municipality to reach a cable agreement with Verizon, and he said that the Verizon offer “sounded interesting” but that he saw no reason to switch from Cablevision.“I’m ensconced with my cable deal, and it seems to be working out very well,” he said, adding that he switched to Cablevision’s triple play earlier this year for a savings of about $80 a month.He said that the cable service had gone out sporadically, knocking out his phone and Internet service, but that he used his cellphone as backup. For $44.95, Cablevision sells a backup battery that connects to the cable modem to provide up to eight hours of standby phone power. Verizon’s package includes a free backup battery that operates from 6 to 10 hours.But Mr. Lawless said that unless Verizon “comes up with some drastic savings, there is no reason for me to rock the boat and switch.”Mr. Bonner, the securities analyst, said that Mr. Lawless’s thinking was common. Even though “a lot of people hate their cable companies, Verizon will have to offer something more than just the same service,” he said.“I don’t see how they can crack the market without doing that,” he said.Verizon, which began its FiOS TV service in September 2005, offers it in parts of seven states. In New York, Verizon must receive franchise approval from local municipalities as well as the State Public Service Commission.It has received approval from 12 Long Island municipalities — Smithtown, Farmingdale, Valley Stream and Huntington within the last month — and the state has approved operation in Massapequa Park, Cedarhurst, Laurel Hollow, Lynbrook, Mineola, East Rockaway and the Towns of Hempstead and Oyster Bay. Verizon says it will build its network in each municipality within five years of franchise approval.John C. Hodulik, a telecommunications analyst for UBS Investment Bank in Manhattan, said that Verizon’s long-term “prospects are reasonable” because it offers “a better product” than Cablevision.He cited, for instance, a system that can be rented for $19.95 a month that records two television programs at once and plays the recordings through three television sets at once. It also allows customers to watch pictures or to listen to music stored on their home computer.To penetrate Cablevision’s dominance on Long Island, Mr. Hodulik said, Verizon has to get “positive reviews from people, and its product is good enough that it will get that kind of buzz.”'"
"'06-10-27,'0','“There is also substantial risk that our auditor will disavow any knowledge of our operations, our accounting practices, or our very existence prior to the date of the filing in which we disclose that what it told us earlier was wrong. It may insist that any suggestion of a prior relationship between us and our auditor be excised from our documents.“Our auditor may also require us to characterize an industry standard interpretation of generally accepted accounting practices, which it later determines to be incorrect, as a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.“It may require us to emblazon, in bright red letters, ‘We had a material financial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting’ on everything we send to the Securities and Exchange Commission or other government agencies, including on our employees’ personal tax returns, and on T-shirts that our employees may then be required to wear to work for the next 12 months.“Buying and printing such T-shirts for all of our employees could be expensive.“Even if we acquiesce to all of our independent auditor’s demands, we may still be unable to file timely reports with the S.E.C. because anything local auditors do must be cleared with our guy at the national office. Our guy is very busy and may not be able to get back to us.”Corporate anger so far does not seem to have turned too serious. It is sort of like the way voters used to feel about Congress: They denounced the institution, but thought their own representative deserved to be re-elected.Corporate executives who talk to me — always off the record because they do not want to risk angering those who can make their lives difficult — usually say their local audit partner is just fine, but they bristle at rules imposed by the firm’s national office, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the S.E.C.They complain that audits of internal controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are too detailed and too expensive and have made auditing firms rich without accomplishing much for the clients.They say auditors used to offer advice on how to account for a transaction but are now unwilling to do so. Auditors worry they will be accused of helping to structure a deal intended to make the company look better than it should, or of not being independent because they told the company what it should do.There is some truth in all those complaints, and the S.E.C. and the accounting oversight board, as well as the firms themselves, are trying to deal with specific issues. Those efforts may prove adequate, and the humor may not turn serious.But this could become an issue when Congress considers whether to amend Sarbanes-Oxley, as many companies want it to do next year.Might companies fight audit firms, which generally think Section 404 is a good thing? Or might they try to cut a deal, in which auditors do not oppose gutting Sarbanes-Oxley so long as something is done to limit the liability of auditors to investors when companies blow up?Auditors were much more popular with companies back in the days before Enron. As they respond to their new unpopularity, the rest of us must hope those days will not return.'"

"'06-10-28,'0','Some of this weekend’s participants say that when it comes to Mr. Clinton, there is no such thing as too much.“I only wish the weekend cost more, because the more money, the more good work the president can do,” said Mark Weiner, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser who is serving as an honorary host of the events. His co-hosts are two other Clinton friends, Ronald W. Burkle, a financier, and Steve Bing, a producer.Mr. Weiner added: “I consider President Clinton to be the most popular person on the planet, and perhaps the most popular American in the history of this country. And his foundation work is a wonderful thing.”But while there seems to be no shortage of fondness for Mr. Clinton in New York, his industriousness does put him at risk of driving supporters to wonder, what price love?People contributing $60,000 were invited to a welcome reception at the Gramercy Park Hotel scheduled for last night, a reception and premium dinner seats tonight at the Museum of Natural History, and a reception and Rolling Stones concert tomorrow night, which is also being filmed for a planned Martin Scorsese movie.In addition to those events, donors who have contributed $100,000 or raised $250,000 also received four tickets for brunch at Pastis with Chelsea Clinton and her parents; “gold” dinner seats tonight; and an invitation for one to play in a presidential golf tournament tomorrow with Mr. Clinton at the Bayonne Golf Club in New Jersey.Those who have contributed $500,000 — the “birthday chair package” — got “platinum” dinner seating tonight, a backstage pass and dinner with Mr. Clinton before the Stones concert. They can also have their picture taken with him.One Friend of Bill and a supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s senatorial campaigns said privately that he was skipping this weekend because he was “Clintoned out.” He added that the Clintons’ spate of fund-raisers, which date back to some this summer in the Hamptons, had been “absolutely endless.”James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington, said that some donors eventually tire of being asked for money. “It’s pretty costly these days to be a Friend of Bill, especially since you have to be a Friend of Hillary, too,” Mr. Thurber said.Another Clinton ally, Sarah Kovner, said that she and her husband, the lawyer Victor Kovner, would not be attending. “I have my Vassar reunion this weekend,” she said. “Also, I think this one is for really big-money donors. I was at the Clinton Global Initiative, which was my contribution to the foundation.”She said that she considered the relatively cheap “membership” fee of $15,000 to participate in that event money well spent.“They spend two and a half days talking in a substantive way about the work they’re doing,” she said. “It’s not for people who are interested in just showing up.”A spokesman for Mr. Clinton noted that people who did not support the former president as a candidate are now donating to the foundation’s nonpartisan efforts. The activities of the foundation, which had a budget of $42 million last year, include a major H.I.V. initiative that has reduced drug prices from $1,000 a year to about $140 in roughly 60 countries.Other programs focus on supporting health care and clean water projects and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 24 major cities.“If you can raise the money to support your programs, why wouldn’t you?” said the president’s spokesman, Jay Carson. “$100,000 is AIDS drugs for 500 kids.”The Clinton birthday bash got off to an unofficial start on Thursday night, as about 1,000 people gathered under a tent at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan to celebrate Mrs. Clinton’s 59th birthday (which actually fell on the same day as the party). The event cost $1,000 a plate and netted about $1 million for her re-election campaign.Mr. Clinton’s high profile on the fund-raising circuit this year has fueled speculation that his efforts are simply a prelude to what he would provide should Senator Clinton run for president in 2008.“I think with him standing next to her, she’s definitely one of the front-runners,” said John Catsimatidis, another high-level Clinton donor.Terry McAuliffe, Mr. Clinton’s longtime confidant and an official organizer of the parties, said that they were being held now, rather than closer to Mr. Clinton’s birthday on Aug. 19, because “two months ago would’ve been right in the middle of the elections” — the thick of campaigning — “and we didn’t want to be raising money for his foundation when people could be giving to other Democrats’ campaigns.”Mr. McAuliffe said, chuckling, that by now any potential donors to the foundation have had earlier opportunities to give to candidates. “We’ve already hit everybody up pretty hard by now.”'"
"'06-10-28,'0','While business groups contained their Democratic contributions to only a handful of candidates throughout the year, a shifting political climate and an expanding field of competitive Congressional races has drawn increased donations from corporate political action committees.For the first nine months of the year, for example, Pfizer’s political action committee had given 67 percent of contributions to Republican candidates. But October ushered in a sudden change of fortune, according to disclosure reports, and Democrats received 59 percent of the Pfizer contributions.Over all, the nation’s top corporations still placed larger bets on Republican candidates. But at the very time Republicans began to fret publicly about holding control of Congress, a subtle shift began occurring in contributions to candidates, particularly in open seats.“We keep fighting up until the last minute of the last day,” said William C. Miller, vice president for political affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, carefully measuring his words to remain positive about the Republicans’ chances. “But when the smoke clears on Nov. 8, there are certainly going to be lots of opportunities for us to get to know the new freshman class.”An analysis by The New York Times of contributions from Oct. 1 to 18, the latest data available, shows that donations to Republicans from corporate political action committees dropped by 11 percentage points in favor of Democratic candidates, compared with corporate giving from January through September.Republicans still received 57 percent of contributions, compared with 43 percent for Democrats, but it was the first double-digit October switch since 1994. “A lot will hold their powder for now,” said Brian Wolff, deputy executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “But after the election, we will have a lot of new friends.”Even before the election, many new contributions were funneled toward open races, like the Eighth Congressional District in Arizona. The Democratic candidate, Gabrielle Giffords, received checks of $5,000 each from the political action committees of United Parcel Service and Union Pacific. Lockheed Martin split the difference, donating $3,000 to Ms. Giffords and sending the same amount to her Republican rival, Randall Graf.Until October, Lockheed Martin, the giant military contractor, had been following its pattern from recent elections of giving about 70 percent of contributions from its political action committee to Republicans. But Lockheed Martin’s generosity shifted in the first half of October, with Democrats receiving 60 percent of donations, or $127,000.While Republicans and Democrats are feverishly soliciting contributions until Election Day, campaign finance reports filed this week provide a window into the final days of a raucous midterm election campaign. The analysis of 288 corporate political action committees, which have contributed more than $100,000 this election cycle, found that at least 65 committees had increased their ratio of contributions to Democrats by at least 15 percentage points, including Sprint, United Parcel Service and Hewlett-Packard.A notable exception to the flurry of last-minute giving is Wal-Mart.“We had a two-year strategy to build up relationships with Democrats,” said Lee Culpepper, the vice president for federal government relations at Wal-Mart. “This wasn’t something that we decided in August that we needed to do and we ran out helter-skelter to try to do it.”One sign of fresh interest in the prospects of Democratic Congressional races came one morning this week when more than 100 lobbyists crowded into Democratic Party headquarters on Capitol Hill. Over Dunkin’ Donuts and coffee, the executive director of the party’s Congressional committee, Karin Johanson, delivered a private briefing on the race to a sea of unfamiliar faces, despite spending 30 years in politics.“People are excited,” she said later in an interview. “It was, by far, the best attended one ever.”As some young Republican lobbyists fled Washington to spend the final days working on too-close-to-call races in Ohio or Pennsylvania, their senior counterparts stayed behind to begin studying prospective members of the new freshman class. Even if Republicans hold control, the next Congress will almost certainly include at least a handful of moderate Democrats who defeated Republicans and will be looking for allies in the corporate world.Peter Welch, the Democratic candidate for Vermont’s single House seat, has already been telephoning some members of the Washington business lobby, offering an opportunity to begin a good relationship if he wins election. Never mind that his Republican opponent, Martha Rainville, has received a host of endorsements from the business community.“The real story of the 2006 contributions is what happens in the early phase of 2007, with a change in party control,” said Bernadette A. Budde, senior vice president of the Business-Industry Political Action Committee. “There will be proverbial meet-and-greets all over town so we will have a sense of who these people are.”Many of these meet-and-greet sessions will have a dual purpose: political action committees will offer contributions to help candidates wipe away debt their campaigns accrued during the race.Spending in the midterm election campaign is forecast to reach $2.6 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, including $1 billion from political action committees. While many business groups have been eager to appear as if they have been handily contributing to Democratic efforts, it was not until this month that the trend became apparent enough to quantify beyond party leaders or prospective committee chairmen.Democrats who are not in tight races — or even standing for re-election in some cases — have seen their contributions increase more than some of those facing the most competitive contests. That is an easy way, lobbyists say, for political action committees to increase the share of their Democratic contributions, a percentage that is carefully tracked by party leaders when they reach the majority.Representative Adam Smith of Washington, who leads a coalition of centrist Democrats, said he has detected a friendlier relationship with the business community in recent months, a welcome change from years of Republican rule when “Democrats were basically frozen out in every way.”“I hope that the new Democratic majority will take a more open and cooperative approach,” Mr. Smith said in an interview. “I hope there won’t be a sense of, ‘Oh, you gave too much money to Republicans, so we’re not going to talk to you.’ ”'"
"'06-10-28,'0','This 30-second television advertisement for Michael Steele, the Republican candidate for Senate in Maryland, is running in Washington and Maryland. It features his sister, Dr. Monica Turner, a pediatrician. The spot is in response to an advertisement for his Democratic opponent, Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, in which the actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson’s disease, accuses Mr. Steele of wanting to “put limits on the most promising stem cell research.”THE SCRIPT — Mr. Steele says: “I’m Michael Steele, and I approve this message.” Dr. Turner says: “I’m Dr. Monica Turner. Congressman Ben Cardin is attacking Michael Steele with deceptive, tasteless ads. He is using the victim of a terrible disease to frighten people all for his own political gain. Mr. Cardin should be ashamed. There’s something you should know about Michael Steele. He does support stem cell research, and he cares deeply for those who suffer from disease. How do I know? I’m Michael Steele’s little sister. I have M.S., and I know he cares about me.”ON THE SCREEN — The spot opens with images of Mr. Steele, the lieutenant governor, wading through a crowd. It then moves on to his sister, sitting in a brightly lit and austere living room. Dr. Turner, who exhibits no signs of multiple sclerosis, is in a chair, speaking directly into the camera.ACCURACY — Mr. Steele’s campaign says he supports stem cell research that does not require the destruction of embryos. Mr. Fox has recently taken issue with people calling him “a victim,” and has dismissed accusations that he has been used by politicians like Mr. Cardin who have featured him in their advertisements this year.SCORECARD — The Cardin advertisement with Mr. Fox was a powerful repudiation of Mr. Steele, given by one of the nation’s leading advocates for stem cell research. But Mr. Steele’s sister would seem no less effective in this ad defending her brother, in calm but firm terms. These two campaigns should perhaps return to their earlier advertising duel, over puppies. Mr. Steele mockingly implied Mr. Cardin’s ads made the Republican out to be such a monster that he hated puppies, and so Mr. Steele appeared in a commercial with one; Mr. Cardin’s campaign responded with an ad saying Mr. Steele might like puppies, but he liked President Bush more.

"'06-10-28,'0','In a scene that black leaders say has racist overtones, a white actress says she met Mr. Ford, who is black, at a “Playboy party.”Canadian officials objected this week to a separate scene in which an actor says, “Canada can take care of North Korea. They’re not busy.”The aside is a perceived slight to a country that has troops in Afghanistan as part of NATO forces, and on Wednesday, Michael Wilson, Canada’s ambassador to the United States, contacted the White House to complain.A statement from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, distributed by the group WakeUpWal-Mart.com, which is backed by unions, said, “Wal-Mart has the responsibility to dismiss Terry Nelson, with explanation, and apologize to Harold Ford Jr. Even though the Republican Party pulled the ad, if you throw ink on a suit, you leave a stain. They threw ink on Harold Ford Jr., and many people believed it to be true, resulting in a negative impact.”Wal-Mart said in a statement that Mr. Nelson’s Washington consulting firm, Crosslink Strategy Group, “sent a letter to Wal-Mart ending its working relationship with our company.”“We believe this is the right course of action,” Wal-Mart said.A person familiar with the letter said it made clear that the decision to end the relationship was based on requests from Wal-Mart. The person, not authorized to speak publicly, did so on condition of anonymity.Mr. Nelson did not respond to several telephone and e-mail messages.Wal-Mart’s relationship with Mr. Nelson threatened to set back the retailer’s extensive efforts to reach out to African-Americans, who account for a large number of its employees and customers.Over the past year, H. Lee Scott Jr., the chief executive, has met with members of the Congressional Black Caucus and appeared on the Rev. Al Sharpton’s radio show.The commercial has created a public relations problem for Republicans less than two weeks before Election Day.Mr. Nelson has worked for various Republican leaders, including President Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona. As a founder of Crosslink Strategy Group, he also consults for corporations. Mr. Nelson has helped recruit Wal-Mart’s suppliers to join an advocacy group that trumpets its accomplishments and has overseen a program to register Wal-Mart employees to vote in Nov. 7 elections in part as a reaction to Democratic attacks against the company.'"
"'06-10-28,'0','Mr. Abe, a longtime staunch defender of the visits, has now adopted a softer, ambiguous policy. Mr. Abe says he will neither confirm nor deny whether he has prayed at Yasukuni — while letting his aides inform the news media that he has, in fact, visited the shrine.“His position on Yasukuni is a symbol of conceding to China and South Korea’s demands,” said Kim Ho-sup, an expert on Japanese-South Korean relations at Chung-Ang University in Seoul. “He seemed hawkish, but after he became prime minister, he handled relations with Asian neighbors and issues like Yasukuni more diplomatically than Koizumi.”“His visits to China and South Korea were very successful,” Mr. Kim said.Michael J. Green, who handled Asian affairs at the National Security Council until last December and is now at Georgetown University, said Mr. Abe has been “able to recast” Japan’s relations with its neighbors away from Yasukuni.“It was smart domestically because it reassured the center that he was able to deal with neighboring states,” Mr. Green said. “It was smart internationally because it gave Japan leverage to deal with North Korea. It was smart with the United States because, even though the United States government wouldn’t interfere on the history problem, the Japanese government could sense that there was growing unease in Washington about the state of relations between China and Japan.”Mr. Abe built a conservative base by leading efforts in Parliament to revise school textbooks, which the right argues dwell masochistically on Japan’s militarist past, and by casting doubts on the validity of the postwar Tokyo trials that assigned guilt to Japan’s wartime leaders. Starting in 2002, he rose to national stardom by being tough on North Korea and China.But in the last month, Mr. Abe acknowledged that wartime leaders, including his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, had “great responsibility” for the war and its damages in Asia. Mr. Abe said he accepted two landmark statements made by Japanese governments in the 1990s, apologizing to the rest of Asia for Japan’s imperialist past and recognizing the Japanese Army’s role in drafting Asian women as wartime sex slaves, or “comfort women.”Hisahiko Okazaki, a former senior diplomat and a leading conservative commentator close to Mr. Abe, said the prime minister had not forsaken his conservative roots but was merely biding his time.“Regarding policies toward the comfort women issue and other issues like that, he says they were established by previous governments, right?” Mr. Okazaki said. “Since previous governments set those policies, this government can naturally set its own policy. The current government hasn’t done so yet. But I think he’ll do it according to his convictions once he consolidates his power.”Mr. Abe’s softening seems in keeping with a move to tamp down the nationalism of recent years. Last April, former Bush administration officials, including Mr. Green and James A. Kelley, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, said at a conference in Tokyo that Yasukuni was giving Japan a black eye. Then J. Thomas Schieffer, the American ambassador to Japan, described as “very disturbing” the view of history presented at Yasukuni’s museum — that Japan was tricked into war by the United States and occupied Asia to free it.Now, Yasukuni officials said that they planned to change an exhibit that states that President Franklin D. Roosevelt forced Japan into war so that the United States could recover from the Great Depression. Taro Nagae, an adviser to Yasukuni and a retired senior researcher at the Defense Agency’s National Institute for Defense Studies, said that the museum had planned to review all its exhibits this year, but acknowledged the effects of American unease over the museum.“I had been feeling it for a while, and when comments by Armitage and Schieffer started appearing on television and in newspapers, I advised in July that we needed to hurry,” Mr. Nagae said, referring to Richard L. Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state.Asked whether the exhibit change was tied to Mr. Abe’s administration, Mr. Nagae said: “If I said there was no relationship, I would be lying. There were opinions that we should start the work after the start of the Abe administration.”'"
"'06-10-28,'0','Eager to get in on the ground floor and to curry favor with the Chinese government, some of the world’s biggest financial institutions, including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, have paid more than $15 billion over the last three years to acquire minority stakes in China’s biggest lenders.Investors are betting that the banks can thrive in the world’s fastest-growing major economy by taking advantage of China’s huge pool of savings and by improving their efficiency.Many of the investors have reaped spectacular gains, though only on paper because most of them have agreed to hold onto their pre-offering shares for at least three years.Analysts say interest in the Chinese banks has surprised even optimists.“Chinese bank shares are flying off the shelves like hotcakes,” said Jonathan Anderson, the chief Asia economist at UBS. “This is part of the success of China’s privatization program.”Goldman Sachs, which agreed to invest about $3 billion for a 6 percent stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank last December, now has a stake worth about $7.4 billion.The investment banks that underwrote the public offering, including Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse, stand to make as much as $400 million in combined banking fees, yet another indication that China is starting to play a central role in global banking and finance.But some experts say the public listing of three of China’s biggest state-owned banks will probably not be matched for at least a decade or more by another Chinese company.Those three banks have recorded the three biggest initial public stock offerings since 2000, and there are few companies left in China that are as big, as highly sought after or as important to the Chinese government.Still, many analysts remain cautious about the prospects of the big banks, with some arguing that the government has cleaned up the debt but not the management of the banks, which up until a few years ago were best known for corruption, mismanagement and large proportions of nonperforming loans.Some analysts suspect that hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans could still be hiding in the system and that a slight economic downturn could prove disastrous for the banks and the banking system.But for now, investors in China’s biggest banks look smart. Investors like UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Goldman Sachs, American Express and the Kuwaiti government have made huge returns on their investments by getting cheap pre-offering stakes.Bank of America, which spent about $3 billion in June 2005 for a 9 percent stake in China Construction Bank, now owns shares valued at about $9 billion.Shares of five of the Chinese banks that have gone public in the last two years have performed well in Hong Kong, led by the Bank of Communications, whose shares have soared 132 percent since listing in June 2005.Industrial and Commercial Bank is the biggest bank of them all, with 355,000 employees and about $800 billion in assets.On the first trading day, the stock jumped 15 percent to close in Hong Kong and Shanghai at the equivalent of 45 American cents, valuing the bank at about $150 billion.When Industrial and Commercial Bank of China made its initial offering this month by agreeing to sell about 16 percent to the public, people formed long lines in Hong Kong and Shanghai, and the bank received more than $300 billion in orders.'"
"'06-10-28,'0','The World Health Organization’s new plan for ramping up the production of flu vaccine is a measure of how unprepared the world is to cope with an onslaught of pandemic influenza. The plan, conceived by a group of more than 120 experts, lays out a sensible path toward vaccine sufficiency— but it will take years to complete and cost up to $10 billion.There are no signs yet that the influenza strain causing the greatest concern — a virulent form of avian flu — is ready to sweep through human populations. So far it has infected only 256 people in 10 countries — mostly people in close contact with chickens in Asia — but the highly lethal pathogen has killed some 60 percent of those.Fortunately, it has not yet developed the ability to spread easily from one person to another, the critical transition for unleashing a pandemic. But if this strain or another does, it will move so rapidly there will be little chance of containing it — unless we start preparing now.This week, the W.H.O. warned that if a flu pandemic were to occur, the global vaccine supply would fall several billion doses short. It recommended three overlapping responses: increasing the use of vaccines in the normal flu season so that manufacturers are encouraged to expand capacity; new techniques to raise production yields; and development of more potent vaccines that could provide broad and long-lasting immunity.The price tag would be $3 billion to $10 billion for a global effort that might yield results in three to five years, provided action started now. The Bush administration’s pledge of $10 million to W.H.O. to help other countries develop vaccines and manufacturing capacity is prompt but woefully short.The administration has also invested substantially in vaccine research, including $1 billion to develop new cell-based technologies that would allow rapid expansion of production in an emergency. Although those investments are primarily for our own benefit, the knowledge generated is likely to help others around the world.'"
"'06-10-28,'0','WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (AP) — A federal judge on Friday threw out a lawsuit against the Air Force that contended that evangelical Christian values were being illegally pushed on academy cadets.An academy graduate said he would appeal the decision by the judge, James A. Parker of Federal District Court in Albuquerque. “Our fight is far from over,” said the graduate, Mikey Weinstein of Albuquerque.The case was brought by Mr. Weinstein and other Air Force Academy graduates who contended that a military chaplain had violated their right to religious freedom by urging cadets to attend Christian services or face “the fires of hell.” That incident, the group asserted, reflected a broader policy of efforts to evangelize members of the Air Force.But Judge Parker said the graduates could not claim that their First Amendment rights were violated, because they no longer attended the academy. Moreover, he said, the group failed to give specific examples of which cadets had been harmed, or when.Last year, an Air Force committee concluded that there was no overt religious bias at the academy.'"
"'06-10-28,'0','Mr. Buretta said the maximum was $250,000, and the judge levied it.Mr. Amato, who is known as Baldo and who immigrated to New York from the Sicilian fishing village of Castellammare del Golfo when he was 18, was convicted on July 12 of racketeering conspiracy charges, including the murders of two Bonanno associates.The jury concluded that he ordered the murder of restaurant owner Sebastiano DiFalco and carried out a second killing himself, shooting Robert Perrino in the head several times.Prosecutors had presented evidence that the Bonanno family was concerned that Mr. Perrino, a delivery supervisor for The New York Post, might help expose an infiltration of The Post’s delivery operation by the crime family.The judge said that Mr. DiFalco was killed “possibly because Mr. Amato and his Mafia colleagues wanted to take over the business and they might have had a disagreement over price or some other detail.”The six-week trial was a primer on the devastation that federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have wrought on the Bonannos, cutting a swath through the family’s ranks and upending its traditions with a growing cadre of informers.Mr. Amato was also stoical when Judge Garaufis rejected a request by his lawyer, Diarmuid White, for a recommendation that he be sent to a prison in the New York area so his family could visit. “It’s for them, your honor,” Mr. White said of the family.“I have compassion for the defendant’s family, and I also have compassion for the members of the families of Sebastiano DiFalco and Robert Perrino,” the judge said. “This defendant made it certain that they would never visit their family member, anywhere.”Mr. DiFalco’s two nephews were in court yesterday and said they were gratified by the life sentence and the fine against Mr. Amato. “He’s a cold and evil person,” said one of them, Sal Montoro, 42. He said Mr. Amato had gone to their uncle’s wake and vowed to help find the killer.For Mr. Amato, after the sentence was handed down, it was a brisk, businesslike handshake and a small smile for his lawyer, and he walked out the courtroom’s side door to the holding cells, accompanied by United States marshals.'"
"'06-10-28,'0','Jeb Corliss, a stuntman who tried to jump off the Empire State Building last April, had a right to risk his own life, his lawyer told a Manhattan judge yesterday.Mr. Corliss, 30, would face up to seven years in jail if convicted of recklessly endangering passers-by, but his lawyer asked the judge to dismiss the charge.The lawyer, Mark Jay Heller, argued that what his client did was analogous to the case of a New York judge who tried to commit suicide by lying in front of his oven with the gas running. The judge’s conviction for showing depraved indifference to the lives of his neighbors was reduced to a lesser charge in July. The state’s highest court ruled that he acted out of depression, not moral deficiency.Mr. Heller said that his client, Mr. Corliss, had made more than 1,000 jumps around the world, without hurting anyone. Besides, the lawyer said, there is no law against jumping off a building in New York State.“This is completely absurd that people are coming down on me this way, because my life is mine,” Mr. Corliss said after the hearing in State Supreme Court. He looked like a cartoon superhero, at 6 feet 3 inches tall, in silver sunglasses and a long black leather coat.Justice Michael R. Ambrecht said he would consider Mr. Heller’s argument and rule in December.On April 27, Mr. Corliss — dressed in a fat suit to hide his parachute — made it to the observation deck around 3:40 p.m. When he started climbing the fence, police and security officers handcuffed him to a rail before he could jump.Mr. Heller contended that it was the officers who had shown depraved indifference to his client’s life by handcuffing him.'"
"'06-10-28,'0','The Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was packed on Thursday night, including extra rows of stage seats, for a recital by the Croatian pianist Ivo Pogorelich, his first appearance in New York in 10 years. When he emerged in the 1980’s, Mr. Pogorelich galvanized the concert world with his technically astounding, deeply personal and unabashedly eccentric playing. But in the last decade he has been an elusive and unpredictable figure.How is he faring? His incoherent and interpretively perverse playing defies description. The first minutes of the opening work, Beethoven’s Sonata in No. 32 in C minor, were weirdly fascinating. Before long the performance was just plain weird. And so the evening continued.These days Mr. Pogorelich, 48, presents himself with the trappings of a cult figure. The hall was nearly dark, except for a single spotlight on the pianist. Those who remember him as a lanky, broodingly handsome young man might have been startled by his current appearance — stocky build, shaved head, glowering glances to an audience he barely acknowledged.He played using the printed scores with the assistance of a page-turner, an option I support in principle. Yet here his reliance on the scores seemed a compensation for insufficient preparation. How else to explain the many rough passages and overall aimlessness?In Beethoven’s visionary final sonata, which begins in stormy complexity and ends in mystical bliss, Mr. Pogorelich’s timings were stretched to the point where the music lost forward motion and structural coherence. That a musical passage should have some semblance of a pulse is something that Mr. Pogorelich seems to think only lesser pianists who lack his brave originality concern themselves with. Consider this: the recordings of this work by Artur Schnabel, Richard Goode and Rudolf Serkin each clock in at about 26 minutes. Mr. Pogorelich’s performance lasted 41 minutes.After this performance, which elicited some lusty boos along with bravos, Mr. Pogorelich’s playing of Beethoven’s Sonata No. 24 was, if anything, stranger. Who could tell slow from fast in this passive-aggressive performance where each phrase, sometimes each measure, inhabited its own world?'"

That would be uncouth!Since asking for the price would be even more uncouth, this number remains a mystery until the check comes and you discover that the specials cost far more than the menu items, often easily exceeding the $40 barrier.It becomes clear why this stealth process is used instead of providing a printed addendum (with the prices) to the regular menu.'"
"'06-10-28,'0','It now takes more than a year of work for the average American to earn enough income to pay for a year at a private college, where costs have risen more rapidly than inflation for 26 consecutive years.But by one measure, American colleges cost less than they used to. Those who plan on paying for their children’s education by selling part of their stock portfolios now need to sell less than half as many shares as their parents would have had to sell a quarter-century ago.The College Board, a research organization, released its latest study of average college costs this week. For the current school year, the average for a private four-year college was $30,367, while the average cost for a public college in the United States is $12,796. Both figures were up almost 6 percent from the previous year and outstripped gains in the overall rate of inflation.Those figures include tuition, room and board, but exclude the cost of books, which has been rising rapidly. And they are averages that significantly understate the cost of top universities, where total costs are over $40,000 per academic year.The accompanying charts show the annual costs for the last 30 years in three ways. First, the figures show the costs for public and private colleges in 2006 dollars, thereby adjusting for inflation.'"

"'06-10-29,'0','The couple had married, they said, three months ago. The precise dates of the wedding and honeymoon, and whether the soldier had been on active duty at the time, were not clear.The people also described in vivid detail how members of the Mahdi Army militia, led by a local commander known as Abu Rami, came to the wife’s home in the central Baghdad neighborhood of Karada last Monday, the first day of the Muslim holiday Id al-Fitr, and dragged Mr. Taei away.“They were saying, ‘He’s an American journalist,’ ” said a woman who identified herself as his mother-in-law and asked that she be identified only by her nickname, Um Omar, because of fear of reprisals. “We were saying, ‘No, he’s an Iraqi,’ ”Um Omar and the others in the home said they had not learned until after his kidnapping that he was an American soldier.Military officials would not comment when asked on Sunday about these new details, and it was impossible to corroborate independently the account given by Mr. Taei’s purported in-laws.The military’s fraternization policies prohibit active duty personnel from marrying local civilians, said Lt. Col. Josslyn Aberle, a military spokeswoman. But she said privacy rules barred her from providing any details about the missing soldier.In 2003, a pair of Florida national guardsmen famously married Iraqi doctors they met in Baghdad soon after the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime in a joint ceremony. One of the soldiers’ marriages dissolved soon afterward, but the one whose marriage lasted was confined to his base and eventually discharged from the military.The people who claimed to be the missing soldier’s in-laws said he and his immediate family, Sunni Arabs from the capital’s Adhamiya neighborhood, had fled to the United States before the fall of Mr. Hussein. They explained how he came to marry Ms. Abdul-Satar, also a Sunni.Mr. Taei had friends in Karada, a mostly well-to-do commercial district that sits outside the Green Zone, Um Omar said. As she described it, he spotted her daughter one day as she was en route to classes at Mutsamsirya University in central Baghdad, where she is enrolled in the science college.Through friends, he arranged to speak with her parents, Um Omar said, and after some discussion, Ms. Abdul-Satar agreed to marry Mr. Taei, whom her mother described as a “gentleman.”After the couple married, Um Omar said, Ms. Abdul-Satar moved out of her mother’s cramped apartment on the third floor of a dreary complex on a side street in Karada near the National Theater, to a cousin’s one-story home down the block.Mr. Taei came to visit every few days, said a neighbor who lives across the street from the cousin’s home, where the kidnapping took place.“We thought he was a businessman,” said the neighbor, who asked to be identified only by his last name, Nadhir.Last Monday, Mr. Taei came about 4 p.m. local time on a motorcycle. Soon after, a car full of gunman came and demanded that Mr. Taei go with them, Mr. Nadhir said. He said he witnessed the entire episode from across the street but was helpless to stop it.Abu Rami, the purported lead kidnapper, had been living in the abandoned Ministry of Defense building just up the street that is now inhabited by squatters, residents said. Members of the Mahdi Army, which answers to the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, are known to patrol that building as well as a squalid former Air Force base across the street that has also become a large homeless encampment.Just a few days before the kidnapping, Abu Rami and his men had beaten several teenage boys in the neighborhood with cables for wearing shorts, residents said.But when the gunmen tried to drag Mr. Taei into their car at gunpoint, he and members of Ms. Abdul-Satar’s family resisted. Three additional cars full of gunmen soon arrived to help.One of Um Omar’s nephews came running to her apartment to tell her what was happening, she said. She rushed over with other family members.“I saw one of the kidnappers putting a gun to his head,” she said.The women in the house were screaming and crying, begging and arguing with the gunmen to stop, said Ahmed Abdul-Satar, one of Ms. Abdul-Satar’s brothers, who said he tried to send them inside while the men sorted out the matter. His sister, in hysterics, fainted, he said.Eventually, the gunmen wrestled Mr. Taei into the car, but another of Ms. Abdul-Satar’s brothers, Omar, who knew Abu Rami from the neighborhood insisted on coming with them, other relatives said.They were on their way to the vast Shiite slum of Sadr City, the stronghold of the Mahdi Army, relatives said, when Abu Rami ordered Mr. Abdul-Satar out of the car and left him at the side of the road. If he did not get out, he was told, they would kidnap him as well.Ms. Abdul-Satar and her brother are now staying in the Green Zone for their safety and to answer additional questions from the military, their mother said. She has heard from her daughter a few times, but there has been no news.American troops, along with their Iraqi counterparts, have cordoned off much of eastern Baghdad, including Sadr City, in their search for the missing soldier.On Sunday, thousands of residents, along with politicians from Mr. Sadr’s political bloc, gathered in Sadr City to protest peacefully the security cordon around the neighborhood.The most serious of the attacks elsewhere across Iraq on Sunday was an ambush of a police academy minibus in the southern city of Basra. Fifteen officers and two translators were killed, said Gen. Abdul Khidir al-Taher of the Iraqi police. In addition, the police found at least 31 bodies across the capital on Sunday, many of them shot at close range and bearing signs of torture, an Interior Ministry official said.For Um Omar, the last week has been filled with waiting and worrying. If she had known that Mr. Taei had been in the United States Army, she said, she would have forbidden him from visiting.“I’m praying,” she said. “I’m calling on Allah for his safety.””'"
"'06-10-29,'0','Mr. Lieberman, who has kept up a brisk fund-raising schedule since losing the primary in August, has been able to deftly use his experience and career ties all over the county at a time that he needs it most to battle for his seat in the Senate. At the same time Mr. Lamont, who hoped for considerable financial support from major Democratic donors, has struggled somewhat to match Mr. Lieberman’s resources.In August, Mr. Lamont’s advisers said they expected to spend roughly $6 million in the general election, but that number was quickly eclipsed. Mr. Lieberman raised that amount in just more than a month, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. He has raised a total of $14.8 million, another record for a campaign in this state.Advisers to Mr. Lamont say they made a decision not to focus on fund-raising efforts, using the events more as political rallies.Last week, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton played host to a fund-raiser for Mr. Lamont at a home on the Upper East Side. Earlier this year, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV played host to an event on Mr. Lamont’s behalf.The campaign has also worked with Mr. Lamont’s longtime friends in Greenwich to organize a “Republicans for Lamont” fund-raiser.As of the end of September, roughly 70 percent of Mr. Lamont’s money has come from his own pocket.Filings show there are far more Republican donors rallying to the side of Mr. Lieberman, who has crisscrossed the country and raised about $5 million since losing the primary, campaign finance records show.Prominent Republican donors listed in Mr. Lieberman’s campaign filings are Joseph Allbaugh, one of President Bush’s close advisers during the 2000 campaign, and Don Nickles, the former assistant leader in the Senate. Several outside groups, known as 527s, have also rallied to Mr. Lieberman’s side.The Connecticut Issues Project, which is sending out mailings praising Mr. Lieberman for his work on the submarine base in Connecticut, is being financed largely by out-of-state donors who typically give to Republicans. The Free Enterprise Fund, which is running ads against Democrats in several other states, has also run television ads criticizing Mr. Lamont’s business.Each campaign has tried to use the source of financing as a line of attack, with the Lieberman campaign accusing Mr. Lamont of trying to buy the election, while the Lamont campaign has said Mr. Lieberman’s support from prominent Republicans is a sign that he is too chummy with the White House.The latest sparks came early this week, when the Lamont campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission about nearly $380,000 the Lieberman campaign listed as “petty cash” to pay for volunteers in the final two weeks of the primary. Tammy Sun, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lieberman, said the money was used to pay for young workers used in the field operation in the last days of the campaign.By law, a campaign must keep a journal of petty cash payments of less than $100, but it is not required to make the contents of the journal public. Ms. Sun declined to allow reporters to examine the journal, saying there is no evidence of wrongdoing.Several campaign finance experts said that while the expenditure was an unusually large sum of money to be listed as petty cash, it would be legal as long as each of the payments was less than $100.'"
"'06-10-29,'0','The proposals will begin to be laid out in public shortly after Election Day, members of the groups said in recent interviews. One of the committees was formed by the United States Chamber of Commerce and until recently was headed by Robert K. Steel.Mr. Steel was sworn in last Friday as the new Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, and he is the senior official in the department who will be formulating the Treasury’s views on the issues being studied by the two groups.The second committee was formed by the Harvard Law professor Hal S. Scott, along with R. Glenn Hubbard, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Bush, and John L. Thornton, a former president of Goldman Sachs, where he worked with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.That group has colloquially become known around Washington as the Paulson Committee because the relatively new Treasury secretary issued an encouraging statement when it was formed last month. But administration officials said Friday that he was not playing a role in the group’s deliberations.Its members include Donald L. Evans, a former commerce secretary who remains a close friend of President Bush; Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr., chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting giant; Robert R. Glauber, former chairman and chief executive of the National Association of Securities Dealers, the private group that oversees the securities industry; and the chief executives of DuPont, Office Depot and the CIT Group.Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman at the Treasury Department, said on Friday that no decision had been made about which recommendations would be supported by the administration.“While the department always wants to hear new ideas from academic and industry thought leaders, especially to encourage the strength of the U.S. capital markets, Treasury is not a member of these committees and is not collaborating on any findings,” Ms. Zuccarelli said.But another official and committee members noted that Mr. Paulson had recently pressed the groups in private discussions to complete their work so it could be rolled out quickly after the November elections.Moreover, committee members say that they expect many of their recommendations will be used as part of an overall administration effort to limit what they see as overzealous state prosecutions by such figures as the New York State attorney general Elliot Spitzer and abusive class action lawsuits by investors. The groups will also attempt to lower what they see as the excessive costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.Their critics, however, see the effort as part of a plan to cater to the most well-heeled constituents of the administration and insulate politically connected companies from prosecution at the expense of investors.One consideration in drafting the proposals has been the chain of events at Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that was convicted in 2002 of obstruction of justice for shredding Enron-related documents; the conviction was overturned in 2005 by the Supreme Court. The proposals being drafted would aim to limit the liability of auditing firms and include a policy shift to make it harder for prosecutors to bring cases against individuals and companies.Even though Arthur Andersen played a prominent role in various corporate scandals, some business and legal experts have criticized the decision by the Bush administration to bring a criminal case that had the effect of shutting the firm down.The proposed policies would emphasize the prosecution of culpable individuals rather than corporations and auditing firms. That shift could prove difficult for prosecutors because it is often harder to find sufficient evidence to show that specific people at a company were the ones who knowingly violated a law.One proposal would recommend that the Justice Department sharply curtail its policy of forcing companies under investigation to withhold paying the legal fees of executives suspected of violating the law. Another one would require some investor lawsuits to be handled by arbitration panels, which are traditionally friendlier to defendants.In an interview last week with Bloomberg News, Mr. Paulson repeated his criticism of the Sarbanes-Oxley law. While it had done some good, he said, it had contributed to “an atmosphere that has made it more burdensome for companies to operate.”Mr. Paulson also repeated a line from his first speech, given at Columbia Business School last August, where he said, “Often the pendulum swings too far and we need to go through a period of readjustment.”Some experts see Mr. Paulson’s complaint as a step backward.“This is an escalation of the culture war against regulation,” said James D. Cox, a securities and corporate law professor at Duke Law School. He said many of the proposals, if adopted, “would be a dark day for investors.”Professor Cox, who has studied 600 class action lawsuits over the last decade, said it was difficult to find “abusive or malicious” cases, particularly in light of new laws and court decisions that had made it more difficult to file such suits.The number of securities class action lawsuits has dropped substantially in each of the last two years, he noted, arguing that the impact of the proposals from the business groups would be that “very few people would be prosecuted.”People involved in the committees said that the timing of the proposals was being dictated by the political calendar: closely following Election Day and as far away as possible from the 2008 elections.Mr. Hubbard, who is now dean of Columbia Business School, said the committee he helps lead would focus on the lack of proper economic foundation for a number of regulations. Most changes will be proposed through regulation, he said, because “the current political environment is simply not ripe for legislation.”But the politics of changing the rules do not break cleanly along party lines. While some prominent Democrats would surely attack the pro-business efforts, there are others who in the past have been sympathetic.People involved in the committees’ work said that their objective was to improve the attractiveness of American capital-raising markets by scaling back rules whose costs outweigh their benefits.“We think the legal liability issues are the most serious ones,” said Professor Scott, the director of the committee singled out by Mr. Paulson. “Companies don’t want to use our markets because of what they see as the substantial, and in their view excessive, liability.”Committee officials disputed the notion that they were simply catering to powerful business interests seeking to benefit from loosening regulations that could wind up hurting investors.“It’s unfortunate to the extent that this has been politicized,” said Robert E. Litan, a former Justice Department official and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who is overseeing the committee’s legal liability subgroup. “The objectives are clearly not to gut such reforms as Sarbanes-Oxley. I’m for cost-effective regulation.”The main Sarbanes-Oxley provision that both committees are focusing on is a part that is commonly called Section 404, which requires audits of companies’ internal financial controls. Some business experts praise this section as having made companies more transparent and better managed, but many smaller companies call the section too costly and unnecessary.Members of the two committees said that they had reached a consensus that Section 404, along with greater threat of investor lawsuits and government prosecutions, had discouraged foreign companies from issuing new stock on exchanges in the United States in recent months.The committee members said that an increase in stock offerings abroad was evidence that the American liability system and tougher auditing standards were taking a toll on the competitiveness of American markets. But others see different reasons for the trend and few links to liability and accounting rules.Bill Daley, a former commerce secretary in the Clinton administration who is the co-chairman of the Chamber of Commerce group, expects proposed changes to liability standards for accounting firms and corporations to draw the most flak. But he said that the changes affecting accounting firms are of paramount importance to prevent the further decline in competition. Only four major firms were left after Andersen’s collapse.Another contentious issue concerns a proposal to eliminate the use of a broadly written and long-established anti-fraud rule, known as Rule 10b-5, that allows shareholders to sue companies for fraud. The change could be accomplished by a vote of the S.E.C.John C. Coffee, a professor of securities law at Columbia Law School and an adviser to the Paulson Committee, said that he had recommended that the S.E.C. adopt the exception to Rule 10b-5 so that only the commission could bring such lawsuits against corporations.But other securities law experts warned that such a move would extinguish a fundamental check on corporate malfeasance.“It would be a shocking turning back to say only the commission can bring fraud cases,” said Harvey J. Goldschmid, a former S.E.C. commissioner and law professor at Columbia University. “Private enforcement is a necessary supplement to the work that the S.E.C. does. It is also a safety valve against the potential capture of the agency by industry.”'"
"'06-10-29,'0','Mr. Snow said that Mr. Maliki made “no demands, and it was a very cordial discussion.” But the prime minister, he said, made clear that he wanted to move quickly toward “an Iraqi assumption of command and control” over forces operating in Baghdad and elsewhere.A Maliki spokesman, Ali Dabbagh, said the prime minister had said the Iraqi government wanted more control over its army, which operates under Americans.The meeting, the second in 12 days for Mr. Bush and Mr. Maliki, was clearly part of a White House effort to diffuse tensions between the two governments.The push for more Iraqi control comes just as American military commanders are saying the Iraqi Army needs more time to improve. America’s top military commander in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., said this week that it would be another 12 to 18 months before Iraqi troops would be ready to take over.A central irritant for the Shiite leaders is what they say is an American preoccupation with Shiite militias — often linked to political parties — that have been responsible for much of the bloodshed here in the past year. Shiites fault American officials, particularly Mr. Khalilzad, for treating militias as enemies on a par with the Sunni insurgency.“The forces need to know one clear fact,” said one prominent Shiite politician. “Who is the real enemy here? It is the Saddamists and the takfiris.” Takfiris are Sunni extremists.That preoccupation has distracted American military policy, Shiite leaders say, and led to gaps in protection of Shiite areas vulnerable to attacks by Sunni militants, a position that American military commanders strongly dispute. Leaders argue that the Iraqis should be allowed to protect these areas themselves, an assertion that raises a distant but real American fear — that the government could use the largely Shiite army selectively, or that it could even become one side of a civil war.Mr. Maliki leads a government that is a fragile coalition between Sunnis, Kurds and other groups, but with the arguments made in recent days, appears to be placing himself firmly inside the Shiite camp, lending an increasingly sectarian tinge to the Iraqi political landscape.One major lever the Iraqis have is the United Nations agreement that extends legal authority for foreign troops to be here. Senior officials are trying to amend the agreement, which expires on Dec. 31, in order to give the government more control over parts of the army sooner, a process American officials are watching worriedly.“I am now prime minister and overall commander of the armed forces, yet I cannot move a single company without coalition approval because of the U.N. mandate,” Mr. Maliki told Reuters on Thursday. “If anyone is responsible for the poor security situation in Iraq, it is the coalition.”In Washington, the administration has sought to smooth relations, particularly as midterm elections near.Part of the Shiites’ anger seems to center on Mr. Khalilzad. A Sunni Muslim born in Afghanistan, Mr. Khalilzad has been most closely associated with his intense efforts to bring minority Sunni Arabs into Iraqi politics. Shiite leaders say he has worked so hard to involve Sunnis that he has abandoned the Shiites.In the Reuters interview, Mr. Maliki said that he was unhappy with Mr. Khalilzad’s presentation of a timetable for Iraqi reform that the Bush administration has pressed. He said that the goals had been laid out at an internal meeting two months before, and that they had been produced by Iraqis, not American officials.The meeting on Saturday, whose participants included Stephen J. Hadley, Mr. Bush’s national security adviser, was also notable for what was not discussed. Mr. Bush did not raise the White House frustrations with the comparatively small number of Iraqi troops dedicated to the latest effort to secure Baghdad. Nor was there discussion, Mr. Snow said, of seeking to further incorporate the militia of the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr into the army.In recent days, other officials have stressed that Mr. Bush is doing all he can to bolster Mr. Maliki, whose early months as prime minister were widely described in Washington as a disappointment. But several officials have noted recently that Mr. Bush has promised to support Mr. Maliki only as long as he makes what Mr. Bush calls “hard decisions.”“No one has said what happens if he stops making those decisions,” one senior official said early this week. “I don’t think anyone knows.”Mr. Maliki took issue even with aspects of the enterprise that Americans have gone to great lengths to make work. On Friday, with Mr. Khalilzad and in the Reuters interview, Mr. Maliki noted that the police and the army were poorly equipped, and that if Iraqis were in charge of building them, they would be fully ready in 6 months, not 12 to 18.“The police are sharing rifles,” Mr. Maliki told Reuters. “This is the responsibility of the coalition because they created them.”“Maybe they thought that the country would not slip into this situation,” he said. “Well, now that we are here we need them to build the army quickly.”The White House, in a statement, said the leaders had agreed on the goals of accelerating the pace of training the Iraqi Security Force, Iraqi assumption of command and control over its forces, and transferring responsibility for security to the government of Iraq. A working group was set up to achieve them.The military on Saturday announced the death of another American soldier from “enemy action” on Friday in Anbar Province in western Iraq. It has also said a soldier was killed in Diyala Province on Thursday. The deaths bring the toll for American troops this month to 98, the highest for one month in more than a year.Also on Saturday, 11 Iraqi soldiers were kidnapped at a fake checkpoint in the heavily Sunni village of Adhaim, north of Baghdad. South of Baghdad in the town of Iskandariya, five Iraqis were killed and 11 wounded in a car bombing.'"
"'06-10-29,'0','“This is my family heritage,” said Mr. Hill, sitting in a cluttered office that he said previously was a men’s room about 100 yards from the base of the statue. “This is home.”Indeed, the Hills have been on the island since the 1920s. Mr. Hill’s father was born in the family home, which stood practically next door to the statue before being torn down.They have weathered wartimes, a two-year refurbishment in the mid-1980s and the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, when the statue was closed for three months. Since then, new security measures have reduced the flow of visitors, whose numbers are nearly a third below their 2000 peak.Still, their business — Evelyn Hill Inc., named for Mr. Hill’s grandmother — on Liberty Island ranks among the 10 biggest commercial operations in the entire national park system, according to the park service. And neither Mr. Hill, 50, nor his father, James I. Hill, is ready to part with it.Mr. Hill, 80, who is known as Jim, spent the first eight years of his life on the 12.7-acre island. Back then, it was still known as Bedloe’s Island and the statue shared the land with Fort Wood, a United States Army post for military police.Some of the residents of the barracks on Bedloe’s Island commuted across the harbor to work on Governors Island. If they needed medical care, they rode boats to Brooklyn, Jim Hill recalled in a recent interview near his home on the Upper East Side.But, as Jim Hill tells the story, he was born on a December day in 1925 when there was too much ice in the harbor for a boat to take his mother to a hospital. So, he was delivered at home by an Army doctor and is a member of the very small club of natives of Liberty Island. As an adult, he commuted to the island for 46 years until he retired in 1992.He remembers sneaking into the statue as a child, only to be chased off by a guard. “The statue was off limits,” he said.Once, he recalled, he and some young buddies tossed a baseball out of the crown to see how high it would bounce. The children traveled by boat to a three-room public school on Governors Island, he said.“We thought everybody lived on an island,” Jim Hill said.Of course, their island also happened to hold a beacon of freedom known around the globe. Since the early years of Jim Hill’s life, when tourists wanted a snack or a memento of their visit, a member of his family has been there to satisfy the craving, starting with his father, Aaron.Aaron Hill, who had been based on the island as a soldier, bought the snack stand from a military officer who had run it. That was in 1931, and it was merely a table with an umbrella set up on the pier where the ferry docked.He later moved the snack counter indoors; a copy of a five-item menu from those days shows that customers could pay a nickel for coffee or a cigar and a dime for tomato juice, a hamburger or a “frank on a roll.”Aaron Hill and his family continued living on the island until the park service arrived in 1933 and started displacing the residents, Jim Hill said. The Hills moved to the Bronx; from there, Aaron Hill rode the subway to Lower Manhattan and a ferry to his shop. He died in 1943.His widow, Evelyn, who had been working behind the sales counter on weekends, took over, with some help from their children. Business was slow during World War II, Jim Hill recalled, because with the government rationing resources, “it was extremely difficult to get any kind of souvenir item made of metals.”After the war, Jim Hill joined his mother full time, he said. Evelyn Hill gradually yielded the reins to him but kept pitching in well into her eighties. She died in 1990 at the age of 88.Jim Hill’s son Brad worked at the statue on weekends as a boy, then for department store chains for a few years before returning to the fold. Now he makes the long trek, by car and boat, from his home in northern New Jersey.“I’ve always loved this place,” Mr. Hill said.To keep up with modern times, he has upgraded the food service to include offerings like fresh tuna salads, and sets up an outdoor grill in the summer.To conserve resources and reduce costs, he has set up an elaborate trash-recycling system and installed waterless urinals in the bathrooms. In one of his two gift shops, he recently unveiled an animatronic likeness of Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi, the Frenchman who created the statue.These improvements were aimed at enticing tourists to spend more time on the island because the number of visitors has dropped to 2.5 million from a high of 3.6 million since new security measures were carried out, Mr. Hill said.He obviously hopes the new food and services will count in his favor next year when the park service weighs bids under a new selection process.Before 1998, incumbents like the Hills received preferential treatment and were nearly impossible to unseat. But now much of that advantage is gone, and big food-service companies are aggressively bidding for national park contracts, according to industry executives and consultants.Just as chain stores have gradually displaced mom-and-pop shops in American cities and towns, national corporations have made steady inroads into the national parks. Three of them — Aramark, Xanterra and Delaware North — dominate the list of the park service’s biggest commercial operations.A spokesman for Aramark declined to discuss the Statue of Liberty contract.But Kevin Kelly, the president of Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts in Buffalo, said he and a team of fellow executives recently toured Liberty Island in anticipation of making a bid. Mr. Kelly praised much of Mr. Hill’s operation but criticized the overall experience of visiting the statue, starting with the security screening required before boarding a ferry in Battery Park.“They stripped me down and really searched me,” Mr. Kelly said. “It wasn’t a really warm and welcoming experience.” He added that the park service needed to make visiting the statue more compelling to a modern audience.“The longer people stay,” he said, “the more hot dogs they’ll buy, the more sodas they’ll buy, the more pictures they’ll take.”Despite the size and financial strength of companies like Delaware North and Aramark, Mr. Kelly thinks it is not improbable that visitors will be buying their hot dogs from the Hills for years to come. After all, he said, “They know the business better than anyone.”'"
"'06-10-29,'0','To hear the National Hurricane Center tell it, the 2006 hurricane season, which ends Tuesday, was average. Nine Atlantic storms were robust enough to be named, near the average of 11, said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist at the center in Miami. Five of them became hurricanes, he said, one fewer than the typical number, and as in an ordinary year, two of those were major storms.But no hurricanes struck the United States. Among the named storms, Alberto hit the Florida Panhandle in June, Beryl skimmed Nantucket in July and Ernesto made a feeble swipe at south Florida in August, Mr. Feltgen said, but all were classified as tropical storms, with winds below hurricane strength of 74 miles an hour.After the devastation of 2004 and 2005, the 2006 season has come as a relief.“It’s been wonderful,” said Stephen P. Leatherman, who directs the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University in Miami. “We needed a break.”He and other hurricane researchers attribute the lull in storm activity in large part to two weather patterns.One was the Bermuda High, a zone of high atmospheric pressure that sat this summer unusually far out in the Atlantic, steering storms north, away from the United States. The other was wind shear produced when high-level winds from the Pacific encounter storms moving across the Atlantic toward the United States. This wind shear can interfere with hurricane formation. “There was a fair bit of wind shear over the Atlantic,” said Kerry Emanuel, a climate expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The researchers said it would be unwise to draw any conclusions about long-term patterns from this year’s non-events. “We are still on a high cycle” of hurricane activity, Dr. Leatherman said.'"
"'06-10-29,'0','A weak report on economic growth set back the stock market on Friday, but thanks to a rally earlier in the week, the market ended up with a five-day gain.The Commerce Department said on Friday that the economy grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter — the lowest quarterly rate in more than three years. While slowing economic growth might help reduce inflationary pressures, it could make it difficult for many corporations to meet their profit targets, so the report put a bit of a chill into the stock market.Until Friday, though, the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high each day of the week.Caterpillar, which was the worst weekly performer in the Dow for the week ended Oct. 20, was at the top of the stock performance chart last week, with a gain of 3.9 percent.For the week, the Dow gained 87.89 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 12,090.26. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed 8.74 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,377.34. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.32 points, or 0.4, percent, to close at 2,350.62.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 4.67 percent from 4.79 percent the previous week.'"
"'06-10-29,'0','Waking society up to the long-term risks of flu pandemics means upgrading how vaccines are made using the latest technology, improving hospital surge capacity and potential responsiveness to any catastrophe, not just flu, and developing ways to preserve supply lines of staple products like food, energy and medications, which often come from overseas.In the event of a mild flu pandemic, premature closings of schools and businesses may spread panic, whereas careful isolation of sick patients and their contacts can slow the spread.Paper surgical masks have never been well studied against flu during pandemic conditions. N95 respirator masks, mentioned by Mr. Wein, are useful in the intensive-care setting to prevent spread of respiratory viruses, but this is a far cry from advocating their use in the general population, where they are not likely to be worn or used properly.Paper surgical masks are much more likely to spread fear and alienate people from one another than to contain an emerging virus. This is the macabre scene we witnessed from afar with SARS.Marc Siegel, M.D.New York, Oct. 26, 2006The writer, an internist and associate professor of medicine at N.Y.U. School of Medicine, is the author of a book about bird flu.Though Lawrence M. Wein makes a persuasive argument that more active stockpiling of protective face masks could improve pandemic influenza preparedness in the United States, he doesn’t include the bigger picture.Around the world, some 2.7 billion people, many of them children, struggle to survive on less than $2 a day. Because the majority of the world’s population has few connections to modern public health systems, our ability to detect emerging infectious diseases early is seriously compromised.Expect to see the first indications of pandemic influenza in rural China or areas of heavy conflict and dislocation in central or southern Africa, not Utica, N.Y., or Sacramento.Investing in masks for Americans should not be our first priority. Preparing for an outbreak in the developing world, including stronger disease surveillance and response capabilities, is a far better next step to strengthen American health security.Asian countries with large populations, like Japan, have long had easy access to masks at the drugstore to wear when having caught cold, or wishing to avoid colds and flu.Imagine riding a train or a subway in Tokyo at rush hour to know why.Masks are just as visible on women in Issey Miyake fashion as they are on businessmen, schoolchildren in sailor uniforms and the elderly.In recent years, quarantine officials at Narita and Osaka airports have been seen wearing masks on a daily basis for checking passengers from countries with contagion problems.These masks are a start. It shouldn’t take 18 months to go from such models to our own. Not if we take the possibility of such a pandemic seriously.I disagree that the government should stockpile face protectors. Lately, getting the government involved in a problem makes it only worse.First, to obtain a supply, people would have to go out in a crowd without face protection — a big no-no. Why can’t people take personal responsibility and obtain their own supply? Then they will have them when they need them.By all means, the government should encourage the production of cheaper and more efficient face protection and publicly rate and test the devices. Then let the market and personal responsibility work.'"
"'06-10-29,'0','Over the five years through the end of the third quarter — a span that included both bull and bear markets — only 29.1 percent of large-cap funds managed to beat the S.& P. 500. What’s more, only 16.4 percent of mid-cap funds beat the S.& P. 400 index of mid-cap stocks, and 19.5 percent of small-cap funds outpaced the S.& P. 600 index of small-company shares. “The long term does seem to favor the indexes,” Ms. Pane said.So does the near term. That’s because corporate earnings are finally expected to decelerate meaningfully over the next several quarters, said Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. And in a period of slowing profit growth, stock market leadership typically narrows.You would think that active fund managers would thrive during such periods — because, in theory, they could select the winning stocks from the market’s losers. But choosing the winners actually becomes that much harder, Mr. Bernstein said.“In the past few years, when we saw unprecedented breadth in the stock market, it was a stock picker’s paradise,” he said. “Even if you were a poor stock picker, your chances of outperforming the broad market were quite high.”But as it becomes more difficult to find stocks generating sizable gains, “we’ll begin to uncover who truly has the stock-picking ability out there,” he said.For John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, which started the first retail stock index fund 30 years ago, the recent success of indexing is self-evident.“The reality is, fads come and go and styles of investing come and go,” he said. “The only things that go on forever are costs and taxes.” And by simply buying all the stocks in an equity benchmark and holding them for the long run, traditional index funds minimize the transaction costs and capital gains taxes associated with investing, he said.Mr. Bogle argued that while indexing grew in popularity in the late 1990s — when the Vanguard 500 Index fund, which tracks the S.& P. 500, was consistently returning more than 20 percent a year — the strategy is even more valuable in a period of modest returns. If equities gain only 6 or 7 percent annually in the coming years, the higher investment management fees, transaction costs and taxes associated with actively managed portfolios will take a disproportionate bite out of a fund’s gross returns, he said.Yet it’s precisely during these stretches of modest returns when individual investors tend to take indexing for granted. After all, there’s nothing sexy about earning mid-single-digit returns through an index fund.Mr. Bernstein said that in recent years, “I don’t recall getting any questions about indexing.” But in the late ’90s, he said, “everybody felt they had to index.”That’s probably because brand-name large-cap stocks like Microsoft and Cisco Systems were driving index funds to huge gains back then — just before the technology stock bubble burst in early 2000.This is precisely the problem that some proponents of indexing have with traditional index funds. In a traditional fund that mimics a market-capitalization-weighted benchmark like the S.& P. 500, rising market values often force portfolios to add to positions in their biggest stocks, even if those shares are grossly overvalued by conventional measures like price-to-earnings ratios.SO-CALLED fundamental indexers believe that this violates a core principle of buy-and-hold investing: buy low and sell high. And they say that there’s a better way.Research Affiliates, an asset management firm in Pasadena, Calif., has built its own set of indexes that get around the problem of market-cap weightings.The Research Affiliates Fundamental Indexes, or RAFI, instead weigh stocks on other factors such as sales, book value, free cash flow and dividends.Jason Hsu, director of research and investment management at Research Affiliates, says that this prevents an index from becoming too oriented toward the fastest-growing and largest-capitalization stocks, for example, just because of market momentum.But while fundamental indexing may be gaining some traction among investors, its timing may be off. That’s because the very force that led to the huge success of traditional indexing in the late ’90s — the dominance of large-cap stocks — appears to be returning.In the second and third quarters this year, the Russell Top 50 Index of the nation’s largest blue-chip stocks rose 6.7 percent. By comparison, the Russell 2000 index of small-company shares fell 4.3 percent.Mr. Hsu conceded that “if we go through a sustained period where large-cap stocks outperform dramatically and unreasonably, as we did in the late ’90s, then RAFI might not keep up in that environment” with a traditional index like the S.& P. 500.If that’s the case, you have another argument not to turn your back on traditional indexing just yet.'"
"'06-10-29,'0','Part of what makes dogs happy, owners and experts say, is socialization through play dates. “Kids and dogs both need socialization,” said Peter Borchelt, an animal behaviorist in Brooklyn who has noticed more people setting up play dates for their pets. While the traditional dog play date was simply a run in the park, he said, “individualized play dates definitely have a place — if a dog is shy, easily frightened or has been ‘mugged’ by another dog,” then a play date with a compatible dog is a good idea.Harold Streitman, a textiles designer, often takes his dachshund, Mambo, to the apartment of his vet’s assistant for play dates, where he can run around with other dogs. “Mambo has always socialized,” he said. “He’s in excellent shape, and part of the reason is that he regularly has dates with a group of dogs.”Nothing involving pets, though, is just about the animal. Just as it’s no secret that mothers seek out play dates to mingle with other mothers, it is also common for dog owners to arrange play dates so they can socialize with people equally besotted with their own dogs.Cindy Adams, the gossip columnist who has written extensively about her beloved dogs over the years, said she now schedules much of her social life around her dog-owning friends. “I’ve become friendlier now with people who have dogs,” she said. “I’m much closer to Ricki Lauren because her Yorkie, Bikini, is friends with my dogs, and we talk like two old ladies.”Ms. Adams and her friends sometimes make dinner dates that include her dogs, Jazzy Jr. and Juicy. “One night I was supposed to go out for dinner with Judge Judy, who owns two Shih Tzus. She said that her dog Lulu didn’t want her to go out. So I brought my dogs over and we ordered in,” Ms. Adams said.Nicole Fischelis, a fashion director at Macy’s and the owner of Valentine, a Jack Russell terrier, often dines with Ms. Evins while the dogs play. “You don’t find too many people who invite you with your dog,” she said. “But Marilyn says ‘You can’t come without your dog.’ ”For those without dog-crazy friends, several Web sites can help arrange dog rendezvous. People seeking to arrange dog play dates post on meetup.com and craigslist, and two recent pet-specific sites are Petster.com, which started last year, and DateMyPet.com, a two-year old site where singles can also search for human love and companionship.One DateMyPet.com listing was from a 37-year-old San Francisco woman seeking play dates for her dog, Marquee: “I am looking for doggy dates for Marquee (sorry guys!) and for exchanging dog-sitting services.”Robert Yau, a founder of DateMyPet.com, said the site started out as a dating service but evolved after he noticed that people wanted just to get their pets together. “People will bring pets to a date and they might not get along, but the dogs get along so the owners stay friends,” he said. “This is a totally new phenomenon.”Images of sloppy frolicking aside, doggy play dates can have a dark side. “People have to be careful who they arrange play dates with because many dogs are not well-enough disciplined,” said Dr. Fred Tierney, an Upper East Side veternarian who said he has two clients whose dogs are hyperactive. “The owners tried to arrange play dates with other dogs, but no one wanted their dog to play with these hyper dogs.”Sometimes owners are even worse, suffering from separation anxiety, overprotectiveness or excessive fussiness. “One mother would never let her dog play with other dogs,” said Ms. Wilpon, Jolie’s owner. “She finally allowed the dogs to play, and then during a drop-off play date, I fed the dog an all-natural treat, which made the dog’s face messy. At pickup time the mother said, ‘What did you do to my dog?’ It took awhile for that dog to come back.”And dog owners can be judgmental of their peers. “Just like moms, if you bring your dog on a play date and they don’t get along with the other dogs,” said Ms. Padgett, the magazine editor, “you are looked at as a bad dog parent.”A poorly behaved dog can chill the relationship between the owners. Marjorie Hilton, president of Marjorie Hilton Interiors on the Upper East Side and the owner of Lily, a Bichon, said that at one of Lily’s parties, another Bichon attacked the dog. “When the dogs don’t get along you hold a lifelong grudge,” Ms. Hilton said. “Like when someone bites your child. After that incident, every time I saw that mother she’d say she felt so bad about her dog trying to attack Lily. I’m sure she’s nice, but I can’t have her back.”But dogs who want regular play dates have to measure up, which means their owners suffer the same anxieties that mothers do. When Mr. Manzoni takes Jicky to Ms. Evins’s apartment, he not only hopes she will behave, but makes sure she is clean. He whips out damp towelettes and wipes her paws before going upstairs. “Ms. Evins has light sofas, and I don’t want Jicky to get footprints on her upholstery,” he said. “I want her to be invited back.”Now that the weather is cooler, some New York hosts will be tweaking their play date plans. “We won’t be going outside as much,” Ms. Wilpon said, “so we will have extra treats for the dogs, and we have to play with them even more to keep them entertained.”She and her husband spend part of the winter season in Palm Beach, Fla., and will be going there in a few weeks. “We have many dog friends down there,” she said. “It’s easier because we can congregate outside.”Beverly Lake Wilkes, a publicist and dog owner who has been living near Lakeside Park in Palm Beach full time for the last five years, takes her dog on casual outings with the dog owners who come down for the season year after year. Her dog, a 2-year-old English Springer spaniel named Logan, has learned to recognize his playmates. “Now that more people are starting to come down here,” Ms. Wilkes said, “Logan trots by the docks looking for his friends. Max the Bulldog from Boston comes every year.”'"

The other, Matt Maiellaro, in a weathered black polo shirt and baggy jeans, extolled the merits of blood-curdling horror flicks. “When I was 8,” said Mr. Maiellaro, who owns 900 gore-filled DVD’s, “I watched ‘The Incredible Melting Man’ and knew that horror movies were going to be big religion in my life.”It seemed a familiar state for the two, as Mr. Willis observed his friend’s verbal meanderings with a suppressed laugh. As the writing partners and creators of the peculiar adult cartoon “Aqua Teen Hunger Force” on the Cartoon Network, they’ve learned to complement each other.Mr. Willis said his friend had persuaded him to see movies he would not ordinarily have seen. “I liked ‘The Descent’ and you liked it, too.” he said, turning to Mr. Maiellaro.“It was O.K. It was a girl movie,” Mr. Maiellaro said with a tinge of mock superiority.Though Mr. Willis, 36, and Mr. Maiellaro 40, are both married with children, they remain the jokers needling each other in the back of biology lab.

"'06-10-29,'0','Radio stations no longer have deep pockets; licensing fees have not risen to keep pace with inflation. And in the age of CD’s and iTunes, studio recordings made for broadcast are no longer essential. “All the symphonies have been recorded,” said Hans-Christoph Sauer, a violinist in the NDR orchestra.So radio orchestras, threatened with cutbacks and even elimination, are offering more public concerts than they used to and, increasingly, competing with regular orchestras for recognition and audiences. Both the North German and Bavarian ensembles are hoping, with their Carnegie Hall appearances, to show the world who they are.“There’s a difference in terms of image,” Mr. Dohnanyi said of the perception that radio orchestras are slightly inferior. “There was a sense of distance from the public. Today radio orchestras are making an effort to get big conductors who can bring them closer to the public.”Mr. Jansons said of the Bavarian orchestra: “This organization has no weaknesses at all. It’s perfect — like a wonderful Cadillac.”Still, does Germany need so many orchestras? The question comes up often as the government tightens its belt. Munich, where the Bavarian orchestra is based, has three major orchestras; Hamburg, two; Berlin, at least five.And some broadcasters maintain more than one orchestra. The NDR has both the NDR Symphony and, in Hannover, the NDR Radio Philharmonic. In Munich, the Bavarian Radio incited a huge outcry two years ago when it announced that it would shut down its second ensemble, the Munich Radio Orchestra. After considerable institutional turmoil, the official word now is that the orchestra will continue, but with only 50 musicians, making it difficult to play some of its former repertory.In 1945, none of the Allied powers asked about the need for orchestras. It was palpable: concerts played to packed houses of people willing to applaud even a mediocre performance as distraction from the difficulties of daily life. Even the American occupying forces in the south, who had to contend with the widespread notion that they represented a basically uncultured society, had a music department, re-establishing orchestras and opera houses, weeding out musicians tainted by past associations. By 1946, Munich was offering about 10 concerts and recitals a week.That Radio Hamburg happened to be in the English sector proved pivotal to the development of the German broadcasting network and its orchestras. In writing a broadcast constitution for the NWDR, the British, naturally enough, took the BBC as their model: a noncommercial, state-supported system, rather than a commercial one on the American model. This constitution set the standard for German broadcasters, even for the Bavarian Radio in the American sector, one of the last to be established, in 1949.But today the sudden emergence of financial constraints is forcing many radio orchestras to rethink their roles. “It’s becoming more and more difficult and necessary,” said Mr. Gilbert of the NDR, “to justify what these orchestras do and what they are and what they serve.”The orchestras’ desire to define their place has taken visible form in a sudden push for new concert halls. In Hamburg, plans are under way for a hall called the Elbphilharmonie, a spectacular edifice that will overlook the harbor. The NDR (somewhat to the disgruntlement of the Hamburg Philharmonic and the city’s other orchestras) will be the orchestra in residence. In Munich, where there are already two concert halls, the Bavarian Radio orchestra has its eye on the Marstall, the former court stables behind the Bavarian State Opera.“I think that the hall is the instrument of an orchestra,” Mr. Dohnanyi said. “You have to rehearse in a hall and develop a sound. The big orchestras all have the chance to rehearse in their hall.”For all the current struggles of radio orchestras, both Mr. Jansons and Mr. Dohnanyi see palpable advantages in the broadcast connection. Mr. Dohnanyi says he is happy that, despite the diminished focus on studio recordings, everything, even rehearsals, is recorded.“It’s a big impetus for an orchestra to play very well,” he said. “And it helps a conductor to check what he does: intonation, tempi. It means I always have feedback about what I’m doing.”And Mr. Jansons experienced the lingering benefits of the radio orchestra’s mandate to record lesser-known music while working on his complete cycle of the Shostakovich symphonies.“I wanted to do the cycle with different orchestras in the world,” he said, “to show how musicians in the whole world play this wonderful music. Then came difficult times with CD productions. Big difficulties: we should stop this production. Because these days the big companies do not want to take risks, to schedule a new production for symphonies which are not so popular.“Then I talked, thank God, to the Bavarian Radio. We did special studio productions, so all the less popular symphonies, I did with them.”EMI has just released the symphonies in a boxed set.The announcement that Mr. Jansons was taking over the Bavarian Radio orchestra (from Lorin Maazel) in 2003 was not surprising; it is among the top two or three orchestras in Germany. But it was surprising in 2005 when Mr. Dohnanyi, after 20 years with the Cleveland Orchestra, went to the NDR, which is not quite in the same league.“Even I was surprised,” he said affably.There were personal reasons. His family is based in Hamburg, where his brother, Klaus von Dohnanyi, was long the mayor. And Christoph von Dohnanyi said he found it fitting to apply the experience he had gleaned abroad in his own country.Then there is the promise of the new hall, which could elevate Hamburg’s musical life to a new level. And there is the potential of the orchestra itself.“It excited me to think about what one could do,” he said.For all their difficulties, both of these orchestras exude a sense of excitement. The Bavarian Radio orchestra’s manager, Walter Blovsky (formerly of the Vienna Philharmonic, and hired in Munich at short notice after the Bavarian Radio’s recent institutional difficulties), says that one of his main tasks is raising the ensemble’s international profile. Mr. Sauer, the NDR violinist, even talks about changing the NDR’s name to something catchier, perhaps something that doesn’t include the word rundfunk, or radio.After all, these orchestras were founded in a spirit of freshness, innovation and international cooperation. Certainly they seem to have inspired at least two of the young officers who assisted at their births. In Hamburg, one of the British music liaisons was Howard Hartog, who went on to become a significant artists’ manager, directing the firm Ingpen & Williams. And an American music officer in Munich, Carlos Moseley, went on to direct the New York Philharmonic.The end of German culture? The radio orchestras, disoriented as they are, could continue to represent a whole new beginning.'"
"'06-10-29,'0','In an industry that has often whitewashed racial differences, gangster movies, like westerns, provide a sexy, impolitic showcase for ethnic conflict and tribalism. Westerns typically reaffirm the white majority, both morally and militarily, but in gangster movies the lines of pride, righteousness and power are more complicated. In a nation of immigrants, the movies pit audience sympathy for the new immigrant against fear of the unassimilated ethnic clan. They are epics of nonassimilation: no one is more Italian than an Italian Mafioso and his kin.The successive screen mobs — Irish, Italian, Jewish, Chinese, Cuban or African-American — all practice strict (and interchangeable) moral codes and family values. Yet each is eventually threatened by ascendant newcomers, who make their codes seem not pure but old-fashioned, flabby. In the ethnic drama of the gangster picture, assimilation becomes a fatal decadence: as the immigrant group becomes more like the dominant culture, it loses its strength. Even as the movies embrace their minorities, they do not let them transcend their difference. And in the end, of course, someone rats; justice wins out.“American Gangster” passes the drug trade, which divided the Corleone family in “The Godfather,” from the Italian-American mob to Frank Lucas, who imagines it as a sleek global supply chain running from Vietnam to Harlem. Brian Grazer, one of the film’s producers, saw it as a parable about business in the age of Enron.“My opinion is the movie is a metaphor for white-collar greed and crime,” Mr. Grazer said, bouncing around in a trailer on Riverside Drive. “In the end, how different is what Frank Lucas does than a junk-bond dealer?”How deeply the movie will develop these themes is anyone’s guess. But it is unlikely that the makers of “Scarface,” “Public Enemy No. 1” or “A Bronx Tale” would have discussed their protagonists in the language of market share and hostile takeover.Among Harlem drug lords, Frank Lucas was less celebrated than Nicky Barnes, but his rise and fall as a businessman, chronicled in a 2000 New York magazine article by Mark Jacobson that inspired the movie, is as American as Horatio Alger. Raised poor in rural North Carolina, he came to New York and modernized the heroin trade, importing directly from Southeast Asia — often in military planes with the help of military brass, and sometimes in the caskets of dead soldiers. In the process he bucked the control of the Italian Mafia, which often treated African-Americans as underlings. He improved the product, the supply chain and the organizational structure, amassing a fortune he once estimated at $52 million in cash. He went to prison for 15 years before giving testimony that led to more than 100 arrests, said Mr. Roberts, who now has a private criminal law practice, with Mr. Lucas as a friend and client.“These drug guys, then and now, were brutal,” Mr. Roberts said. “He was, too. But he was smart. There was something about him I liked. I hate to admit it.” He added: “Some say he’s a rat because he cooperated. Baloney. He did the smart thing. He did tremendous harm, but then tremendous good.”What fascinated Mr. Scott, though, were not just Mr. Lucas’s entrepreneurial courage but also his values, especially compared with those of the police and prosecutors, including Mr. Roberts, who is portrayed in the movie as a womanizer.“It’s about the paradox of what their private life was like and their work life,” Mr. Scott said between shots on another afternoon. “They’re reversals on each other. One is personally ethical, yet his business is highly debatable, i.e., heroin. And yet his ethics about his business as a process and procedure are so meticulous that it can almost be respected.”Speaking of Mr. Roberts, he continued: “And the other character is again a paradox of opposites. His personal life is all to hell, and yet he’s a hound dog and fervently honest. He was infamous within the Police Department for having returned a million dollars of probably drug money, which he found in the trunk of a car, instantly making him untrustworthy within the Police Department. So already you have this confusion of ethics.”Mr. Scott, who has made movies that advertise their genres in their titles before, including “Alien” and “Gladiator,” said that to set a mood before filming, he studied “The French Connection” and “Prince of the City.” He described “American Gangster” as less a genre film than a documentary, but did not complete the thought.“I like to think in terms of a grand generic notion of an American gangster, as opposed to the American gangster,” he said. “Because there are too many famous and infamous American gangsters over the last century. The notion of ‘American Gangster’ is almost like a new evolution of the adjustment of change. Change in this instance cost the Mafia the main precedence at the time, because they were having to buy the idea of progress in the idea of a black businessman.” (Somehow, when he talked to actors and his four camera teams, they seemed to follow him without decryption devices.)“American Gangster” enters production with a troubled history. In 2004, with Antoine Fuqua directing and Mr. Washington and Benicio Del Toro in the lead roles, Universal Studios scrapped the movie less than a month before the scheduled start of filming, absorbing a loss reported at $30 million. Terry George, director of “Hotel Rwanda,” rewrote the script and began a cheaper version last year, before Mr. Grazer started again with Mr. Scott and a new cast.Mr. Grazer said he had begun to think the movie was cursed because its protagonist was so evil that he was not meant to be popularized.Mr. Washington, too, said he had wrestled with the question of whether it was appropriate to give the Hollywood treatment to someone whose chief accomplishment was bringing more heroin to more people. Unlike Mr. Grazer, who cites the first two “Godfather” movies as his favorite films, Mr. Washington said he was never a big fan of gangster movies. “I thought, ‘Why should I want to play this dope dealer?’ ”But he said he took comfort in the biblical passage “There is no peace, saith the Lord, for the wicked,” which he wrote on his script. “This guy gets to a certain place, and one thing after another after another in our script starts happening to him,” Mr. Washington said. “His body turns on him. He gets shot. The life of crime — he pays the price in a lot of ways. Some would say not enough, obviously.“When I met Frank, I really understood what I saw as the arc of the character. He wears nice clothes and drives fancy cars and all that, so if that means glorifying it I guess that’s the case. But for me I was looking at the arc of the character, and he don’t look that glorious right now.”On the Harlem set, Vicky Gholson, a local resident and community board member, said that without Mr. Washington she might have worried that “American Gangster” would repeat the sins of the blaxploitation films of the 1970’s. But, she added: “The mere fact that Denzel is starring in it offsets any mixed feelings I might have of glorifying a drug dealer. This community has a legacy of gangsterism and entertainment, and this movie shows both.”The street scene was not feeling right. The young hoodlums looked like actors in Timberlands and hoodies, not real thugs. The rap figure Fab Five Freddy, a consultant, advised them on their swagger. They were moving away too fast, he said. Real bad boys savor the confrontation.Mr. Roberts, who said he had not read the entire script, said he hoped the movie was straightforward and not glamorized, but he was already feeling the distorting effects of Hollywood.

"'06-10-29,'0','The Tax Man wants to know. In what amounts to a moral audit, Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, recently sent a letter to the money-grab artists at the nonprofit N.C.A.A., asking it to justify its tax-exempt status with some barbed questions:¶With corporate sponsorships, lucrative TV deals and millionaire coaches with no academic duties, Thomas asked, “What actions has the N.C.A.A. taken to retain a clear line of demarcation between major college sports and professional sports?”¶Given that federal taxpayers have no interest in which universities generate visibility and contributions through athletic success, Thomas asked, “Why should the federal government subsidize the athletic activities of educational institutions when that subsidy is being used to help pay for escalating coaches’ salaries, costly chartered travel and state-of-the-art athletic facilities?”¶With Texas, the defending Division I-A football champion, graduating 29 percent of its players compared with 74 percent of the university’s student body for the class that entered in 1998, Thomas asked, “How well is the N.C.A.A. accomplishing its tax-exempt purpose of maintaining the athlete as an integral part of the student body?”¶The N.C.A.A. added an extra football game to the schedule and lengthened the basketball season, so Thomas asked, “How do these proposals help athletes improve academic performance?”Excellent questions. But what’s the political point of frisking the N.C.A.A. for loaded pockets?“It is not an insignificant event,” said the economist Andrew Zimbalist, author of “The Bottom Line: Observations and Arguments on Sports Business.” He added, “Although these politicians are grandstanding in my view, I’d rather have them grandstanding than be silent.”Peacock politicians can be effective. Congress took the stage to shame Major League Baseball and scared it straight into the admission of a drug problem. And as the Ways and Means Committee probes America’s nonprofit sector, it may hold the N.C.A.A. accountable to its unholy binge shopping.“I think all of us in higher education — the conferences, the N.C.A.A. — we should be worried about this,” said David Williams, a tax lawyer and vice chancellor at Vanderbilt, where administrators have successfully folded athletics back into education. “The tax code is one of the largest pieces of social legislation. You can encourage and discourage certain behaviors.“I believe the government is saying: ‘You’ve been told time and time again to link athletics to higher education, and we’re not seeing that. You’re not able to control yourself.’ ”It’s a deep spiral on a post pattern to the bank. More than 10 Division I-A universities pay their football and basketball coaches a combined $3 million a year. At Texas, Mack Brown ($2.6 million) and Rick Barnes ($1.8 million) exceed $4 million. At Florida, it’s enough to pay Urban Meyer ($2.1 million) and Billy Donovan ($1.6 million), but the Gators have also been on the hook for $2.6 million in severance payments.“The question is,” Williams said, “where is that money coming from?”The sugar daddies of college sports. Boosters receive up to an 80 percent tax deduction on gifts to the program. Every check writer — from the Oklahoma State Santa T. Boone Pickens ($165 million) to the Tennessee benefactor Peyton Manning ($1 million) — may be in line for an atta-boy from their accountants.Peek inside the 990 tax forms at nonprofit booster clubs and you’ll discover charity’s payoff. At Florida State, not only did Seminole Booster Inc. raise $42 million in direct public support, according to its 2004 tax documents, but the president of the club was paid $228,184 in salary.Booster czars don’t just hang up the signup sheets for tailgate casseroles, anymore. They oversee friends of the program who have penthouse tastes. Bull Gators — the grand pooh-bah of Florida boosters — can use their nonprofit devotion as a business perk by purchasing a luxury suite for $48,000 with the sweet bonus of air-conditioning at the Swamp.What’s too much? Is it Texas spending $150 million for a stadium expansion? Is it Georgia pouring nearly $7 million into an academic center to prop up struggling athletes? It is the five-star hotel football players at the University of Colorado have been known to stay in the night before a home game?The excess only serves to loot the soul of higher education. It’s enough to make Congress suspicious.“I think Congress wants to know: Do you look more like a for-profit rather than a nonprofit?” Williams said.Imagine the market correction if the free money disappeared for the N.C.A.A. That’s not a pompom you hear, but the sound of the N.C.A.A. shaking. It has until Nov. 13 to respond to Thomas. So far, the N.C.A.A. has only offered a statement in its weak defense, “The N.C.A.A. disagrees with the fundamental assertion that intercollegiate athletics is not part of higher education.”Just how is a team spa day part of higher education?'"

"'06-10-30,'0','The people also described how members of the Mahdi Army, led by a local commander known as Abu Rami, came to the wife’s home in the central Baghdad neighborhood of Karada last Monday, on the Muslim holiday Id al-Fitr, and took Mr. Taei.“They were saying, ‘He’s an American journalist,’ ” said a woman who identified herself as his mother-in-law and asked that she be identified only by her nickname, Um Omar, because of fear of reprisals. “We were saying, ‘No, he’s an Iraqi.’ ”Um Omar and the others in the home said they had not learned until after the man’s kidnapping that he was an American soldier.Military officials would not comment when asked Sunday about these new details, and it was impossible to independently corroborate the account given by the people who said they were Mr. Taei’s in-laws.The military’s fraternization policies prohibit active duty personnel from marrying local civilians, said Lt. Col. Josslyn Aberle, a military spokeswoman. But she said privacy rules barred her from providing any details about the missing soldier.In 2003, a pair of Florida national guardsmen married Iraqi doctors they met in Baghdad soon after the fall of Saddam Hussein’s government in a joint ceremony. One of the soldiers’ marriages dissolved soon afterward, but the one whose marriage lasted was confined to his base and eventually discharged from the military.The people who said they were the missing soldier’s in-laws said he and his immediate family, Sunnis from the capital’s Adhamiya neighborhood, had fled to the United States before the fall of Saddam Hussein. They explained how he came to marry Ms. Abdul-Satar, also a Sunni.Mr. Taei had friends in Karada, a mostly upscale commercial district that sits outside the Green Zone, Um Omar said. As she described it, he spotted her daughter one day as she was en route to classes at Mustansiriya University in central Baghdad, where she is enrolled in the science college.Through friends, he arranged to speak with her parents, Um Omar said, and after some discussion, Ms. Abdul-Satar agreed to marry Mr. Taei, whom her mother described as a “gentleman.”After the couple married, Um Omar said, Ms. Abdul-Satar moved out of her mother’s cramped apartment, on the third floor of a dreary complex on a side street in Karada near the National Theater, and settled into a cousin’s one-story home down the block.Mr. Taei came to visit every few days, said a neighbor who lives across the street from the cousin’s home, where the kidnapping took place.“We thought he was a businessman,” said the neighbor, who asked to be identified only by his last name, Nadhir.Last Monday, Mr. Taei came about 4 p.m. on a motorcycle. Soon after, a car full of gunmen came and demanded that Mr. Taei go with them, Mr. Nadhir said. He said he witnessed the entire episode from across the street but was helpless to stop it.Abu Rami, said to be the lead kidnapper, had been living in the abandoned Ministry of Defense building just up the street that is now inhabited by squatters, residents said. Members of the Mahdi Army, a force that answers to the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, are known to patrol that building as well as a squalid former air force base across the street that has also become a large encampment for the homeless.Just a few days before the kidnapping, Abu Rami and his men had beaten several teenage boys in the neighborhood with cables for wearing shorts, residents said.But when the men tried to drag Mr. Taei into their car at gunpoint, he and members of Ms. Abdul-Satar’s family resisted, Mr. Nadhir said. Three additional cars full of gunmen soon arrived to help.One of Um Omar’s nephews came running to her apartment to tell her what was happening, she said. She rushed over with other family members.“I saw one of the kidnappers putting a gun to his head,” she said.The women in the house were screaming and crying, begging and arguing with the gunmen to stop, said Ahmed Abdul-Satar, one of Ms. Abdul-Satar’s brothers, who said he tried to send them inside while the men sorted out the matter. His sister, in hysterics, fainted, he said.Eventually, the gunmen wrestled Mr. Taei into the car, but another of Ms. Abdul-Satar’s brothers, Omar, who knew Abu Rami from the neighborhood, insisted on going with them, other relatives said.They were on their way to the vast Shiite slum of Sadr City, the stronghold of the Mahdi Army, relatives said, when Abu Rami ordered Mr. Abdul-Satar out of the car and left him at the side of the road. If he did not get out, he was told, they would kidnap him as well.Ms. Abdul-Satar and her brother are now staying in the Green Zone for their safety and to answer additional questions from the military, their mother said. She has heard from her daughter a few times, but there has been no news of Mr. Taei.American troops, along with their Iraqi counterparts, have cordoned off much of eastern Baghdad, including Sadr City, in their search for the missing soldier.On Friday, they rolled in force into the district, searching a mosque and a school but did not find him.Just two days before that, Iraqi and American troops had clashed over several hours with militiamen after they entered Sadr City at dawn. They raided the home of a notorious Shiite guerrilla leader in search of suspects in the kidnapping, the military said. In total, 10 militiamen were killed in the fighting.On Sunday, thousands of residents, along with politicians from Mr. Sadr’s political bloc, gathered in Sadr City to protest peacefully against the security cordon around the neighborhood.The most serious of the attacks elsewhere across Iraq on Sunday was an ambush of a police academy minibus in the southern city of Basra. Fifteen officers and two interpreters were killed, said Gen. Abdul Khidir al-Taher of the Iraqi police. In addition, the police found at least 31 bodies across the capital on Sunday, many of them shot at close range and bearing signs of torture, an Interior Ministry official said.For Um Omar, the last week has been filled with waiting and worrying. If she had known that Mr. Taei had been in the United States Army, she said, she would have forbidden him to visit.“I’m praying,” she said. “I’m calling on Allah for his safety.”'"
"'06-10-30,'0','“We’re still in October,” Dungy said. “We have to continue to get better. If we think this week and next week, the season is over, that’s not the case. We know we’re three games ahead of Jacksonville in our division, and that’s all we know.”He also knows that the Colts will not go very far this winter if their defense does not get better quickly. The Colts scored on seven of their nine drives (one was a kneel-down to end the first half), and they needed every one of their 34 points to hold off a team that had not scored more than 20 in any of its previous games.If this game is another in Manning’s long list of star-dusted performances — he threw three touchdown passes and missed only 7 of 39 attempts all day — it also exposed significant flaws in a defense that allowed 227 yards rushing, much of it straight through the middle.“I thought eventually we would stop them,” Dungy said. “It would have been nice to stop them and not have those last two drives. When our offense has the ball with a chance to win, we feel pretty confident. This was definitely a game when our run defense could have lost it for us.”But only if Manning was not around. For one half, at least, it looked as if the Broncos’ strategy of offering a bend-but-don’t-break defense would work.The Colts were allowed all the short, underneath passes Manning wanted. But they struggled to go downfield, and they were held to two Vinatieri field goals, a virtual shutout by Colts standards, that allowed the Broncos a 14-6 halftime lead.But on the Colts’ first drive of the third quarter, Manning looked to his right, where three receivers had lined up, even as Wayne was moving to his left. Manning whipped the pass to Wayne, who was wide open for a 12-yard touchdown reception that put the Colts a point behind.When Jake Plummer, the Denver quarterback, fumbled as he was sacked on the next Broncos possession — a play that the officials originally ruled was not a fumble, only to reverse themselves after Dungy challenged — the Colts had a frighteningly short field.With Broncos safety John Lynch playing up near the line of scrimmage, Wayne slipped behind him for a leaping touchdown reception.The defense that had yielded two touchdowns in six games had yielded two touchdowns in less than four minutes.Wayne went on to catch 10 passes for 138 yards and 3 touchdowns, and a 2-point conversion, establishing himself as the go-to man while the Broncos’ outstanding cornerback Champ Bailey shadowed Marvin Harrison all day.Still, even as the lead changed hands four times — Denver’s Mike Bell scored on two 1-yard touchdown runs — before Elam’s field goal tied the score, the Broncos elected not to follow the blueprint the Steelers, who blitzed Manning, provided in last year’s playoffs.“I thought we would get the pressure needed, we just didn’t quite do it,” said Denver Coach Mike Shanahan, whose team fell to 5-2.The Colts’ record, and Manning’s performance, do not indicate how much more difficult the beginning of this season has been for the Colts than last season. The games have been closer. Several key defenders are hurt. Manning took a punishing blow in last week’s victory over the Redskins. “I’m enjoying it,” Manning said. “These close games — hopefully those will pay off for us down the line.”'"
"'06-10-30,'0','The Observer, a British newspaper, reported that the study cited a figure of £3.68 trillion (the equivalent of $6.98 trillion) as the cost to society of failing to start blunting global warming within a decade.“Our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity, later in this century and in the next, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century,” the report said, according to Reuters.The study estimated that the cost of cutting emissions in 2050 to 60 percent to 80 percent below 1990 levels would be about 1 percent of total global economic activity by then, Reuters and The Observer said. If emissions cannot be cut to those levels, the cost from climatic impacts could be 5 to 20 times higher, The Observer cited the study as saying.The study, according to the news reports, said that progress would best be accomplished by doubling global investment in research on climate-friendly energy technologies and placing a rising cost on further emissions of the greenhouse gases, led by carbon dioxide, to propel the shift toward non-polluting options.The news reports on the study are consistent with presentations by Sir Nicholas, including a speech last January at Oxford University.Other recent estimates of the eventual annual costs of stabilizing concentrations of greenhouse gases over the 21st century have ranged from 1 percent of global gross domestic product to 16 percent by around 2100, not counting any savings from averted damage.By comparison, the world is currently spending just over $1 trillion a year, or about 2.5 percent of global gross global domestic product, on defense, according to a yearly survey by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. (Military spending in the United States is about 3.7 percent of gross domestic product.)“This confirms what we’ve seen for a long time,” said Kert Davies, a climate-policy coordinator for Greenpeace. “The longer we take to act, the greater the costs will be.”Jerry Taylor, an expert on energy and climate policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group in Washington, said the wide range of cost estimates for cutting emissions “basically tells you we’re guessing.”Overall, he said, he put more faith in academic analyses than one produced at a government’s request, particularly at a time when the public appears eager to see signs of action on the issue.The release of the 700-page report, which was 16 months in the making, will come one week before the start of the latest round of talks on the Kyoto Protocol, the first international pact requiring cuts in heat-trapping emissions.The United States has not ratified the Kyoto pact but is a party to the voluntary treaty that preceded it, which requires all signatories to seek to avoid a dangerous buildup of greenhouse gases.The Kyoto Protocol, an addendum to the original treaty, requires three dozen participating industrialized countries to cut their combined emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.At the moment, many of the three dozen industrialized countries bound by the pact are not on track to meet targets. And there are few indications of a shift toward accepting binding restrictions in the United States, the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, or China and India, which are projected to be the dominant sources of emissions in a couple of decades.'"

"'06-10-30,'0','“Tax avoidance is a big issue,” said Marc A. Siegel, research director of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, an independent forensic accounting advisory firm in Rockville, Md. “There is no real excuse for intentionally trying to misreport an exercise date.”An option grant gives the holder the right to buy shares of stock in the future at a predetermined “exercise” price. If the current market price is higher than the price at which the option was granted, the option holder captures the gain. Profits from options are subject to income tax when the options are exercised.Backdating an exercise date can reduce that tax burden. By reporting an exercise date with a lower price than the date on which the options were actually exercised, executives may understate their gains and lower their income tax. It may also cause their companies to take improper tax deductions, leading to reporting problems down the road.In other cases, executives can benefit by reporting an exercise date with a higher price than the one on which the options were acquired. Instead of acquiring their new shares with cash, executives sometimes use stock to pay the cost of converting their options, including the taxes on the profits. A higher market price means that the executive needs fewer shares to pay those costs.As with backdated grants, improper adjustments of exercise dates are most likely to have taken place during the dot-com boom of the 1990s and to have subsided in 2002, when more stringent reporting requirements were introduced. And, as with the backdating inquiry, it appears that federal investigators are combing through data to identify patterns, where executives consistently exercised their stock options at a favorable price, like a monthly or quarterly low. In suspicious cases, investigators may follow up by requesting brokerage firm records and other transaction documents from companies to see if the actual and reported exercise dates match up.Because backdating exercise prices involves false financial reporting and improper accounting, the cases fall under the S.E.C.’s oversight. But in similar investigations, S.E.C officials have alerted the Internal Revenue Service of possible tax issues in the securities cases they were examining.The practice of backdating exercise prices first emerged in two of the first investigations into improper options practices. Both Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, and Linda Chatman Thomsen, the agency’s enforcement director, cited the abuse in their testimony before Congress last month.In 2004, as part of a broader case of accounting fraud, the Justice Department and the S.E.C. accused several former executives at Symbol Technologies, a producer of bar code equipment, of manipulating their option exercise dates.Federal prosecutors and regulators accused Leonard Goldner, Symbol’s former general counsel, of devising a plan that let him and a handful of other senior executives push back the option exercise dates on the filings used to report stock acquisitions, without the knowledge of the company’s board or shareholders.Rather than report the actual exercise dates, they could choose the most advantageous date from among the preceding 30 days to come up with a lower exercise price, according to court filings. This so-called look-back practice allowed Symbol’s senior executives to avoiding paying hundreds of thousands in income taxes, court filings claim.Consider the case of Kenneth V. Jaeggi, Symbol’s former chief financial officer. On June 9, 2000, Mr. Jaeggi signed a securities filing stating that he had exercised 101,250 stock options in late May, at the second-lowest price for Symbol shares in the preceding 30 days. In fact, government prosecutors testified in court that that the options were never actually exercised until they were paid for on June 30.Instead of Mr. Jaeggi’s actual gain of $4.48 million, the gain reported to the I.R.S. was $3.02 million — a difference of $1.46 million, according to Frank Stamm, an I.R.S agent who testified as a government witness. The result was that Mr. Jaeggi avoided paying more than $596,000 in taxes in 2000, according Mr. Stamm’s testimony.Mr. Goldner, the Symbol general counsel, pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct the I.R.S. from collecting income tax in June 2004 and forfeited $2 million; he also settled the civil charges with the S.E.C. Mr. Jaeggi pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges, and his lawyer, Steven F. Molo, denied that his client had acted improperly. “He didn’t look back. He didn’t do anything wrong,” Mr. Molo said. “The government failed to prove any illegality because there was none.”The jury could not reach a verdict in the initial trial earlier this year, and Mr. Jaeggi, along with several other Symbol executives, is awaiting a second court trial next spring. Symbol, which Motorola agreed to acquire last month, paid a $37 million penalty in 2004 to resolve a number of civil accounting fraud charges.More recently, Mercury Interactive, a software testing company based in Mountain View, Calif., acknowledged that backdated exercises were among a variety of stock option abuses identified in an internal investigation, which led to the removal of several of the company’s top officers.Mercury investigators found at least three occasions when it appeared that Amnon Landan, the company’s former chief executive, and several other former top managers reported “a date that differed from the date at which the exercise actually happened,” according to an update in the company’s annual report. That difference “reduced the executives’ taxable income significantly and exposed the company to possible penalties for failure to pay withholding taxes.”A Mercury spokesman declined to comment, as did Jonathan M. Cohen, a lawyer for Mr. Landan. In September, Mercury proposed paying $35 million to resolve the S.E.C.’s charges related to its stock options practices. And in regulatory filings this month, the company said that it was discussing settlement terms with the I.R.S. and cooperating with the Justice Department. Mercury agreed to sell itself this summer to Hewlett-Packard in a $4.5 billion deal with that has faced several delays.Some lawyers who have been hired by companies as outside investigators said they did not currently expect backdated exercises to become a widespread issue.Reviewing exercise dates for past option grants, however, is not currently a standard part of the internal investigations that at least 153 companies have acknowledged so far. And new accounting guidelines released in July do not direct auditors to give greater scrutiny to exercise dates. “I know the investigators are aware of this gambit,” said William D. Sherman, a partner at Morrison & Foerster in Palo Alto, Calif., which is involved in several investigations. “But by and large,” he added, “we not finding much of it.”But Mr. Siegel of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis said that it would not surprise him if investigations into the backdating of exercise dates became a bigger deal. “The whole thing about backdating was that you were in the world of the Internet bubble,” he said. “You had inadequate internal controls, a high incentive to make the options package lucrative, war for talent and low regulatory presence. It wouldn’t surprise me if both the grants and exercise dates got misreported.”'"
"'06-10-30,'0','It is in this context that, working with the law firm DLA Piper and the United States Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, we commissioned a report on the failure of the North Korean government to exercise its responsibility to protect its own people. The evidence and analysis in this report are deeply disturbing. Indeed, it is clear that North Korea is actively committing crimes against humanity — against its own people.North Korea allowed perhaps one million — and possibly many more — of its own citizens to die during the famine in the 1990’s. This was caused in part by the government’s decision to reduce food purchases as international assistance increased so that it could divert resources to its military and nuclear program.Hunger and starvation remain a persistent problem today, with more than 37 percent of North Korean children chronically malnourished. And yet North Korea has requested less food assistance from the World Food Program and refuses to let the program monitor food distribution in some 42 of 203 counties in the country.As a result of the cuts in food aid, the program has said that millions of North Koreans will face real hardship this winter and many aid groups have warned of another famine.Furthermore, North Korea holds as many as 200,000 people in its political prisons. Not only are real or imagined dissenters imprisoned, but so are their relatives, including the elderly and children, under a guilt-by-association system instituted by North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-sung.Prisoners in the gulag are provided starvation-level rations, forced to work long days under brutal conditions, and many face torture or execution for trivial offenses. It is estimated that more than 400,000 have died in the North Korean gulag over 30 years.The few attempts by the international community to engage with North Korea on human rights and humanitarian concerns have come up short. Resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights have been repudiated by North Korean representatives and then ignored.In addition, North Korea refuses to recognize the legitimacy of the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea and has denied his numerous requests for access to the country.Kim Jong-il has proven that the international community’s restraint in openly discussing North Korea’s treatment of its own people did not yield compromise on the nuclear issue. It merely allowed him to decouple the two issues.Now that Kim Jong-il’s nuclear weapons test has attracted the attention and condemnation of the world, it is imperative to seize this opportunity and once again engage with Pyongyang on human rights and humanitarian concerns.Our report recommends that, as a first step, the Council should adopt a non-punitive resolution urging open access to North Korea for humanitarian relief, the release of political prisoners, access for the special rapporteur and engagement by the United Nations.We also urge the incoming secretary-general, Ban Ki-Moon, to make his first official action a briefing of the Security Council on this dire situation.Protecting the people of North Korea requires nothing less.'"

"'06-10-31,'0','Criticizing 12 years of Republican rule in New York, former President Bill Clinton told supporters last night that the Senate office of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had become like “a de facto governor’s office” for upstate economic development.Appearing at a fund-raiser for Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, in Manhattan, Mr. Clinton made the broadside without mentioning Gov. George E. Pataki, who is leaving office at the end of the year after three terms.Indeed, it was not a slash-and-burn moment: Mr. Clinton seemed to be in an exuberant mood at the prospect of a Democratic takeover in New York led by Mr. Cuomo, a former housing secretary of his, as well as the party’s candidate for governor, Eliot Spitzer, and Mrs. Clinton, who is up for re-election next week.Addressing about 200 people at the Rainbow Room, Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Cuomo as effective because of his mastery of both politics and policy, which Mr. Clinton described as “really important.” Then he said:“With all respect to my adopted state, New York needs a lot of work now. There’s one reason my wife is running like a house fire in upstate New York. In a lot of these Republican communities, in effect, her office has become like a de facto governor’s office for economic development and specific problem solving.”The Pataki administration has been criticized by many Democrats, including Mr. Spitzer, for not doing enough to create more jobs upstate. But Mr. Clinton has not assailed the governor’s office very often. Coming one week before Election Day, his remark had a triumphal air — but it also gave New York Republicans a rare opening to criticize the Clintons.'"
"'06-10-31,'0','A judicial ethics commission is investigating whether two judges colluded in a decision that could have been damaging to Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, just days before last year’s Democratic primary.The state’s Commission on Judicial Conduct is looking at whether Justice William A. Wetzel of State Supreme Court in Manhattan influenced a fellow justice in the same court, Michael R. Ambrecht, to issue a ruling critical of Mr. Morgenthau in a case involving Leslie Crocker Snyder, Mr. Morgenthau’s opponent in the primary.The chain of events began around June 2005, when Mr. Morgenthau’s office asked Justice Ambrecht to unseal any records of payments authorized by Ms. Snyder, while she was a judge to Eric D. Herschmann, whom she had appointed as administrator of a restitution fund.Mr. Herschmann was a lawyer with the firm Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, which Ms. Snyder joined in 2003. In August 2005, a month before the Democratic primary, The New York Post published an article that said that Ms. Snyder had approved more than $1 million in expenses and fees from 1997 to 2003 for the law firm that later hired her. On Sept. 7, 2005, five days before the primary, Justice Ambrecht issued a ruling on the request to unseal the records that was critical of Mr. Morgenthau’s office, implying that it had leaked the sealed records.“The Court, while lacking all the necessary facts to determine the source of the leaked information, is compelled to express its concern over the apparent misuse of a public office for inappropriate political purposes,” Justice Ambrecht wrote.'"

Because it formed after the end of crab season, it did not affect commercial fishing this year.

That leads to a proliferation of bacteria that use up so much oxygen that fish and crabs die.'"
"'06-10-31,'0','Merck & Company will pay $1.1 billion to acquire Sirna Therapeutics, one of the leading companies pursuing the technology that was the basis for the Nobel Prize in medicine awarded earlier this month.The deal, announced by the companies yesterday after the close of trading, is the largest sign yet of interest among pharmaceutical companies in the technology, known as RNA interference. Merck’s all-cash offer for Sirna was worth $13 a share, more than double Sirna’s $6.45 closing price yesterday.RNAi, as it is known for short, is a powerful mechanism for inactivating particular genes. It is already used widely in laboratories to study the functions of genes. But Merck and Sirna hope the technique may also be used one day to treat diseases — killing viruses or tumors, for instance, by turning off their genes.“There’s a potential for RNAi to change the way drugs are discovered and developed,” Peter S. Kim, the president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in an interview.The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this year went to Andrew Z. Fire of Stanford University and Craig C. Mello of the University of Massachusetts for their discovery of RNAi, a natural process that apparently evolved as a way for cells to fight viruses. The awarding of the prize only eight years after the discovery — light speed for the Nobel Foundation — was a sign of how important RNAi has already become.'"
"'06-10-31,'0','In halting fashion — an adjective never used to describe Stoudemire before the operations — he has made it back to the court. A No. 1 pick out of high school in 2002, a quickly emerging 6-foot-10 force in the league until his knee troubles, he begins this season as the backup to Kurt Thomas at power forward.Stoudemire knows he needs his teammates now. But how much they need him and how soon they can all get into sync will determine whether Phoenix can break through in the N.B.A.’s talent-laden Western Conference.“I think he understands that around the All-Star break, or March, and really going down the stretch, that’s when we’ll need him,” Suns Coach Mike D’Antoni said in a telephone interview on Sunday.The Suns’ Steve Nash became a two-time league most valuable player last season by rallying two big men — Boris Diaw and Thomas — in Stoudemire’s absence and teaming them with Shawn Marion, Leandro Barbosa and Raja Bell to get the Suns to their second straight conference finals. No longer revolving around Stoudemire’s pick-and-roll, the Suns relied on ball movement and Thomas’s defensive intensity.For a team that shook up the league by running, first with Stoudemire and then without him, the Suns do not want to be caught waiting around while he makes incremental progress.“Our game is a little different than it was,” Nash said in a recent interview in Phoenix, “so it’s going to take time to fit him back into the system. Last year, we were pretty close without him.”Stoudemire could see that. “There probably wasn’t the highlights that I sometimes bring,” Stoudemire said, “but as a team, they played great basketball. They hit the open shots, spaced the floor well; Boris came in and had a great year.“Whatever works for the team, I’m definitely down for it,” he said of the possibility of becoming the Suns’ sixth man. “I see myself as a great fit once I get to that point where I can be consistent.”Stoudemire often needed extra days off after being given extended playing time this preseason. Last week, he reported discomfort in both knees and wondered whether the Suns might be growing impatient with him.By Sunday, Stoudemire felt pain free, D’Antoni said. “He understands until he proves it, everybody has doubts,” D’Antoni said. “We’re not going to give up on him. We believe in him.”D’Antoni said he had no timetable for increasing Stoudemire’s minutes. “I don’t think there’s any magic formula,” he said. “It’s just a matter of what’s pain, what’s soreness, and understanding what you can play on and what you can’t. He’s going to have good days and bad.”Thomas said: “I think we’re better with him, without a doubt. It’s going to give us depth. Last season, we played seven guys. In the long haul, that’s only going to help.”The Lakers’ Kobe Bryant, who is also returning from knee surgery, said in an interview this month that there should be no debate about Stoudemire’s impact. “I’m sure people in Phoenix are talking about whether the Suns are a better team without him,” Bryant said. “That’s silly. He’s a phenomenal talent.”By the time the Suns reached the 2005 conference finals against San Antonio, Stoudemire was leaping out of the gym, averaging 37 points a game in that series. “And I was only getting better,” Stoudemire said. “I’m trying definitely to get back to that.”The Suns’ window of opportunity — Nash turns 33 in February — would seem to be narrowing.Stoudemire’s success ultimately depends on his reintegration with the team, which the Suns know cannot occur just on the court. Encouraged by team officials, Stoudemire has been trying to socialize more with his teammates after a rehabilitation that heightened his isolation last season.In Italy, during training camp, he joined teammates at an Italian soccer game. “I’m doing more, just to fit that bond,” Stoudemire said.Off the court, Stoudemire has a core of advisers to support him through unsettling family issues. His mother, Carrie Stoudemire, is serving a three-year prison sentence in Arizona for driving while impaired.Carrie moved Stoudemire and his half-brother from Florida to New York when they were young. “I went to something like five elementary schools, six middle schools, six high schools,” he said.Each time, sports eased his alienation. “I was always good at something, whether it be riding skateboards, riding trick bikes or just playing basketball,” he said.Maybe a jersey change will help him recapture his easy dominance. Stoudemire said he wanted to honor his foundation’s motto, “Each One Teach One,” by switching from No. 32 to No. 1 this season.He hopes for a new start, and a new finish.'"

"'06-10-31,'0','Dura Automotive Systems filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday, becoming the fifth major auto parts company since February 2005 to seek protection from creditors.Dura listed liabilities of $1.73 billion and assets of $1.99 billion in papers filed with the federal bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Del. The company said it was forced to file for Chapter 11 because of North American production cutbacks by domestic automakers and rising costs for raw materials like steel.Dura’s largest customers, Ford and General Motors, are building fewer vehicles in the United States as they lose sales and market share to Toyota.“Dura finally threw in the towel,” said Pete Hastings, an analyst with Morgan Keegan & Company. “Several of the weaker suppliers have already folded, but they will re-emerge through the magic of bankruptcy after they shed the high labor costs, heavy debt burdens and overly aggressive sales contracts.”Representatives of Ford and G.M. said they did not expect production to be affected by Dura’s filing for bankruptcy.The filing covers Dura’s United States and Canadian operations and comes after the company missed a $17.3 million interest payment on Oct. 16. The company said it would consolidate operations and exit unprofitable contracts while under bankruptcy protection.'"
"'06-10-31,'0','While the administrative problems undermined investor confidence, Archeus’s performance this year did little to inspire its clients. Through the first week of October, Archeus’s main fund was down 1.9 percent for the year. In their letter, however, Mr. Kilberg and Mr. Hirsch noted that this fund had returned 18.5 percent since July 2005.Still, during a period when hedge fund returns have come under increased scrutiny and have, on average, lagged the returns of the major stock market indexes, such a return was apparently not enough to keep investors on board.In the letter, the two men said that all funds in investor accounts would be redeemed ""as of the value established on Dec. 31, 2006."" The fund has assets of $700 million, Mr. Kilberg and Mr. Hirsch said in their letter.Archeus’s fairly rapid demise underscores how quickly the fortunes can change for hedge funds. Just four years ago, Mr. Kilberg, who as a member of the Salomon Brothers trainee class of 1985 drew a mention in ""Liar’s Poker,” had raised billions of dollars for his fund, joining a herd of Wall Street traders who left jobs at large investment banks to reap larger riches by running their own hedge funds.At its peak, the fund employed 80 people in its New York and London offices.That trend has become all the more acute over the last two years as senior executives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have raised large sums to run their own funds.But as funds have proliferated, the soaring returns common at the beginning of the decade have been harder to come by, prompting investors to become all the more fickle about sticking with middling funds.In their letter, the two men said that ""continuing redemptions have triggered a spiral of portfolio liquidations"" that offset other areas of positive portfolio performance, a common occurrence when a hedge fund has to cope with a wave of investor defections.Archeus should have no trouble returning investor money. In the letter, the two men said the fund’s remaining assets were held in ""highly liquid positions,"" which they said would make for an orderly redemption process.""For all the statistics and data, we believe that, ultimately, the hedge fund universe is very much about people,"" they wrote. ""In this regard, we are glad to know you.""'"
"'06-10-31,'0','WHEN I talk about my work, I have a tendency to sound detached and clinical about it. Some even say that our unofficial motto at the Population Council should be, “We make sex boring.”But that’s not true when I travel.I recently attended the International AIDS Conference in Toronto, where people hand out condoms at virtually every booth. The free prophylactics come in all conceivable shapes, sizes and colors.For example, the delegation from Brazil offered specially made necklaces with condoms inside. There were condoms glued to fabric and worn as decorative pins. There were dresses made of condoms. Mexico City, where the next AIDS conference will be held, even had condom mascots in sombreros greeting visitors.By the final day of the event, everyone was doling condoms out by the handful because they didn’t want to ship them back.Needless to say, I collected a lot of condoms.You might ask yourself: What would a nice girl like me do with all those condoms? Well, I would share them with my staff back in New York, of course. I also saved a few for my friends and family members.

"'06-10-31,'0','Verizon Communications said yesterday that its earnings grew 2.8 percent in the third quarter, driven largely by its mobile phone company, Verizon Wireless, which overtook Cingular Wireless as the nation’s largest mobile phone carrier ranked by revenue.Verizon earned $1.92 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with $1.87 billion, or 67 cents, in the third quarter last year. Sales reached $23.3 billion, a 26 percent increase compared with the period in 2005, before the company absorbed the long-distance carrier MCI last January.Despite the growth, Verizon’s shares fell $1.19, or 3.1 percent, to $37.65 yesterday as investors focused on a decline in the company’s local phone lines and on the effect of its new fiber optic network on profits.Verizon said the fiber network, which will cost about $20 billion to build, would reduce 2006 profit by 31 cents to 32 cents a share, instead of the 28 cents to 30 cents a share the company had forecast earlier.Still, Verizon’s shares have risen 24 percent this year, mainly because of industry-leading growth at Verizon Wireless and optimism that the fiber network, which provides phone, broadband and television services over one line, will help Verizon fight cable providers and other rivals getting into the phone business.'"
"'06-10-31,'0','“Our marketing model is evolving pretty quickly,” Mr. Roth said. “It’s fair to say we’ve gone deeper into pushing content into the world consumers are already living in.”The decision by Nike to add so many unconventional elements to its ad buys is occurring amid increasing interest among major marketers in exploring the brave world of new media. For example, the Dove line of products sold by Unilever is sponsoring a video clip, “Dove Evolution,” that appears not on TV, but on YouTube.American Express is offering fans of the TV series “Prison Break” a chance to watch a preview of the season-premiere episode on a Web site, fox.com/prisonbreak. And Ford Motor is trying to burnish its tarnished brand image through a series of articles, blogs and films available only on a Web site, fordboldmoves.com.“There’s still a little fear out there about shifting away from the traditional marketing tactics,” said Doug Scott, who recently joined the North American operations of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, as executive director for branded content and entertainment.Even so, Mr. Scott said, more advertisers “are interested in how to build this content and own it, entering into a dialogue with consumers and marketing in a more direct way.”Marketers like Nike, which aim a preponderance of product pitches at younger consumers, are particularly eager to rewrite their media plans to include more new-media outlets.“The younger consumer digests media in so many different ways,” Mr. Roth said. “It presents more opportunities, but it’s also a challenge because you can’t drive them to any one channel.“So we use TV now as a catalyst to extend a larger idea into different areas.”That is the idea behind having the new shoe be the sole sponsor of the 6 o’clock episode of “SportsCenter” tomorrow night. Between the commercials will be segments featuring Mr. James, in makeup and costume, being interviewed as two of the characters he plays in the spots: an old-school version of himself called Wise and the entrepreneurial side, known as Business.“We hear every day from advertisers, ‘Bring me ideas I haven’t heard before that will help me break through,’ ” said Ed Erhardt, president at ESPN/ABC Sports customer marketing and sales, part of the ESPN unit of the Walt Disney Company.To assist the shoe spots in their quest to be noticed, ESPN is reducing the commercial load during the hourlong episode of “SportsCenter” to about 10 minutes from the typical 15 minutes, Mr. Erhardt said. The cutback is being made through steps that will include eliminating network promotions, he added.Sean R. H. Bratches, executive vice president for sales and marketing at ESPN, said it was coincidental that Nike, the first sole sponsor of an episode of “SportsCenter,” uses the same ad agency as the network. The agency is Wieden & Kennedy, which handles Nike from its flagship Portland, Ore., office and ESPN from its New York office.Wieden & Kennedy is creating the television and outdoor elements of the campaign. Deep Focus, an interactive agency based in Brooklyn, is handling the digital aspects.Nike spent just under $1 million last fall for ads in major media to introduce the Air Zoom LeBron III, according to data from Nielsen Monitor-Plus, part of the Nielsen Media Research unit of VNU. The budget for the LeBron IV is being estimated at two to three times that.The online saturation ads for the LeBrons, in what are called home-page takeovers, will appear on Web sites that include — in addition to espn.com and mtv.com — Bet.com, CBSSportsLine.com, LebronJames.com, nba.com and nikebasketball.com. Those ads are scheduled to start appearing today. The DVDs, with about 15 minutes of content, are to be distributed inside the November issue of Slam magazine, which will also carry print ads for the sneakers. The magazine’s Web site, slam.com, ran teaser spots last week to whet reader appetites for the full campaign; other Web sites carrying the teasers included youtube.com.The pop-up store is planned to remain open for a week, beginning on Nov. 11. It will be located at 476 Broome Street in SoHo, between Greene and Wooster Streets. The store will sell James apparel along with limited-edition versions of the new shoe.The neon sign, at Seventh Avenue and 34th Street, is scheduled to be activated on Nov. 12, the day before Mr. LeBron and his team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, play the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. The sign’s image of an animated Mr. James in perpetual dunk mode is meant to evoke classic neon billboards in locations like Times Square and Las Vegas.Mr. Roth of Nike said it was important in producing a campaign as varied as this to “try to tell different parts of the same story in different ways” in the different media outlets.“We can reach consumers 24/7,” Mr. Roth said, “but we don’t want to be such a presence in our consumers’ lives to the point it becomes an annoyance.”At ESPN, Mr. Erhardt said, now that the ice has been broken in offering episodes of “SportsCenter” to single sponsors, the intent is “to do it on a limited basis, to keep it special.” That would be “probably every five or six weeks,” he estimated.'"
"'06-10-31,'0','Martin N. Bandier, who rose to become one of the music industry’s most influential executives while building the music-publishing unit of the EMI Group into a powerhouse, said yesterday that he would resign as chairman one year earlier than planned.Under Mr. Bandier, EMI emerged as the biggest player in the business through acquisitions of song catalogs like Jobete, which contains hits from Motown artists, and through the licensing of songs for film, television and other media.Mr. Bandier has been contemplating his eventual exit from the company since at least early last year, when EMI announced a succession plan in which he was to leave as chairman of the publishing unit in 2008 and remain a consultant to the company for three years. Instead, Mr. Bandier said, he will leave in about six months.His decision to depart even earlier may have arisen partly because he was disappointed over the unraveling of merger talks between EMI and a rival, the Warner Music Group, which would have resulted in a new role for him, according to executives briefed on his affairs. Recently, Mr. Bandier has held talks with a variety of potential backers for a new publishing venture, these executives said.EMI, which is based in London, is expected to be eclipsed as the biggest player in music publishing if regulators approve Vivendi’s proposed $2 billion purchase of the BMG publishing unit of Bertelsmann.'"
"'06-10-31,'0','Using questionnaires, Italian researchers have found some evidence of an association between kidney cancer and the consumption of large amounts of bread, although the significance of the finding remains unclear.The scientists used the responses to determine the eating habits of 767 men and women with kidney cancer who had been admitted to hospitals in Italy. They compared them to 1,534 people free of the disease who were admitted for other reasons. The subjects ranged in age from 24 to 79, with an average age of 62. The report appears online in The International Journal of Cancer.The researchers found that the one-fifth of patients who consumed the most bread — 12 ounces or more a day — were almost twice as likely to suffer from kidney cancer as those who consumed 31/2 ounces or less.Those who ate the most pasta (18 ounces or more) were almost one-third more likely to have kidney cancer than those who ate 8 ounces or less.“This is only one study,” said Dr. Cristina Bosetti, a co-author of the paper and an epidemiologist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, “and it has to be confirmed by other investigations.”The authors also acknowledged that people diagnosed with cancer may recall their dietary habits differently from other people and that the interviewers knew which patients had kidney cancer and which did not.'"
"'06-10-31,'0','The president of the university, Mary Sue Coleman, an opponent of the proposition, said its reach could extend into K to 12 education.“It would make it illegal to have our program targeting girls in junior high school, and having them come to campus to learn about science and engineering,” Ms. Coleman said. “I’m a woman scientist, and I know how fragile our gains are.”Such arguments have resonance in Ann Arbor, where the Democratic headquarters is doing a brisk business in “No on 2” yard signs.“We need to keep affirmative action because it’s still not a level playing field for women or minorities,” said Gena Morris, who is black, an event planner who volunteers at Democratic headquarters.Susan Greenberg, a widow whose husband was a University of Michigan professor, took home a yard sign recently, saying, “It’s probably the most important thing on the ballot.”Just 20 miles north of the liberal university enclave, in Brighton, there is less familiarity with the proposition but more opposition to affirmative action.“I don’t know a lot about Proposition 2, but I do know a neighbor kid, a good kid, a local kid with a 3.7-3.8 average, who didn’t get into the university and he should have,” said Vicki Smith, who is white, shopping one afternoon at Kohls department store. “I do think there’s something wrong with their admissions.”Pollsters, in fact, say the Nov. 7 results may well turn on whether the measure is seen primarily as a race issue.“If voters think about it as being about race, black and white, support goes up,” said Ed Sarpolus, vice president of EPIC-MRA, a polling firm in Lansing. “So the opponents are trying to show that it’s not just race, that it would hurt women, hurt Michigan’s economy, and they’re having some success with that.”Though most of the debate on the proposition has been about race and college admissions — four out of five Michigan residents are white — the ballot initiative is also playing out against the state’s somber economic picture of high unemployment, high migration of young people and a wrenching transition away from manufacturing.Opposition to Proposition 2 is strongest in majority-black Detroit and a few liberal strongholds like Ann Arbor. Like California’s Proposition 209, which passed in 1996, Proposition 2 has been backed by Ward Connerly, a wealthy black Republican who is a former University of California regent. If Mr. Connerly is successful in Michigan, and maybe even if he is not, he is likely to carry the fight to other states.“When my toes turn up, that’s when I’ll stop fighting this,” said Mr. Connerly, who has provided nearly $500,000 for the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, the group Ms. Gratz leads. “As John F. Kennedy said,” he continued, “race has no place in public life.”As of Oct. 20, the group had raised $1.4 million and spent $782,000.Ms. Gratz, who grew up in a working-class suburb of Detroit, graduated among the top 15 in a high school class of about 300. But she only made the wait list for the Ann Arbor campus of the University of Michigan and never returned the postcard that would have kept her on the list for available spaces.She graduated from the University of Michigan-Dearborn with a math degree and became a product manager at a technology company. She also pursued the suit against the university. She called Mr. Connerly soon after the Supreme Court ruled on her case, and they began working on the Michigan proposition. It has been her full-time job for three years.Opposition to the measure is led by One United Michigan, an unusually broad coalition that includes Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, and her Republican challenger, Dick DeVos, as well as unions, churches, businesses and higher education and civil rights groups. It has raised and spent $3.3 million.“We have the A.C.L.U. sitting with the Michigan Catholic Conference on the steering committee, which is something you don’t see very often, “ said David Waymire, a coalition spokesman. “There isn’t a big Michigan voice on the other side. But it’s tough. Two years ago, the initial polling found more than two-thirds supported the proposition. The miracle is that we’ve gotten it into a winnable range.”Coalition members said Proposition 2 would hamper employers’ efforts to diversify their work forces. They said it would also force some local governments to eliminate outreach and set-aside programs for minority contractors and would diminish the already-meager representation of black and Hispanic students at the flagship university here.“It would be like slamming a door on progress,” Ms. Coleman said. “I will do everything that’s legal to help us attract minority students. But it’s already having a chilling effect.”This year, the freshman class at the Ann Arbor campus has 330 blacks, or 6.4 percent, down from the high of 499 in 2001, and from 350 in the year after the Supreme Court case, when a new admissions process was adopted. Over all, blacks make up 7.2 percent of the undergraduates. But there are other ways to look at the numbers.The Center for Equal Opportunity in Virginia, which supports the proposition, released an analysis of University of Michigan data finding that black applicants who were accepted by the university had lower grades and SAT scores than white applicants who were admitted. The median SAT for black students who were admitted was 1160 in 2005, it said, compared with 1350 for whites.The center said the university now weighed race and ethnicity even more heavily than before the Supreme Court ruling.The university disagrees. “Their analysis is flat-out wrong and carefully calculated to achieve a political outcome,” said Julie Peterson, a university spokeswoman.She said that the center overlooked factors added to the admissions process after the ruling, like recommendations, essays and extracurricular activities, and that the data on which the center based its conclusions did not include all applicants.Ms. Peterson and others at the university emphasized that because there were so many white applicants and so few blacks, an end to affirmative action would not substantially increase white students’ odds of admission. In their book, “The Shape of the River,” Derek C. Bok and William G. Bowen estimated that if selective universities had race-blind admissions, the probability of white students’ admission would rise only slightly — to 26.5 percent from 25 percent — while black students’ admissions would decline by half.Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said the proposition would help determine the future of affirmative action.“Michigan is ground zero in the national debate on the meaning of equal opportunity,” Mr. Henderson said. “It’s really important that we stop this, before Ward Connerly takes the battle to other states.”But in many quarters here, public support remained strong, which Ms. Gratz said indicated just how much Michigan’s power brokers were out of touch with voters.“The entire elite establishment is all lined up on the other side of this issue,” Ms. Gratz said, “but the mainstream, normal, everyday people who go to work every day think their husbands, their wives, their kids, should be treated equally by our government, and should not be judged on race or sex.”'"
"'06-10-31,'0','“It is not in the public interest to spend federal dollars pursuing claims that have little or no chance of success,” the agency said. “M.M.S. lost a contested and controversial issue” before the appeals board. “Had we simply wanted to capitulate to ‘big oil,’ the agency would not have issued the order in the first place.”Chevron said in a written statement that it “endeavors to calculate and pay its oil and gas royalties correctly,” and it said that the Interior Department had agreed.The agency notified Chevron of its decision in a confidential letter on Aug. 3, which The New York Times obtained recently under the Freedom of Information Act.The reversal in the case, which involves Chevron’s accounting of natural gas sales to a company it partly owned, has renewed criticism that the Bush administration is reluctant to confront oil and gas companies and is lax in collecting royalties.“The government is giving up without a fight,” said Richard T. Dorman, a lawyer representing private citizens suing Chevron over its federal royalty payments. “If this decision is left standing, it would result in the loss of tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars in royalties owed by other companies.”In return for the right to drill on federal lands and in federal waters, energy companies are required to pay the government a share of their proceeds. Last year, businesses producing natural gas paid $5.15 billion in government royalties.But the Bush administration has come under fire on Capitol Hill for its record on collecting payments. While the Interior Department has sweetened incentives for exploration and pushed to open wilderness areas for drilling, it has also cut back on full-scale audits of companies intended to make sure they are paying their full share.Administration officials knew that dozens of companies had incorrectly claimed exemptions from royalties since 2003, but they waited until December 2005 to send letters demanding about $500 million in repayments.In February, the Interior Department acknowledged that oil companies could escape more than $7 billion in payments because of mistakes in leases signed in the 1990s. Top officials are trying to renegotiate those deals, but some Republicans and Democrats have complained that the administration is dragging its feet.In addition, four government auditors last month publicly accused the Interior Department of blocking their efforts to recover more than $30 million from the Shell Oil Corporation, the Kerr-McGee Corporation and other major companies.“This latest revelation proves that the Bush administration is incapable of preventing big oil companies from cheating taxpayers,” said Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, a senior Democrat on the House Committee on Resources. “The public has been systematically fleeced out of royalties that these companies owe for the privilege of drilling for oil and gas on lands belonging to all of us.”The Chevron case offers a glimpse into what is normally a secretive process. To protect what energy companies consider proprietary information, the Interior Department does not announce that it is accusing companies of underpaying royalties nor does it announce its settlements in these disputes. The government also does not disclose how much money each company pays in royalties.In theory, companies are required to pay the government a royalty of 12 percent to 16 percent of their sales. In practice, the definition of sales is as convoluted as a Rubik’s Cube.In the Chevron case, auditors in the Minerals Management Service were addressing an issue that had bedeviled royalty enforcement for decades: How does the government make sure it gets its due when companies sell natural gas to businesses they partly own?In 1996, Chevron sold its holdings in more than 50 processing plants to Dynegy in exchange for a 26 percent stake in the natural gas company, which is based in Houston. For the next seven years, Chevron sold virtually all its domestic natural gas to Dynegy for processing.In their original accusations, dating to 2001, the auditors asserted that Chevron had understated sales, and hence its royalty obligations, by inflating costs for processing gas at Dynegy.Companies are allowed to deduct processing costs from their sales revenues when they calculate their royalty obligations. Processing involves separating water and a variety of liquid fuels like propane from raw natural gas. The auditors’ accusations were not unique. State officials in New Mexico challenged Chevron over the same issue — “non-arms-length” deals, as regulators call them — and Chevron agreed to pay $10.4 million in extra royalties without admitting wrongdoing. Private property owners who leased land to Chevron sued over the same issue in Oklahoma, and the company paid $60 million last year to settle out of court.“The natural gas processing business lends itself almost uniquely to chicanery,” said Spencer Hosie, a lawyer who has represented the states of Louisiana and Alaska in several court fights over oil and gas royalties. “It is a complicated and opaque business, and there are many opportunities to shade judgments and numbers.”From 2001 to 2003, after detailed audits of several Chevron leases, the Interior Department said the company was reducing its “sales value” by exaggerating processing costs at six of Dynegy’s many plants. At one plant, auditors estimated Chevron had claimed five times the actual costs.At first glance, the suspected underpayments seemed trivial: about $6 million out of hundreds of millions in royalties. But the audits were limited to only a handful of plants. Had the Interior Department pressed its claims successfully, it could have recovered money tied to all the other plants, and for other years.Chevron paid the $6 million but appealed. The file in that case now runs more than 900 pages, most of it still off-limits to the public.Mr. Hosie, who represented Louisiana in a lawsuit that led to a $100 million verdict against Chevron over underpaid oil royalties, expressed surprise at the federal government’s decision in the natural gas case.“Is it even remotely likely that oil companies systematically underpay private royalty owners and state governments, but pay the federal government perfectly properly?” Mr. Hosie asked. “Isn’t it more likely they are underpaying everybody?”A Chevron spokesman, Donald Campbell, said laws regulating state and private leases often differed significantly from those of the federal government. “The rules governing valuation vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,” Mr. Campbell said in a statement.Chevron argued that New Mexico’s rules presumed that a deal was “not at arms length” — and that costs had to be calculated differently — if one company owned 10 percent to 50 percent of the other. The federal regulations, Chevron said, required auditors to consider additional factors before making such a determination. Because of a backlog, the appeals board had not considered Chevron’s appeal when Interior Department officials decided they could not win. But if the appeals board had overruled the auditors, federal regulations would have allowed the interior secretary to let a federal court decide the issue.In their letter to Chevron, department officials did not say the underlying facts had changed. Rather, they noted that the agency’s Board of Land Appeals had rejected similar accusations about non-arm’s-length agreements involving two other companies, Vastar Resources and Southern Companies.The appeals board ruled in 2005 that the Minerals Management Service had failed to show that Vastar had any real control over a partnership it had formed with Southern to sell its gas. The board said Vastar had provided “uncontroverted evidence” that the sales prices had been negotiated at arm’s length between companies with “opposing economic interests.”But the Chevron case differed in several important ways.The government never audited Vastar in reaching its conclusions and had provided a largely theoretical opinion when the company asked for guidance. By contrast, auditors had scrutinized Chevron, which is based in San Ramon, Calif., and Dynegy and backed their arguments with supporting data.Chevron’s ties with Dynegy also appeared to be closer than those between the other companies. Chevron described Dynegy as an affiliate in some reports to shareholders. Chevron was also Dynegy’s biggest supplier of raw natural gas, its biggest customer for gas processing and one of its biggest for processing byproducts like propane.Administration officials said they had “carefully reviewed” similarities and differences between the cases, but offered little elaboration.“We recognize that other parties may assert various arguments regarding the relationship between the Vastar and Chevron situations,” the Minerals Management Service said in its written response to questions, “but the agency’s evaluation and deliberative processes are privileged.”John Bemis, the assistant commissioner for gas and minerals in New Mexico, said his state was challenging a growing number of such alliances. In addition to the $10.4 million royalty settlement with Chevron, New Mexico persuaded ConocoPhillips to settle a similar case in August for $9.5 million and is negotiating with BP in a third case.Interior Department officials have shown little interest in evidence from either New Mexico’s experience or a current court fight with Chevron over federal royalties.On July 11, three weeks before the department dropped its case against Chevron, Mr. Dorman and other lawyers involved in a Texas lawsuit against Chevron wrote to Interior Department officials. The lawyers, who represent a whistle-blower seeking to recover money for the federal government, said they were suing Chevron over the same issues the department had raised.“All we were saying was that they should wait to see what evidence we turned up, and that we would gladly share everything we had with them,” Mr. Dorman said. His firm faxed a letter to the policy appeals division. Getting no response, the lawyers sent a copy by U.P.S. Six days later, it was returned. The reason, according to the U.P.S. label: “Receiver did not want, refused delivery.”The agency confirmed in a statement that it knew of the lawyers’ case. Asked why it refused to accept their letter, the Minerals Management Service said it could not comment “because these matters are the subject of pending litigation.”'"
