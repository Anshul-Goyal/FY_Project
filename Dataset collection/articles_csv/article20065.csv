"'06-05-01,'0','Mr. Morales warned that companies that rejected the decree would have to leave Bolivia.He said all the companies must turn their production over to the state's Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos, which was privatized in 1996 and 1997, it reported.Foreign companies with interests in Bolivia also include British Petroleum, and Total of France. The country likely to be affected the most is Brazil, which is the biggest importer of Bolivian gas, and has a significant investment in Bolivia through Petrobras.The State Department official said that he did not have a preliminary assessment of the impact the new move would have on United States trade and its relations with Bolivia. The United States gets most of its gas from domestic sources, Canada and Mexico.The announcement was made on the May 1 national holiday in Bolivia.""We are trying to get a copy of the proposal and we will discuss it with our Bolivian counterparts and people at the foreign ministry,"" said a State Department official. ""The embassy plans to consult with affected U.S. companies.""A spokesman for BP in London, Robert Wine, said BP has a very small interest in Bolivia as a partner in a joint venture that produces gas equivalent to 15,000 barrels of oil, a small amount compared to BP's 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.Asked how the decision might change BP's interests, Mr. Wine said ""We have not seen the detail but I am sure our joint venture partners will be analyzing it. Our partners who are the operators of activities there will be digesting today's news.""The announcement did not come as a surprise.Mr. Wine noted that there had been political turmoil in Bolivia with public protests over the industry. ""The change is not unexpected, but as far as I am aware we were not expecting total nationalization,"" he said.Mr. Morales is the country's first indigenous president. Since he was elected in a landslide on Dec. 18, he has emphasized the message that he will lay the groundwork for an economic and political transformation that he says will give voice to the poor, indigenous majority that fueled his campaign.There have been other measures affecting the sector since Mr. Morales became president.Last month, moving on a complaint filed by leftist groups, Attorney General Pedro Gareca charged three former presidents and eight former energy ministers with violating the Constitution in signing dozens of contracts with foreign energy companies over the last decade without Congress's approval, Bolivian radio reported, according to Reuters.The contracts, which included oil companies in Brazil, France and Spain, attracted billions of dollars in investments, but angered groups that accused the firms of plundering Bolivia's resources.The government is renegotiating contracts that will cost the companies much more in taxes and royalties.In January, just after he was inaugurated, Mr. Morales appointed Andrés Solíz Rada, a Marxist journalist and former senator, to oversee Bolivia's energy policy.As president-elect, Mr. Morales met with President Hu Jintao of China in Beijing and called China an ""ideological ally,"" a day after he invited it to develop Bolivia's vast gas reserves.'"
"'06-05-01,'0','Spanish officials said they did not expect the lifting of restrictions to have a direct impact on immigration flows to Spain, which became a member of the E.U. in 1986.""When Spain joined the E.U., eliminating barriers did not cause Spanish workers to leave like many people had warned,"" said a senior aide to Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak publicly about government business. ""We suspect it will be the same with the countries from the east.""By lifting the restrictions on workers from Eastern Europe, the government is hoping to send a message that Spain is receptive to foreigners and is an attractive place for immigrants to work, Spanish officials say. The government wants to portray the country as a tolerant and open society where immigrants are not just welcome but needed to fill the gaps created by an aging workforce and an expanding economy.""We never said that the restrictions were necessary, but some important members of the E.U. wanted them, so we said we would support them,"" the Zapatero aide said. ""Spain knows it is contradictory to the spirit of the E.U. to have restrictions on workers and people.""Conscious of the Spanish economy's reliance on foreign labor, Mr. Zapatero, a member of the center-left Socialist Party, offered amnesty in 2005 to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who had been working in Spain.The move was a reflection of the degree to which a decade's worth of robust economic growth had transformed Spain from a country that primarily exported workers to one that desperately needed to bring them in.At about 9 percent, the unemployment rate is still relatively high, despite dropping steeply since the mid-1990s. But there are still many jobs, particularly in fields like construction or information technology, that Spanish workers are either unwilling or unqualified to do.Moreover, Spain's impressive economic performance is coupled with some of the lowest birth rates in Europe, meaning companies will have trouble finding replacements for retiring workers without turning to immigrant labor.For the past five years, Spain has been drawing about 500,000 immigrants per year, he said.The most dramatic images of immigrants clamoring to get into Spain have occurred on the coast of Morocco, where Spanish troops and patrol boats struggle to keep African immigrants from illegally reaching Spain by raft or by hopping the fences that separate the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla from Moroccan territory.Most illegal immigrants, however, enter Spain legally but then overstay their tourist visas, government officials say.Immigration officials estimate that Spain has a total of about 4 million illegal and legal immigrants, or nearly 10 percent of its 44 million people. That is a sharp rise from only 10 years ago, when they made up perhaps two or three percent of the population.'"
"'06-05-01,'0','Microsoft replies that Google is misreading its intentions and actions. It says the default settings in the browser, Internet Explorer 7, are easy to change. And it says the product was designed with consumers and many partners in mind — even though it might not be to the liking of Google, the leading search engine.""Whatever behavior happened in the past, the guiding principle we had is that the user is in control,"" said Dean Hachamovitch, general manager of the Internet Explorer group.Companies often talk with antitrust officials, and the talks do not imply that an investigation is imminent. But they do indicate that Google is pursuing every option in its escalating rivalry with Microsoft, which has already led to some public battles.Last December, Google outbid Microsoft to remain the primary search service on America Online, paying $1 billion and taking a 5 percent stake in AOL. Last year, Microsoft sued Google to stop a star computer scientist and manager at Microsoft, Kai-Fu Lee, from working on search technology at Google. The suit was settled, and Mr. Lee runs Google's operations in China.The browser that set off the latest dispute has been in development for some time, but Microsoft first made it available to the public for downloading last week in a test version. It is the first new release of Microsoft's browser in five years. A final version is expected to be released this summer and will be included in Microsoft's new operating system, Windows Vista, which is scheduled for release next January.The focus of Google's concern is a slender box in the corner of the browser window that allows users to start a search directly instead of first going to the Web site of a search engine like Google, Yahoo or MSN. Typing a query and hitting ""Enter"" immediately brings up a page of results from a designated search engine.That slice of on-screen real estate has the potential to be enormously valuable, and Microsoft is the landlord. Internet Explorer 7 is the first Microsoft browser to have a built-in search box, while other browsers like Firefox, Opera and Safari have had them for some time. Google estimates that the boxes, when available, are the starting point for 30 to 50 percent of a user's searches, making them a crucial gateway to the lucrative and fast-growing market for advertisements that appear next to search results.Microsoft has lost some ground in the browser market in the last year, mainly to Firefox, which is a Google ally. But Microsoft still holds more than 80 percent of the market. And Internet Explorer 7 is expected to be extremely popular because it is an improvement over Microsoft's previous browser, and because Microsoft will promote downloads of it and include it in Windows Vista.That gives Microsoft the potential to use the browser to steer substantial traffic, and business, to MSN and away from rivals. MSN handled 11 percent of searches in the United States in March, down slightly from a year earlier, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings, a market research firm. That put it well behind Google, which had a 49 percent share, and Yahoo, with 22 percent.Microsoft insists it has no intention of deploying its browser as a weapon in the search wars. But Google suspects otherwise.In meetings beginning last year, Google told Microsoft of its objections to the company's plans to set MSN as the default search engine in Internet Explorer 7, according to Ms. Mayer of Google. Yahoo raised similar objections in a meeting with Microsoft last year, according to a Yahoo employee who was briefed on the conversation. Yahoo declined to comment last week beyond a statement: ""We would be concerned about any company's attempts to limit user choice or change user preferences without their knowledge, and believe others would share that concern.""With its objections unresolved, Google took the matter to antitrust authorities in Europe and the United States during the last month. It is not clear what, if anything, will come of the talks or how far Google is willing to push the issue.In Europe, where Microsoft is challenging an antitrust decision against the company for its past behavior, the European Commission has already made inquiries about Microsoft's plans for Vista. Though it is now distributing Internet Explorer 7 separately, Microsoft has long maintained that its browser is part of its Windows operating system.Google has informed the European antitrust authorities of its worry that ""Microsoft's approach to setting search defaults in Internet Explorer 7 benefits Microsoft while taking away choice from users,"" said Steve Langdon, a spokesman for Google.Google would not say specifically what it has discussed with American antitrust officials. ""We have spoken to the Justice Department generally about our business and the importance of preserving competition in the search market,"" Mr. Langdon said.The best way to handle the search box, Google asserts, would be to give users a choice when they first start up Internet Explorer 7. It says that could be done by asking the user to either type in the name of their favorite search engine or choose from a handful of the most popular services, using a simple drop-down menu next to the search box.The Firefox and Opera browsers come with Google set as the default, but Ms. Mayer said Google would support unfettered choice on those as well.Microsoft replies that giving users an open-ended choice could add complexity and confusion to the browser set-up process, while offering a few options would be arbitrarily limiting.Instead, those wanting to pick a new search-box option in the new browser need to click through a menu with options like ""Get Search Providers,"" which links to a Web page with six search engines including Google and 16 ""topic search"" sites, from Amazon to MTV to Wal-Mart.Mr. Hachamovitch, who led Microsoft's browser team, said MSN was not always the default search in Internet Explorer 7. When downloaded, the new browser inherits the settings from the old Microsoft browser, version 6. But the search default in that program was based on a feature called AutoSearch that Google says was not widely used.Mr. Hachamovitch said Microsoft's user research and early reviews indicate that it is easy to change the default setting. ""People seem to be O.K. with what we're doing,"" he said.Google counters that claim with a study it sponsored that was conducted by Tec-Ed, a research firm. It found that only a third of users could master the four-click process to change the default.Whether Microsoft's treatment of the search box will have an impact on the search market is uncertain. From an antitrust perspective, harm to competition is the litmus test, not just swinging a sharp elbow or two. There are many ways people get to search engines other than through a search box — for example, by typing google.com in the browser or making it their home page.""Assume that everything Google says is true; the question then is whether Microsoft's conduct is really going to have a serious effect on Google,"" said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. ""Obviously, Google thinks that it will.""Google is now a rich, powerful company in its own right, far larger than the browser pioneer Netscape Communications was when Microsoft set out to dominate the market it had created in the 1990's. In 2001, after a lengthy trial, a federal appeals court held that Microsoft had repeatedly violated antitrust laws as it tried to stifle the challenge from Netscape. Later, Microsoft reached a settlement with the Justice Department that freed personal computer makers from some restrictions Microsoft had placed on their use of software and services that compete with its own products.When Internet Explorer 7 begins to be loaded on new machines next year, computer makers like Dell and Hewlett-Packard will be free to determine what search engines and other sites they feature in the browser's Web guide and search box.That promises to be valuable screen real estate indeed, especially the coveted spot as the preferred search engine, which the computer makers are likely to sell to the highest bidder. Google and Yahoo have deep pockets, but no one can match Microsoft's spending power. ""People will be bidding aggressively to get in that space,"" said Mr. Hachamovitch of Microsoft. ""And that's a good thing.""'"

Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serbs' wartime military commander, expired Sunday with no sign of him, threatening the nation's efforts to join the European bloc.Still, Serbian officials promised that they would keep hunting for General Mladic, who has been indicted by the United Nations court at The Hague. He is charged in the killings of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica in 1995. It was Europe's worst massacre since World War II.If General Mladic is not delivered to the court, Serbia faces the prospect of a suspension of its talks with the 25-nation European Union.""It is very possible the talks will be suspended,"" Rasim Ljajic, the Serbian official responsible for coordinating efforts with the United Nations tribunal, was quoted as saying in the newspaper Blic.He said he hoped any suspension would be temporary, and he added that his government would ""continue cooperating"" with the tribunal and eventually capture General Mladic.'"

"'06-05-01,'0','Saturday's column gave a critical deal from the last quarter of the 64-board Vanderbilt semifinal match between teams captained by Rita Shugart of Pebble Beach, Calif., and Roy Welland of New York during the Spring North American Championships in Dallas last month. On Board 52, for the Welland team, Lew Stansby of Castro Valley, Calif., had opened one spade, promising at least five cards in the suit, with the A-K-Q-J alone. This had worked well, his partner, Chip Martel of Davis, Calif., having five-card support. They bid to a good six-spade contract that was missed in the other room after a one-diamond opening. Welland gained 15 international match points to reduce the deficit to 8 imps: 128-120.Over the next nine boards, Welland moved 2 imps closer, the score being 142-136 to Shugart. The diagramed deal was No. 62.At the other table, South passed as dealer. Martel (West) opened one heart, Stansby (East) responded one spade, and West raised to two spades. (In their style, this raise is usually made with only three-card support.) East rebid three clubs, which West treated as a game-try, asking for help in clubs. He continued with three no-trump, warning of three weak spades and showing his diamond strength. This did not excite East, who settled for four spades. (If he had continued with four clubs, West would have bid four hearts to express slam suitability, show his ace and deny the diamond ace, and they might have reached the reasonable slam.)Against four spades, South led his singleton club. Declarer won all 13 tricks by squeezing South in the red suits. At Trick 11, dummy (West) had the heart ace-nine and diamond king. Declarer held the heart queen-seven and a trump. South retained the heart king-jack and diamond ace but had no safe discard on the final spade.The auction in the first room is given, where Cezary Balicki (South) from Poland opened two hearts, showing a weak two-suiter with hearts and another suit. Adam Zmudzinski (North) responded two spades, which was pass-or-correct. South would pass if his second suit were spades, or show his minor. This gave East, Boye Brogeland from Norway, a problem. He was playing in an unfamiliar partnership with Shugart. Probably he should have jumped straight to four spades, it being so unlikely that South had spades. But East passed. After South showed his diamonds, North would have done best to bid a simple five diamonds, which would have left East in an awkward position. Instead, North psyched, rebidding three no-trump. This gave East a second chance to bid four spades. Instead, he made a penalty double, showing a decent hand with spade values. Now North ran to five diamonds, which West should have doubled, but she passed it out. Five diamonds went down four, declarer losing two spades, one heart, two diamonds and one club.Plus 510 and minus 200 gave the Welland team 7 imps and the lead by one. Another 4 were added on the last deal, Welland being victorious by 5: 147-142. But if East had bid four spades and West had competed to five spades over five diamonds, the board would have been flat or Shugart would have lost one imp, and her team would have won by 2 or one. And if West had doubled five diamonds, collecting 800, her team would have gained 7 imps and won by 9. It was that close.'"
"'06-05-01,'0','""Once the product was pulled, I had to work as fast as possible to develop new partnerships, which eventually led to the creation of our own product, which is now the focus of our business,"" Mr. Katz said. Today, he said, he has a strong customer base and seven employees, including three in Ukraine, Brazil and Russia. ""Being adaptable was crucial to the survival of the business, and there were very tough lessons learned in this process.""Four years ago, he had angry customers, ""huge doubts and a job offer,"" he said, but decided: ""No way. I can't doubt any more. Focus on your own vision. If it's good and you can execute, you're going to get customers."" He succeeded and credits it to adapting to the situation. ""Always have a backup plan,"" he said. ""Have a diversification strategy.""Asked about Mr. Katz's comments, Barbara Weltman, a lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., who specializes in small business, said, ""Absolutely right.""Ms. Weltman, who publishes an online newsletter, Big Ideas for Small Business, and is a co-author with Jerry Silberman of ""Small Business Survival Book,"" said that businesses must be adaptable and have a backup plan to survive. ""A lot of small businesses have one prime customer,"" she said. ""Continually prospect for new customers. Don't rely on one. Be diversified — the same as you would for your stock portfolio.""Dr. Duffy Spencer, a social psychologist in Westbury, N.Y., who acts as a business coach and consultant, said, ""Healthy people change when circumstances change."" She added, ""An entrepreneur is in the business of creation and re-creation — how have things changed, and can I go along with these changes?""When it comes to healthy people, whether they are looking at their own lives or their business lives, it's the situation itself that rules,"" Dr. Spencer said. The proper focus is not on what is ""supposed to be, but what that particular situation requires.""Another lesson that Mr. Katz said he learned at that time was ""that my contract was not that strong"" because it had only a 60-day termination for convenience clause. ""That meant that all I really had was a 60-day contract,"" he said. The lessons are be sure you know what your contract says and negotiate the best deal you can.After he lost the Romanian antivirus product, Mr. Katz said he decided to focus on keeping customers who were using Mac computers running the relatively new OSX operating system. (Mac customers didn't have the range of choices for antivirus products, he said, compared with the others.) Subsequently, Mr. Katz developed an integrated service for business servers, including antivirus, antispam and antiphising protection.""It is very important to think through ideas,"" he said. ""Why is the customer going to come? Who is the customer? Why buy from me?""Dr. Spencer agreed, citing the importance of self-awareness. ""In a business context it means, 'What is it I have to offer today?' "" she said. ""And what is it that other people need, and how can I create that where I am meeting my needs and their needs?""As important as the I.B.M. deal is for Mr. Katz, he first spent several years developing a solid customer base with small businesses before talking to any big businesses. ""The big guys can put you out of business,"" he said. When he felt his business was ready, he did the I.B.M. negotiations himself, rather than involving his employees. ""Big businesses like meetings,"" he said. ""Having people chasing too much speculative business will kill you.""Another insight of his is, ""You have to have a very strong stomach to run a business — you have to risk everything."" He added that friends, neighbors and even acquaintances often remarked that they would like to own their own businesses, but they had no idea how tough it could be. It means working 60 hours a week, seven days a week, Mr. Katz said.Ms. Weltman agreed. ""You can be the best at what you do, but that doesn't mean you can run a business,"" she said. ""Marketing, finance, dealing with employees, government regulations. You have to really have a passion over and above what you're good at. That is really the big thing.""""Hardly anyone starts a business and it just takes off,"" Mr. Katz said. ""That's not reality. You have to look into yourself, and if it's not going your way — you can blame this and that, but at the end of the day, you have to blame yourself.""On the other hand, as Ms. Weltman said, ""You get all the glory when things go well.""'"
"'06-05-01,'0','""Songs that scared me."" That was the original concept behind the choice of material for Audra McDonald's thrilling concert of mostly Broadway songs at Carnegie Hall on Saturday evening. One daunting prospect, she explained from the stage, was to perform anything made famous by ""the two Barbaras"" (Cook and Streisand). For her that meant carrying two of their signature songs — ""Will He Like Me?"" (from ""She Loves Me"") and ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" (from ""Funny Girl"") — to a light-operatic plateau.Another challenge, she admitted, was to sing the film version of ""The Glamorous Life"" (from ""A Little Night Music""), which ponders the impact on a child of having a famous, peripatetic show business parent. (Ms. McDonald is the mother of a young girl.)A third, she joked, was to get through ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" without bursting into laughter because the song is so ridiculously famous. Midway, she paused and gave it over to the audience to sing and joined in only at the end.As ever, Ms. McDonald, here accompanied by a 31-piece orchestra conducted by Ted Sperling, forced one to reconsider conventional musical definitions. What is the difference between a show tune, a theater song and an art song when someone of Ms. McDonald's formidable talent and impeccable taste takes them on? The vocal luster and intense commitment she imparts to whatever she sings automatically lifts it to a higher elevation. To what degree does her good taste shut out the raucous vulgarity of the burlesque side of Broadway? How much room is left for humor?But with a vibrato that seems to accelerate on a current of emotional urgency, a vocal texture that breaks suddenly from a plummy operatic richness into a pop wail carrying an echo of traditional spirituals, Ms. McDonald never sounds like a mink-clad opera diva touring the slums of Broadway. The humor that erupts from her comes in her sudden breaks from decorum, as in her wild, jubilant cries at the end of ""Gorgeous"" (from ""The Apple Tree"").Fred Hersch, the wonderful pianist whose genre-scrambling mixtures of classical, jazz and pop match Ms. McDonald's in stylistic flexibility, accompanied her for two songs: a soaring, chaste rendition of that Freudian booby trap ""My Ship"" (from ""Lady in the Dark""), and a version of ""Dividing Day"" from ""The Light in the Piazza"" that reinvented it as a delicately jazz-inflected stream of consciousness.'"

"'06-05-01,'0','The way I figure it, that rebate won't even cover my gas one way to Washington to complain!There are only two things that will bring energy prices down: reduced consumption and increased alternatives. How? Improved energy efficiency for all motor vehicles, all appliances, all residences and all office buildings.Wind mills, solar panels and nuclear power will help supply side. Is that so hard for our president and Congress to understand?Temporarily rebating $100 to some taxpayers or temporarily reducing the gasoline tax will be followed by another cycle in which demand pushes up prices again.Let's set about the task that lies ahead: long-term reduction in energy consumption and development of non-petroleum energy sources.It is so frustrating to watch our leaders waste vast amounts of fuel while we are trying to make ends meet with the gas prices hurting us.How much fuel does our president burn on his trips flying around the country for photo-ops and votes? Let us see him conserve.Re ""Pander at the Pump"" (editorial, April 28) was hard-hitting and informative, but included a contradiction.While certain Band-Aids and half-measures by Washington would merely boost demand for gasoline, as you pointed out, the same effect would result from your plea for better fiscal management than tax cuts for the wealthy.So ""struggling families would be better able to weather higher prices at the pump"" also means consumers' being able to afford to drive more.The overarching point should be that the world's peak in oil extraction is a major factor in higher prices for fuel.Transportation fuels are only part of what oil provides. Petroleum is our source for food production, distribution and preparation — more essential to survival than the ability to drive personal cars.Congress and the president have it exactly backward. Now is not the time for tax rebates or suspension of the federal gasoline tax.If we had courageous leaders, they would seize the opportunity to impose a $1-to-$3 increase in the tax on gasoline.This would force consumers to demand an energy policy that had its base in alternative fuels and hybrid automobiles, which in turn would speed up Detroit's lethargic response to the need for more efficient vehicles.Yes, the short-term effect of a higher tax would be a burden to people who had to use their cars for work, but if we are ever to cut our dependence on foreign oil, it will be necessary to decrease the carbon emissions that are contributing to global warming and develop sustainable alternative sources of energy.Now is the time for courageous leaders to stand and deliver. Unfortunately, President Bush and Congress do not have the stomach to make the hard choices.Your solution of higher fuel efficiency standards is as foolish as the solutions you decry.How many cars are on the road now? How many would be replaced by those with higher standards?When would this even take effect?And increasing federal gas taxes on gasoline will hurt only those who can't afford them whether they're job- and wage-limited working class or retired folks on fixed incomes. Tax the gas guzzlers, S.U.V.'s and the like. Local governments also should increase taxes on these.Do you know how much gasoline is wasted by soccer moms in their idling gas guzzlers waiting to pick up their children?'"

At first, it was slow going even to find financing, but during the 90's, Mr. Mariotti's foundation — based in New York City and known by its abbreviated name, NFTE, as in ""nifty"" — began to introduce its curriculum to high schools nationwide. As of this year, its classes are being taught in more than 300 high schools, most in lower-income districts, in 45 states. One-third of the funding for the program, which enrolled 28,000 students this academic year, comes from the Goldman Sachs Foundation.Mary M.

The students also learn skills like writing a résumé and a cover letter, preparing a presentation and giving it before a group, creating a business plan and devising a marketing plan.The academy has 50 slots and twice as many students, who are representative of the area's African-American, Hispanic, Caucasian and Asian populations, apply for them. By junior year, Mrs. Styner said, ""few of those participating drop out of school.""A 2002 study of the NFTE program by the Harvard Graduate School of Education found that students taking the course had a 32 percent higher interest in attending college than their peers who did not take it. After taking the course, the study said, students' interest in getting a job that required a higher level of education rose 44 percent. Even though Tony Renesca, a business teacher at the Booker T. Washington Senior High School in Miami, began teaching the course just a year ago, he said it had caught on. He especially liked teaching entrepreneurial skills, he said, because he could draw on his previous experience as a manager of a fast-food restaurant.Like others teaching NFTE classes, Mr. Renesca attended a four-day course the foundation gives for teachers. So far, 3,700 teachers have been certified by NFTE, and more than 120,000 students have taken a class or attended entrepreneurship camps run by the foundation.Mr. Renesca organizes an annual expo to give students a chance to show their parents, classmates and teachers their businesses, which have included a bakery and a T-shirt design company. Students often use the Internet to research products that interest them, he said. Once they decide the area they would like to pursue, NFTE can make money available for students to buy the product in quantity at a wholesale store. Then the student must learn how to budget, how much to charge for each item to turn a profit and how to calculate overall costs.The course has made ""my students more self-reliant and confident about their skills,"" Mr. Renesca said. One student, Thania Potosme, 15, started a greeting-card business. Born in Nicaragua, Ms. Potosme said that operating a business helped her learn English. ""You have to know your grammar if you are going to be putting words on cards,"" she said. It also taught her to honor commitments. ""When you have a project, you have to be responsible,"" she said.While NFTE is aimed at low-income high schools, which typically have a high dropout rate, it is also in school districts where the income levels are more diversified.In 2002, Jeannie Bunce, who spent 22 years in marketing, began teaching a NFTE class at Brien McMahon High School in Norwalk, Conn., which has a student body with a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. The course's popularity has grown steadily, resulting in four courses to accommodate the more than 120 students who enrolled.""I teach them that whether you are the C.E.O. of I.B.M. or not, you have to make decisions about what you buy,"" Mrs. Bunce said. She said that NFTE financed trips to one of New York City's wholesale districts to help students understand the mechanics of pricing items they bought for resale.""It helps to have a real-life example,"" she said. ""It builds their self-confidence, and lets them know that there are alternatives out there to college or the military.""Beyond financing, the biggest barrier that NFTE has encountered are the school requirements under the No Child Left Behind law, said J. David Nelson, the foundation's chief operating officer who retired from I.B.M. Schools are finding that there is little time for classes beyond science and math.""We have a shelf space problem,"" Mr. Nelson said, ""because there is so much focus on test scores starting in the ninth grade. That means there is no room sometimes for teaching entrepreneur skills.""Still, NFTE is pressing on, Mr. Mariotti said, because entrepreneurial skills ""teach kids, even from the most dysfunctional families where they feel like failures, that they can build a life.""'"

Fuel costs were up $10.5 million, and pension expenses increased by $5.9 million.Sysco said cost pressures would most likely persist through the fourth quarter, but lessen, if not disappear, after that.Stock in Sysco, which is based in Houston, fell 5 cents, to $29.84.'"
"'06-05-02,'1','WASHINGTON, May 2 — A Republican proposal to provide taxpayers with a $100 rebate to compensate for higher fuel prices appeared all but dead today as leading congressional Republicans said it had quickly run out of gas.""I just think that trying to satisfy voters with a $100 voucher is insulting,"" said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House majority leader. ""Over the weekend, I heard about it from my constituents a few times. They thought it was stupid.""Other Republicans in the House and Senate did not mince words either.""It was a silly idea,"" said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, a member of the Republican leadership, who predicted that the rebate would not be in the final energy package when it reaches the floor.Coming after Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, announced Monday that he was dropping a broad tax proposal from the leadership's eight-point package of energy initiatives, the resistance to the rebate meant that two core elements of the plan were either off the table or teetering on life support.As a result, Republicans will have to regroup on energy legislation while they are under steady political attack from Democrats who say the ties between Republicans and the oil industry have contributed to rising prices at the pump. The harsh reaction to the rebate was also a setback for Mr. Frist, who led the rollout last week of the energy plan and defended it during a morning interview on CBS.'"
"'06-05-02,'1','DETROIT, May 2 — The high cost of gasoline already appeared to impact vehicle sales last month, automakers said, with General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all reporting declines. Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda, meanwhile, saw their sales rise.G.M.'s sales declined 7 percent, and Ford's dropped 3 percent compared to April last year. The Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler reported a 4 percent decline. Toyota's sales grew nearly 9 percent and Honda's increased 7 percent.The latest surge in gas prices may have a more searing impact on S.U.V. and pickup truck buyers than last summer's post-Katrina price spike, experts said.""Last fall when we had this first spike, then people could write it off as a one-time deal,"" said Stephen Hoch, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. But with gas prices rising again so soon, he said, consumers will be wary of buying an S.U.V. because they fear ongoing volatility in oil prices.""The fact that it spikes twice means it can spike again,"" Mr. Hoch added. ""Now this time people will say there's enough evidence that this is going to be a recurring, if not frequent, phenomenon.""'"
"'06-05-02,'1','Deborah Hamner, the widow of George Hamner Jr., pressed regulatory officials about the mine's ventilation system, which proved inadequate to quickly clear the air after the explosion. A federal official replied that it had not been a great concern prior to the accident. ""It was deemed adequate by my guys,"" said Ken Tenney, a field office supervisor.Kevin Stricklin, another federal official, said in response to questions from Russell Bennett that said he did not recall details of the approval of a wall built to seal off the worked-out section of the mine. ""You signed it, you should,"" Mr. Bennett retorted.The families had been demanding the right to question regulators and company officials in the months since the accident. Adding to their loss, their emotions had been whipsawed in the hours after the explosion by early reports — which proved false — that 12 of the trapped men had been found alive.According to accounts from the scene, the erroneous news was prompted by a misunderstood cellphone conversation that was passed on to the families. Officials soon realized that it was untrue, but delayed notifying relatives until they had solid information on the condition of the men in the mine. The mistaken news of a successful rescue was reported by newspapers and by radio and television stations around the world.Since state and federal investigations of the accident are still under way, it is not clear that the survivors will get definitive answers at the hearings. But organizers have promised that additional questions will be answered when a transcript of the proceedings are published.The comments and questions from the miners' survivors came at what is scheduled to be a two-day hearing by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration and the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training into the cause of the blast and rescue efforts. It is being held at West Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon.The sole survivor of the explosion and its aftermath, Randal McCloy Jr., is not expected to testify, but some of the issues he raised in a recent letter about the accident seemed to be very much on the minds of the relatives of these who died.The family members raised questions about the adequacy of emergency air supplies, after Mr. McCloy said trapped miners were forced to share air packs after four of the individual units failed. They questioned how well the closed-off section of the mine where the explosion occurred had been sealed.And they questioned why some safety records appear to have gone missing.""It is a coincidence that the fire boss notes got lost?"" asked Peggy Ware-Cohen, the daughter of one dead miner, Fred Ware Jr. ""Was this a preventable explosion?""The mine's owner, the International Coal Group, has said it believes that a lightning strike conducted into a closed section of the mine triggered the blast, not some operating condition in the working sections.'"
"'06-05-02,'1','In the days after the election, with Mr. Berlusconi still actively contesting the results, Mr. Ciampi had said that he would leave to his successor the job of asking Mr. Prodi to form a government. Mr. Ciampi, 85, is retiring on May 18 after his seven-year term.That would delay the formation of a new government until at least late May, but investors and credit rating agencies concerned about Italy's economic problems and large public debt have been eager for the president to assign the mandate before then. Over the weekend, Mr. Prodi said he would name his entire government by the end of this week.""My objective is to be ready, but I don't have any intention of dictating to President Ciampi,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""But I can't be unprepared the day that he decides.""Meantime, Mr. Berlusconi's coalition of center-right parties waded into the politically charged debate over the presidency, saying that the new Parliament ought to re-elect Mr. Ciampi.Mr. Ciampi, a banker and former prime minister himself, ""has represented in these seven years a solid moral and institutional point for the entire nation,"" the coalition said in a statement.The statement was notable because it essentially answered the question of who Mr. Berlusconi favors for the presidency, an office of tremendous influence and prestige in Italian politics. Filling the office is a complicated issue, both in relations between the Prodi and Berlusconi camps — important because the election was so close — as well as inside Mr. Prodi's own center-left coalition.Mr. Berlusconi and his allies have argued that, given how many votes he won in the election, he should have a major say in who the candidate is. Over the weekend, Italian newspapers reported that he wanted Gianni Letta, one of this closest advisors, for the job.But Mr. Prodi has to satisfy the largest party in his own coalition, the Democrats of the Left, and one of its leaders, Massimo D'Alema, also a former prime minister, has circulated as a possible future president.Mr. Ciampi, one of the nation's most respected politicians, has expressed a desire to retire but has not completely ruled out a second term, though many experts say it might be for a relatively short time. If he agreed to another term — and Parliament confirmed him — it could nullify Mr. Ciampi's desire to have his successor give the mandate to Mr. Prodi, and thus speed up the formation of a new government.'"
"'06-05-02,'1','A summary of the top stories in the Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.Fewer than the usual number of newspapers appeared in the wake of Monday's holiday, the Day of Spring and Labor. And most papers featured articles, photographs, and interviews related to the holiday, the beginning of the traditional May holidays, which informally extend through Victory Day on May 9, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.The state newspaper, Rossiiskaya Gazeta, led with the headline ""The People of May."" The article described how the pro-Kremlin parliamentary party, United Russia, was adapting the symbols and language once used by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The party organized traditional workers' demonstrations this year with such slogans as, ""A working man should not be poor,"" and ""First salaries go up, then rent."" The party's activities acknowledged public dissatisfaction with aspects of the economy and other issues, including rising rents for apartments that have prompted nationwide protests led by the Communist Party.Rossiiskaya Gazeta noted that the party's slogans had ""a leftist character,"" in keeping with steps the party had taken to adopt Communist rhetoric to broaden its base of support. The Communist Party remains the second largest in the parliament but it is a shadow of its former incarnation. Still, United Russia's co-opting of some of its ideals underscored the lingering appeal for Soviet-era nostalgia.The party's new left-wing voice, however, did not resonate with everyone during festivities on Monday. Vechernyaya Moskva quoted people on the street as saying that they never thought of it as a day of ""workers' solidarity."" Rather, they said they would use the holidays to go to Egypt or Turkey. An editorial in Vedomosti attributed what it considered the recent phenomenon of political and social indifference to ""changes of the past 15 years"" that unhinged Russia's economy and political structure.'"
"'06-05-02,'1','He distinguished Intel's efforts from other campaigns with similar aims by saying Intel would focus on full-featured computer systems with enough power and memory to run Microsoft software.Intel's rival chip maker, Advanced Micro Devices, has backed the concept of reaching half of the world's population with inexpensive personal computers by 2015, and Nicholas Negroponte, a co-founder of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been designing a sub-$100 notebook computer for educational use in developing nations.Those machines have either been designed to run open-source software or a subset of the complete version of Microsoft's standard desktop software.The issue has been a highly charged one, both for political and business reasons.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Mr. Negroponte publicly debated the issue with Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, and his chief technology officer, Craig J. Mundie, who suggested that a better alternative to an ultralow-cost computer might be a combination phone and personal organizer that can be fitted with an inexpensive display and a keyboard.On Monday, Mr. Otellini appeared to be making a point of defending the utility of the Intel-Microsoft desktop standard.""We don't think you cross the digital divide with old technology,"" he said. ""It doesn't need exotic technology and it runs real applications.""The new Intel design, to be called Eduwise, will include software for the classroom. Makers of the computer are to be named later.Mr. Otellini dismissed the possibility that the emergence of such low-cost computers might cannibalize existing markets, saying that low-end portable computers were already close to these prices in the United States.Mr. Negroponte, whose machine will have a handle, a hand crank and an innovative display screen, is in discussions with Brazil, China, Egypt, Thailand and South Africa to purchase millions of the notebooks.He said that the Intel program was a step forward, but that focusing efforts on training teachers had serious drawbacks.""Anything is better than nothing,"" he said, ""but teacher training is the slowest way to improve global education and reaches very few rural, remote teachers in very poor places.""He argued that a more radical and more efficient approach was to equip children with technology. Intel has already announced several PC design initiatives for specific regions, including a desktop computer for the Indian market and another for Mexico. The Mexican machine is based on a partnership with Telmex, the Mexican communications company and involves a subsidy for a broadband Internet connection. The machine is priced about 20 percent below the consumer market price for a similar machine.In addition to training and access to computing, Intel's focus will be on Internet connections. The company has already financed 175 experimental wireless networks using Wi-Max, a longer-distance version of the Wi-Fi networking standard.Intel executives have said they believe that Wi-Max deployments will leapfrog stages of development in the nonindustrialized world.'"
"'06-05-02,'1','Democrats are trying to rally voters against Republicans, pointing to the rising fuel costs as evidence of how consumers were hurt by the opposition's ties to the oil industry.The Republican energy package was assembled quickly last week after lawmakers returned from a recess punctuated by public complaints about the rapidly rising gas costs . Senate officials acknowledged privately that they were paying a price for rolling out the proposal before having time to vet it fully.Besides the tax provision and the rebate, the measure includes new protections against price gouging, incentives to expand domestic oil refinery capacity, support for new energy initiatives and tax incentives for buying hybrid vehicles.Outside Congress, experts have said the government has few realistic options that would quickly reduce gas prices. And as lawmakers struggle to gain political advantage on the issue, they must juggle the often competing goals of curbing prices, increasing production and tamping down populist anger about oil industry profits.Major trade groups quickly and vociferously registered their disdain for the tax provision, saying the plan amounted to a hefty new tax not only on the oil industry, but also on many manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers that rely on large inventories as well.""This just came out of the blue,"" said Dorothy Coleman, vice president of tax and domestic economic policy at the National Association of Manufacturers. ""Before you make a change in longstanding tax policy — I am talking 70 years or so — you don't just up and do it in an energy bill.""At the National Retail Federation, Rochelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel, said lobbyists there immediately raised a red flag with lawmakers and aides. ""Our concern was did they understand what they were doing, did they know this was a proposal that could have wide-ranging implications?"" Ms. Bernstein said.One leadership aide who did not want to be identified as discussing internal deliberations said the decision was made to drop the provision rather than have the energy proposals caught up in a secondary tax fight. It remained unclear how quickly the leadership might move to bring its plan to the floor but it appeared unlikely to be added to the emergency spending bill the Senate is considering this week.Though the Senate previously approved a more narrowly defined proposal to require the accounting change for major oil companies, the plan announced last week would have extended to all business sectors. It would have represented a major shift in policy for Congressional Republicans, who have wrapped their economic approach around tax cuts rather than increases.The decision to drop it eliminates a chief source of revenue to pay for the rebate checks to be mailed to an estimated 100 million taxpayers. After the tax plan was dropped, Mr. Frist said money to pay for the rebate program could be generated by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, another element of the plan. But the drilling initiative, previously rebuffed in Congress several times, faces serious opposition of its own and the revenues would not be realized for years.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, called the decision to drop the tax proposal ""just another example of the Bush Republicans' inability to break their ties to big oil.""There were no estimates of how much money the change would have produced, though it had been projected at more than $11 billion in the past. The proposal in a separate tax bill to bar the accounting practice known as last in, first out for the oil companies was estimated to raise about $4.3 billion from them alone. That idea is still part of the continuing tax negotiations. But whether it will be in the final measure is unclear, and President Bush has threatened to veto it.Business advocates said taxes could have been driven up significantly by ending the practice that allows companies to record sales from inventory at the higher, current cost of acquiring or producing the goods rather than a potentially lower original price.Some panicked executives told their Washington representatives the increase could be from $30 million to $60 million for their individual companies alone.""When this deal first surfaced late Thursday, the business community was just shocked,"" said Bruce Josten, at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ""Instantly, if not rather simultaneously, people started making calls to the Senate leadership, to the staff of the Senate Finance Committee. It was the wholesalers, the manufacturers, the mass retailers.""Jade West, senior vice president at the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, said she learned about the full reach of Mr. Frist's proposal at midafternoon on Thursday and did not believe the report at first.When Ms. West polled some of the association's largest members, all of whom juggle large inventories, their response was frantic. One called the proposal ""dumb and irrational,"" she said. By Friday, the wholesalers had mobilized an e-mail campaign that resulted in about 350 letters to the Senate by Monday morning.The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group representing about 400 businesses including Wal-Mart and Target, began rallying their big-box store members first thing Friday.""It was just surprising that they didn't see the writing on the wall, they didn't see the opposition that this provision would face,"" said Shannon Campagna, the organization's vice president for government affairs. ""They didn't have their ear to the ground.""'"
"'06-05-02,'1','Demographers and voting rights advocates are rightly pressuring the Census Bureau to begin counting the nation's 1.4 million prison inmates at their home communities — and not as ""residents"" of the prisons, the current practice. Counting the inmates at prison inflates the prison community's population and political influence, while draining political clout from the communities where inmates actually live.Most Americans aren't aware that prisoners are counted as part of the population in the electoral district where they serve time — even though they often live hundreds of miles away and are barred from voting in all but two states. But recent evidence shows that voters in nonprison communities become outraged when they learn that nonvoting prison populations in adjacent districts are being leveraged against them. When made aware of the scheme, voters typically demand that the inmates be dropped from the district count so as not to skew local legislative authority. But state legislatures inevitably include inmates in the count when drawing state legislative districts, which shifts political power from the places were inmates actually live to the prison districts.The Census Bureau balked and raised unconvincing excuses recently when Congress asked it to consider a system that would count inmates at home instead of at prison. But the prison census controversy is a potentially explosive issue whose time has clearly come.The bureau should get busy on a system for counting inmates where they live as opposed to where they do time.'"
"'06-05-02,'1','Mr. Lay's sale of Enron shares to meet bank calls was long thought to be his best defense against charges that he conspired to defraud the company, which collapsed in December 2001. Mr. Lay argued on Monday that he went to great lengths to hang onto his Enron shares, even as the debacle unfolded. He acknowledged that he maintained a risky trading position, pledging virtually his entire portfolio of liquid assets, nearly 90 percent of which was in Enron stock, as collateral against loans used to make other investments.But his insistence on being portrayed as the proverbial captain willing to go down with his ship has become a vulnerability for him in the trial. A prosecutor, John Hueston, doggedly sought to show on Monday that Mr. Lay did not do everything he could to hold onto his Enron shares.Mr. Lay's claim that he sold only when forced is crucial to buttressing his defense that he was telling the truth when he made rosy assessments of Enron's performance in the five months after he reassumed the chief executive post after the August 2001 resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Mr. Lay's co-defendant. Mr. Skilling is charged with conspiracy, fraud and insider trading.While the government has not charged Mr. Lay with insider trading, Mr. Hueston has used Mr. Lay's stock sales to raise questions about his credibility and truthfulness when he was encouraging employees to buy Enron shares in the late summer of 2001, even as he was unloading his.Despite Mr. Lay's claims that he wanted to tell the ""whole truth"" in trial, Mr. Hueston suggested that Mr. Lay had told ""Enron employees a half-truth.""On Monday, Mr. Hueston's second day of extensive questioning on the issue, the prosecutor showed, that Mr. Lay chose to meet a $483,426 margin call on July 26, 2001, with his Enron line of credit. That was despite having more than $11 million available in separate secured and unsecured credit lines separate from the Enron line. He also had $6.3 million in stocks in Compaq, Eli Lilly and a TCW stock fund, at least some of which, Mr. Hueston showed, was available for trading.In addition, Mr. Lay had some $30 million in real estate he never sought to sell, including three Colorado properties. When Mr. Lay tried to protest to Mr. Hueston that some of the properties took up to two years to sell, the prosecutor showed that one property, on Shady Lane in Aspen, sold in January 2002 in two days for the full asking price of $10 million.The prosecutor also sought to embarrass Mr. Lay with details of his spending habits. Mr. Hueston revealed that Mr. Lay, in January of 2001, spent some $200,000 on a birthday party for his wife, Linda, on a leased yacht called the Amnesia. The 164-foot yacht is replete with a helipad, Turkish marble and a Jacuzzi.Then in April of that year Mr. Lay paid $12,000 for a vacation in Los Cabos, Mexico, to celebrate his birthday. ""As you can see, my birthdays were cheaper than my wife's birthdays,"" Mr. Lay said wryly, drawing few grins from the courtroom.The next month he spent two nights on the French Riviera for $4,700.While in Europe he sold $4 million in Enron stock, Mr. Hueston said.The stock sales continued as Enron was collapsing. On Nov. 26, as a desperate bid to merge with Dynegy was all but dead, Mrs. Lay sold 500,000 Enron shares of the Linda and Ken Lay Family Foundation, the Lays' charitable organization, Mr. Hueston revealed.The next day, on Nov. 27, as Enron's bankruptcy filing was being drafted, Mr. Lay used up all his Enron credit line, borrowing $1 million and, for the first time, drawing the full $7.5 million he was allowed to borrow annually from the line.""You had a liquidity problem and Enron had a liquidity problem and you saw to it that you were taken care of before the Enron employees,"" Mr. Hueston said in concluding his initial cross-examination.'"
"'06-05-02,'1','Microsoft enters that battle from a stronghold: its lucrative, powerful business in personal computer software. Google has asserted that Microsoft's next Web browser typically steers users to Microsoft's search service, limiting consumer choice and potentially hurting Google, the leading Internet search engine.Microsoft says Google's objections are mistaken, and that its new browser, Internet Explorer 7, increases a user's search options.But Google has advantages of its own, and the Internet services business is very different from the desktop software industry.The Internet model is one that offers search, e-mail, calendar, contacts and even word processing as services accessible remotely with a PC or hand-held device with a Web browser. Typically, Google invents a new service or feature, makes it a free Web-based service, and only later figures out how to make money on it from advertising of some kind.That ad-supported software, distributed as a Web service, is a threat to Microsoft's model of selling licensed desktop software, at least in the consumer market. Corporations have so far shown less interest in ad-supported software as an Internet service.To smaller software companies, Google's strategy appears to have the same competitive impact as Microsoft's tried-and-true practice of bundling more software programs and features into its Windows operating system.Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Watch, a Web newsletter, said that in some niches of the software business, Google is casting the same sort of shadow over Silicon Valley that Microsoft once did.""You've got people who don't even feel they can launch a product for fear that Google will get in,"" Mr. Sullivan said.Google, he said, has acquired companies and then made their products free, roiling the markets in which they compete. Google has introduced free versions of the graphics software made by SketchUp and of the Internet analytics service from Urchin, two companies that it bought.And Google won a bid to offer wireless Internet service in San Francisco at no charge, hoping to make money by selling local advertising. If this model proves to be successful, it could cut into the business of other Internet providers and wireless phone companies.Now Google is starting to move directly into Microsoft's core market. It recently acquired Writely, a Web-based word processor.How far Google can eat into Microsoft's software franchise is uncertain. But Microsoft fears that Google could become a kind of operating system of the Internet in the same way that Windows is the dominant operating system of personal computing.For its part, Google wants to avoid becoming the ""next Netscape,"" a reference to the early leader in the browser market that Microsoft eventually thwarted.""A lot of the people who are at the center of Google had done hand-to-hand combat with Microsoft in the 90's, and I don't think they have forgotten,"" observed John Battelle, the editor of SearchBlog, a Web log on search technology.The group includes Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive and former executive of Sun Microsystems; Omid Kordestani, its senior vice president for sales and a former Netscape executive; and John Doerr, a Google director and venture capitalist who was a prime backer of Netscape, Sun Microsystems and other Microsoft rivals.""They are very worried,"" Mr. Battelle said, ""about Microsoft leveraging their I.E. monopoly,"" referring to Microsoft's commanding share of the browser market, which Microsoft includes in Windows.The fears of both companies may well be exaggerated. For Microsoft, the PC promises to remain a powerful business and technology franchise for years to come. And Google should benefit from the fact that Microsoft, after a federal antitrust judgment against it and a settlement with the government, is more restrained in its tactics and behavior than it once was.A major expense of their escalating battle lies in the very nature of the Internet services realm: the digital engine rooms and power plants that must be built to support it. Google does not disclose technical details, but estimates of the number of computer servers in its data centers range up to a million.Last month, when reporting its quarterly earnings, Google reported a doubling in its rate of capital investment, mainly in computer servers, network equipment and space for data centers, and said it would spend at least $1.5 billion over the next year.As Google grows, so does its need to store and handle more Web site information, video and e-mail content on its servers. ""Those machines are full,"" Mr. Schmidt, the chief executive, said in an interview last month. ""We have a huge machine crisis.""To catch up, Microsoft is also stepping up capital spending as it invests aggressively to build data centers worldwide. ""It is becoming more capital intensive,"" said Mr. Sherlund of Goldman Sachs. ""But the company has a bulging cash position and no debt. That's not a constraint for Microsoft.""However deep their pockets and established their names, the two companies will mainly compete on one point. ""In the long run,"" Mr. Battelle said, ""it's about whether you have the best service.""'"

"'06-05-02,'1','Almost every element of the programs reflects a political judgment, but Mr. Bush said, ""It's time to set aside politics and restructure Social Security and Medicare for generations to come.""Republicans and Democrats seized on the reports to renew the political battle over Social Security and Medicare, with an eye to Congressional elections this fall.The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said the reports showed that ""despite White House scare tactics, Social Security remains sound for decades to come."" Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said the administration had worsened Medicare's problems by promoting managed-care plans, which he said often ""cost more than traditional Medicare.""The administration urged Congress to approve the president's proposals to slow the growth of Medicare by curbing payments to hospitals. Under current law, the trustees said, doctors already face a cut of 4.7 percent or more in Medicare fees in each of the next nine years.The trustees' reports are authoritative documents prepared by career civil servants, mainly actuaries, and are full of data used as a basis for policy making and political debate.In the report on Medicare, the Bush administration reduced its estimates of the number of people who would sign up for the new prescription drug benefit.The trustees now predict that 31.4 million people will have signed up for the drug benefit by the end of the initial enrollment period in two weeks, and that monthly enrollment for 2006 will average 29.2 million, down from an estimate of 39 million published in last year's report.Likewise, the administration now predicts enrollment of 34 million for 2007, down from an estimate of 39.8 million in last year's report.Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said Medicare's financial problems were more severe than those of Social Security because of ""steady large increases in underlying health care costs.""The new report estimates that the basic Medicare premium — what a beneficiary pays for coverage of doctors' services and other outpatient care — will be higher than predicted last year. The premium has increased more than 50 percent in the last three years, to $88.50 a month, from $58.70 in 2003, and the Bush administration predicts that it will rise to $98.20 next year.By contrast, in last year's report, the administration predicted that the basic 2007 premium would be $87.70.But the average premiums for drug coverage are lower than expected: $32.20 this year and $35.86 in 2007. The comparable figures in last year's report were $37.37 and $41.22.The administration lowered its estimate of the cost of the drug benefit for the period from 2006 to 2014. The administration now puts the cost at $872 billion, down from $1.1 trillion last year. (The figures do not reflect premiums paid by beneficiaries or compulsory payments by states to help defray the costs.)In a joint statement, the public trustees of the two programs, John L. Palmer and Thomas R. Saving, said the projected costs of the drug benefit were ""significantly lower than those in the 2005 report due to recent slower growth in overall prescription drug spending and lower enrollment in stand-alone prescription drug plans than was expected a year ago.""Still, the administration said, the cost of the drug benefit will grow an average of 11.5 percent a year in the next decade, more than twice as fast as the economy.'"

"'06-05-02,'1','The flood of dollars to Asia would under normal circumstances push up the value of Asian currencies, raising the price of Asian goods in dollars and gradually reducing the ability of Americans to keep buying them. But central bankers in Asia, which has long depended on exports for economic development, then need to put those earnings to work and maintain a stable currency.They do that by buying safe investments like Treasury bonds, and that keeps their currencies from rising while lending Washington the money to finance the deficits and allowing American consumers to continue buying Toyotas and Samsung TV's and Chinese-made textiles. That is why some countries like China have gone so far as to fix the value of the currency to the United States dollar.Economists say the gusher of global funds became a torrent after 9/11, when the Fed and other central bankers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations steered interest rates lower in response to a growing global recession and fears of deflation.With long-term United States bond yields barely higher than short-term yields, investors looking for higher returns have had to head abroad into markets considered riskier than United States bonds or stocks.""This is the story that's been driving Asia for the last couple of years — this hunt for global yield,"" said Nicholas Bibby, an associate director at Barclays Capital in Singapore.While precise figures are not available, Barclays estimates that Asia has received roughly $670 billion in net capital inflows since 2001, including $42.2 billion so far this year. That does not include the earnings Asia generates from exports.Where once Southeast Asian markets received funds largely from Asian banks or international mutual funds specializing in the region, analysts say these days that hedge funds and pension funds are increasingly dabbling in the region's securities.And the money is coming not only from America. A rapidly growing private banking industry has emerged in Asia to service the appetite for risk among the new rich being created by China's rise. Record oil prices have created a flood of petrodollars from the Middle East in search of investments. And Japan's own banks and brokerage firms have long been venturing out in search of returns for their depositors and clients since the country's central bank set rates effectively at zero in an effort to jump-start the economy and stave off deflation.Thus, even as local investors ship their cash out of Indonesia, foreigners continue to pump funds back in, buying $570 million in Indonesian stocks this year, pushing the Indonesian rupiah up 9 percent and the benchmark stock index up 17 percent. That is small change compared with India, where foreign investors have bought $4.1 billion in equities this year. Foreign buying in Vietnam's still tiny stock market has helped make it the world's best-performing market so far in 2006 with a gain of 77 percent.To be sure, most analysts agree that Asian markets remain attractive and that despite the influx of funds, stock prices remain low relative to average corporate earnings. Their economies, moreover, depend heavily on agriculture and global demand for their electronics exports, and domestic political disruptions are likely to have little effect on them. ""Industry and exports will continue to roll on,"" said Chua Hak Bin, senior regional economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.Some fear that financial trends are poised to reverse the situation. Some economists say that the recent plunge in Iceland's currency and stock prices portends a worldwide retreat by Japanese funds in the aftermath of the Bank of Japan's decision to end what was essentially no-interest financing. Others say continued low interest rates in Japan will preserve this so-called yen carry trade — in which lenders borrow at low Japanese interest rate and lend at higher rates abroad — and that China's decision last month to begin allowing its own savers to begin investing abroad will only expand the amount of money sweeping global markets.One thing is sure, economists say: Financial risk has become mispriced. Perhaps the best evidence is in Asia's bond markets, where the cost to borrow for governments has been steadily declining. In part, economists say, this reflects how steady capital inflows are improving government finances. But more and more, so much cash is available that it has become a borrower's market. Governments in Indonesia or the Philippines are now selling 10-year bonds that offer investors an interest rate only about two percentage points higher than bonds issued by the United States government, which are considered the most risk-free investment in the world.""Risk?"" said James McCormack, head of Asian sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings in Hong Kong. ""No one talks about it anymore. It's a bad word.""'"
"'06-05-02,'1','But central to Ms. Köllner's argument is the idea that the company and others like it can raise costs for consumers beyond what world prices justify because they control the networks that deliver the gas to households. Consumers in her region are protesting increases of 32 percent over the last 18 months, using consumer protection laws to pry open E.On's books and reveal profit margins.In response, E.On's local subsidiary, E.On Westfalen Weser, is suing 23 of its customers there, hoping to make examples of them.""We owe it to the 95 percent of our customers who pay correctly to take this path with those who refuse to pay,"" the chief executive of E.On Westfalen Weser, Hans-Peter Villis, said in a statement.To Jonathan Stern, director of the natural gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, which will soon publish a book on the German market, everyone comes out looking bad.""This is a story that reflects credit on no one at all,"" he said. ""Not the companies and not the government.""A report issued in November by the European Commission said Europe's natural gas market was still dominated by established suppliers and was particularly uncompetitive in Germany. Though the situation is improving in countries like Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands, ""competition for households does not exist"" in Germany, the commission wrote.After Germany liberalized its natural gas sector in 1998, E.On bought several local gas networks, including the company that serves Paderborn, where it has a de facto monopoly on distribution.At the time, policy makers said they hoped that E.On's expanded networks would enhance its ability to negotiate good prices for imported natural gas, allowing prices for consumers to fall.Instead, E.On's critics contend it has abused its commanding position in some markets. In 2004, E.On imposed the first of three price increases.In 2005, natural gas cost 10.16 euros, or $12.60, per gigajoule for an average household in Germany, compared with 6.91 euros in Britain, where competition is more developed, according to Eurostat.Part of the problem, critics say, is that the government did not provide for adequate checks and balances when it began to liberalize the natural gas market. In 19 of the 25 European Union countries, gas prices are regulated. But not in Germany.As the government opened the sector, it allowed energy companies to buy municipal utilities but then directed industry groups to negotiate access to networks — the pipelines that carry the natural gas to individual customers — among themselves. This model was doomed from the start, said Detlef Weidemann, a managing director of NatGas, a gas company in Potsdam.Indeed, the negotiations collapsed a few years later, leaving companies like NatGas facing what they say are unduly high fees for network access.""Technically speaking, we could deliver gas to every single customer in Germany,"" Mr. Weidemann said. ""As a practical matter, it's utterly impossible.""The ownership of the networks, according to Ms. Köllner and others, left an opening for E.On to keep prices higher than the market would justify. Soon after the company took over the local natural gas network, she and other consumers formed a group called Gas Prices Down to challenge E.On.Using its own research, the group disputed E.On's contention that natural gas prices roughly tracked oil prices as they rose.They also hired a lawyer who ferreted out a vital provision in Germany's civil code: Consumers who believe a monopoly provider is gouging them can withhold payment of higher bills until the company opens its books — and natural gas companies are not allowed to simply turn off the spigot. Beginning in late 2004, Ms. Köllner and dozens of others in Paderborn began rejecting price increases and paying their natural gas bills at previous rates. Over the next 12 months, the movement spread quickly throughout the country. The Association of German Energy Consumers estimates, based on nationwide surveys, that roughly 500,000 Germans are refusing to pay price increases.Amid the turmoil, German legislators last year decided to create an independent network regulator, much like those in France and Spain, to adjudicate access charges. The Bundesnetzagentur, based in Bonn, is already promising new fees by Aug. 1, a spokesman, Rudolf Boll, said.The agency has the power to set ""appropriate"" fees so that network operators like E.On can earn a reasonable profit but not gouge consumers, so it is likely to lower some fees, according to Mr. Stern. If more companies are able to compete with E.On, it will force the whole industry to become more efficient, and reduce retail prices.That would free consumers from the burden created when oil prices push up gas costs. ""If the market were liberalized and competitive, then E.On could not pass on these prices to consumers,"" Mr. Stern said.E.On Westfalen Weser has proposed access fees to the German regulator and has said it looks forward to the competition.In the meantime, as a result of the actions by Gas Prices Down, a judge may decide early this month whether E.On Westfalen Weser has to open its books.The company published financial data Jan. 1 that it said demonstrated how it lost 0.16 cents per kilowatt-hour of power in 2005.Ms. Köllner said the numbers were useless because they obscured how each level of E.On's organization made a profit from natural gas sales, increasing prices for consumers.An E.On spokesman, Meinhof Päsch, said further disclosures would damage the company's position vis-à-vis other potential competitors.Though Ms. Köllner is not one of the 23 people being sued, her organization is aiding the customers E.On has singled out, and is settling in for the long haul.German laws make legal fees contingent on the value of the dispute, and Ms. Köllner said that those customers, like herself, had probably neglected to pay E.On as much as 400 euros since November 2004.""The costs are not so bad,"" she said. ""We can keep up the fight.""'"
"'06-05-02,'1','The state said that such subsidies cost it $60 million a year and that the law would save it $12 million.Critics said that by discouraging adoptions the law would end up costing the state more over time in foster expenses and in later social costs, because so many former foster children end up homeless, with drug problems or in prison.Finding permanent homes for foster children who cannot return to their biological parents is a national goal, backed up by federal, state and local subsidies for adoptive parents who are often taking on children with cognitive or medical disabilities. In Missouri, such payments can range from $225 to $650 a month, depending on needs for therapy or other special care.The law required adoptive parents to reapply for subsidies annually, voiding contracts that had guaranteed aid to age 18. For a subgroup of parents, whose children were not covered by a federal program that bars means tests, it ended aid if the parents earned more than 200 percent of the poverty line, or $38,314 a year for a family of four.In August, Judge Wright temporarily delayed invoking the law. After a one-day trial last week, he issued a permanent injunction yesterday, saying that the annual renewal of subsidy agreements violated federal law and that the means test was discriminatory because it applied just to a subgroup without rational justification.""The means test will not save taxpayer money, but will increase the overall cost of child welfare in the State of Missouri,"" he said. Several states have acted to curb adoption subsidies or eligibility, but the Missouri law went further than others by retroactively imposing means tests and other changes on parents who had adopted in the past.Promoting the adoption of foster children who cannot return to their biological parents was a goal of federal laws passed in 1980 and 1997. Such adoptions have increased to 50,000 in recent years from 28,000 in 1996.Related aid to parents has grown, reaching $4 billion last year, with half paid by the federal government, according to a study in the March issue of The Social Service Review.The increasing costs have drawn the scrutiny of financially beleaguered states.If a subsidy cut discourages adoptions, that is likely to prove shortsighted, said Richard P. Barth, a professor of social welfare at the University of North Carolina. Professor Barth is a co-author of the March study, which found that the public cost of supporting a child in the foster system tended to surpass significantly any adoption subsidies.""Our research shows that adoptive parents pay quite a substantial amount for services that their children need, and this is only partly offset by the subsidies they receive,"" Professor Barth said. ""These parents are taking on a substantial challenge and deserve the appreciation of the public.""'"
"'06-05-02,'1','The current president, Tim Tompkins, jumped in to add, ""The Spanish Steps on steroids.""The alliance, which runs the business improvement district, envisions a new Duffy Square as the keystone in its plan to improve street life in the overcrowded Broadway-Seventh Avenue vortex. ""There is so much clutter in Times Square, this will be a striking shift,"" Mr. Tompkins said. ""Finally, there'll be a place where you can sit down and look.""The Theater Development Fund, which runs the TKTS discount ticket program, hopes that people who flock to this new gathering place will also become theatergoers.""I imagine a person sitting there having lunch and saying, 'What's going on here?' "" said Victoria Bailey, the executive director. Perhaps that person would end lunch hour at one of the 12 windows in the new fiberglass TKTS booth tucked under the staircase at 47th Street. ""We'll be able to sell much more efficiently,"" Ms. Bailey said.There are 10 windows in the current setup, which consists of two trailers surrounded by a network of pipes and sail-like vinyl panels emblazoned with huge red t's and k's and s's. This was designed by Mayers & Schiff in 1973 as a temporary measure. It is now old enough to be eligible for landmark status.Indeed, some of the panels may be acquired by the Museum of the City of New York, said Veronica Claypool, the managing director of the fund.The architects of the new TKTS pavilion and Duffy Square are Perkins Eastman and William Fellows Architects, working from a concept by two Australian architects, John Choi and Tai Ropiha, who won a 1999 competition sponsored by the Van Alen Institute.""The whole intent was to take the essence of that concept and make a glowing, floating, red amphitheater,"" said Nicholas S. Leahy, a principal in Perkins Eastman.The steps will be made of three-layer laminated glass panels, one-and-a-half inches thick. They will be 45 feet wide at the top, tapering to 32 feet. The treads will be two feet deep, almost twice as deep as those at the Met. Panels under the steps will supply heat to melt snow and cooling for the light-emitting diodes that will illuminate the entire staircase. Glass panels will border the edges.Given that a seated person typically occupies about two square feet, the steps could conceivably hold more than 1,000 people.The top of the steps will be 16 feet above the sidewalk, as high as the current pipe structure and just slightly lower than the top of the Celtic cross that is a backdrop to the statue of Father Duffy. That was important to the Father Duffy coalition.Father Duffy, who died in 1932, was most famously chaplain to the Fighting 69th Regiment in World War I. He was also pastor of Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church at 329 West 42nd Street.Bruce Meyerson, who served in the 69th Regiment as a first lieutenant and is now chairman of the coalition, said he was pleased with the overall plan for Duffy Square. ""The entire site works,"" he said. ""Everything blends together.""It took a lot of mixing to blend.Construction was supposed to begin in 2000. Then the leadership of the Theater Development Fund changed hands. Then terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center, slowing down many projects in the city and affecting the theater fund more directly, because it had a booth at the trade center. The downtown TKTS booth has since reopened in the South Street Seaport.Then, as the concept was translated into real plans, the fund incorporated the needs of the alliance, which wanted a better streetscape, and those of the coalition, which wanted a better setting for the Father Duffy statue. Then there was give and take with New York City Transit and the City Department of Transportation.Then the financing had to be cobbled together: $5.5 million from the mayor's office, $4 million from the City Council, $1.5 million from the alliance, $1 million from the fund and $500,000 from the coalition.The project now seems to be under way. And because the major structural elements are prefabricated, the completion date is not too distant.""It is our intent and hope to have it ready for Dec. 31st,"" Mr. Tompkins said. He meant 2006.'"
"'06-05-02,'1','""I hate theater,"" the voice says. ""Well, it's so disappointing, isn't it?"" This voice, which belongs to a character called Man in Chair (rendered with clinical exactitude by Mr. Martin), offers up the prayer he says he always mutters before a show, requesting that it be short, free of actors who roam the audience and blessed with ""a story and a few good songs that will take me away.""Imagine, he continues, a time when audiences eagerly awaited the latest from Cole Porter and the Gershwins. ""Now,"" the Man says, ""it's, 'Please, Elton John, must we continue this charade?' ""Luckily for us, this Man — who is subsequently revealed sitting, alone, in a humble studio apartment — refuses to go away. He puts on a vinyl record of a 1928 musical called, yes, ""The Drowsy Chaperone."" And his drab little apartment becomes a show palace (with glitzy fantasy sets and costumes courtesy of David Gallo), with the original cast members summoned into being to recreate the production.So we have been thoroughly primed to appreciate whatever follows, which turns out to be one of those intricately (and improbably) plotted tales of love in crisis — involving gangsters, show people, millionaires and servants — that showed up regularly in productions with titles like ""Oh, Kay!"" and ""Sitting Pretty.""Unfortunately the musical in ""The Drowsy Chaperone"" isn't as astute or amusing on its own as what the Man has to say about it. The cast members are bright and eager and energetic, but with a couple of exceptions they don't quite grasp what it is they're sending up.Musicals from the era of ""The Drowsy Chaperone"" had a renewed vogue in the mid-20th century, with works that ranged from pure parody (Sandy Wilson's ""Boy Friend"" in 1954, ""Dames at Sea"" in 1968) to retooled versions of the real thing (""No, No, Nanette"" in 1971). The difference between these earlier productions and ""The Drowsy Chaperone"" is that the commentary — arch and adoring at the same time — was built into the style of the performances.Appropriately for an age in which self-consciousness has become as essential (and expected) an element of human communication as vocal cords are, ""The Drowsy Chaperone"" divides the chores and lets Mr. Martin's character do most of the interpretive work. Everybody else, with one notable exception, just seems to be having a good old time, hamming it up in ways more reminiscent of broad television revue comedy (remember the old-movie parodies on ""The Carol Burnett Show""?) than of the age of Gershwin and Kern.Directed and choreographed with untiring buoyancy by Casey Nicholaw, the cast members include Lenny Wolpe and Jennifer Smith as a sort of George Burns and Gracie Allen team; Troy Britton Johnson as the toothy and toothsome leading man; Danny Burstein as an overacting pseudo-Latin lover; and Beth Leavel as a strutting, martini-swigging vamp, enlisted as chaperone on the wedding day of one Janet Van De Graaff (Sutton Foster), darling of the Broadway stage, who is about to give it all up for love.By the way, while ""No, No, Nannette"" had Ruby Keeler (the tap-dancing ingénue of the film ""42nd Street"") on board as a performer to lend nostalgia-enhancing authenticity, ""The Drowsy Chaperone"" has Georgia Engel, who plays a ditsy, feathery-voiced rich woman. Ms. Engel, you may recall, portrayed Georgette, Ted Baxter's dimwitted girlfriend, on ""Mary Tyler Moore."" More than 30 years later she looks and sounds almost exactly the same, which sort of confuses the issues of what we're being sentimental about.Oh, well. Ms. Engel and Edward Hibbert (who plays an inflexibly proper butler) perform spit take after spit take with gusto, as well as a sweet duet when they discover their love for each other. And the rest of the cast tap-dances up such a storm that you have no choice but to applaud. But the genuine wit lies almost entirely in Mr. Martin's asides and annotations.The one performer who makes us forget about Mr. Martin is Ms. Foster, who has hitherto been known for her exhausting peppiness in shows like ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" and ""Little Women."" As Janet the Broadway glamourpuss, a part that would seem made for excess, Ms. Foster instead pulls in the reins and gives a gloriously artificial, deadpan account of a woman who is almost as in love with love as she is with herself.A little number called ""Show Off"" — in which Janet sings that she no longer needs attention while doing everything she can (including cartwheels) to hold the spotlight — is the one song that, on its own, lifts the audience into a helium paradise of pure pleasure. (Over all the songs, while serviceably imitative of the 1920's, are forgettable.)Otherwise you have to squint compassionately to imagine that the characters onstage are as Mr. Martin would have us believe they are. Though I could have done without some shrill revelations about his character's mother fixation, Man in the Chair is a vital addition to the gallery of Broadway archetypes.Judging by audience reaction to ""The Drowsy Chaperone,"" his hunger for a bona fide escapist musical would seem to be shared by many.

"'06-05-02,'1','Indeed, passions on a range of issues almost define New York streets these days.There was the antiwar march. Friday night, there was the usual end-of-month bike ride cum protest by the group known as Critical Mass. Yesterday morning, there was a rally near the United Nations to denounce the American prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Yesterday afternoon, protests over immigration policies took place across the city.For a constitutional provision said by some gloom-and-doomers to be in jeopardy, the First Amendment has certainly gotten its share of exercise.Among other things, the Saturday march was a helpful reminder that it is still possible in this troubled land to disagree without being disagreeable.Perhaps the weather was a factor. Saturday was spring at its most glorious. It was what some New Yorkers, with a perhaps unavoidable touch of melancholy, have come to think of as a 9/11 day — one of azure skies and pleasant temperatures, just like that morning in 2001 when menace came, literally, out of the blue.There was no danger this time. Nor was there conflict. The police, not always models of restraint during protests, stood benignly on the sidelines. In turn, demonstrators did nothing to provoke officers. There were no arrests.Placards bore sober messages of grievance, but they were in the main free of nastiness or vulgarisms. Lordy, people even went out of their way to throw empty water bottles and unfinished ice cream cones into sidewalk trash baskets.COULD protesters from relatively genteel places like Indiana, Wisconsin and New Hampshire have had a civilizing influence? For sure, the out-of-towners swelled the numbers on Broadway. The marchers' total was probably somewhere in the several tens of thousands.Playing the numbers game is always dicey. The police have stopped providing their own estimates, a sensible policy since they were always accused of low-balling the figures.For their part, protest organizers tend to run high, sometimes very high. They let it be known that 350,000 people had marched. If that were so, an average of 2,600 people per minute would have passed the spot along the route where I stood from start to finish. No way did that many go by at that pace.Even so, it was one of the larger demonstrations in a while on New York streets, as well as one of the least hostile. It included quite a few church groups.Rita Pearl carried an intriguing sign. It made no specific mention of the war.""The meek are ready,"" it said.She is a churchgoer, Ms. Pearl said, part of the congregation at the First Unitarian Church of Brooklyn. A sign with a biblical allusion appealed to her, for it put together seemingly disparate issues that she believed to be related.""The meek are getting pushed back all over the world,"" Ms. Pearl said, lamenting that prices are up, wages are down and many jobs are disappearing. ""People,"" she said, ""have been too meek, and it's time we got ready to raise our voices again.""'"

"'06-05-03,'0','A convicted felon who worked as a driver transporting artwork to New York City for a Florida company has disappeared with a truckload of pieces valued at several million dollars, investigators said yesterday.AXA Art Insurance Corporation has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of seven Milton Avery paintings that were part of the shipment, according to Detective Michael A. Mauro of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.He said the driver, Patrick Joseph McIntosh, 36, who was employed by David Jones Fine Art Services of Boca Raton, Fla., left the city on April 18 with the artwork.Mr. McIntosh was scheduled to pick up additional works in Naples, on the west coast of Florida, and then head to New York. He never showed up in Naples, Detective Mauro said. Investigators have tracked the use of the company's debit card he carried to Fort Pierce, about 70 miles north of West Palm Beach, and to Gainesville, the detective said.The truck contained furniture, paintings, photographs and sculptures bound for galleries and private collections in the New York area.Mr. McIntosh, of West Palm Beach, has a criminal record dating back to 1989, with convictions for trafficking in stolen property, grand larceny and auto theft, according to Detective Mauro. He was also convicted of bigamy in Virginia in 1992 and, the detective said, currently has two wives in Florida.'"
"'06-05-03,'0','Globally, EMI and Warner rank a distant third and fourth in sales behind Universal Music Group, a unit of Vivendi, and Sony BMG Music Entertainment, a venture of Sony and Bertelsmann.Combining EMI and Warner would create a company with about 24.7 percent of the market, second behind Universal, which has 25.5 percent, according to data from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the industry's international trade organization. Such a deal would shrink the field of major competitors to three companies of similar size.The talks also underscore the uncertainty within the music industry, which may still need more consolidation and cost cuts to survive.Record companies have been scrambling to secure footing in the digital market as they suffer a lengthy slump in CD sales, in part because of continuing piracy of music.EMI has such acts as Coldplay and Norah Jones, with a large catalog of best-selling recordings by the Beatles and the Beach Boys. Adding Warner would bulk up the company's presence in the United States — where it has long lagged — and give it access to a catalog that includes Ray Charles, Metallica and Led Zeppelin. Warner has surged lately with a run of hits from Madonna, the singer James Blunt and the rapper T.I.In 2003, Time Warner decided to sell the unit to allay its corporate debt. EMI submitted a bid worth roughly $3 billion, but Time Warner decided to accept a lower offer — for about $2.6 billion — from a consortium led by Mr. Bronfman and the private equity company Thomas H. Lee Partners, in part because of worries that regulators would block a deal with EMI.The prospect of an eventual merger with EMI was such an issue at Time Warner that it discussed adding a provision to its agreement with Mr. Bronfman that would force him to pay a penalty to Time Warner if he quickly turned around and sold to EMI.After taking over, Mr. Bronfman cut more than 1,000 jobs and trimmed Warner Music's artist roster. Warner went public last May — at $17 a share, several dollars less than initially planned. But the stock has rebounded as the company trumpeted a series of deals to sell music through online services and cellphones, and as speculation grew about a merger with EMI.News of the talks was reported yesterday by CNBC.Any deal still faces several challenges, including regulatory hurdles and questions about the management structure. The two companies would probably be forced to sell one of their respective music publishing units — probably the Warner/Chappell unit — to satisfy regulators that the entity would not unfairly dominate that sector of the business.The deal is also riddled with tricky personnel questions that could make it difficult to build a harmonious management team.EMI's recorded-music unit is headed by Alain Levy, who quit his job at the helm of the music giant PolyGram in the late 1990's after Mr. Bronfman — then head of Seagram — acquired it and refused to appoint him to run the company's global music operations.Roger Ames, who had been Warner's chairman when Mr. Bronfman's team won the bidding for the unit, found himself without a job and now is a consultant to EMI. And EMI last year hired Jason Flom to run Virgin Records — two months after he had been forced out as the chairman of Warner's Atlantic Records.'"
"'06-05-03,'0','Senate Republicans have announced plans to push for a quick vote on Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination for a powerful appeals court judgeship has languished since 2003. There are good reasons the nomination has been kept on hold. Mr. Kavanaugh was unqualified then, and he is unqualified now. Moreover, since his Senate hearing in 2004, new issues have been raised that he should be questioned about, including what role, if any, he played in Bush administration policies like the National Security Agency's domestic spying program.Mr. Kavanaugh has been nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, often called the nation's second most important court. A young lawyer with paltry courtroom experience, Mr. Kavanaugh does not have the legal background appropriate for such a lofty appointment. What he does have is a résumé that screams political partisanship.He worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor, and helped draft possible grounds of impeachment against President Bill Clinton. He became a partisan in the impeachment battles that followed, co-writing an op-ed article in 1999 that presented Mr. Starr as an ""American hero,"" while railing against a ""presidentially approved smear campaign against him."" Mr. Kavanaugh has spent much of his legal career since then in the Bush White House, where he helped select many of the administration's far-right judicial nominees.Since Mr. Kavanaugh's nomination was first considered, information has come to light about a number of troubling policies that he could have had a hand in, including domestic spying, torture and rendition of detainees to other countries. Senate Democrats would like to question Mr. Kavanaugh about these programs, and about what connection he had, if any, to the Jack Abramoff scandal.It is not clear, however, that they will get the chance. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has so far resisted calls for another hearing before Mr. Kavanaugh's nomination is brought to a vote. The Republicans have long used judicial nominations as a way of placating the far right of their party, and it appears that with President Bush sinking in the polls, they now want to offer up some new appeals court judges to their conservative base. But a lifetime appointment to the D.C. Circuit is too important to be treated as a political reward.'"
"'06-05-03,'0','GARDEN CITY, N.Y., May 2 — Calling it a main theme of his bid for governor, Thomas R. Suozzi outlined a $2.5 billion plan on Tuesday to cut school property taxes and improve troubled schools across the state.In calling for tax cuts, Mr. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, said property tax bills in New York were among the nation's highest. ""They are crushing our communities and forcing residents to leave,"" pushing the elderly from their homes, shutting young couples out of the housing market and driving away business, he said.His remarks came a week after State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi reported that the taxes on suburban and upstate homeowners in New York were 73 percent above the national average and have risen much faster than the rate of inflation in recent years.Mr. Suozzi accused his rival and the poll leader for the Democratic nomination, State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, of ignoring the issue. After detailing his own proposal, Mr. Suozzi said, ""I would like to compare it to Eliot Spitzer's property tax plan, but he has no plan.""Mr. Spitzer's camp defended his record. ""Throughout his campaign, Eliot Spitzer has talked about the urgent need to provide property tax relief,"" said his spokeswoman, Christine Anderson. He has proposed changes to address the underlying causes of high taxes, she said, like reducing Medicaid costs and reviving the upstate economy. Later he will present plans to grant tax relief and reduce expenditures required by the state, she said.'"

"'06-05-03,'0','The measures include allowing telecommuting, cutting back on the number of meetings, introducing liberal leave policies and staggering employee shifts.The goals include helping make sure that ""people aren't coming and going from a workplace at the same time"" and generally to ""encourage people to stay at home"" if they have any sense they are infected, the official said.""The main purpose of this implementation plan is to say, 'Department X, you need to be doing the following,' "" he said.The plan says, however, that setting up operational logistics will be up to the various departments.The first part of the plan was released in November. Under it, the federal government shouldered responsibility for developing a vaccine and stockpiling antivirals, and state and local governments were told to plan for the medical response and quarantine.Many of them soon complained that they had no money and no control over privately owned local hospitals.The nation's borders would almost certainly not be closed, the draft summary says, because the virus would enter the country anyway, enforcement would be difficult, and such an action would ""present foreign affairs complications and have significant negative social and economic consequences.""The federal government will establish policies for screening travelers for flu symptoms and make recommendations about quarantines. It could also restrict unnecessary domestic travel.In addition to increasing the stockpile of human vaccines and antivirals, the government will increase the stockpile of poultry vaccines to 110 million doses.It will create separate stockpiles of masks, suits, disinfectants and antiviral medication for poultry workers. (American policy now is to avoid vaccination and to kill any infected chickens that may be found, but countries like China and Vietnam began vaccinating when the virus began spreading faster than flocks could be tested and culled.)Under the government's plan for the worst-case possibility, a pandemic flu could cause up to two million deaths in the United States.'"

McGuire, worth some $1.6 billion, drawing criticism from institutional and individual shareholders as well as investigations into their timing.Looking tense at times, Mr. McGuire told shareholders: ""With perfect hindsight we perhaps should have moved to make adjustments in our options program as quickly as our business was growing. But this was not necessarily apparently without the benefit of that hindsight. In any event, we can only act now.""About 200 shareholders showed up on a sparkling spring day in this Minneapolis suburb, with some intent on holding the company's feet to the fire. In a typical year, a few dozen shareholders attend the meeting.""I was always steadfast in my belief that the amount of shares being granted were obscene,"" Larry Larson, a retired Minneapolis-area schoolteacher who owns about 800 UnitedHealth shares, told Mr. McGuire during a question-and-answer session.""I grant you many more sleepless nights so you might make better decisions for this company in the future,"" Mr. Larson said to a strong round of applause.

"'06-05-03,'0','Verizon said it operated 48 million phone lines at the end of March, 3.6 million fewer than at the end of the first quarter last year. But the company said the number of broadband subscribers jumped 47.1 percent in the first quarter compared with the period last year.As in past quarters, the biggest contribution to growth came from Verizon Wireless. The company added 1.7 million new subscribers and sales grew 18.8 percent in the quarter. Like other wireless carriers, Verizon Wireless has been trying to persuade customers to use more data services to offset a slowdown in the amount of money generated from voice calls.Monthly average spending per customer for wireless data services rose to $5.58, up 79 percent from the quarter last year. The company said it had 6.2 million subscribers for its high-speed mobile phone service.Ivan G. Seidenberg, Verizon's chief executive, repeated that his company was interested in buying the 45 percent of Verizon Wireless owned by the British company Vodafone, but that Vodafone must decide when it wants to sell its stake.Financial analysts, however, continue to voice concerns about Verizon's ambitious plans to install fiber optic cable to millions of homes by the end of the decade. The company's new network now passes 3.6 million homes and Verizon hopes to reach 6 million homes by the end of the year. The costs of connecting homes to the network remain high, though, and the number of customers buying services is relatively small.The costs of building the fiber network shaved 6 cents a share off Verizon's earnings in the quarter.Verizon is spending far more to build a new network than AT&T, which is extending its fiber optic cables to within 3,000 feet of homes and using existing copper cables to cover the remaining distance.Despite the higher cost, Doreen A. Toben, Verizon's chief financial officer, said investors were starting to understand that her company's network would be more versatile than AT&T's and thus worth the extra cost.""We've spent a lot of time getting bashed"" because AT&T's network is cheaper than Verizon's, she said. But now ""analysts seem to be taking a longer-term view.""'"
"'06-05-03,'0','Mark Green received endorsements yesterday from several labor organizations in his candidacy for attorney general, a show of strength that was intended to steal some of the thunder from Andrew M.

Mr. Green's campaign said that the unions had a combined membership of 110,000 workers.With the state Democratic convention just four weeks away, Mr. Green and five other rivals in the party are announcing their endorsements on almost a daily basis as they seek to show their political muscle. While Mr. Cuomo, a former housing secretary in the Clinton administration, has been leading in fund-raising and in public opinion polls, Mr. Green has not been far behind him in those same polls.At a news conference yesterday on the steps of City Hall, Mr. Green also released a report detailing his ideas for reducing consumer fraud.""Consumer debt is ballooning in part because of predatory lending, mortgage fraud and credit card sleight-of-hand that should be investigated,"" Mr. Green said. ""As New York attorney general, my job will be to use the law to shrink the wage and wealth gap because it's wrong that the head of Exxon-Mobil makes more per hour than a minimum wage worker earns per year.""In addition to Mr. Green and Mr. Cuomo, the other candidates for the Democratic nomination for attorney general are Assemblyman Richard L.

"'06-05-03,'0','Why the different treatment, and what does it show about Poland? Commentators have been asking those questions, even as the conservative government has negotiated a power-sharing arrangement with a group of populist parties whose beliefs are very close to those of Radio Maryja.The government says no action was taken against Radio Maryja for a simple technical reason: when Mr. Michalkiewicz made his remark, the president of the National Broadcasting Council, Elzbieta Kruk, a longtime friend and associate of Poland's president, Lech Kaczynski, had been forced to step down because of a challenge to the way she had been appointed — by Mr. Kaczynski himself rather than by the council's other members. During this time, Ms. Kruk has told the Polish press, she has had no authority to act.But critics of the government see things differently, saying it fears alienating the station or its constituency, which both helped it win the last election. Beyond that, some Poles see the unfolding of a bitter culture war involving two incompatible views of this country's identity and values.The new conservative governing party, Law and Justice, clearly sides more with the religious and traditional values generally represented by Radio Maryja than with people like Ms. Szczuka, who see Radio Maryja as an intolerant throwback to an unwelcome past.""They don't like her because she is independent,"" said Andrzej Jonas, the editor of the English-language Polish Voice, referring to Ms. Szczuka, who is well known in Poland as a feminist, an active supporter of gay rights and an opponent of Law and Justice, whose leading figures are President Kaczynski and his twin brother, the party chairman, Jaroslaw Kaczynski.Nobody here is saying the scandal indicates a resurgence of the old Polish demon of anti-Semitism, which is against the law here and which many people, including opponents of the Kaczynski twins, believe has never been at lower levels in this country than it is now.But what many people believe to be at issue are the deep divisions that have appeared in Polish life since the end of Soviet-enforced Communist dictatorship some 16 years ago.Ms. Szczuka's views reflect a secular, Western-oriented Poland that is in the European Union and subscribes to what have become the standard European democratic and liberal values.""There was a scandal because they hate me,"" Ms. Szczuka said, referring to the Radio Maryja listeners who reportedly demanded that the government take action against her. ""They hate me because I'm a feminist, I'm Jewish — mostly because I'm a feminist,"" she said.She is also an activist for gay rights, while President Kaczynski is a political figure who as mayor of Warsaw last year gained notoriety throughout liberal circles in Europe when he banned the city's annual gay pride parade.On the other side is Radio Maryja, which to many Polish analysts represents the still deeply religious Poland that feels threatened by creeping secularism. The station was founded about 16 years ago by the Rev. Tadeusz Rydzyk, a conservative, populist priest who actively supported the Kaczynski brothers during last year's election campaign.From time to time the station has taken on a nasty edge, in the form of callers on talk programs or commentators who have expressed the not-quite-disappeared caricatures of Jews that were once deeply embedded in the Polish culture.As reported in the daily Gazeta Wyborcza, Mr. Michalkiewicz, the Radio Maryja commentator, spoke on the air of ""the men from Judea"" who ""are trying to surprise us from behind."" He said the World Jewish Congress was demanding $60 billion in compensation for Jewish property lost during World War II, calling the organization ""a main firm in the Holocaust industry.""He called Gazeta Wyborcza, where a number of prominent Polish Jewish journalists work, ""an unusual example of the Jewish fifth column in Poland.""A professional journalists' organization, the Council for Media Ethics, branded what it called Mr. Michalkiewicz's ""weakly documented accusations"" examples of ""primitive anti-Semitism."" The papal nuncio in Poland, Archbishop Jozef Kowalczyk, wrote a letter to the Polish episcopate asking that it work ""to overcome difficulties caused by some transmissions and the views presented by Radio Maryja.""Still, the government has taken no action against Radio Maryja like those it took against the television station where Ms. Szczuka committed her anticlerical satire, and the suspicion that the discrepancy reflects an unspoken cultural and political alliance between the government and Father Rydzyk's radio outlet is widespread.""It is probably right to say that that is the real reason,"" Wojciech Z. Dziomdziora, a lawyer and the only one of the National Broadcasting Council's five members to oppose the fine levied against Ms. Szczuka, said in an interview.""The legal situation really didn't allow us to take action against Radio Maryja,"" he added, ""but probably that was a very comfortable situation for the council.""'"
"'06-05-03,'0','MY friend Charlie Mayer, a producer for National Public Radio who is spending a year in Mongolia, traveled to Cambodia last month and reported to me on a preparation of fried ginger and fried fish.""What else?"" I asked him in an e-mail message.I pressed him for more details. ""The secret,"" he finally wrote, ""is that the ginger is shaved in lovely little curlicues; and it's cooked both before and after the fish. It's not only tasty, but crunchy.""The recipe here is probably a tad gussied up compared with the original. But I like it this way. The key is the twice-cooked ginger, which becomes crisp but retains a fair amount of its heat. You can julienne it; slice it into disks, preferably with a mandoline; or strip off pieces with a vegetable peeler.Try to buy young, thin-skinned (sometimes called Hawaiian) ginger. It will be less fibrous and more pleasant to eat. And get a lot: a half-pound is not too much.Mr. Mayer said the Cambodian version featured freshwater fish, but unless you know a fisherman, every freshwater fish you can buy is farm-raised and slightly muddy-tasting. These days catfish is the best available (steer clear of tilapia; trout is too delicate for this dish), but I'd sooner use red snapper, black bass or even cod.'"
"'06-05-03,'0','Last week, Dorothy Cann Hamilton, chairwoman of the board, said a new goal of the foundation is to be a food research institute, ""a resource for government and industry.""""Why shouldn't we have our own Davos, where Jean-Georges Vongerichten and the secretary of agriculture sit down with the C.E.O. of Sysco?"" she said.Beard's grand plans throw light on the increasingly serious — and competitive — world of food enthusiasm.It all started marginally enough in the 1970's, with a few like-minded people huddling around, say, a coq au vin and an old bottle of French Burgundy. From these spindly roots grew the American food appreciation movement, and organizations grew up to service it, among them large-scale cooking schools and culinary charities like the Institute for Culinary Education, the American Institute of Wine and Food, the International Association of Culinary Professionals and the James Beard Foundation.The early incarnations grew quickly and chaotically, run by friends on shoestring budgets. ""It was a mom-and-pop operation,"" said Arlyn Blake, who recently left the staff of the Beard foundation after more than a decade. ""Now it has to be a business.""That's because American food lovers have become more willing to back up their interest with serious money, and the organizations are scrambling for bigger chunks of it. The A.I.W.F. has had success with upscale European cruises run by descendants of Auguste Escoffier. The Beard foundation has developed an affiliation with New York University that is allowing it to co-sponsor a conference on the Mediterranean diet next month at the university's spectacular villa in Florence, La Pietra.Copia: The American Center for Food, Wine and the Arts in the Napa Valley is staging Taste3, an ambitious meeting of food scientists, historians, chefs, winemakers and industry executives, sponsored by the Robert Mondavi Winery, in July. For $2,350 a person, not including accommodations, attendees can immerse themselves in two days of ""nimble minds, eclectic palates and provocative ideas,"" with those attending including the Pilobolus Dance Company and Hiroshi Tanaka, a Japanese scientist who has developed a way of electrolyzing wine so that it ages in seconds.Copia, the newest group, is a high-minded nonprofit founded with $20 million from Robert Mondavi and devoted to wine, food and the arts. Its estate in Napa, Calif., includes 12 acres of buildings, organic gardens, restaurants and tasting rooms.The year 2005 was a rocky one for many of the organizations. After the Beard financial scandal, some awards judges resigned and the whole program distanced itself from the foundation. Leonard F. Pickell Jr., the former president, went to an upstate prison, where he remains hospitalized with a septic foot wound complicated by diabetes, according to his brother, Derek Pickell. His release is expected in June.Also last year, Copia's director stepped down, and the board flirted with raising Copia's profile through a proposed merger with the A.I.W.F., which has been facing a decline in income and membership. But negotiations broke down and the institute moved its headquarters to New York City.Copia struggled financially after opening in 2001, and a new president, Arthur Jacobus, was brought in last year to ""change the model,"" which he says was quiet, museum-like and not much fun for the casual visitor. ""Reducing the ticket price from $12.50 to $5 made a big difference,"" he said. Bigger ideas for Copia include a food-and-wine-themed ""village.""The deep pockets of American food lovers have attracted the notice of institutions like New York University, which has loaned its imprimatur to various Beard foundation projects. ""The university gets to raise its public profile,"" said Lisa Sasson, a clinical assistant professor of nutrition at N.Y.U. and a planner of the Florence event. ""And the attendees have access to the top academic work in the subject."" In June 2004, the University of California at Davis broke ground for a wine and food study center with seed money — $25 million — coming from Robert Mondavi and his wife, Margrit.The interest goes both ways: cooking schools are gaining a new kind of academic credibility. The French Culinary Institute in Manhattan, which will be transformed into the International Culinary Center in October after a major expansion, boasts deans of pastry arts and Italian studies, among others. At the Artisanal Premium Cheese Center in Manhattan, Max McCalman holds the grand title dean of curriculum. ""The kind of people who will spend 12 hours in a cheese master class appreciate being treated like serious students"" he said.Mr. McCalman is also involved in the increasingly crowded world of culinary awards, as a judge for the new Gallo Family Gold Medal awards for artisanal producers. Blending the serious purpose of SlowFood and the taste criteria of a Pillsbury Bake-Off, the first awards were bestowed last month in categories including Outstanding Condiment and Outstanding Dairy. This fall, Copia will expand its wine awards programs to include food, although without attaching ""chef"" or ""restaurant"" or even ""food"" to the categories.""It might be a farmer, or an iconic product, or a people's choice award,"" said Linda Carucci, Copia's culinary director. ""It might be the person who invented bagged salad, or another marketing innovation that changed Americans' relationship to food. What it won't be is a duplication of any other awards program."" This year, Beard honors will be awarded in 70 categories.""To continue to be meaningful, awards have to be somewhat restrictive"" Mr. McCalman said. ""But there's no question that they benefit the industry, both in morale and on the margins.""Susan Ungaro said chefs have never had more reason for high morale. ""Not only are chefs celebrities now, but they are the most likable ones we have,"" she said. ""Compared to the Jens and J. Lo's of the world, celebrity chefs are engaged with important things: families, health, agriculture.""They are also increasingly perceived as artists. This week, producers are wrapping the first season of ""Chef's Story,"" a program in the style of ""Inside the Actors Studio"" that brings Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Thomas Keller and 24 other American chefs out from behind the stove to talk solemnly about their work.Their interviewer — surprise — is Dorothy Cann Hamilton, who, as founder of the French Culinary Institute, the Beard chairwoman, and past president of the A.I.W.F., has become ubiquitous at the top of the culinary world. ""I am very careful to keep my roles separate,"" she said. ""I am not interested in being accused of profiteering."" Ms. Hamilton's career, which began with a 20-year stint as president of Apex Technical School, is a road map of the progress of American professional cooking as it has risen to a highly refined, expressive profession.""It's wonderful, what has happened to the industry,"" said Andrew Carmellini, last year's winner of the Beard for best chef in New York. ""But sometimes I miss the old days of the Beard awards, with Drew Nieporent doing the cancan up on the stage.""'"
"'06-05-03,'0','To harness the Web's attributes, many of the shows and applications will wrap around them community offshoots, commerce opportunities and the ability to dig deeper for related segments or information. Product placement, a specialty of Mr. Silverman, will also be an integral part of the programming.And in a final twist, Mr. Silverman's Reveille, the independent production company he founded and runs, will be able to turn any of the Web shows into television series. Microsoft will have a financial stake in any resulting show. ""We are all about building brands that can go across mediums,"" Mr. Silverman said.Microsoft's move comes as it is looking to jazz up its MSN portal, one part of its accelerating competition with Google, Yahoo and AOL. Ultimately Microsoft executives want to lure more Web users to MSN, keep them there longer than they have stayed in the past and sell plenty of advertising to marketers wishing to woo them.The deal is expected to be announced today at the MSN Strategic Account Summit, a Microsoft-convened gathering of marketing, technology and entertainment executives in Redmond, Wash.Microsoft's previous foray into original Web content was not particularly auspicious. In 1996 and 1997 the company poured about a $100 million into shows like ""475 Madison"" (a dark comedy about a New York advertising agency) and ""Project: Watchfire"" (a serious look at U.F.O.'s) and mini-sites like Mungo Park (an outdoor adventure project) and the movie-obsessed Cinemania.In November 1996, when MSN announced its transition from a proprietary service to a Web supersite, it unveiled a lineup of more than two dozen shows for what its executives — borrowing from the language of television — called a new season. In the ensuing months it found itself mimicking another tradition of the television business when it canceled almost all of the shows.Within a few years Microsoft had dumped nearly all of the original entertainment programming for more practical, utilitarian services. ""Perhaps we invested too much too quickly in content before the audience was there and the bandwidth was there,"" said Gayle Troberman, the director of branded entertainment and experiences for MSN.Faster connections and the audience's embrace of Web video have persuaded Microsoft executives to intensify their original programming ambitions. But Microsoft executives have also learned to play to the company's strength: its collection of large numbers of Web users, thanks largely to the power of its Web browser and its ability to steer people to MSN.While continuing to license content from existing media and entertainment companies (like clips of NBC shows or the streaming of new shows before they make their debuts on network television) and beefing up its user-generated content platform, MSN is adding a third pillar to its content strategy.""We're going to partner with the experts,"" the new generation of content creators for the broadband experience, said Rob Bennett, general manager of entertainment and video services for MSN.""We're not going to go build a massive studio in Santa Monica and go give someone a Handycam,"" Mr. Bennett added, in a playful dig at Yahoo's media efforts. (Yahoo recently scaled back its ambitious plans to produce television-style programming for the Web site, shifting more to user-generated content as well as repurposed fare from media and entertainment companies.)Mr. Silverman and his staff — and the connections to talent they bring — are the attraction for MSN. Mr. Silverman's longtime relationship with Mr. Arnold, for example, helped interest the actor in the concept for the Web sitcom, tentatively titled ""Airplane."" And for ""Face Off,"" Reveille is working with Woody Thompson, a co-creator of ""Pop-Up Video,"" the VH1 creation in the 1990's that spurred a generation of wisecrackers to ironically and affectionately deconstruct the detritus of popular culture.""We told Woody, 'The same way you took on the static music video, you should be attacking this new medium,' "" Mr. Silverman said.MSN meanwhile has the distribution to get these new shows in front of millions of people, quickly. And MSN has plenty of knowledge about what their audience flocks to. Entertainment, for example, represents about half of the searches on MSN, according to Mr. Silverman. Knowing that tidbit helped Reveille decide to make the most-searched entertainment-related query become the topic for the debate of the day for ""Face Off.""MSN and Reveille executives understand that Web users want content they can snack on, and then — when the mood strikes and spare time materializes — immerse themselves in offshoots. That characteristic causes Mr. Silverman to rave about the possibilities of creating programming for the Web.""It's creativity without walls,"" Mr. Silverman said. ""You're never in one room.""'"
"'06-05-03,'0','That's a good characterization, even if Mr. Jaffe and his wife, Sandra, established Preservation Hall virtually by happenstance. They were new arrivals to New Orleans when they stumbled across the building on St. Peter Street; it was owned by the art dealer Larry Borenstein, who featured traditional jazz there on Sunday afternoons.The Jaffes took over and eventually expanded the series, with the guidance of knowledgeable locals like the historian Richard B. Allen. They also moved into a building at the back of the property, sleeping in a loft overlooking the garden patio of Pat O'Brien's, the famous French Quarter bar.Mr. Jaffe, a tuba player, organized the first of countless Preservation Hall band tours in 1964, advancing an international awareness of New Orleans legends like the clarinetist George Lewis and the husband-and-wife team of DeDe and Billie Pierce, a trumpeter and a pianist.Those legends can still be discerned in some murky portraits adorning the hall's interior. Last week there was also a wreath in the carriageway for Narvin Kimball, a banjoist and last founding member of the band, who died in March at 97. There was no conspicuous monument to Mr. Jaffe, who died in 1987, except his son Benjamin Jaffe, who plays bass and tuba, serves as musical director, organizes tours and generally maintains the hall.The younger Mr. Jaffe, who grew up a few blocks away in the Quarter, assumed stewardship of the organization after graduating from Oberlin Conservatory in 1993. He set about gently refurbishing both the hall and the band, buffing their image with small innovations: a flashy Web site, a start-up record label, a line of stylish T-shirts.""I see it as my father did, as a business,"" Mr. Jaffe said at Jazzfest, sitting cross-legged on a patch of grass next to a memorial wooden cutout of his father. But he also recalled his father's apprehensions about authorizing the first Preservation Hall T-shirt, roughly 25 years ago.The younger Mr. Jaffe, who recently retired from touring with the band to focus on administration as well as New Orleans recovery efforts, speaks passionately about his city's cultural traditions. But it is safe to say that without him, the Preservation Hall band would never have arranged a Kinks song, ""Complicated Life,"" featuring the vocalist Clint Maedgen, or shot a music video for the tune, which had its premiere at the reopening on Friday night.For now these flashes of pop culture — all draped, it should be said, in New Orleans finery — have yet to alienate fans like Shelly Gallichio of Tuscon, Ariz., who was at the hall on Friday for ""maybe the 50th time,"" or her husband, Ken Arnold,, who first encountered the band on his college campus in 1965.The band's current members are divided about the new musical directions; Mr. Jaffe's mother, Sandra, who keeps a close eye on the group, likens the departures to a classical artist's extracurricular activities, ""like Yo-Yo Ma doing bluegrass.""Hints of bluegrass could actually be heard at the hall on Sunday night, courtesy of an assemblage of musicians including the guitarist-singer J. J. Grey, of the band Mofro. The following night the room was packed again for a trio led by Stanton Moore, drummer for the New Orleans rock band Galactic. This weekend, in addition to sets by the traditional jazz trumpeter Greg Stafford, there will be a Saturday midnight show featuring a groove-minded crew called 504ever Allstars.Mr. Jaffe was quick to point out that all of these musicians had ""very strong ties to New Orleans."" And he expressed concerns that there still might not be enough local support to keep the hall afloat once Jazzfest's crowds dispersed. After this weekend Preservation Hall will feature music on Friday and Saturday nights — it used to close only on Mardi Gras — and will likely continue to court younger audiences, as a matter of survival.But not just survival, it seems. ""Why wouldn't Preservation Hall do a project with Tom Waits?"" Mr. Jaffe mused at the fairgrounds on Saturday. ""Or Bruce Springsteen? Or even the Edge, like we did the other day? I don't think I'm compromising the integrity of the band, as long as I'm staying true to the vision of Preservation Hall, which was originally, and always has been, to provide a place for New Orleans jazz musicians to perform.""The next day the Preservation Hall Jazz Band closed the festival's first weekend according to tradition, with ""When the Saints Go Marching In."" Its blithe polyphony accompanied a procession of bobbing parasols in the aisles. Of course not even Mr. Jaffe knew that Mr. Springsteen would shortly finish his own set across the fairgrounds with the same tune, in a fashion that was strikingly different but every bit as true.'"

Revenue climbed 29 percent, to 21.8 billion francs. The earnings exceeded the 2.04 billion francs expected by analysts.Revenue from trading equities almost doubled. Credit Suisse's private bank, a money manager for the rich, received 14.5 billion francs of new funds.The figures beat estimates because costs were lower than expected at the investment bank and revenue was higher, said Javier Lodeiro, an analyst in Zurich at Bank Sarasin.Profit from continuing operations at the investment bank rose 68 percent, to a record 1.56 billion francs in the quarter. Earnings at the private bank increased 34 percent, to 1.31 billion francs, led by a 50 percent gain in wealth management profit, to 963 million francs. Asset management earnings advanced 13 percent, to 234 million francs.Return on equity, a measure of profitability, rose to 24.4 percent in the first quarter, from about 21 percent a year earlier and from 11 percent in the fourth quarter.Revenue from equity trading rose 95 percent, to 2.08 billion francs, the fastest-growing business at the investment bank in the period.

McIntosh, after they had surrounded a trailer belonging to what one official called ""his baby's momma's sister."" Mr. McIntosh surrendered without incident, the authorities said, and the art was found some three miles away, still in the truck untouched.""The guy gave up,"" said Sgt. Keith Faulk, who works for the sheriff's office. ""He was a big ol' boy, too — 6-8, 280. I think he might have thought about slipping out. Then again we had the residence surrounded.""Mr. McIntosh, 36, had been missing since April 17, when he and his 24-foot Budget rental truck pulled out of Boca Raton with millions of dollars worth of art, including seven canvases by the Abstract Expressionist painter Milton Avery. He had been hired by David Jones Fine Art Services to deliver the art from private dealers and collectors — and at least one museum — in Boca Raton to a series of homes and galleries in New York.""He appeared to be very polite, very hardworking, you know, dependable,"" said Susan Buzzi, who works for David Jones.

"'06-05-04,'1','American workers were more productive in the first three months of the year than in the preceding quarter, the Labor Department reported today, and appear to have been rewarded well for it.Bucking a recent trend, the report showed workers' hourly compensation increased at an annual pace of 5.7 percent in the first quarter; adjusted for inflation compensation rose 3.6 percent. In the last three months of 2005, compensation fell 0.3 percent after accounting for inflation.Productivity, a ratio of output to hours worked, increased by 3.2 percent as output surged by 5.8 percent and hours worked increased by 2.5 percent. Some of the increase in productivity appears to reflect a recovery from the fourth quarter, when it fell by 0.3 percent because production was temporarily depressed by the effects of the hurricanes.Still, it seems clear to many economists that businesses continue to find ways to improve the efficiency of their operations more than four years into the current expansion. Productivity, which has eased from 4.1 percent in 2002 to 2.7 percent in 2005, typically slows as experienced workers become harder to find, as wages rise and as corporate cost cutting efforts end.The increase in compensation indicates that recent job growth is starting to tilt the balance of power between businesses and workers. Unit labor costs, a ratio of output to hourly compensation, jumped 2.5 percent in the first quarter.'"
"'06-05-04,'1','A summary of the top stories in the Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.The crash of an Armenian airliner in southern Russia, which killed all 113 aboard, led the newspapers. The airliner, an Airbus 320 belonging to Armavia airline, crashed into the Black Sea as it flew to the resort city of Sochi from Armenia's capital of Yerevan.Vremya Novostei reported that by Wednesday night, rescue workers had found 47 bodies and continued to search for the others as relatives waited anxiously for news.A team of experts has been assigned to investigate the the crash. ""We are considering two versions—technical problems and a mistake by the pilot,"" Izvestia quoted the prosecutor general in Krasnodar, the region's capital, Sergei Yeremin, as saying. A colleague of the crew, whom it did not name, said that they could not ""imagine that these people who knew the route like the back of their hands could make a mistake.""Kommersant reported that investigators suggested that the crewmembers' ""moral state"" had been affected by the fact that they had to turn back to Yerevan because of a storm, and that this might have caused them to falter. Vremya Novostei reported that reason for the crash would likely never be established conclusively.Vremya Novostei led with a photograph of distraught relatives. Many sat around an airport television, with their heads in their hands, consoling one another.

"'06-05-04,'1','Euronext, which comprises the Dutch, Belgian, French and Portuguese stock exchanges as well as derivatives markets in London and other cities, faced strong pressure from some of its shareholders to abandon the idea of bidding for the London exchange, in part because it would have been an expensive purchase.But analysts also said Euronext's decision to back away from bidding demonstrated the effectiveness of Nasdaq's strategy. Nasdaq's stake ""was always going to be a deterrent,"" said Michael Long, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London. Fending off other bidders ""was part of Nasdaq's intention, and they've succeeded,"" he said.Early last month, Euronext announced it would hold a vote on the principle of a tie-up with Deutsche Börse at its annual general meeting on May 23. But even that tentative step is far from straightforward.Last year, merger talks between French-run Euronext and Deutsche Börse hit obstacles, including differences over where the combined group would be located and what computer systems it would use. This time around, tensions already are surfacing over what model the combined exchanges would employ to process and settle trades.Euronext processes and settles trades through companies it does not control, LCH.Clearnet and Euroclear — a model strongly preferred by groups of British, French and Italian banks and by European Union single-market regulators. Deutsche Börse performs those tasks in-house, contributing to its overall profitability.On Wednesday, Euronext called a merger with Deutsche Börse ""a serious option"" but it discouraged shareholders from signing up to a deal before they had all the facts about how the combined company would operate.""Euronext is concerned not to restrict its flexibility during this period,"" the company said. Talks ""are therefore continuing, with a view to identifying the most attractive and value-creating transaction available.""In another sign that consolidation may be under way, some shareholders in the Borsa Italiana, based in Milan, are encouraging a deal with Euronext rather than a sale of shares in the exchange that had been planned for this year.Stefano Micossi, vice chairman of the Milan exchange's consultation committee, told Bloomberg News that he was ""100 percent convinced that the best solution for Borsa Italiana is integration under the Euronext umbrella.""With Nasdaq now seemingly in a strong position to take over the London exchange, and with merger concessions from Deutsche Börse uncertain, Euronext could be shying away from a deal with either of the exchanges. A tie-up with the Milan exchange, however, may be welcome.The role that the New York Stock Exchange could play in London or in Continental Europe is also unclear. In April, the New York exchange said it had recently held talks with rivals about an acquisition, but did not provide details.Many London exchange users expect Nasdaq to raise its stake to at least 20 percent in the near future, because at that threshold it can count some of the London exchange's revenue on its own balance sheet.Clara Furse, the chief executive of the London exchange, has not discussed Nasdaq's bid with her Nasdaq counterpart, Robert Greifeld. Ms. Furse wants the exchange to remain independent, according to several executives she has confided in. By putting off any face-to-face negotiations, she may also be driving the price higher, some analysts said.""If I were Clara, I would go sit on the beach for a month, and have people wire in their latest bids,"" said Douglas Atkin, chief executive of Majestic Research, an independent research firm. ""Not engaging is creating more of a frothy situation.""'"
"'06-05-04,'1','Venezuela's president, Hugo Chávez, who dreams of uniting Latin America as a buffer to United States influence, arrived in La Paz on Wednesday night and congratulated Bolivia's new president, Evo Morales, on the nationalization.As a first step, auditors from Petróleos de Venezuela, that nation's oil giant, visited three foreign companies in Bolivia and announced that they would be involved in the audits, an executive of one company said.The Venezuelan company is also providing technical help to Bolivian authorities and is to sign a contract to build a gas separation plant.Bolivian authorities seemed to underestimate the impact of the steps that Mr. Morales announced Monday, on their own government and on foreign companies, particularly for an impoverished country of just nine million people that is still far from being the energy giant it wishes to be.Bolivia may have Latin America's second-largest gas reserves, but much of its riches are far from being developed. The landlocked country also has limited sales outlets.It is a far cry from Venezuela, a major oil producer that has squeezed companies at will, with little chance that they will leave because of the huge profits to be made there.""It's one thing to produce petroleum at $72 a barrel and have access to many markets, and it's another thing to produce gas that has only one market in the region, Brazil,"" said Carlos Alberto López, a consultant for foreign oil companies.The decree puts the Bolivian government's energy firm, Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos, better known as Y.P.F.B., front and center. Instead of a small auditing firm, Yacimientos would, under Mr. Morales's decree, become an equal partner with giants like Repsol YPF S.A. of Spain and Total of France.In an interview, Jorge Alvarado, the president of the Bolivian company, who stood beside Mr. Soliz Rada at the news conference, admitted Yacimientos had no money. Asked how it would develop the country's gas fields if foreign investment evaporated, Mr. Alvarado said he was certain that foreign companies remained eager to continue in Bolivia.""I want to be sincere,"" he said. ""Y.P.F.B., because of the neoliberal model, has been reduced to a minimum. It has no economic resources. But we see that there is much interest by foreign companies that want to invest in the country.""Spain's prime minister, José Luis Zapatero, said the move could affect the amount of assistance Madrid provided to Bolivia, Agence France-Presse reported, and he is sending a delegation to La Paz to meet with officials.Energy companies are considering international arbitration or court fights.The Bolivian Chamber of Hydrocarbons, which represents the companies, said the decree could change the terrain for foreign companies for the worse. The chamber expressed concern that Bolivia was veering away from emphasizing the importance of contracts and investments.""It is the point of view of the chamber that the companies will not have the incentive to continue developing hydrocarbons,"" Enrique Menacho, the chamber's president, said in an interview.Petrobras, in a letter from its director in Bolivia to Mr. Alvarado, said that while the company would continue operating in Bolivia, it was worried about the decree, and he hinted that the company could take legal action to protect its investments.Under the decree, the state would be entitled to 82 percent of production in the biggest fields, up from the less than 18 percent the companies first agreed to when they began developing the fields.Yacimientos also would take a majority stake in three companies — Chaco, Andina and Transredes — that once were state-owned but are now run by foreign companies.Petrobras also appears to be losing control of two refineries, including the one where the briefing was held.On Thursday, Mr. Morales and Mr. Chávez are to travel together to Argentina and meet with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and President Nestór Kirchner of Argentina.At the briefing, Mr. Alvarado and Mr. Soliz Rada offered assurances that current contracts with the state still enjoyed legal security. But at the same time, they highlighted the new measures as a sign of dignity and sovereignty, and complained about the lack of Bolivian employees at foreign companies.""Give me the names of Bolivians in Transredes, in Chaco, in Andina,"" said Mr. Soliz Rada.Bolivian officials also contend that foreign oil companies, which have invested upwards of $4 billion since 1997, have recovered their money.It is an assertion that the companies deny. The Margarita field, for instance, operated by Repsol of Spain with its British partners, cost more than $300 million to develop.""You're just now going on market,"" said one foreign executive here who has worked on the project, asking that his name not be used for fear that his relationship with the government would be damaged. ""How can you say that the consortium has recovered their investment in Bolivia?""'"
"'06-05-04,'1','The Warner Music Group said yesterday that it had turned down a $4.2 billion takeover bid from the EMI Group, the latest twist in a lengthy dance between the corporate competitors.Warner Music said its board unanimously rejected EMI's cash-and-stock offer, which would have paid Warner $28.50 a share. EMI said its board ""continues to believe that an acquisition of Warner Music by EMI would be very attractive to both sets of shareholders.""People involved in the talks said they expected them to be restarted in the next several weeks. Most likely, they said, EMI would return to the bargaining table with an offer worth closer to $30 a share, which is believed to be the minimum price Warner Music has suggested it will be willing to consider.Warner Music's board evidently believes that it can extract a higher price. Warner's biggest investors — Edgar Bronfman Jr., Thomas H. Lee Partners, Providence Equity Partners and Bain Capital, among others — would prefer not just a higher offer, but one that includes more cash, rather than stock, people close to them said. In part, that reflects the fact that the investors were unable to sell as much of their stake as they had hoped when Warner made its initial public offering last May.Still, it remains unclear whether EMI can afford to pay much more than $30 a share, analysts and industry executives said. While EMI can probably afford to pay $30 a share in cash and stock, any more than that would stretch the company beyond its current debt-to-earnings ratio and would mean that the company would have to borrow more than $2 billion, or the equivalent of half of its own market value.'"
"'06-05-04,'1','In a statement released by his House office, Mr. Jefferson said he was ""surprised and disappointed to learn of Vernon Jackson's guilty plea and his characterization of our relationship."" He added, ""I have never over all the years of my public service accepted payment from anyone for the performance of any act or duty for which I have been elected.""The investigation of Mr. Jefferson, who is in his eighth term, has given Republican leaders an opportunity to try to divert public attention from recent federal corruption investigations involving House and Senate Republicans and their ties to corporate lobbyists.Jack Abramoff, a once-powerful lobbyist and Republican political fund-raiser, pleaded guilty in January to trying to corrupt public officials and has agreed to cooperate in investigations of several Congressional Republicans. In a separate inquiry, Representative Randy Cunningham, a California Republican known as Duke, pleaded guilty in November to taking $2.4 million in homes, yachts and other bribes, and resigned his seat.Mr. Jackson, the Kentucky businessman, faces up to 20 years in prison as a result of his guilty plea Wednesday.In court papers outlining his agreement with prosecutors, he acknowledged that he bribed Representative A for help to promote high-speed and broadband Internet technology developed by iGate. In exchange for the payments, the plea agreement says, Representative A helped iGate to obtain federal certification for the company, allowing its technology to be sold to the Defense Department and other agencies.The Justice Department said the bribes began in 2001 and were made to a company ""ostensibly maintained in the names of Representative A's spouse and children"" and were fraudulently described as consulting fees. ""In fact,"" the plea agreement said, ""those payments were designed to be in return for Representative A performing official acts in promoting iGate products and business.""In 2003, it said, Representative A traveled to Nigeria on official business and met with officials of a Nigerian television company to promote iGate's technology, an effort that resulted in an agreement by the Nigerian company to invest $45 million in a joint venture with iGate. That same year, the agreement said, the lawmaker visited the offices of the Export-Import Bank in Washington to introduce Mr. Jackson to the bank's officials ""for the purpose of promoting the Nigerian deal.""The court papers said iGate helped to sponsor and pay for a trip to Nigeria by Representative A, where he met with the country's president, vice president and chief commerce minister and ""promoted iGate"" and its communications technology.As part of the investigation, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Jefferson's homes in Washington and Louisiana last August. They also raided the Maryland home of Nigeria's vice president, Atiku Abubakar, citing warrants for documents linking him and his wife to Mr. Jefferson and the business deals.'"
"'06-05-04,'1','For Kohlberg Kravis, which remains a private firm, a public unit gives it access to permanent capital, instead of raising money for a fund with a limited shelf life.The offering is a flash point for private equity because of its size and because of the status of Kohlberg Kravis. But the idea itself is not new.Hundreds of publicly traded private equity funds are listed on global markets and together control an estimated $80 billion in capital. The majority of these funds are based outside the United States, and do deals in Britain and Europe.Private equity firms like Wendel Investissement and Eurazeo, both of France, and 3i Group of Britain control large publicly traded funds, or are themselves publicly traded. The growth in funds was sparked in part by British tax laws that favor publicly traded investment trusts. In Continental Europe, meanwhile, some well-established companies have transformed themselves from manufacturing or industrial companies into private equity investors, like Ratos of Sweden. They just kept their public listing.Managers of publicly trade funds say that the funds make it easier to attract cash.""Shareholders want to have the possibility to exit,"" said Ion Florescu, director of New Europe Capital. In December, New Europe listed Reconstruction Capital II, a fund that makes small buyouts in Romania on London's small-capitalization market, AIM.Some analysts say they believe that the number of these funds will increase substantially in coming years.""We are still at the beginning of this growing asset class,"" said Michèl Degoscui, a managing director at LPX, which in 2004 developed the first index for publicly traded private equity funds. The LPX50, which comprises the top 50 listed private equity funds, had a market capitalization of 46 billion euros ($58 billion) at the end of March. Last summer, banks started introducing financial products linked to it.Most of these listings are likely to happen in Europe, analysts said, in part because of the lighter regulatory burden. Private equity investors have swept through Europe in recent years, sometimes attracting criticism for their voracious appetite for deals.Last summer, German politicians called private equity firms and other foreign investors ""locusts."" At the same time, however, German investors were piling into LPX-indexed products, Mr. Degoscui said. Indeed, he contended, the criticism may have helped because ""everyone in Germany now knows what private equity is.""Mr. O'Hare of Private Equity Intelligence said: ""A lot of people are sitting on the sidelines with huge amounts to invest. They'd like to get involved in private equity, but so far they haven't.""Some American private equity firms have already tried a variation of the idea at home, with mixed results. In April 2004, Apollo Investment listed a business development company, or B.D.C., essentially a private equity fund, on Nasdaq, raising $900 million. Several other private equity firms filed registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission for their own B.D.C.'s, but most of them never actually listed.""They became unmarketable,"" said Edwin C. Pease, a partner with the law firm of Brown Rudnick in Boston, because the initial investors in the offering had to shoulder the costs of the underwriting. ""It was flavor of the month, and it didn't catch on,"" he said.The Kohlberg Kravis fund is slightly different in the way that fees are paid out and cash moves around, potential investors said. Exactly how was unclear: the firm was not distributing prospectuses of the offering yesterday, nor were the banks who underwrote it.""Whether it is repeatable remains to be seen"" as well as whether there is significant demand beyond what KKR raised, said Erik R. Hirsch, chief investment officer for Hamilton Lane, a private equity asset management firm.'"
"'06-05-04,'1','""The governor hasn't pardoned anyone, be it alive or deceased,"" said Mr. Barbour's spokesman, Pete Smith. ""The governor isn't going to issue a pardon here.""Mr. Smith added that a pardon would be an empty gesture.""The governor believes that Clyde Kennard was wronged, and if he were alive today his rights would be restored,"" Mr. Smith said. ""There's nothing the governor can do for Clyde Kennard right now.""Mr. Kennard's case, which was the subject of a recent three-month investigation by The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss., has also been pursued by students at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Ill., and the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's law school, in Chicago. Several of the students involved said they were baffled by Mr. Barbour's response.""Please,"" said Mona Ghadiri, 17, a senior at Stevenson High, addressing Governor Barbour, ""if you are going to say no, at least give us a decent reason.""The only evidence against Mr. Kennard was the testimony of a black man named Johnny Lee Roberts, then 19, who said that Mr. Kennard, 33, had asked him to steal the chicken feed. Mr. Roberts, who did the stealing, received a suspended sentence. Mr. Kennard, convicted as an accessory, got a year for every $3.57 of feed.Mr. Roberts has recanted, first to Jerry Mitchell of The Clarion-Ledger and then in a sworn statement before a judge.""Kennard did not ask me to steal,"" Mr. Roberts said in the sworn statement. ""Kennard did not ask me to do anything illegal. Kennard is not guilty of burglary or any other crime.""""I have always felt bad about what happened to Clyde,"" Mr. Roberts continued. ""He was a good man.""Joyce A. Ladner, a sociologist, remembered being mentored by Mr. Kennard when she was a teenager. ""He was a quiet, very dignified guy, a real gentleman,"" Ms. Ladner said of Mr. Kennard.Aubrey K. Lucas, the director of admissions at the college when Mr. Kennard applied, recalled in an interview that it was the governor, J. P. Coleman, who decided against admitting Mr. Kennard.That was a mistake, said Mr. Lucas, who went on to be president of what became the University of Southern Mississippi. ""Kennard would have been the perfect person to integrate this university,"" Mr. Lucas said. ""He didn't bring attorneys with him. He didn't bring the N.A.A.C.P. leadership.""There was little question of Mr. Kennard's qualifications.""Everybody who knew him refers to him as brilliant — not as a smart man but as a brilliant man,"" said Barry Bradford, the teacher at Stevenson High who directed its project on Mr. Kennard, available at www.clydekennard.org.State authorities had a different reaction. The files of the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, the state's segregationist spy agency, show that killing or framing Mr. Kennard was openly discussed as preferable to allowing him to enroll at the college.March 30 was Clyde Kennard Day in Mississippi, and Governor Barbour issued a proclamation. He urged citizens to remember Mr. Kennard's ""determination, the injustices he suffered, and his significant role in the history of the civil rights movement in Mississippi.""There has apparently never been a posthumous pardon in Mississippi, but there have been such pardons in 10 other states and in the federal system. Yesterday, Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana posthumously pardoned 78 people convicted of sedition early in the last century.Mr. Lucas said pardoning Mr. Kennard might cost Mr. Barbour a few votes.""There are some people around here still,"" Mr. Lucas said, ""who think we should be separate as races and who refuse to see the errors of our past. But I can't imagine it would be a factor in his re-election.""'"
"'06-05-04,'1','Since last May, when President Jacques Chirac appointed Mr. de Villepin as prime minister and asked Mr. Sarkozy back into the government as interior minister — after having forced him out because of his naked presidential ambitions months earlier — the government has been increasingly dysfunctional.Mr. Chirac favors Mr. de Villepin as his successor, but Mr. Sarkozy has adeptly outmaneuvered the two men. Les Échos, a financial newspaper, proclaimed Wednesday that the Villepin-Sarkozy rivalry had become an outright war.That war heated up Wednesday with Le Monde's partial transcript of notes taken by an intelligence officer, Gen. Philippe Rondot, during a meeting with Mr. de Villepin when he was foreign minister about investigating corruption allegations. That transcript put earlier leaked citations from the notes into fuller and more damning context.The matter began in 2004 when anonymous allegations were sent in the form of a CD-ROM to an investigating judge. On it Mr. Sarkozy and other politicians were listed as beneficiaries of kickbacks paid in the sale of French frigates to Taiwan in 1991. The list included secret bank accounts at Clearstream, a financial clearinghouse based in Luxembourg, which had earlier been the subject of broad corruption charges.Investigators quickly determined that the information on the CD-ROM was false. But a subsequent investigation into who was behind the attempted smear campaign raised questions about whether Mr. de Villepin had used those allegations as an excuse to investigate his rivals.In the 2004 meeting, Mr. de Villepin talked to General Rondot about initiating an investigation of whether the accounts mentioned on the CD-ROM were real.The general carried out an inquiry and determined that they were not. But his notes from the 2004 meeting were later seized by investigators, and last week abbreviated leaks from the notes suggested that Mr. de Villepin had raised Mr. Sarkozy's name in the meeting, though the context was not clear.In a statement issued Friday, Mr. de Villepin categorically denied he had asked General Rondot to investigate Mr. Sarkozy or any other politician. ""We never spoke about Nicolas Sarkozy as a possible beneficiary of a foreign bank account,"" he said.On Tuesday, the general told Le Figaro that although Mr. Sarkozy's name had been mentioned, Mr. de Villepin had not asked him to investigate Mr. Sarkozy specifically. But the fuller transcript of the general's notes in Le Monde refers repeatedly to Mr. Sarkozy, at one point noting, ""The political stake: Nicolas Sarkozy.""Another notation reads, ""Comes back to Nicolas Sarkozy in China — financial interest?"" and a reference to the alleged Clearstream accounts reads, ""Account linked Nicolas Sarkozy, Stéphane Bocza — to be verified."" Stéphane Bocza is part of Mr. Sarkozy's full name.The notes, Le Monde wrote, make it ""clear beyond doubt that Mr. Sarkozy was the subject of a large part"" of the 2004 meeting.'"

Spam filters work by analyzing incoming messages for certain characteristics common in unsolicited bulk e-mail, like multiple addressees or certain words in the message's subject line, and then diverting suspect messages into a special Junk or Spam folder. Some spam-catching software can be a little overzealous at first, though, and put mail from people you'd actually like to hear from into your Junk folder.Whether you have a separate anti- spam program or e-mail software that can filter junk mail, you should be able to adjust the program to allow messages you actually want into your in-box. Most spam filters let you adjust their overall settings in the program's preferences to be more or less vigilant when screening your mail, although it may take some tinkering to get accurate filtering.In most programs, you can also tag messages to be junk or not junk. This teaches the program to let mail from certain addresses through while showing it the kinds of messages you consider to be spam. If you don't see a Junk button on your mail program's toolbar to click when you have spam in your in-box, try right-clicking on the message and looking for an option to tag the messages as spam.If you find messages from friends that have landed in your Junk folder, select them, right-click and look for a menu option like ""This is not spam"" to tell the program not to block messages from that sender.Q. Is it really necessary to use the Safely Remove Hardware icon to unplug a U.S.B. flash drive, or can you just pull it out of the port?A. It's always a good idea to eject an external drive or device properly from both Windows and Macintosh computers. This can help prevent scrambled data or system problems that might occur if you detach the device without warning.When you copy or drag files over to a device like a pocket-size U.S.B. drive, the files may not transfer immediately and may sit in a buffer area for a short time if the computer is busy doing other things. If you disconnect your portable drive without telling the operating system what you are doing, any files in the process of being copied to the portable drive could become damaged or corrupted.In Windows XP, click the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the Taskbar (which looks like a green arrow pointing at a downward angle) to release the drive correctly. You can also right-click on the icon to get a list of attached devices if you have several connected.There are several ways to disconnect a drive in Mac OS X computer. You can click on the U.S.B. device's icon on the desktop and press Command-E on the keyboard. Or, if you have the Mac's Finder window open, you can click the Eject button next to the list of drives in the side of the window.'"
"'06-05-04,'1','It's not often that concertgoers in New York can hear a singer of the renown of the baritone Thomas Hampson in a recital hall that seats only 280. But the Morgan Library and Museum, which this weekend opened the doors to a splendid new pavilion that unites its existing and expanded building, wanted to call attention to a special component of its new campus: Gilder Lehrman Hall, a new space for chamber music, recitals, lectures and readings. So the Morgan secured the services of Mr. Hampson, along with the pianist Craig Rutenberg, a noted accompanist and opera coach, and the Vermeer String Quartet, to inaugurate the hall with an engaging program on Tuesday night.New York has few intimate and acoustically appealing halls in the 250-seat range. The Morgan is hoping that its handsome space — designed, like the pavilion, by the architect Renzo Piano — will become a valuable resource. It usually takes concertgoers (this one, at least) time to assess the acoustics and qualities of a new hall. But it's clear from the get-go that this one will be welcomed by the music lovers in the city.It is located in the lower basement area of the new complex. You enter through the airy glass-enclosed pavilion and can either walk down an elegant winding staircase or take the roomy elevators. The hall is raked at a steep angle, which means that sightlines are excellent from every seat. The stage area can be reconfigured so that the hall can accommodate 240 to 280 people.The walls are made of lovely cherry wood, and the cushioned seats are colored what could be called Roman Catholic Cardinal Red. Those who like their mattresses extra firm will be at home in these seats. The Morgan might have chosen to eliminate two or three rows to create a bit more legroom. At just over six feet, I was comfortable. But those who are as tall as, say, Mr. Hampson may feel cramped. Because of the significant slope of the raked floor, the back rows do feel somewhat far from the stage for such an essentially intimate space. Still, the hall is inviting and attractive.So the big question, as always: How are the acoustics? In designing the hall Mr. Piano worked with Eckhard Kahle of Kahle Acoustics in Brussels. As in many modern halls, the acoustics are bright and resonant, rather than warm and rich. The Vermeer Quartet began the program with Schumann's String Quartet in A (Op. 41, No. 3). It is always involving to hear a string quartet up close, and the sound enveloped you the way it never can in a large recital hall.'"
"'06-05-04,'1','One day I wore a pair of black jeans from a new label called Cheap Monday. They sell for $65 — hence the name — at a handful of retailers like Seven New York and Colette in Paris. The jeans stretched over my calves and bunched up at the knees like black earthworms, but they had the desired effect, drawing comments about Iggy Pop, Nick Cave and the Ramones. People stopped to reminisce about buying skinny jeans at places like Trash and Vaudeville or Lip Service.But before long my lower back was aching inexplicably, perhaps from too much pressure on my spine, and all of the teasing about Keith Richards made my head ache (though not as badly as his). The skinny jeans had a life of their own, one that was exhausting and seemed to call for a lifestyle more exciting than spending Thursday nights at doggie obedience school.""I have a saying that is ridiculous, but true,"" said Jonny Johansson, the creative director of Acne. ""That is, 'Jeans are the perfect canvas for everything.' Pop culture, from the 50's with Marilyn Monroe and James Dean, and every interesting subculture that has happened since then, is built on an image of jeans. It is the most generic product and the most interesting product at the same time.""There are high-concept skinny jeans from Rick Owens with seams that trace the quadriceps. There are skinny jeans from Alexander McQueen that are stained to appear as if they had grown mold; these are sold with a disclaimer that says, ""This denim may leave traces of color when it comes in contact with light clothing and furnishing fabrics."" The Dior Homme designer Hedi Slimane, who gave wings to the louche aesthetic with his springtime homage to Pete Doherty, offers whiskered rock jeans in pale pink and pistachio, for $580.Karl Lagerfeld's new collection includes skinny jeans sewn in Frankenstein patches, and John Varvatos designed a style that is a hybrid: roomy up top and strangling around the calves. Some feel nice for a few moments, as if your legs are being gently hugged into shape, but after walking a block, they become as claustrophobia-inducing as a fierce case of static cling. When I tried on a pair of Tsubi jeans in my normal waist size (30, thank you), I could barely button them, then turned around to discover the denim equivalent of a double chin.After a day or two of wearing size 32 Tsubis (with stretch), I began to notice double takes from people on the street and started to feel like a pervert. The jeans stirred up body issues I never knew I had. By Friday I considered the possibility that I had become fat. To hide myself, I wore a boxy jacket and claimed it was part of the 80's trend.""Some guys are just not comfortable being that well defined,"" said Alexandre Plokhov, the designer of the men's wear line Cloak. ""But skinny jeans are pretty much a backlash against the boot-leg cut. When all the masses go right, a few people will go left.""For his store on Greene Street, Mr. Plokhov produced 200 pairs of a skinny style made of Japanese selvage denim with straight seams and trouser pockets that seem to magically eliminate unsightly bulges. At $390, they had nearly sold out.Mr. Plokhov said he was surprised by the reaction, but mainstream denim makers suggest that more than a few people are going left. Greg Chait, the chief executive of Tsubi in the United States, said the company will sell $20 million in skinny jeans this year, about 40 percent of them for men. Tsubi's most popular styles, Dee Dee and Joey, both skinny, high-waist cuts, are named after members of the Ramones.The market for denim styles with escalating prices has become so sophisticated that some companies claim to be able to predict where the skinny trend will lead. ""Somewhere between October and next February, it will hit all parts of the country,"" said Jeff Rudes, the president of J Brand, which expects to ship more than 140,000 pairs of skinny women's jeans this year, with leg openings as narrow as 10 inches around. ""This cycle is then good for 18 months to two years. It can't get any narrower than this without stopping blood flow.""I understood what he meant when I tried on the Acne jeans at Barneys. A mirror revealed that the results were not so much ""Rebel Without a Cause"" skinny as they were ""West Side Story"" unseemly. I blame the jeans.'"
"'06-05-04,'1','The treatments are gaining popularity because this season's shoes, including open-toed platform wedges and designer sandals, are exposing feet to intense scrutiny.""The more the shoe style is open and revealing, the more it requires an immaculate foot,"" said Ed Burstell, the senior vice president for beauty and accessories at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan. He has a list of dozens of people waiting for $300 appointments with Bastien Gonzalez, a pedicurist based in Paris and London, who treats clients at the store several times a year.A medical pedicure, despite its surgical-sounding name, is usually a noninvasive treatment that focuses on the aesthetics of the toenails and the soles of the feet.""A medical pedicure is a good old-school pedicure with elbow grease,"" said Erica Marton, a pedicurist who works at Sally Hershberger Face Place on West 14th Street. ""It's the way they used to do it before spas brought in fancy stuff like milk baths, salt scrubs and floating rose petals that don't really do a lot to help your feet.""She described her pedicure as purely cosmetic. But some spas do offer pedicures for foot problems.For $100, the Mezzanine Spa in SoHo offers a ""special European medical pedicure"" during which Maria Kovacs, the spa's pedicurist, says she regularly treats problems like corns. A licensed aesthetician, she is a medical assistant to the spa's medical director, Dr. Laurie J. Polis, a dermatologist.""I have a special sharp knife to cut off corns and dig them out and other special instruments for ingrown toenails,"" Ms. Kovacs said. New York State prohibits aestheticians from using sharp instruments like pedicure knives, which could pierce the skin. Dr. Polis said the pedicure instruments Ms. Kovacs uses are not knives, but scrapers for removing dead skin.""Nothing pierces the skin,"" Dr. Polis said. ""She is not allowed to cut into the dermis. But under my umbrella she is allowed to remove calluses and corns.""But podiatrists say foot problems are better left to medical professionals.""You want your corns and calluses trimmed by a doctor as opposed to a manicurist,"" said Dr. Jane E. Andersen, a podiatrist in Chapel Hill, N.C., who is a spokeswoman for the American Podiatric Medical Association. Corns or calluses may require special orthotics like shoe inserts or indicate that more serious medical treatment is needed, she said.Mr. Rousseau describes his scalpel-free pedicures as boot camp for the feet. He avoids footbaths because, he said, immersing the feet in water gives a false sense of softened skin. He offers dry pedicures so that ""what you get is what you get.""Mr. Rousseau spent two hours toning up Ms. Kooper's feet while she relaxed in a leather chair she called her throne. First he removed her old nail polish. Then he coated her toenails and cuticles with Vitamin E oil to soften them.Next, he shaped her toenails with a file. Nail tips can be shaped into flat square cuts, rounded ends or ""squovals,"" a manicure term meaning nails that are square on top and slightly rounded at the edges, he said.The hard skin that forms on the feet in response to pressure or repeated activity is necessary to protect underlying layers of skin, so Mr. Rousseau was careful to file away enough to soften Ms. Kooper's feet, but not so much as to leave them vulnerable.Then he swabbed under the tips of her nails with cotton dipped into an antibacterial solution and buffed her toenails until they shone. To finish, he coated her nails with a sheer pale pink polish.At the Warren-Tricomi Salon on West 57th Street, where Mr. Rousseau works one day a week, his pedicures cost $80. But Ms. Kooper prefers his $125 home visits so he can devote more time and attention to her feet.Valerie Steele, the director and chief curator of the Museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, said that with flip-flops and other shoe styles that expose the toes for all to see, flawless feet have become a status symbol.""Having perfectly groomed feet indicates that you have the money and the time to make the effort and that you have the social polish to know you should be up to peak standards,"" said Ms. Steele, the author of ""Shoes: A Lexicon of Style.""Public scrutiny isn't the only reason women are opting for more elaborate pedicures, she said. ""You should not underestimate the genuine aesthetic pleasure one gets,"" she said, ""from looking down 20 times a day at your own little jewel-like toes.""'"
"'06-05-04,'1','Aaron, who hit his 712th on a Saturday night in Houston, returned to Atlanta for the final week of the 1973 season, when some 15 out-of-town reporters and a few cameras had gathered for the countdown, but Atlanta itself didn't seem to care.In the hours before two midweek games attracted crowds of 10,211 and 5,711, Aaron sat at his locker and talked casually and easily with the reporters until it was time for batting practice. With a smile, he picked up his bat and said, ""Let me go hit.""Attendance improved. Aaron hit his 713th homer off the Astros left-hander Jerry Reuss before 17,836 on a Saturday night. During the season finale Sunday afternoon, 40,517 held their breath whenever Aaron swung. Three singles lifted his average to .301 with 40 homers and 96 runs batted in, quite a season for a 39-year-old outfielder.But in the off-season, he would wonder about the dozens, if not hundreds, of death threats among the thousands of letters and packages he received and eventually saved. Most were encouraging, like the youngster's letter that read, ""I hope you beat that other guy in homers."" Many other letters warned that he would be shot.""I can't go into hibernation now,"" Aaron said. ""I can't hide. I've said that all I have to do to break Babe Ruth's record is to stay alive, but I got to live my life.""Aaron later became a prosperous auto dealer in Atlanta, but with an estimated $200,000 salary in 1973, he drove a Chevrolet Caprice that ""gets me around.""As the 1974 season approached, the Braves announced that they would not play Aaron in the opening three-game series in Cincinnati, thereby ensuring that he would not tie or break the record until the Braves' home opener. Stirred by criticism in the news media, Kuhn objected; he expected Aaron to play at least two of the three games in Cincinnati.On his first swing against the Reds right-hander Jack Billingham in the season opener, Aaron walloped his 714th homer, tying the Babe's record. But after Aaron was kept out of the lineup for Saturday's game, Kuhn telephoned Braves Manager Eddie Mathews with a direct order to start Aaron in Sunday's game or face ""serious penalties."" Aaron struck out twice and grounded out.Kuhn had been expected to be in Atlanta for the Braves' opener, but strangely, he didn't show. His explanation was that he had a previous commitment in Cleveland.With the Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander Al Downing pitching carefully before a hushed 53,775 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, Aaron took a called strike before walking. His next time up, he shattered the silence with his first swing, a thunderclap that propelled his 715th homer over the fence in left-center field into the Braves' bullpen, where Tom House caught the ball.Fireworks and cheers accompanied Aaron in his head-up, elbows-back trot. When two teenagers joined Aaron, Calvin Wardlaw, an Atlanta police detective the team had hired to travel with Aaron, wondered what those kids might be up to and gripped the .38 that he carried, but he didn't flash it.

"'06-05-05,'1','Somebody wake up Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice; swinging is back.Of course it never left in some quarters, and it never stopped being a subject of filmmakers aiming for the male-fantasy crowd. Which is what is so stunning, and not in a good way, about ""Kiss Me Again,"" a first-time feature by William Tyler Smith: he seems not to realize just how tired the notion of married folk deciding jointly to experiment with other partners is. The movie is so earnest that it's embarrassing.You can tell just how earnest from the names of the main characters. No unpretentious Bob or Alice here; the husband and wife at the heart of ""Kiss Me Again"" are Julian (Jeremy London) and — ugh — Chalice (Katheryn Winnick).Chalice is a wife right from the In Your Dreams Men's Catalog: she's gorgeous and smart, except when her husband suggests that they get another woman into their bed with them, at which time she turns Stepford and says, in effect, ""Sure, if that would please you, hon."" Julian, a college professor, has already picked out his auxiliary babe (Mirelly Taylor) from among his students. Things of course don't go quite as Julian envisioned. Lessons are learned.Making this all the more painful is the dreadful miscasting of Mr. London, who calls to mind the young Dan Aykroyd, perpetual smug grin and unconscious mugging for the camera included. It says something about the performances here that Darrell Hammond, the ""Saturday Night Live"" veteran, in a supporting role, comes off looking like the seasoned actor.Directed by William Tyler Smith; written by J.

"'06-05-05,'1','IT would be a stretch to say that Tom Cruise needs a hit. What this guy needs is an intervention, someone who can help the star once known as Tom Terrific return to the glory days, when the only things most of us really knew about him came from the boilerplate continually recycled in glossy magazines, sealing him in a bubble of blandness and mystery. In those days, we didn't know that inside the world's biggest movie draw lurked a reckless couch-jumper and heartless amateur pharmacologist. All we saw was a billion-dollar smile and a performer who risked life and limb, everything but his own true self, for our movie-going pleasure.Until the ascendancy of George Clooney, the multi-hyphenated sex bomb (he walks, he talks, he smiles and he thinks!), few stars seemed to work harder than Mr. Cruise. The embodiment of the 1990's extreme ethos, he could be counted on to hang tougher than anyone else, whether doing his own stunts, spending a couple of years in production with Stanley Kubrick, or, as he did on more than one occasion, rescuing a civilian. Recently, though, all that extremeness has seemed, well, too extreme. And you have to wonder if the real mission in his newest film isn't the search for the damsel in distress or the hunt for the supervillain, but the resurrection of a screen attraction who has, of late, seemed a bit of a freak.Aptly named or not, ""Mission: Impossible III"" may emerge as Mr. Cruise's latest box-office triumph, but it won't do him any favors when it comes to his public persona, since it appears to have been explicitly tailored to reflect his personal life, or at least its outward face. As he has in the first two ""Mission"" films, Mr. Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of a stealth government agency, the Impossible Mission Force, who circumnavigates the world, blowing stuff up to wage battle against all manner of wickedness. Again he racks up miles (Berlin, Rome, Shanghai) and lights a few fuses, including that of a humorously decadent arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), but this time he also has a main squeeze, Julia (the welcome if badly used Michelle Monaghan).The overlap between a star's private and public selves can add frisson to the screen, especially when the luminaries are Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, but it can prove deleterious, especially when it reeks of public relations. ""Mission: Impossible III"" opens in medias res with a screaming match between Ethan, who's actually doing all the screaming, and Davian, who's holding a gun on a woman. ""I am going to kill you!"" Ethan shouts, limbs bound and tendons jumping. Alas, before that happens, the director J. J. Abrams, who wrote the script with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, backtracks to an engagement party, where, tendons at ease and smile blasting, Ethan is playing the aggressively jubilant fiancé, all but shrieking, ""I am going to marry her!""Viewer, he does. In between communiqués with his agency superiors (Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne), a rescue mission (hence, Keri Russell from ""Felicity"") and pyrotechnic larks with his newest team (Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, the decorative Hong Kong transplant Maggie Q), Ethan settles into domesticity, an endeavor interrupted when Julia is kidnapped by a malevolently aggrieved Davian. Mr. Hoffman isn't given all that much to do in the film, but what he does is choice. With a sneer in his voice and a lazy slouch that telegraphs world-weariness of the most misanthropic kind, he creates an ice-blooded creature who seems as if he would like nothing better than to destroy the earth, and with as much human suffering as possible. The too-few scenes of Mr. Hoffman going directly up against Mr. Cruise are particularly tasty.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','The parent of the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE Group, said yesterday that shareholders had sold 25 million shares at $61.50 each for a total of $1.54 billion, less than two months after the Big Board went public. Shareholders involved in the sale include the Goldman Sachs Group and Merrill Lynch, as well as executives of the NYSE Group.The offering, the first of its kind for the NYSE Group, covered nearly one-sixth of outstanding shares. The NYSE Group will receive no proceeds from the offering, which was arranged by J. P.

As of April 17, about 1,328 shareholders owned roughly 155.6 million outstanding shares in the NYSE Group, a regulatory filing shows.

"'06-05-05,'1','The industrial conglomerate Tyco International reported that its quarterly profit more than quadrupled yesterday, helped by its engineered products division, but it cut its forecast for full-year earnings, citing soaring copper prices.Net income rose to $1.02 billion, or 49 cents a share, from $192 million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier, when it took a one-time charge of 29 cents a share to retire debt.Earnings from continuing operations were $1.08 billion, or 52 cents a share, up from $399 million, or 19 cents a share. The most recent quarter included a gain of 7 cents a share related to taxes and divestitures. Sales in the period, which ended March 31 and was the second quarter of Tyco's fiscal year, were up 2 percent, to $10.21 billion, matching Wall Street estimates.The company projected full-year earnings of $1.80 to $1.85 a share, down from a forecast in February of $1.85 to $1.92 a share. The company blamed copper prices for its lowered forecast.""There's really only one change, and that's copper,"" the chief executive, Edward D. Breen, said in a conference call.

"'06-05-05,'1','The more the federal government tells us how to prepare for a possible avian flu pandemic, the more apparent it becomes that we won't be prepared anytime soon. If a pandemic hits within the next several years, it will be up to hospitals, doctors, public health agencies and ordinary people to muddle through as best they can — with guidance, but little money, from the federal government.The latest advice from the federal government, in a plan issued this week, makes it clear that a worst-case pandemic would indeed be bad. A third of the population might become infected, two million Americans might die, and 40 percent of the work force might be out of commission at the height of the outbreak. Nobody has the foggiest idea whether a pandemic will arrive in the near future or how severe one might be, but federal officials argue, persuasively, that we have to brace ourselves for the worst.The 227-page document usefully spells out some 300 actions to be taken by federal agencies and the timetables for achieving them. It also offers advice to businesses, schools, individuals and others in the private sector. All of this is to the good. It makes sense to think through problems in advance rather than in the midst of a raging pandemic.What troubles us most is what looks like a less-than-urgent push to develop a new vaccine production capacity that can quickly respond to an emergency. There is no overstating the importance of effective vaccines; they could greatly reduce the need for other costly and less effective measures to deal with a lethal new virus. To its credit, the Bush administration, as part of its $7.1 billion preparedness plan, has poured substantial money into developing and procuring vaccines and antiviral drugs. But its primary goal — to expand and modernize domestic production capacity to make enough vaccine for all Americans within six months — seems as distant as ever. Last fall officials said that goal might be reached in four to five years. Half a year later, the target is still five years away, and is contingent on future appropriations and the responsiveness of vaccine makers. Congress needs to look hard to see whether a more aggressive effort might convert the industry more quickly.Meanwhile, the burden of caring for the sickest patients would fall on the nation's hospitals. Most of us probably assume that should we get sick, our local hospitals would of course take us in. But that confidence may be misplaced. The federal government has offered many pages of advice on what hospitals should do to prepare, but precious little money to help them do it. Given that many hospitals are already on the financial ropes, with their emergency rooms clogged, it seems unlikely that they could handle a sudden onslaught of very ill patients.Some experts are estimating that $5 billion may be needed to get all hospitals prepared. That is a hefty sum that no one seems eager to pay — and all the more reason to get cracking on a faster way to make vaccines.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','The idea has gained popularity among several Asian finance ministers as a step toward harmonizing regional monetary policies.The development bank's Japanese president, Haruhiko Kuroda, a supporter of an Asian monetary union, had pledged to propose the creation of an A.C.U. at the meeting in Hyderabad, but reportedly held back in light of opposition from Washington.""From the Americans there was an outcry, seeing it as a danger to the dollar,"" Volker Ducklau, the Asian Development Bank's executive director for Germany and Britain, told Emerging Markets, a newsletter published during bank meetings.The United States and Japan are the two largest shareholders in the bank, each with a 12.85 percent stake.Senior Treasury officials denied that the United States had expressed concern about Asian currency linkage.""We don't oppose it,""' said Timothy D. Adams, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs. ""I have no concerns about this issue.""The Asian currency unit initiative is now backed by the so-called Asean Plus 3 grouping, which comprises the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan and South Korea. The Hyderabad statement was issued after a meeting of Asean Plus 3 finance ministers.Though billed as a small step, the idea of an Asian currency unit mirrors early moves made toward the euro. First, European countries devised a valueless measurement unit reflecting relative currency fluctuations. They then began aligning exchange rates and altering monetary policy to keep those rates in line, a process that took decades. The euro finally emerged as a currency in January 2002.The announcement on Thursday came as the United States appeared increasingly isolated from Asian and European nations on a related issue: whether, and how quickly, China should let its currency appreciate. Washington accuses Beijing of keeping the yuan artificially undervalued to subsidize its exports while deterring imports.""Let markets work,"" Mr. Adams, the Treasury official, said during a meeting on trade imbalances here, arguing that Beijing should allow the yuan to float freely as soon as possible.But senior finance officials from Japan and Germany appeared to echo the Chinese view that structural reform, rather than quick-fix currency changes, offered the only real answer to global trade imbalances. They saw high savings rates and inefficient use of capital in Japan and China, ballooning fiscal deficits in the United States and languishing European demand as more significant problems than the value of the Chinese currency.Currency disputes ""might distract our attention from fundamental structural problems,"" said Japan's finance minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, May 4 — In the halls of the State Capitol in Sacramento, the legislation on ultrasound machines is known as the ""Tom Cruise bill.""Mr. Cruise, who is busy promoting his latest movie, had no involvement in drafting the measure, and the agency representing him declined to comment on it Thursday. Rather, as these things sometimes go in the jumble of Hollywood celebrity and California politics, the bill has simply attached itself to him.""The ultrasound machine was never intended as a toy for the rich and famous,"" said the measure's author, Assemblyman Ted W. Lieu, a Democrat from suburban Los Angeles.Mr. Lieu's bill, which passed the Assembly on Thursday by a vote of 55 to 7 and is now headed to the State Senate, would ban the sale or distribution of ultrasound machines to anyone other than a licensed medical professional. The measure is intended to block parents-to-be from using the devices to create home sonograms and, in the process, possibly harming the development of the fetus.The authorities in California have not reported a rash of amateur uses of ultrasound machines, but the one widely reported celebrity use stirred the Sacramento lawmakers to action. Last year, Mr. Cruise bought one of the machines for home viewing of the fetus carried by his fiancée, the actress Katie Holmes. Their daughter was born on April 18.Supporters of the bill, which include the California Medical Association, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and a number of legislators who are medical doctors, said the bill would guard against the improper use of a device with a potential for danger.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','KABUL, Afghanistan, May 4 — Britain took command of the NATO peacekeeping force in Afghanistan on Thursday, in preparation for the expansion of its role into the turbulent southern and southeastern areas of the country in what a NATO representative called the alliance's most challenging operation to date.Lt. Gen. David Richards assumed command in a short ceremony at which he issued a warning to insurgents that he intended to build a strong security force with NATO and American forces under a unified command. General Richards took charge immediately of 9,000 troops of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force stationed here in the capital and the northern and western parts of the country, where their focus is on supporting reconstruction activities. By the end of July, he will assume command of NATO and other forces in southern Afghanistan, adding combat operations against insurgents.The arrival of some 6,000 NATO troops in the south will allow the United States to reduce its force of 19,000 troops by 2,000 to 3,000 in August. American forces will remain in the border provinces of eastern Afghanistan and are expected to come under the NATO flag by November, giving General Richards command of the military force across the country.""It will be NATO's most challenging ground operation ever,"" Hikmet Cetin, the alliance's civilian representative in Afghanistan, said at a news briefing after the ceremony. ""NATO cannot afford to fail in Afghanistan, for the whole world and the whole region.""He said the alliance was sending its elite force, the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, to take on the task.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','He has compiled a long record with city and federal housing authorities. ""Baruch Singer has a long history of putting tenants at jeopardy,"" said Jonathan Rosen, a spokesman for Housing Here and Now, a coalition of tenants, housing advocates, labor unions and clergy members. ""He has among the worst records of any landlord in the city of complying with the housing code and ensuring that his buildings are safe and habitable.""In 1995, part of a Harlem building on which Mr. Singer held the mortgage collapsed, throwing sleeping tenants to the ground. Three people died. Mr. Baruch was not charged because the collapse was deemed to be not ""reasonably foreseeable,"" prosecutors said at the time.In 1999, Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, sponsored a bill that would have allowed Mr. Singer to buy back a Harlem building that was seized because he failed to pay taxes. Mr. Silver later said that Mr. Singer's father — Yitzchok Singer, the rabbi at Mr. Silver's synagogue — had asked him to help. The rabbi later denied that he had asked for Mr. Silver's help.At the time, Mr. Singer was the subject of a series of scathing articles in The New York Post that described aggressive tactics he was said to have used in his real estate dealings, including overcharging tenants, refusing to make repairs, and using two pit bulls to scare unwanted tenants into leaving.Mr. Singer did not return calls for comment. His lawyer, David Jaroslawicz, said yesterday: ""Singer doesn't own a dog. He has never, ever owned a dog in his life.""In 2000, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development blocked Mr. Singer from bidding on a Harlem property.""I thought, this guy should not be entitled to get this property, because he hasn't demonstrated that he can be a good landlord,"" said Charles King, a former HUD official — and current candidate for state attorney general — who authorized the unusual move. ""The number of violations was unbelievable.""Mr. Jaroslawicz said that the block was reversed after a HUD investigation. Mr. King said that that occurred after his tenure at the agency.Amanda Pitman, a spokeswoman for Housing Preservation and Development, said that Mr. Singer currently owned 58 buildings with a total of 1,164 units. The department has issued more than 3,000 violations to those buildings, she said.Mr. Jaroslawicz said the number of violations was deceiving.""When you buy a building that has hundreds or a thousand violations, and over the year you fix up the building, and at the end of the year there's still 50 left, someone could write an article that says this man is a wonderful human being because he fixed up the building,"" Mr. Jaroslawicz said. ""Or you could write an article saying there's 50 violations.""Mr. Singer approached Mr. Guttman about buying the Greenpoint buildings last year, according to a lawsuit later filed by Mr. Singer. Mr. Singer paid a deposit of $42 million, but the plan fell apart as the closing date, Jan. 17, came and went. Mr. Singer claims that he and Mr. Guttman had an oral agreement to extend the closing date at least six months, the suit claims. Mr. Guttman's lawyers have said there was no such agreement and that Mr. Singer did not do what the contract required of him.This has been a difficult week, Mr. Jaroslawicz said. ""There was a massive fire. The litigation, which has nothing to do with the fire, just suddenly became a story. If anything, he'd be better off if the buildings were standing. One thing I can tell you, he doesn't benefit by the fire.""'"
"'06-05-05,'1','Without the bill, nearly 19 million taxpayers would owe up to $3,640 each in higher taxes this year, with most of the burden falling on families with children who own homes.If the bill becomes law, taxpayers making $75,000 to $100,000 will save, on average, $403, while those making $100,000 to $200,000 will save $1,388. Those making $200,000 to $1 million will save an average of $5,000.The bill would increase the exemption for the alternative tax to $62,550 for married couples, up from $58,000 last year. For single people and heads of households, the exemption would rise to $42,500, from $40,250 last year.The increased exemption for the alternative tax is worth up to $1,274 in tax savings for married couples and up to $630 for singles and heads of households.Under the alternative tax, taxpayers lose exemptions for themselves, their spouses and their children; they cannot deduct state income and local property taxes; and they lose the standard deduction. Those who are seriously sick or injured also must pay higher income taxes because, under the alternative tax, medical expenses are not deductible until they exceed 10 percent of income, compared with the 7.5 percent threshold in the regular tax system.The bill would also expand opportunities to invest money that will never again be taxed, a significant goal of President Bush. The bill would let anyone put $5,000 a year into a Roth IRA. Under current law, married taxpayers who make more than $160,000 and single people who make more than $110,000 cannot contribute to a Roth. No investment gains in a Roth are taxed, unlike regular retirement plans, in which taxes are deferred only until withdrawal and are then taxed at the same rates as wages.A Roth IRA is especially attractive to anyone who believes that income tax rates will rise or whose savings exceed what they expect to need in retirement, and so plans to leave money to heirs. Roth IRA's left to heirs in trusts can grow tax-free for decades.Leonard Burman, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, said the expansion of the Roth IRA would encourage many people, especially the rich, to take money out of traditional retirement plans, pay the taxes and then invest in a Roth.That would produce a short-term surge in tax revenue, he said, followed by a drop.Neither Congress nor the administration has issued an analysis of how the tax cuts would be distributed.There are two other private tax models. The Heritage Foundation, which owns one, has not issued a distribution analysis. Citizens for Tax Justice, which owns the other, limited its analysis to the alternative minimum tax and the two-year extension of the investment tax savings provision.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','""Republicans are capitulating to pressures to do something, even if they would be doing things that make no sense,"" said Kevin A. Hassett, a senior economist at the American Enterprise Institute. ""The proper course is to let the remedy for high prices be high prices. If it turns out that biofuels are more economical, then you don't need government subsidies.""But that view has not stopped Republican lawmakers and the Bush administration from circulating proposals for more tax breaks for hybrid cars, more subsidies for renewable fuels and more government-financed research for areas like battery technology.Even so, supporters of conservation and alternative fuels, including some within the Republican Party, are unsatisfied.""It isn't enough,"" said Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, Republican of New York, a champion of higher fuel-efficiency requirements.Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are also renewing their wish list for the oil industry — opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for exploration and drilling, as well as millions of additional acres in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Coast. They are also blocking calls for a windfall profits tax on the major oil companies.The political pressures created by soaring gasoline prices have pulled Republicans in Congress and the administration in different directions. While blocking higher taxes on the oil industry, for example, the While House and Senate Republicans are likely to try to eliminate or at least cut back on $2 billion in tax incentives for oil and gas drilling that Congress passed less than a year ago.But the greatest challenge lies in formulating a consistent policy that would help reduce the demand for imported oil.Almost all Republicans, along with many Democrats, are adamantly opposed to higher taxes on gasoline, seeing it as a political loser despite support from economists who argue that painful as it might be in the short run, a stiffer gas tax would be the most effective way to encourage Americans to drive more fuel-efficient cars.At the same time, unlike Democrats, Republican lawmakers have repeatedly defeated proposals for higher fuel-economy requirements on passenger cars. Indeed, in the 2004 presidential election, they ridiculed such proposals as job-losing Democratic ideas.Now, with gasoline prices above $3 a gallon, Mr. Bush is asking for new authority to modify the current requirements, an average of 27.5 miles to the gallon, but only in a way that the White House says would not hurt domestic companies whose greatest strength has been in big cars and sport utility vehicles.Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday that Congress should not impose an ""arbitrary"" standard on its own. Rather, Mr. Mineta said, it should let the administration develop ""size based"" rules that would impose different requirements for big cars and small cars.""A size-based system eliminates the perverse incentives for manufacturers to produce smaller and more dangerous vehicles, instead of introducing fuel-saving technologies,"" Mr. Mineta said.That was good news to the Big Three automakers in Detroit whose businesses are heavily dependent on sales of big S.U.V.'s and light trucks.Mr. Mineta refused to say how strict the new mileage requirements might be or even if they would be higher than the current standards. He also predicted that the administration would not be able to devise new rules for two years, and that the rules would apply only to cars produced in 2009 and later.This week, 10 states, including New York, sued the administration over a set of new fuel-economy rules for light trucks and sport utility vehicles. The states contend that the rules are too weak and disregard the full environmental benefits of stricter standards.""If the light truck standard is any indication, it's hard to believe the administration is serious about upgrading,"" said William R. Prindle, deputy director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a policy research and advocacy group in Washington.Mr. Boehlert, a liberal Republican who is chairman of the House science committee, expressed similar skepticism.""If we just give the administration authority, we know what will happen,"" Mr. Boehlert told members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. ""We would produce a long rule-making and probably tepid results.""Yet almost any Republican discussion about higher fuel-economy requirements represents a big change in tone if not substance.In five years, House Republicans have defeated three bills to raise the average fuel efficiency of cars to 33 miles a gallon, from 27.5.During the 2004 presidential campaign, the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, warned that Sen. John F. Kerry's support for tougher rules would cost Michigan 100,000 jobs in the automobile industry.Vice President Dick Cheney said, ""You can rely on President Bush to fight to keep auto jobs where they belong — right here in America.""The automobile industry, though it counts many Democrats as powerful supporters, has contributed three times as much to Republican candidates as to Democrats. Oil and gas producers have even closer ties to Republicans in general and Mr. Bush in particular.The industry's political action committees have given $1 million to Republican candidates and groups in the last 18 months, eight times what they gave to Democrats, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, which monitors political donations.""Their desire to do corporate America's bidding has run squarely up against public outrage over Big Oil ripping off America,"" said David J. Sirota, a Democratic strategist and the author of ""Hostile Takeover,"" a new book on corporate influence here. ""In reaction, they have made a U-turn.""To be sure, Mr. Bush and Republican leaders have stepped up support for alternative fuels.

"'06-05-05,'1','Stung by competition from generic products and setbacks at the Food and Drug Administration, Johnson & Johnson sent a strong signal yesterday that it wants to revitalize the pharmaceutical side of the company, a health care conglomerate that has become increasingly reliant on its medical devices business.The company told its employees yesterday that it was dividing its pharmaceuticals group into three major disease or therapeutic clusters, each with its own research and development function.The company said the reorganization was intended to create ""greater synergy"" between its research activities and their commercial possibilities.""I think that makes a lot of sense,"" said Jan David Wald, a health care analyst with A. G. Edwards. ""One of the problems that J.& J. has had in the pharma side has been in developing new products.""A Johnson & Johnson spokesman, Ray Jordan, said the reorganization was partly related to planning for next year's retirement of Dr. Per A.

"'06-05-05,'1','REDMOND, Wash., May 4 (Bloomberg News) — Microsoft will increase investments in MSN and its other online businesses to $1.6 billion next year as it escalates a battle with Google, its chief executive said Thursday.Capital spending and research outlays will rise 60 percent in the year that starts July 1 from a projected $1 billion this year, the chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, said in a speech to advertisers at the company's headquarters here.""It's important for you to understand our deep commitment,"" Mr. Ballmer said. ""Only two to three companies can really deliver the infrastructure that's required to keep pace with consumer demand and advertisers' needs.""Microsoft is investing in advertising and search technology, and is building computer centers to manage the services it offers in a bid to catch Google, which dominates the search market. Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, is having difficulty matching Google's rapid product development and customer appeal.Speaking at the conference on Wednesday, Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, said Google had done a ""great job"" in search and advertising, but added: ""We will keep them honest. I think this is a rare case where we are being underestimated.""'"
"'06-05-05,'1','Oxfam International, the global relief organization, said yesterday that a seven-week investigation of fraud in its operation in Aceh Province, Indonesia, had found evidence of $22,000 in losses.Although the fraud represents a tiny proportion of the organization's $48 million budget for tsunami recovery in Aceh in 2005, and most of the losses have already been recovered, it is unusual for charities to reveal such problems.Oxfam announced in March that a regular audit had identified financial irregularities in Aceh and has been widely praised in the nonprofit sector for its candor. Other organizations seem to have taken notice, and charity regulators in two states said they had noticed an increase in self-reported wrongdoing among the organizations they monitored.The fraud involved discrepancies between payments made for materials ordered for the organization's shelter program and the amount of materials delivered. Oxfam said it had been able to recover about $20,000 in materials, almost the entire amount of its losses.The organization said it was considering disciplinary measures against 22 staff members, 10 of whom could face dismissal.Oxfam said it had fully resumed all services in Aceh, the region hardest hit by the tsunami in December 2004. It scaled back its operations to water provision and waste collection pending the outcome of the inquiry.""The public who gave so generously should be reassured that the money they donated continues to help change the lives of people who were so devastated by the tsunami,"" Raymond C. Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America, said in a statement.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','Stocks rose and the Dow Jones industrial average set a six-year high yesterday after oil prices dropped, retailers posted the biggest monthly sales increase since 2004 and corporate earnings generally beat Wall Street expectations.Tyco International, Starbucks and Whole Foods Market all gained after reporting profits that exceeded Wall Street projections.The Dow average gained 38.58 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,438.86, the highest since January 2000. The S.& P. 500-stock index added 4.40 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,312.25. The Nasdaq composite index rallied 19.93 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,323.90.Two stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.72 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board.Better-than-expected quarterly earnings results have spurred a rally this year. Still, record oil prices and signs of buoyant economic growth have reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve may raise borrowing costs to restrain inflation, limiting gains in equities.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','The increase in compensation indicates that recent job growth is starting to tilt the balance of power from businesses to workers. Unit labor costs, a ratio of hourly compensation to output, rose 2.5 percent in the first quarter.""There has been a definite tightening in the labor market, so there is greater competition for labor,"" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics, a research firm based outside Cleveland.The increase in labor costs could stoke growing concerns about inflation. Federal Reserve officials have said that they will raise short-term interest rates if they believe that inflation will flare because of rising wages and energy prices.Higher compensation does not have to set off inflation, especially if workers are more productive, Mr. Mayland said. But if labor costs rise at the same time that productivity and economic growth slow, as most economists believe will happen in the coming months, they can drive up inflation.""There is a tendency, as expansions mature, for productivity growth to slow,"" he said.But it is not completely clear if most workers are making more. The labor cost statistics in yesterday's report conflict with those in other recent reports that show far more modest increases in wages and employment costs.Last week, the Labor Department said its employment cost index increased 2.8 percent in the first quarter from the year-earlier period. And hourly earnings increased 3.4 percent in March from a year ago.Some of the discrepancies may reflect differences in the design of various government statistics. For instance, the employment cost index does not include the cost of exercising stock options. And economists said the sharp rise in labor costs seen in yesterday's report might also be skewed by big annual bonus payments to white-collar and management workers. The Labor Department's hourly earnings data, by contrast, is based on production and nonsupervisory workers' wages.""Labor is gradually getting an increasing share of gains from output,"" said David Kelly, an economist at Putnam Investments, the mutual fund company based in Boston. But ""one thing that has been true for most of this expansion is that wages have been running below inflation,"" he said.Separately, the Labor Department reported that state unemployment insurance claims increased last week by 5,000, to 322,000.There were 2.5 million claims outstanding as of April 22, about 5.5 percent less than a year earlier.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','A Manhattan Criminal Court judge issued a warrant yesterday for the arrest of Ronald Martin, a homeless man convicted of stalking a conservative cable television and radio commentator, after Mr. Martin failed to show up for his sentencing.But even as the judge issued the warrant, Mr. Martin's uncle, Lou Roman, who appeared in court hoping to find him there, said he believed that his nephew was photographed panhandling two weeks ago in Washington, in a picture that has become a favorite of Internet bloggers.That was 13 days before he was scheduled to be sentenced in the stalking of the commentator, Monica Crowley.The photograph, taken by The Associated Press on April 22 on a Georgetown street, shows an anonymous ""hitchhiker from New York,"" wearing work boots and khakis, holding a sign that says, ""Brad & Angelina are having a baby and I need money for a gift."" Brad and Angelina, of course, are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.Mr. Martin, 42, was convicted on April 17 of stalking Ms. Crowley after a trial that made tabloid headlines. Ms. Crowley testified that her lovesick suitor had sent her disturbing e-mail messages and followed her. Mr. Martin contended he was just a fan who wanted friendship.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','A margin call occurs when brokers who have lent money to investors to buy stock require more collateral to cover the loan, usually because the stock used as collateral has fallen in value, as Enron's did.""As the values were falling over time and as margin calls start hitting in June 2001, he's in a position where he's really got to sell Enron stock to meet his obligations,"" Professor Barry said.He said that in early 2001 Mr. Lay's debt was about $100 million and went down to about zero by the end of the year.He said Mr. Lay had few other options, like selling real estate or shares in other companies, as the prosecution has suggested he could have done, because 90 percent of Mr. Lay's liquid assets were in Enron stock.Prosecutors showed evidence that Mr. Lay could have drawn down additional lines of credit at banks to pay the margin calls. ""That would be like using your MasterCard to pay off your Visa,"" Professor Barry said yesterday.Professor Barry said Mr. Lay's stock sales were evidence of his faith in Enron because they were a small percentage of his total holdings. The fact that he paid off debt with the $10 million in cash he got for coming back as chief of Enron in August 2001 instead of using Enron stock also showed faith in the company, Professor Barry said.""By using cash to pay off his debt, Mr. Lay avoided having to sell stock,"" he said. ""I would have viewed that as a very favorable indication that this executive believes in where Enron is going.""Professor Barry also testified that Enron collapsed not because of criminal conduct by Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling but because of a lack of faith in the company stemming from articles written about it in The Wall Street Journal. He especially noted articles about off-the-books partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, a former chief financial officer, and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.""What happened in Enron is very descriptive of the classic run on the bank,"" he said.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','WASHINGTON, May 4 — The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee acceded on Thursday to Democratic demands to hold a second hearing on the appeals court nomination of a White House aide, Brett M.

"'06-05-05,'1','Ensemble Studio Theater's First Light Festival, featuring plays that explore issues raised by science and technology, is always guaranteed to send audiences out with plenty to think about. ""Relativity,"" the main offering this year, is no exception, and the production offers dandy fringe benefits to go along with the heady science: two dazzling performances and two especially dazzling scenes.The playwright, Cassandra Medley, seems to have a rather long laundry list of race- and science-related issues she wants to touch on and concocts a somewhat strained premise to get to them all. But the play is so entertaining and fast-moving under Talvin Wilks's direction that you're soon in a forgiving mood.Claire (Elain Graham), a black psychotherapist, runs a foundation started by her long-dead husband that is dedicated to ""melanin science,"" the notion that the pigment melanin makes black people genetically superior in various ways to ""the nonmelanated,"" as devotees of the theory call the other races.Claire's daughter, Kalima (Melanie Nicholls-King), a brilliant young scientist, has become skeptical of these views; in the course of the play she is forced to choose between loyalty to her mother and faith in her own findings. That she has a white boyfriend (Anthony Crane) only complicates matters, as does the arrival at her lab of Iris Preston (Petronia Paley), a leading black scientist and outspoken critic of melanin theories.Ms. Medley has a few awkward moments as she sets these dynamics in motion, but sterling performances by Ms. Nicholls-King and especially by Ms. Paley as the abrupt, self-assured Dr. Preston smooth over the wrinkles. And all is forgiven as Act II opens with a devastating scene in which Claire and her sidekick, Malik (Kim Sullivan), raise a field full of warning flags about cloning, gene-mapping, baby-designing and such.Though their melanin science sounds preposterous, by the time they're done you know why many people, especially those with a history of being oppressed, are deeply suspicious of what passes for scientific progress.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','The books in Stuart Kelly's clever and highly entertaining new book are works of literature that have somehow been lost to posterity: Homer's ""Margites,"" a humorous epic about a fool, who, in Plato's words, ""knew many things, but all badly""; the Arthurian epics contemplated by both Dryden and Milton but never written; Laurence Sterne's never completed ""Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy,"" which concludes with one of the most famous unfinished sentences in literary history (""So that when I stretch'd out my hand, I caught hold of the Fille de Chambre's —"") ; Lord Byron's supposedly explosive ""Memoirs,"" which his publisher, executor and biographer had burned because, as one critic put it, they were ""fit only for the brothel and would have damned"" the poet ""to everlasting infamy""; the novel, provisionally titled ""Double Exposure"" or ""Double Take,"" that Sylvia Plath was reportedly working on before her suicide in 1963.As Mr. Kelly notes, ""Loss is not an anomaly, or a deviation, or an exception,"" it's ""the norm,"" and his inventory of missing books is a many-splendored thing, filled with classics gone missing and wildly ambitious projects never realized. We are reminded for instance of how little from antiquity has survived: we have only 7 of the more than 80 plays Aeschylus wrote, only 7 of Sophocles' 120 and only 18 of more than 90 by Euripides.Aeschylus, whose supposed cause of death must surely rank as one of the strangest on record — an eagle, Mr. Kelly informs us, dropped a tortoise on his head, apparently mistaking his bald pate for a rock — would garner great fame in the ancient world, and the sole copy of his complete works came to occupy a privileged place in the celebrated library of Alexandria in Egypt; that copy was destroyed, along with thousands of other precious volumes, when that library went up in flames.In the case of the comic playwright Menander, the loss of his writing was probably a good career move. Although the last known manuscripts of his work disappeared in Constantinople centuries ago, he had been hailed for his realism and his literary elegance by the likes of Aristophanes and Plutarch, and over the years, Mr. Kelly observes, his ""fame grew and grew."" That is, until fragments of his work turned up in an Egyptian excavation in 1905, and decades later one of his plays was pieced together, translated and staged. The reaction was less than enthusiastic, with Erich Segal, the classicist (better known as the author of ""Love Story""), declaring that Menander had been revealed to be ""a suburban Euripides.""As Mr. Kelly sees it, Menander's plays aren't the only works best lost to history's dustbin. Had Edward Gibbon pursued his original plan to write ""The History of the Liberty of the Swiss,"" he might never have gone on to write the work that made him famous, ""The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.""More debatable is Mr. Kelly's suggestion that the loss of a suitcase containing the young Ernest Hemingway's apprentice writings — his first wife, Hadley, was transporting his possessions to Switzerland in 1922, when the valise was apparently stolen — was actually a fortuitous event that forced him to develop his famous style and write the books he was capable of writing.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','""The relations between the two presidents are much more constructive than these statements,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""And they are more oriented to the future.""Stephen Sestanovich, who served as a senior Russia policy official in the Clinton Administration, said the speech was likely to infuriate Mr. Putin and his circle of advisers, adding to the strains between the countries.""However much you try to sound hopeful notes, the folks around Putin are likely to say this is proof of Washington's hostility and say, 'How dare they tell us to be more democratic?' "" said Mr. Sestanovich, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, based in Washington.Mr. Sestanovich said the speech ""definitely reflects a scaling back of expectations of the relationship with Moscow. For the vice president to say Russia can be a strategic partner is already to imply that it isn't.""While Mr. Cheney has always voiced greater skepticism toward Russia than his boss, President Bush, his remarks underscored a deepening rift that has emerged since Mr. Bush famously said in 2001 that he had looked into President Putin's eyes and ""got a sense of his soul."" Indeed, in many areas, the United States and Russia have rarely seemed more at odds since the cold war ended.In Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, the two countries, if not their leaders, seem to confront each other more often than they cooperate. Their disputes include everything from elections in former Soviet republics like Ukraine and Belarus to Russia's exploitation of its energy resources for political ends.""No legitimate interest is served when oil and gas become tools of intimidation or blackmail, either by supply manipulation or attempts to monopolize transportation,"" Mr. Cheney said, weighing in on a heated European debate over Russia's reliability as an energy exporter following a brief New Year's shutoff of natural gas to Ukraine. ""And no one can justify actions that undermine the territorial integrity of a neighbor, or interfere with democratic movements.""The latter were clear references to Georgia and Moldova, both former Soviet republics with unrecognized separatist enclaves abetted by Russia, and to Ukraine, where Mr. Putin openly sided against the current president, Viktor A. Yushchenko, during the public protests of electoral fraud in 2004 that ultimately swept him to power.Mr. Cheney spoke at an international conference in Vilnius that gathered together leaders of nine former Soviet republics or Warsaw Pact satellites along Russia's western border, as well as the United States, European Union and NATO.The bulk of his address was a celebration of the democratic progress these countries have made since the Soviet sway over Europe began to collapse in 1989. And Mr. Cheney sounded very much like a triumphant cold warrior. He evoked Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II and the dissident leaders of the Soviet bloc who threw off ""the stagnation of imperial dictatorship.""Mr. Cheney did not mention Mr. Putin by name. And he said that Russia was not ""fated to be an enemy"" and that it ""can be a strategic partner and a trusted friend."" But he urged that Russia follow the course embraced by its former subjects in the Soviet bloc. He added that the meeting in St. Petersburg would be an opportunity for Mr. Bush and the other G-8 leaders to make that case.""Russia has a choice to make,"" he said.Mr. Cheney also reiterated the administration's strong condemnation of Belarus, where President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko was elected to a third term in a vote denounced as a fraud. He said that he had planned to meet Mr. Lukashenko's leading opponent, Aleksandr Milinkevich, in Vilnius, but that Mr. Milinkevich's arrest last week prevented it. He called for his release.""There is no place in a Europe whole and free for a regime of this kind,"" he said, calling Mr. Lukashenko's government ""the last dictatorship in Europe.""Russia, by contrast, has praised Mr. Lukashenko's victory, most recently when Mr. Putin met the Belarussian leader last week.Mr. Cheney's speech was barely mentioned in Russia's state-owned or controlled media, but nevertheless set off a torrent of criticism here.""The United States has to deal with an absolutely different Russia today — a Russia that has restored its real sovereignty in many areas,"" Andrei A. Kokoshin, a member of the lower house of parliament, told the Interfax news agency.His remarks reflected an increasingly confident view of Russia's status that is widely held here. It is a view that has required the Bush administration to calibrate its criticism over democratic backsliding with the realization that Russia's growing economic might, largely fueled by oil and gas, made it an indispensable player.""The vice president was clear about our concerns,"" a senior administration official traveling with Mr. Cheney said, according to a transcript provided by the White House, ""but also clear that we want to work with Russia.""'"

"'06-05-05,'1','Scrapbooking and ships are an unlikely pair, and not only because of the disconnect of huddling over a project while the sea sparkles and deck chairs sit empty. A rocking boat doesn't provide a level working surface; it can be hard even to cut a straight line, some scrapbookers said. Shipboard conference rooms, designed for the laid-back passenger who wants to play hooky, are often poorly lighted and inadequately ventilated for 18-hour work stints.Yet since their first appearance about five years ago, scrapbook cruises have caught on. Joan Levicoff, vice president of group sales for the Carnival Cruise Line, said her line does more than 20 scrapbooking cruises annually, with groups ranging in size from 30 to 200.On the Monarch of the Seas cruise in March, there were about 2,500 passengers, 81 of them scrapbookers (and half of those obsessive enough to skip the offshore excursion), all luxuriating in uninterrupted scrapbook time.""It's like a drug, being able to scrapbook all night and not have to worry about going home,"" said Lisa Baldwin, a 39-year-old mother of four who taught scrapbook-technique classes to pay her way onto the cruise.Deloris Saams-Hoy, 39, who left her husband, children and job behind to join the cruise, had similar sentiments. ""I can sleep when I'm at home,"" she said as she finally headed to her cabin at 4:30 a.m. the first night on board. ""I'm determined to get these pages done.""Scrapbook cruises cropped up as part of a trend of theme cruises of various kinds.""It's a phenomenon that has taken hold across the industry,"" said Brian Major, a spokesman for the Cruise Lines International Association, a trade organization in New York. ""Whether it's people interested in Harley-Davidsons, knitting or scrapbooking, there is a trend toward organizing a trip around a common interest.""Theme cruises may have helped the cruise industry's recent growth. Mr. Major said that his association, whose members are 20 cruise lines responsible for 97 percent of the cruise capacity marketed in North America, forecast 11.7 million total cruise passengers in 2006, a 4.5 percent increase from last year.According to Ms. Levicoff, scrapbook cruises on Carnival have left from Galveston, Tex., as well as Los Angeles. She said the cruises were usually organized and marketed by a local travel agent, who then approached the cruise line for accommodations and services like reserving conference rooms and providing tables. ""We can make arrangements on any of our vessels to do a scrapbook cruise,"" she said. ""And we make an effort to make it a great experience for everyone.""Scrapbooking cruise destinations have included Mexico, Alaska, the Caribbean, Eastern Canada and the New England states. In April, Debbie Haas, an author of the forthcoming ""Chicken Soup for the Scrapbooker's Soul,"" led a group on a seven-day cruise to Southampton, England, from New York on the Queen Mary 2. In the fall, Creating Keepsakes is sponsoring a Mediterranean cruise with stops in Barcelona and Rome.The scrapbook cruise to Ensenada was organized by Anita Pagliasso-Balamane, a travel agent in San Jose, Calif., and Picture Passion, a store in nearby Campbell that sells scrapbooking items from rubber stamps to colored staples.Many of the scrapbookers on the cruise had carried their materials aboard in specially designed scrapbook luggage with brand names like Cropper Hopper and Crop in Style. Beri Anderson, 40, of Elizabeth, Colo., packed so many materials for the cruise that her baggage was 27 pounds overweight at the Denver International Airport when she set off for Los Angeles. She had to pay a $25 penalty.""It was definitely my scrapbooking stuff,"" Mrs. Anderson said. ""I brought very few clothes.""During the scrapbooking sessions, the chatty talk often veered away from the hobby itself and into stories of weddings and divorces, bosses and children, triumphs and tragedies — a normal pattern at scrapbooking events.""Everyone has a story to tell,"" said Veronica Hugger, a founder of the National Scrapbooking Association in Katy, Tex., near Houston. ""Scrapbooking is like writing an autobiography.""And there is always the topic of husbands, who have sometimes been known to have trouble comprehending the scrapbook mania. ""Both my husband and 15-year-old son are hard sells,"" Mrs. Saams-Hoy said.But she added that she had little guilt about going off alone on the cruise. ""My biggest dilemma about leaving,"" she said, ""was that I was going to miss the opening day of my younger son's T-ball and the last day of soccer, because I won't be there to take the pictures.""Pictures that she will need, of course, for future scrapbooks.'"
"'06-05-05,'1','What I would call ""petro-ist"" states — highly dependent on oil or gas for their G.D.P. and having either weak institutions or outright authoritarian systems — have started asserting themselves. And they are weakening, for now at least, the global democratization trend.Economists have long taught us about the negative effects that an overabundance of natural resources can have on political and economic reform in any country: the ""resource curse."" But when it comes to oil, it seems that you can take this resource curse argument a step further: there appears to be a specific correlation between the price of oil and the pace of freedom.I call it the ""First Law of Petropolitics,"" and it posits the following: The price of oil and the pace of freedom always move in opposite directions in petro-ist states.According to the First Law of Petropolitics, the higher the price of global crude oil, the more erosion we see in petro-ist nations in the right to free speech, a free press, free elections, freedom of assembly, government transparency, an independent judiciary and the rule of law, and in the freedom to form independent political parties and nongovernmental organizations. Such erosion does not occur in healthy democracies with oil.Conversely, according to the First Law of Petropolitics, the lower the price of oil, the more the petro-ist countries are forced to move toward a politics that is more transparent, more sensitive to opposition voices, more open to a broad set of interactions with the outside world and more focused on building the legal and educational structures that will maximize the ability of their citizens, both men and women, to compete, start new companies and attract investments from abroad. (For an elaboration of this argument, see the current issue of Foreign Policy magazine, www.foreignpolicy.com.)Yes, many factors are involved in shaping the politics of a country. But is it an accident that when oil was $20 to $40 a barrel, Iran was calling for a ""dialogue of civilizations,"" and when it hit $70 a barrel, Iran was calling for the destruction of Israel?When a barrel was $20 to $40, we had ""Putin I."" That's when President Bush looked Mr. Putin in the eye in 2001 and said he'd found ""a sense of his soul."" If Mr. Bush tried to get a sense of Mr. Putin's soul today — the soul of ""Putin II,"" the Putin of $70-a-barrel oil — he would see down there the huge Russian energy company Gazprom. Mr. Putin's regime has swallowed Gazprom, along with a variety of once-independent Russian media outlets and institutions.While these increasingly bold petro-authoritarians don't represent the sort of strategic or ideological threat that communism once posed to the West, their impact on global politics is still quite corrosive. Some of the worst regimes now have more oil money than ever to do bad things for a long time — and many decent, democratic countries have to kowtow to them to get oil and gas.Given the inverse relationship between the price of oil and the pace of freedom in petro-ist states, any U.S. strategy for promoting democracy in these countries is doomed to fail unless it includes a credible plan for finding alternatives to oil and bringing down the global price of crude.The price of oil should now be a daily preoccupation of the secretary of state, not just the secretary of energy. Today, you cannot be an effective democracy-promoting idealist without also being an effective energy-conscious environmentalist.'"

"'06-05-06,'0','HARTFORD, May 5 — In a rare determination, the American Bar Association has deemed a Connecticut judge who was nominated to the federal bench by President Bush ""not qualified"" for the post.The judge, Vanessa L. Bryant, 52, who will be the first black woman in New England to be a federal judge if her nomination is confirmed, oversees court administration for the civil division of State Superior Court in Hartford. Before she became a judge, she worked in private practice representing state and local governments and private financial institutions.She was nominated by Mr. Bush in January upon the recommendation of Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican who is seeking her first full term in November, to replace Dominic J. Squatrito, who left the bench in November 2004 for a reduced caseload as a senior judge.The rating of the bar association committee makes Judge Bryant only the sixth nominee out of 445 jurists since 1999 to be deemed not qualified to serve. Of the five others to receive unqualified rankings, three were later confirmed by the United States Senate and two withdrew from consideration.Ratings are based on whether candidates meet standards for integrity; professional competence, like intellectual capacity and breadth of professional experience; and judicial temperament, like compassion and decisiveness, according to the bar association's Web site. The committee, which forwards the results of its investigation to the Senate Judiciary Committee, does not release information other than its rating unless its members are called to testify before Congress.Judge Bryant did not respond to two phone messages on Friday. But Governor Rell, through a spokesman, stood by the nominee. ""Governor Rell believes that Vanessa Bryant is qualified to serve on the U.S. District Court and has every expectation that she will be confirmed by the Senate,"" said the spokesman, Judd Everhart.Through his spokesman, Senator Joseph I.

"'06-05-06,'0','Chris Drury and the Buffalo Sabres beat the high-scoring Ottawa Senators at their own game.Drury scored 18 seconds into overtime after Tim Connolly netted his second goal of the night with 10.7 seconds remaining in regulation and the Sabres stunned the Senators with a 7-6 victory last night in a wild Eastern Conference semifinal opener.The teams scored three goals in the final 1 minute 37 seconds of regulation as Buffalo's Derek Roy tied it at 5 with a short-handed effort for his second of the game at 18:23. But Bryan Smolinski scored his second 24 seconds later during the same power play to give Ottawa its fifth straight lead, 6-5.The Sabres pressed for one more, and Connolly got it as he swept a puck that lay within Ray Emery's reach up and over the rookie goalie to shock the sellout crowd. The winning goal was even more sudden as Drury beat Emery with a shot from the left circle.Game 2 of the best-of-seven series will not be until Monday because the arena is unavailable over the weekend.MIGHTY DUCKS 5, AVALANCHE 0 Teemu Selanne had a goal and two assists against his former Colorado teammates and the rookie Ilya Bryzgalov logged his second consecutive shutout for Anaheim at home in the opener of the Western Conference semifinal series.Bryzgalov is the first rookie to post back-to-back playoff shutouts since Toronto's Frank McCool had three straight in 1945.The Ducks scored four times in the second period, including goals by Selanne and Joffrey Lupul in the final minute to break the game open. Bryzgalov made 29 saves after stopping all 22 he faced in his Game 7 victory at Calgary to clinch the first-round series.'"
"'06-05-06,'0','As for what ""appropriate action"" might entail, Sergeant Schneider declined to comment, citing security concerns. ""Our current policy and procedure is not open for public dissemination,"" she said.In the case of Mr. Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat from the clan of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the union representing members of the Capitol Police has complained that supervisors told officers on the scene Thursday morning to take Mr. Kennedy home without testing for drugs or alcohol, said Louis P. Cannon, president of the District of Columbia chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, the union.Sergeant Schneider said the Capitol Police were investigating whether ""existing policies and procedures"" were followed.Mr. Kennedy's run-in followed by just a few weeks a clash between the Capitol Police and Representative Cynthia A. McKinney, a Georgia Democrat who is African-American. In contrast to the police union's accusation about laxness toward Mr. Kennedy, Ms. McKinney accused officers of treating her with excessive wariness.When she tried to enter the Capitol without her official pin, the guards did not recognize her and a scuffle ensued. The Capitol Police referred the matter to federal prosecutors, and Ms. McKinney accused the police of racial profiling.Mr. Cannon said, however, that he saw similarities in the cases.""Neither one of them were arrested right off,"" he said. ""What would somebody do if you struck an officer?""""There is still some of the 'old school' left, shall we say, where political considerations are given instead of letting the officers do their job,"" Mr. Cannon said.Historians say the Capitol Police have often been slow to act against lawmakers.In 1991, for example, the Capitol Police delayed more than a month before investigating reports of fraud by members at the House post office. The police board attributed the delay to debate about whether the matter should be handled by the Justice Department or the United States Postal Service.In 1828, Congress decided to create its own police force after a son of President John Quincy Adams was beaten up as he walked through the Capitol Rotunda. (The assailant believed that the son, John Adams Jr., had insulted his wife.)Until the 1970's, the Capitol Police officers were almost always hired through political patronage.The force has grown enormously since the shootings of two Capitol Police officers in 1998 and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Although the force remains beholden only to Congress, it now consists of 1,700 officers armed with machine guns and financed with a 2006 budget of about $250 million.""We have spent a lot of money on these guys making them the real deal,"" John Scofield, a spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee, said.'"
"'06-05-06,'0','On top of that, about 25 percent of students use credit cards to help cover college costs; according to the student loan provider Sallie Mae, in 2004 graduating students carried an average credit card balance of nearly $3,000.The job market itself can pose problems, Ms. Draut said. ""The hottest job markets are generally clustered in the major cities, where the cost of living is higher — which puts young professionals in even more of a bind.""According to an online survey conducted by the Quarterlife Crisis Web site (quarterlifecrisis.com), which calls itself a resource ""for twentysomethings transitioning to life in the 'real world,' "" 61 percent of respondents had moved home for at least a year between the ages of 21 and 25.Even if your graduate doesn't lack for money, all young adults can benefit from basic directions to help them on the road to financial independence.DISCUSS THE BIGGER PICTURE After a successful college career, many graduates are demoralized when their career plans don't gel quickly and bills loom large, said Abby Wilner, co-author of ""The Quarterlife Crisis"" (McGraw Hill, 2005). ""Rather than being critical, it helps if parents can talk about these hurdles with their kids.""DO A FINANCIAL REVIEW Many seniors take a short test to prepare them for paying back student loans, Ms. Draut said, but it's still important to sit down with your new graduate and go over what they owe, what the payments are and what they need to earn to cover expenses.EXPLAIN THE WEIRD WORLD OF CREDIT CARDS Many young people get their first credit card in college and build up debt before they understand basic concepts like how interest works, or the fact that it would take many years of making minimum payments to pay off the balance. Explaining how credit really works can keep them from using cards as their backup plan.START A SAVINGS PLAN Young people juggling adult responsibilities for the first time may be inclined to make savings their last priority, but it's the parents' job to enforce the ""pay yourself first"" rule, said Michael Masterson, author of ""Automatic Wealth for Grads"" (Wiley, 2006) and the father of three sons, ages 17, 22 and 25. By working a side job a few hours a week, Mr. Masterson suggested, a determined saver could salt away $3,000 a year. ""They can put that money into a tax-deferred account, and they will become wealthy automatically,"" he said.Mr. Masterson recommends putting the money in a no-load index fund, like those offered by Fidelity or Vanguard.Again, I'd be careful with phrases like ""tax-deferred account,"" but Mr. Masterson says that most young people will respond well to the concept of building up millions without having to think too hard.And with any luck, parents who help graduates take these steps will reap their own windfall when they can, in the end, rent out that basement studio to a paying tenant.'"
"'06-05-06,'0','We must not spend a billion dollars to build a 9/11 memorial at ground zero. That much is clear. The only thing a $1 billion memorial would memorialize is a complete collapse of political and private leadership in Lower Manhattan.We've often said on this page that the memorial should be built as soon as possible. But the cost estimate made public this week — prepared by Bovis Lend Lease, the construction manager, at the request of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation — has given everyone pause. It isn't merely the fact that the number is so high: $972 million and rising. It's also the fact that the task of planning a buildable memorial has fallen into such disarray.What began as a public process to choose a memorial design — the winner, you may recall, was Michael Arad's ""Reflecting Absence"" — has slowly turned into something else. And it's something that looks very much like design-by-committee. Nearly everyone has a stake, and often a self-contradictory stake, in what the memorial will become, including the city, the Port Authority, the memorial foundation and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, not to mention a small but increasingly vocal contingent of 9/11 families who oppose Mr. Arad's design.The political and emotional pressures on the memorial have been confused still further by a new assessment of security concerns. They threaten the basic integrity of the memorial design, which has already been compromised by consultants working for the development corporation. This is a recipe for chaos.Two things should happen right away. A competent entity needs to be put in charge of building the memorial. That should be the Port Authority, which has far and away the best track record among the concerned parties.Second, there needs to be a comprehensive analysis of Bovis's cost estimates. Once that's been done, it will be time to examine the alternatives, and their costs, at ground zero. Those may well include delaying the museum until the primary task of building a memorial is completed. The museum was not part of the original design competition. The memorial foundation rightly emphasizes the need for a place to present artifacts from 9/11, to interpret the events of that day and to educate the public about them. But at this point, most of us still remember that day very clearly. What we need right now is a place on the site to contemplate what stood at ground zero and how it fell, and to honor the victims. The museum can come later, and perhaps be elsewhere.The memorial design itself will clearly need to be re-examined in light of these new cost estimates and security concerns. We are not committed to preserving all the details of ""Reflecting Absence."" But we are committed to the process by which it was chosen.'"
"'06-05-06,'0','Under the Convention Against Torture, a 1987 treaty that is a centerpiece of international human rights law, the United States was supposed to have reported to the United Nations panel on its compliance by 1999.The panel, known as the Committee Against Torture, will review the American report and issue findings later this month, but it has no power to enforce its conclusions.Members of the panel appeared skeptical about some aspects of the American presentation. One, Fernando Mariño Menendez of Spain, cited data from human rights groups saying that of 600 American service members or intelligence officers accused of having been involved in the torture or murder of detainees, only 10 have received prison terms of a year or more.The committee raised a number of other concerns, which the delegation is to answer in detail on Monday. These include Washington's reported policy of sending prisoners to countries with poor human rights records for questioning, C.I.A.-run prisons and the role of controversial interrogation techniques like waterboarding, in which prisoners are led to believe that they are going to drown.By sending its delegation here, the Bush administration sought to restore credibility to its record on prisoner treatment by affirming support for the Convention Against Torture. Under the treaty, the 140 signatories must periodically submit reports and appear before the United Nations to show that they are following the rules.Gabor Rona, international legal director for Human Rights First, a nongovernmental group that followed the Geneva meeting, said the Americans ""failed to resolve serious questions about the U.S. commitment to fully implement Congress's recently enacted ban on cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.""Investigators for the European Parliament said last month that they had evidence that the C.I.A. had flown 1,000 undeclared flights over Europe since 2001, in some cases transporting terrorist suspects abducted within the European Union to countries known to use torture.Mr. Bellinger said the allegation that all of those planes carried terror suspects was an ""absurd insinuation."" In cases where the government has sent prisoners to countries with poor human rights records — a policy the administration defends, saying it helps to get dangerous individuals out of the United States — it has sought assurances that they will not be tortured, Mr. Bellinger added.The panel was dubious. ""The very fact that you are asking for diplomatic assurances means you are in doubt,"" said Andreas Mavrommatis, chairman of the committee. He said the United States must be above reproach in promoting human rights and should lead by example.Mr. Bellinger also responded to questions raised in a committee report late last year by defending the United States' decision not to grant prisoners held in Guantánamo Bay, Afghanistan and Iraq rights under the Geneva Conventions.Terrorist suspects could pose a threat to security if allowed to meet with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, as stipulated by the Geneva Conventions, Mr. Bellinger said.The delegation included representatives from the State, Defense, Justice and Homeland Security Departments, but not from the C.I.A.Mr. Bellinger said he was not authorized to talk about any intelligence activities that the committee questioned in its report. The committee said it had evidence that the United States had established secret prisons where detainees are given no access to their families or human rights organizations, and in most cases would not even acknowledge that the prisoners were being held.Guibril Camara, a committee member from Senegal, said it was the committee's interpretation — not that of the United States — that would set the global definition of torture. ""One of the parties is going to have to give way,"" Mr. Camara said. ""And I think it's probably going to have to be you.""'"
"'06-05-06,'0','To replace it, refiners have turned in part to ethanol, which is also an oxygenate but not a pollution worry.Ethanol, which is made from corn, costs more than gasoline, though, and shipping it from the Midwest, where it is made, is cumbersome and expensive, because it has to go by barge, railroad tank car or tanker truck, rather than pipeline.Along with importing vast amounts of crude oil, the United States imports more than a million barrels a day of gasoline or gasoline ingredients. The loss of the MTBE now requires more of those imports. Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a nonprofit group in New York, said tight refinery capacity helped to explain why the price of gasoline had increased so much faster than the price of crude oil.West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark oil, was up only about 39 cents a gallon last month compared with April 2005, while the wholesale price of gasoline rose about 64 cents over the same period. Mr. Goldstein blames the loss of MTBE for the difference.Experts at the Energy Department, the refiners' trade association and elsewhere agree that the changeover from MTBE was a factor, although they differ about the amount.Experts say part of the problem was that the law specified that the changeover would happen on the 270th day after signing, without its authors knowing when the bill would be passed and signed. As it happens, the 270th day coincides with the seasonal price rise that comes each year when refineries shut down equipment to shift to the typical mix of products sold in summer.After Hurricane Katrina, some refineries skipped maintenance last fall to make up for lost production; that has led to longer shutdowns now.At the Energy Information Administration, part of the Energy Department, Joanne Shore, a senior analyst who specializes in gasoline, said, ""The market has tightened, because of all the things that have to be done to gasoline,"" including transition to summer gas and the phasing out of MTBE.""There is a transition issue,"" Ms. Shore said.But she said the 35-cent estimate was too high.Ethanol is pricey and energy-poor. Its price is up by about $1.30 a gallon in the last year, in part because of heavy demand for something to replace MTBE. But ethanol has only about two-thirds as much energy as MTBE does.Charles T. Drevna, executive vice president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, said refiners had faced tough decisions in the late winter and early spring, because the law specified that the oxygenate requirement be dropped on the 270th day, but the refiners were not sure whether the Environmental Protection Agency would publish the regulation that carries out the law on schedule. (It did.)So the refiners, eager to get rid of MTBE but unsure whether they would still face a requirement for oxygenated gasoline, scrambled to line up supplies of ethanol.The oxygenate requirement has been obsolete for years. It was intended to make the fuel mix leaner, reducing air pollution. But that works only on older cars, with carburetors, not in modern vehicles with oxygen sensors and fuel injectors.'"
"'06-05-06,'0','PHILADELPHIA, May 5 (AP) — Toll Brothers, the builder of luxury homes, said on Friday that signed contracts for its homes fell 29 percent in the second quarter and that home deliveries for the year would be 200 lower than expected as the housing market began to slow.After five years of explosive growth, the housing market is in the grip of a slowdown prompted by rising mortgage rates and higher inventories.""It's pretty much what we had thought,"" said William Mack, a home building analyst for Standard & Poor's. ""Things are slowing and at a pretty rapid rate.""But shares of Toll Brothers and other home builders rose yesterday because a weaker-than-projected jobs report for April was seen on Wall Street as giving the Federal Reserve less incentive to raise interest rates. That would slow the rise of mortgage rates.While sales of new homes rose 13.8 percent nationally in March, the median price of homes sold dipped 2.2 percent as builders cut prices. Sales of existing homes edged up in March, but the backlog of unsold homes hit a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors.'"
"'06-05-06,'0','JERUSALEM, May 5 — The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, urged Israel to start peace negotiations when he telephoned the new prime minister, Ehud Olmert, on Friday to congratulate him on formally taking office.The two men are expected to meet this month after Mr. Olmert returns from Washington, where he is likely to seek support for his plans to draw borders with the West Bank. Israel has ruled out peace negotiations with Mr. Abbas while the Palestinian Authority, run by Hamas, the militant Islamic group, refuses to recognize Israel or renounce violence.Mr. Olmert, who had been the acting prime minister since Ariel Sharon had a stroke in January, formally took office on Thursday and said he was prepared to set Israel's boundaries during his government's four-year term.In a move that could further damage peace prospects for the region, however, an Israeli airstrike killed five Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, Reuters reported Friday.The Israeli military said the strike had been on a training camp used by the Popular Resistance Committees, a group of militants responsible for many attacks against Israel, including much of the recent rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israel.Also on Friday, thousands of Palestinians marched in Gaza and the West Bank in support of the Hamas-led government, which organized the marches, and to protest a cutoff in direct aid by the United States and the European Union. Both suspended aid until Hamas recognizes Israel and renounces violence.'"
"'06-05-06,'0','The rules were publicly proposed last summer and went into effect on Thursday.""The safety and security of these participants are of paramount importance to the department,"" officials said in a statement in August.The acting director of the State Department Office of Exchange Coordination and Designation, Stanley Colvin, said last year that the office had received five reports of abuse.Among the recently publicized cases was that of Andrew T. Powers, a high school biology teacher in Gaithersburg, Md., who was convicted last year of sexual assault involving a 17-year-old German girl who lived in his house.In April, Paul Stone of Berea, Ky., pleaded guilty to sodomizing a 15-year-old Taiwanese girl who was staying with his family.A former program coordinator who led the lobbying for the rules suggested that the problem was far greater than the record indicated.It is ""the dirty little secret of the student exchange industry,"" said the former coordinator, Danielle Grijalva of Oceanside, Calif.Many cases have gone unreported, Ms. Grijalva said, because of language and cultural barriers and students' fears that reporting abuse could jeopardize their visas.Ms. Grijalva said she formed the Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students two years ago because of problems reported by an exchange student while she was a program coordinator. The group has received more than 50 reports of abuse, Ms. Grijalva said.""I learned that what I was experiencing were not isolated incidents,"" she said. ""Way too many children were leaving the United States with horrible impressions.""Mr. Hishmeh said his group had adopted screening criteria beyond the federal measures, including criminal checks in all 50 states.""If we're going to do this, we're going to do this properly,"" he said.Mr. Hishmeh added that most exchange programs embraced the added scrutiny.Moacir Rodrigues, executive director of the United Students Association in Mansfield, Tex., said the regulations would make it harder to recruit host families.""They're willing to share their lives, share their homes,"" Mr. Rodrigues said. ""Some people are going to get offended and not have anything to do with it. It's too much trouble.""'"

The exercise price in these stock-option grants was set at $2.42.These options were priced very soon after the private placement when the spread between market and issuance was only 28 cents, not the $1.49 implied in the article.These 48 million shares were all the shares then authorized by shareholders; the apparent ""bargain"" element cited in the article was a result of needing shareholder approval before the grants could actually be made.Our stock-option grants were fully disclosed and overwhelmingly approved by shareholders.

"'06-05-06,'0','South led the diamond queen, which was an unexpected choice. Fu won with his ace and shifted to the heart king. Declarer won with his heart ace and led the club king, ruffing away South's ace. East played a diamond to his king and tried to cash the queen and jack of clubs to discard dummy's heart losers, but North ruffed the third club. The defense took three spades and one diamond for down one.In the other room, Stansby ended in four hearts. This contract can always be defeated, but the defenders lost their way. Hallberg led the spade deuce, suit-preference for clubs, which ran to declarer's ace. South, knowing from the auction that the clubs were 6-0, led a low club to dummy's ten. West threw a diamond, and Chang won with his jack and continued with the club queen.South played low, but West ruffed his partner's trick to shift to a spade, thinking that East might trump it. (But if that were true, surely East would have won trick two with his club king and continued with the club queen, the high cards being suit-preference for spades. West, after ruffing, had to return a trump to ensure defeating the contract.)Now Stansby had a chance. He won with dummy's spade king and discarded a diamond from his hand. Declarer cashed the diamond ace, ruffed a diamond in his hand, trumped the club seven on the board (West pitching a spade), ruffed the spade eight in his hand (East throwing a club) and trumped his last low club to give this end position:It is best to play a diamond now, and to get home, South must ruff with his heart nine and lead the club ace. But declarer called for the heart king, hoping that West had begun with 7-2-4-0 distribution and a doubleton heart ten. East would win with his heart ace and return a club, but West would be unable to ruff.With the actual layout, though, West ruffed the club return to defeat the contract. (To give a full analysis of this deal would take column feet, not inches. If you are curious, do not forget to analyze the effect of moving the heart ten from East to West.)Plus 100 at both tables gave Chang 5 imps. But if Stansby had made four hearts, Welland would have gained 11 imps, a difference of 16. And what was the final margin in the match? Right: 16. It was that close to overtime.In Thursday's column, the end position depicted in the second diagram was at the table where Curtis Cheek was declarer. When Hallberg was declarer, he retained the heart queen, and dummy had the 6-5.'"

"'06-05-07,'0','Mr. Brown called for ""renewal"" of the party after huge Labor losses in local elections last Thursday compounded a sense of crisis following a series of government scandals, missteps and bungles. Mr. Blair reshuffled his cabinet on Friday in a political maneuver compared by columnists to Harold Macmillan's dismissal of seven Conservative ministers in what became known as the ""night of the long knives"" in the 1960's.Today, though, Mr. Blair's adversaries were drawing another comparison with the internecine Conservative feuding of 1990 as Margaret Thatcher's hold on her party fizzled away.Mr. Brown appeared on the BBC's Sunday AM television program, broadcast from a glass-walled studio overlooking the Tower of London famed for the decapitation of traitors to the reigning monarch, and returned frequently to the theme of a ""stable and orderly transition"" to help Labor renew itself after the ""warning shot"" of last week's elections.But, even though he spoke of ""the next phase in my political career,"" he displayed characteristic caution in the wording of his demands.""Because we are in a unique situation where the leader has said he is not going to stay on, then that stable and orderly transition which Tony Blair has said that he wishes to manage — I think people will look to him,"" he said.""I think people will look to him, and it's not essentially a matter for me, it's a matter for him and the Labour Party,"" Mr. Brown said. ""No doubt people will continue to discuss this with him. But at the end of the day I get on with my job.""The events since last Thursday's local vote, when the opposition Conservatives secured 40 percent of the ballot while Labor trailed third with 26 percent, have borne an uncanny resemblance to Mr. Blair's handling of the national elections results one year ago.At that time, he reshuffled his cabinet in the face of demands from Labor Party dissidents for his earlier departure. He then scheduled a televised press conference and a meeting with Labor Party parliamentarians, just as he plans to on Monday. At that time, too, he spoke of a ""stable and orderly transition"" but refused to set a timetable for Labor Party elections to choose a successor.One of Mr. Blair's loyalists, former Transport Minister Stephen Byers, likened the latest assault on the prime minister to a coup. ""And for those people who are organizing a coup against him, they are playing a very dangerous game and they should stop,"" he said.The letter by the dissidents, obtained by the Sunday Telegraph newspaper, said Labor's record was ""now being overshadowed by the continuing and debilitating speculation over the future leadership and direction of our party.""It called for the Labor Party leadership to lay out by mid-summer ""a clear timetable and procedure for the election of a new Labor Party leader."" There was no confirmation of news reports that 50 of Labor's 353 parliamentary legislators had signed the letter.'"
"'06-05-07,'0','In the shakeout Mr. Blair dismissed his home affairs minister, Charles Clarke.Among those who were demoted was Jack Straw, his foreign secretary, who became leader of the House of Commons.Mr. Straw had become a close associate of Condoleezza Rice, the United States secretary of state.Reuters news agency reported that Ms. Rice telephoned Mr. Straw on Friday. Mr. Blair has not explained why he removed Mr. Straw as foreign secretary. But newspapers on Saturday ascribed Mr. Straw's dismissal to factors including Mr. Blair's dislike of the highly publicized friendship between Mr. Straw and Ms. Rice, Mr. Straw's rejection of a possible military solution in the Iran nuclear crisis and Mr. Blair's suspicion that Mr. Straw was positioning himself to win favor with Mr. Brown. Mr. Straw has described the likelihood of military action against Iran as ""inconceivable,"" while Mr. Blair, like the Bush administration, has been more circumspect about keeping options open to pressure Iran.The new foreign minister, Margaret Beckett, a longtime Labor politician who was environment minister, will be plunged into her new job on Monday as she enters negotiations on Iran at the United Nations.In the past, particularly in the Iraq war, Mr. Blair has often taken the lead in running Britain's foreign policy, and Mr. Straw's exit may be designed to give the prime minister more leeway in the Iran crisis.Some newspapers and Labor legislators focused their ire on Mr. Blair's decision to retain John Prescott, the deputy prime minister who has acknowledged having an affair with a secretary. Mr. Prescott, who is regarded as an intermediary between Mr. Brown and Mr. Blair, kept his title and rank but was stripped of most of his responsibilities.""What is the point of John Prescott?"" the Sun tabloid asked, calculating that Mr Prescott's salary, free housing, official car and other perquisites cost taxpayers around $1.1 million a year.The calls for Mr. Blair's departure mirrored events a year ago when he changed his government lineup after being winning a third successive term in office — the first for a Labor government.Then, as now, his foes lined up to demand his departure. Then, as now, he faced down opposition. But he seems more beleaguered this time, with the local ballot showing the extent of the damage caused by a series of government stumbles, crises and scandals. Labor lost 319 of the 1,768 council seats it was defending in voting for 176 local authorities, according to final results.Hazel Blears, a Blair loyalist who was promoted in the reshuffling to chairwoman of the Labor Party, dismissed the outcry about the reshuffling as ""froth"" in remarks to the BBC and said voters were more interested in issues that affected their lives directly. She described the talk of political maneuverings as ""gossip.""'"
"'06-05-07,'0','Some suggest that a Senate proposal to adopt a guest worker program, possibly leading to legal residency and citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, might be inspiring more people to try a crossing. Others say the larger numbers indicate nothing more than stepped up enforcement or even a statistical aberration. Nobody really knows.The peaks and valleys of arrests over the years reflect a variety of social, economic and political influences, including the pull of jobs and family here, a lack of opportunity on the other side, or even the weather.What is certain is the United States keeps building up its border defenses, with more planned this year, including adding 1,500 agents and spending some $35 million in Arizona alone on surveillance equipment.People still keep trying to get in, tucked under the dashboards of cars, tunneling under the fences — more than a dozen passages have been found this year — throwing bicycles over the barriers and pedaling away like weekend enthusiasts, crawling through brush, and walking, walking and walking — sometimes dying in the desert.""They are ingenious sometimes,"" Mr. Kite said.Fresh off a four-day bus ride from León, Mexico, Roberto Estrada, 43, toted a small plastic grocery bag with his belongings and planned to bed down the night before making contact with a smuggler. He said he had heard nothing about the immigration debate in the United States and was simply itching for work, maybe in a restaurant, but he would not get picky.""I'll take whatever job,"" Mr. Estrada said.After a peak of 1,676,438 arrests in 2000, apprehensions dropped, but they have drifted upward again to 1,189,067 in 2005 from 931,557 in 2003.While the Border Patrol attributes the increase to the build up of security, scholars who study the border said it was more likely that migration was rebounding from an economic slump after the Sept. 11 attacks and years of diminished back-and-forth crossings by repeat crossers.In the San Diego sector, which includes some of the Border Patrol's heaviest fortifications, federal agents have apprehended 90,843 people since October, a 33 percent increase over the same period a year before.Along the busiest stretch for crossings, a 1,000-mile stretch from San Diego to the Texas state line, there have been 699,609 arrests over the same period, a 6 percent increase.But arrest figures fluctuate, so the Border Patrol cannot declare a trend. As a rule of thumb, the agency estimates that for every person arrested two or three get through. But because of repeat arrests the number of apprehensions does not necessarily reflect the actual number of people trying to cross.Still, people familiar with the border crossings, including the head of the union representing the border agents, suggest that the crossing attempts are growing, with some of those inspired by the prospect of a guest worker program.""I think we are starting to see the early stage of a rush to take advantage of what is perceived to be a shift in immigration policy,"" said T. J. Bonner, president of the union, the National Border Patrol Council.Mr. Bonner said some of the people arrested had told agents that they believed Congress had approved a guest worker program that would make their presence in the United States legal.Mario Martinez, a spokesman for the Border Patrol in Washington, did not dismiss the guest worker program as a factor in the rising numbers of crossing efforts, but he said other influences, like jobs and reuniting with family, could also account for the increase.Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California, San Diego, said researchers there recently surveyed prospective migrants from the Yucatán Peninsula. They found that 60 percent of them had heard of the guest worker debate and that 30 percent said it would make them more likely to go the United States if it was approved. Only one who had already made the trip said the program was the main reason.Operators of shelters in Mexico said they had noticed an increase in the number of people passing through, but they were also unsure of the cause.The director of the Casa del Migrante shelter in Tijuana, the Rev. Luíz Kendzierski, said shelter visits had increased about 20 percent in the past year. More than anything, he said, grinding poverty in parts of Mexico and Central America and word from relatives about the ease of finding jobs in the United States have pushed most people to try crossing.At Casa Betania, a shelter in Mexicali, Mexico, Tomás Reyes Hernández, the director, said he had heard only a few people mention the prospect of legalization as a reason for crossing.""Most people don't know what is going on in the United States,"" he said.At the Tijuana shelter, men flowed in and out, trading stories about their journey to the border and comparing notes on promising smugglers.More and more people use guides, known as coyotes or polleros, because of the dangers of the desert and the strengthened enforcement.""It's not that hard if you're willing to pay a good smuggler,"" said a 23-year-old man deported from Los Angeles after an arrest for domestic violence. ""The hard part is getting the $2,000, $3,000 it costs for a good one. But sometimes they can get you across right here in Tijuana in the trunk or under the seat of a van.""'"
"'06-05-07,'0','The Defense Department controls most of the intelligence budget and is the biggest user of intelligence. Mr. Rumsfeld also set up his own intelligence agency within the Pentagon when the C.I.A. and the State Department refused to tell him what he wanted to hear about Iraq. It was that office's distortions that formed the basis for what the administration told Congress and the public.In Atlanta, Mr. Rumsfeld denied ever saying flatly that there were dangerous weapons in Iraq. Actually, he did, many times, even as late as March 30, 2003. On Sept. 27, 2002, Mr. Rumsfeld said there was ""bulletproof"" evidence of ties between Al Qaeda and Iraq, including that Iraq had trained Qaeda agents in chemical and biological warfare, and he repeated that myth in response to Mr. McGovern.Which brings us back to the Senate committee. In 2004, Democratic members agreed to split the investigation of Iraq intelligence. The committee issued a report on how bad the information was, but put off until after the 2004 election the question of whether the administration deliberately hyped the evidence. Mr. Roberts tried to kill the investigation entirely, and after the Democrats forced him to proceed, he set rules that seem a lot like the recipe for a whitewash.The investigation, known as Phase 2, is divided into five parts: Did officials' public statements reflect the actual intelligence? Why did the government fail to anticipate the postwar disaster in Iraq? Were there actually any W.M.D. in Iraq? Was the Pentagon's mini-C.I.A. a proper and legal operation? And did any of the disinformation provided by the Iraqi exile leader Ahmad Chalabi get into any ""intelligence product""?Mr. Roberts has so gummed up the first part of the investigation that it is going to take forever to complete and is unlikely to be of much clarity. The only public statements that matter are those by Mr. Bush and his top aides. But Mr. Roberts included any statement, by any public official, including members of Congress, going back to 1991.Beyond dragging out the process further, the intent, obviously, is to suggest that Mr. Bush said the same things that Democratic senators and others did. That has no significance. They did not decide to have a war and had access only to the sanitized intelligence fed to them by the administration. Bill Clinton and Mr. Bush's father did think there were dangerous weapons in Iraq — back in the 20th century. By the time the war started, those weapons had long been eliminated by inspections and sanctions.It is worth knowing why policy makers failed to anticipate the insurgency and other postwar nightmares, but the structure of this part of the investigation is flawed as well. The Senate investigation of Mr. Chalabi's involvement is limited to ""intelligence products,"" which the C.I.A. produces. But it was not the C.I.A. that predicted rose petals in Baghdad and a virtually problem-free transition to democracy; it was Mr. Chalabi and his henchmen, creatures of Mr. Rumsfeld's team at the Pentagon. And it was the intelligence business that Mr. Rumsfeld now pretends not to run that used Mr. Chalabi's myths in an attempt to rebut the skeptical State Department and make dubious information seem more reliable.It was helpful of Mr. Rumsfeld to remind us why this inquiry is still so important. The least Mr. Roberts and his committee can do is to finish the flawed investigation and make the results public.'"
"'06-05-07,'0','In 2002, the foundation filed suit against a coffee shop in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria, for refusing to serve Roma.The foundation won, and has since filed suits against nightclub owners, hospitals and other companies, charging that they refuse to hire or serve Roma.The cases cited antidiscrimination laws enacted to prepare Bulgaria to join the European Union, which it hopes to do next year.Some of those working on behalf of the Roma say these efforts offer a model for helping other groups that face discrimination.George Soros, the billionaire who is one of the biggest donors to Roma rights groups, promises that ""a similar effort will be made with the Muslim minority"" of Europe once Roma gains have been secured.However, European law is based on civil law, meaning that a court decision does not automatically become the law of the land — and that court victories achieved in campaigns of strategic litigation do not necessarily have far-reaching effects.Still, Panayote Dimitras, executive director of the Greek branch of Helsinki Monitor, a human rights group that also operates in the Balkans, said he had cited court decisions from Eastern Europe in his Roma cases in Greece.Ms. Petrova said she hoped the gains made in Eastern Europe would reverberate in Western Europe, where Roma also struggle for their rights.The Roma efforts go beyond legal challenges. In December, Gyorgy Makula, a young police officer in Budapest, founded the Roma Police Association in Budapest. He modeled it on the National Black Police Association, a group founded in Illinois in 1972 to help black officers around the United States fight racist law enforcement practices and create a more positive relationship with minority communities.For the first time, there is even Roma representation in Brussels. After Hungary joined the European Union in 2004, it elected two Roma to the union's Parliament.Still, there is no unified Roma movement and no leader like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to help create one, nor galvanizing figures like Malcolm X or Rosa Parks.And not all legal cases succeed. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg rejected a case about 18 nonhandicapped Czech Roma children allowed to enroll only in schools for the handicapped. Estimates are that up to 75 percent of Roma children in the Czech Republic are shunted to special schools. The case has been resubmitted.Roma are believed to have migrated from India to Europe up to 1,000 years ago, bringing nomadic ways, dark skin, insular culture and strange customs that paved the way for permanent marginalization.The Nazis considered the Roma racially inferior, grouping them with Jews and the disabled, and killed half a million in concentration camps in World War II.Even today, much remains unclear about the Roma. There is no agreement even on their numbers in Europe. Estimates range from 7 million to 15 million, and 5 percent to 10 percent of the population in many Eastern European countries.In Hungary, the struggle to desegregate schools has come here to Miskolc, one of the poorest regions in the European Union. Andras Ujlaky, president of the Chance for Children Foundation, a Hungarian group that focuses on Roma schooling, recently visited Roma community leaders here to discuss integration of a school near the neighborhood of scores of squalid buildings where Ms. Krappai lives.Mr. Ujlaky drank instant coffee as he sat on a worn couch in the small, tidy home of a community leader and discussed plans for children to refuse to enroll in the all-Roma school nearby.If the children have trouble transferring, he said, he plans to file a discrimination suit, hoping to prompt a procedural review that would close the Roma-only school.""Now that the law is in place we should use it,"" Mr. Ujlaky said.'"
"'06-05-07,'0','As a public relations spectacle and customer-flattering exercise, the event was a smashing success for Boeing. Now the trick is to keep the lovefest going — and not just with China, but with customers all over the world.In recent years, Boeing has stumbled badly, ceding its decades-long-dominance in commercial aviation to Airbus and becoming mired in a string of scandals over Pentagon contracts. The terrorist attacks of 2001 depressed demand at a time when the company's product line paled against appealing new planes from Airbus. In one year alone, from 2001 to 2002, Boeing's profits dropped 80 percent.Boeing's executive suite also became a revolving door, as ethical failures forced the resignations of two chief executives in little more than a year. The first, Philip M. Condit, departed in December 2003 amid a Pentagon contract scandal; the other, Harry C. Stonecipher, stepped down in March 2005 over his adulterous affair with a subordinate. The Pentagon scandal also led to a prison sentence for Boeing's former chief financial officer, Michael M. Sears.Boeing's ethical woes are still not over, so the company is not ready to declare a turnaround. It may have to pay more than $1 billion in fines to settle matters, and its top lawyer, Douglas G. Bain, recently warned that some people in the government believe that Boeing is ""rotten to the core.""But the view from Seattle, the headquarters of Boeing's commercial jet operations, has more of that Chinese pep-rally spirit than such gloomy talk might indicate.With revenue having grown for the second consecutive year, to $54.8 billion in 2005, and a record number of orders on its books, Boeing has had a huge gain in its stock price — to more than $80 a share, more than three times its nadir of $25 in 2003. Boeing's 1,002 orders last year fell short of Airbus's 1,055. But Boeing's orders included more wide-body planes, which analysts valued at $10 billion to $15 billion more than Airbus's.But what is really driving the high spirits at Boeing — and the high stock price — is a plane that has not yet taken to the skies: the 787. It is Boeing's first new commercial airplane in a decade. Even though it will not go into service until 2008, its first three years of production are already sold out — with 60 of the 345 planes on order going to China, a $7.2 billion deal that Mr. Hu cited in his presentation. Other big orders have come from Qantas Airways, All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines and Northwest Airlines.Big orders mean big money, of course — and that is good, because analysts estimate that Boeing and its partners will invest $8 billion to develop the 787. Boeing is also risking a new way of doing business and a new way of building airplanes: farming out production of most major components to other companies, many outside the United States, and using a carbon-fiber composite material in place of aluminum for about half of each plane.IF it works, Boeing could vault back in front of Airbus, perhaps decisively. If it fails, Boeing could be relegated to the status of a permanent also-ran, having badly miscalculated the future of commercial aviation and unable to meet the changing needs of its customers.""The entire company is riding on the wings of the 787 Dreamliner,"" said Loren B. Thompson, an aviation expert at the Lexington Institute, a research and lobbying group in Arlington, Va., that focuses on the aerospace and military industries. ""It's the most complicated plane ever.""Boeing calls the 787 Dreamliner a ""game changer,"" with a radically different approach to aircraft design that it says will transform aviation. A lightweight one-piece carbon-fiber fuselage, for instance, replaces 1,200 sheets of aluminum and 40,000 rivets, and is about 15 percent lighter. The extensive use of composites, already used to a lesser extent in many other jets, helps to improve fuel efficiency.To convince potential customers of the benefits of composite — similar to the material used to make golf clubs and tennis rackets — Boeing gives them hammers to bang against an aluminum panel, which dents, and against a composite one, which does not.At the same time, the 787 has new engines with bigger fans that are expected to let the plane sip 20 percent less fuel per mile than similarly sized twin-engine planes, like Boeing's own 767 and many from Airbus.This is no small sales point, with oil fetching around $70 a barrel and many airlines struggling to make a profit even as they pack more passengers into their planes.""The 787 is the most successful new launch of a plane — ever,"" said Howard A. Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Jeffries & Company, an investment bank that has advised a Boeing subsidiary. ""But,"" he added, ""the burden is that their engineering is as good as they say it is.""Mr. Thompson of the Lexington Institute says the risks are great with a program this ambitious. ""Right now, Boeing is perceived to have a world-beating product with the 787,"" he said. ""But if something went wrong, it would overnight change the perception of the company.""The 787 is designed to carry 220 to 300 people on routes from North America to Europe and Asia. Boeing is counting on it to replace the workhorse 767, which is being phased out, and, it hopes, a few Airbus models as well. Its advantages go beyond fuel efficiency: Boeing designed the 787 to fly long distances while keeping passengers relatively comfortable.That approach grows out of another gamble by Boeing — that the future of the airline business will be in point-to-point nonstop flights with medium-size planes rather than the current hub-and-spoke model favored by Airbus, which is developing the 550-seat A380 superjumbo as its premier long-haul jetliner. Flying point to point eliminates the need for most passengers to change planes, a competitive advantage so long as the Dreamliner is as comfortable and as fast as a bigger aircraft.Unlike the 767 and other planes designed and built in the 1980's and even the 90's, which were made to be pressurized to simulate the thin air found at 8,000 feet, the 787 will allow pressurization to be set for conditions at 6,000 feet. After putting some frequent-flier volunteers into a pressure chamber in Oklahoma to simulate flights of 9 to 15 hours, Boeing concluded that 6,000 feet was well below the level where most people experience the headaches and other symptoms of altitude sickness.And after talking with passengers around the world, Boeing designed the 787 to have higher humidity and more headroom than other airplanes, and to provide the largest windows of any commercial plane flying today.""We are trying to reconnect passengers to the flying experience,"" said Kenneth G. Price, a Boeing fleet revenue analyst. With airlines squeezing every last cent and cutting back service, ""flying is not enjoyable,"" Mr. Price said. ""Every culture fantasizes about flying,"" he added. ""All superheroes fly. But we were taking a magical experience and beating the magic out.""Even more innovative for Boeing is the way it makes the 787. Most of the design and construction, along with up to 40 percent of the estimated $8 billion in development costs, is being outsourced to subcontractors in six other countries and hundreds of suppliers around the world. Mitsubishi of Japan, for example, is making the wings, a particularly complex task that Boeing always reserved for itself. Messier-Dowty of France is making the landing gear and Latecoere the doors. Alenia Aeronautica of Italy was given parts of the fuselage and tail.Nor are these foreign suppliers simply building to Boeing specifications. Instead, they are being given the freedom, and the responsibility, to design the components and to raise billions of dollars in development costs that are usually shouldered by Boeing.This transformation did not come overnight, of course, nor did it begin spontaneously. Boeing changed because it had to, analysts said.""Starting in 2000, Airbus was doing well,"" said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, an aviation research firm in Fairfax, Va. ""Boeing had to reconsider how it did business. That led to the framework for the 787 — getting the development risk off the books of Boeing and coming up with a killer application.""BOEING plans to bring the 787 to market in four and a half years, which is 16 to 18 months faster than most other models. All of that is good, Mr. Aboulafia added, if it works. It is a tall order for a wholly new plane being built with new materials, many from new suppliers and assembled in a new way. ""The 787 is operating on an aggressive timetable and with aggressive performance goals,"" he said. ""It leaves no margin for error.""Never before has Boeing farmed out so much work to so many partners — and in so many countries. The outsourcing is so extensive that Boeing acknowledges it has no idea how many people around the world are working on the 787 project.Airbus, Boeing's sole rival in making big commercial airliners, is also making a big bet on the future, but in a different direction. The companies agree that in 20 years, the commercial aviation market may double, with today's big orders from China, India and the Middle East to be followed by increased sales to American and European carriers as they reorganize and reduce costs.By 2024, Boeing estimates, 35,000 commercial planes will be flying, more than twice the number now aloft, and 26,000 new planes will be needed to satisfy additional demand and replace aging ones. But how passengers will get from place to place, and in what planes, will depend on whether Boeing or Airbus has correctly forecast the future.Boeing believes that passengers will want more frequent nonstop flights between major destinations — what the industry calls ""city pairs."" That is what led to the big bet on the Dreamliner, a midsize wide-body plane that can fly nonstop between almost any two global cities — say, Boston to Athens, or Seattle to Osaka — and go such long distances at a lower cost than other aircraft.Boeing focused on the 787 after it dropped plans in late 2001 to build the ""Sonic Cruiser,"" a nearly supersonic aircraft, when its customers said they wanted a plane that was cheaper to operate, not faster.Airbus believes that airplane size is more important than frequent nonstop flights and that passengers will stick with a hub-and-spoke system in which a passenger in, say, Seattle, will fly to Los Angeles and transfer to an Airbus 380 to go to Tokyo before catching a smaller plane to Osaka. That view has led it to spend $12 billion to develop the double-deck A380, the largest passenger jet ever — a bet that is as crucial to its future as the 787 is to Boeing's.""We have a fundamental difference with Airbus on how airlines will accommodate growth,"" said Randolph S. Baseler, Boeing's vice president for marketing. ""They are predicting flat growth in city pairs. We are saying that people want more frequent nonstop flights. They believe airplane size will increase, and we believe that airplanes will not increase in size that much. Those two different market scenarios lead to two different product strategies.""The market, of course, will determine the winner, but given the industry's long lead times, that may not be clear for 10 to 20 years. For now, airlines have ordered 159 copies of the A380 — which has a list price of $295 million and is scheduled to enter service this year — and more than twice as many 787's, which list for $130 million and are scheduled to enter service in two years.Both sides are hedging their bets somewhat. To compete with Airbus in superjumbos — a market that Airbus estimates at 1,250 planes in the next 20 years, and Boeing at only 300 — Boeing is offering an upgrade of its 747, called a 747-8, which will have 450 seats and will use the fuel-efficient engines developed for the 787. The 747-8 has 18 orders so far.To take on the 787, Airbus is offering the midsize A350, a retooled version of its A330. But it is having little success so far. Vagn Soerensen, the chairman of Austrian Airlines, has complained that the A350's operating economies did not match those of the 787, a view shared by Singapore Airlines and other big potential customers. Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, the chairman of the International Lease Finance Corporation, a major airline leasing company, stunned a trade meeting last month by saying that Airbus should scrap the A350 and come up with an entirely new design — a move that could cost Airbus billions in development costs when it is already paying the multibillion-dollar bill for the A380.Mr. Aboulafia of the Teal Group said: ""There is no proof that the market is endorsing the A350. They don't have a single blue-chip customer.""Boeing's recent rebound in commercial aviation would have been difficult to predict in the early part of the decade. Back then, Airbus's popular A330's and A320's were hammering Boeing's twin-aisle 767 and single-aisle 737. During that period Boeing lost more than 20 percentage points of market share — and 60,000 employees in the frantic cost-cutting that resulted.To fight back, Boeing encouraged the United States government to turn to the World Trade Organization to attack what Washington says are government subsidies to Airbus. Despite Boeing's improving fortunes, the case is still pending — on the theory that any settlement would compensate for the past and make it harder for Airbus to get government aid if it wants to redesign the A350. It is expected to be decided in 2007.Since the filing of the case, however, the picture has brightened for nearly every Boeing plane. For instance, the 777, a long-haul twin-engine plane, has outsold Airbus's A340 because the Airbus plane has four engines — a decided disadvantage in an era of high fuel prices.Airlines placed orders for 154 of the 777's last year, a record, while Airbus booked only 15 orders for the A340. The 777 has captured about 70 percent of all orders in its market since the A340 made its debut in 1997.""The A340 is dying slowly and horribly,"" Mr. Aboulafia said. ""It is one of the more colossal failures in aviation. With higher fuel prices, no one wants four engines.""In the highly competitive market for single-aisle planes — the workhorses that are used on most short-haul domestic flights and are the backbone of low-cost airlines — the two companies have brisk sellers in the Boeing 737 and the Airbus 320. To compete, Boeing recently overhauled its 737 production line to cut final assembly to 11 days from 28.The 737 is considered the best-selling commercial jet in history. The 5,000th 737 was just put into service, and the current backlog is 1,000 orders. A big buyer of the 737 is now China, which placed an order for 150 to coincide with Mr. Hu's trip. Boeing's next big project will be to come up with a replacement for the 737; the new plane is expected to draw on Dreamliner technology.Yet as rosy as things seem to be at Boeing's commercial operations here, the company in general has still not emerged from the cloud of scandal. Boeing is working with federal prosecutors to settle a high-profile investigation into the theft of proprietary documents from Lockheed Martin.Three midlevel Boeing employees were charged by the federal government with stealing the documents, which could have been used to help Boeing rig bids for government rocket-launching contracts. The government also stripped Boeing of $1 billion in rocket business.ON top of that, Boeing was found to have illegally recruited a former Air Force procurement official, Darleen A. Druyun, who had overseen Boeing contracts with the Pentagon and steered business to the company. Ms. Druyun ended up in prison, as did Mr. Sears, the company's former chief financial officer, who had recruited her. The scandal also caused the Pentagon to pull back from a $20 billion contract to use Boeing 767's as aerial refueling tankers and to open the program to competition from Airbus.Settling both these investigations could cost Boeing another $1 billion.In addition, Boeing just paid $15 million to settle federal accusations that it violated the Arms Control Export Act by exporting an electronic navigation chip that could have been used for military purposes. The chips, which have been used in the guidance system of Maverick air-to-ground missiles, were built into the navigation systems of 94 commercial jets Boeing sold to China from 2000 to 2003.Still, the Boeing chief executives who were on watch during these scandals have benefited handsomely from the rise in Boeing's stock. Recent company filings show that Mr. Stonecipher got $11 million from his Boeing performance shares and Mr. Condit got an additional $9 million from his holdings.Back in Mr. Mulally's office in Seattle, where the commercial aircraft headquarters stayed after the corporate office moved to Chicago in 2001, these scandals seem a million miles away. Rarely, he said, does the topic of scandal come up in conversation with potential customers. Most of the scandals, he noted, were in Boeing's military business.""No impact,"" Mr. Mulally said, waving his hand as if to brush away the very idea. ""We haven't been in violation, and our commercial customers care about us.""Mr. Mulally's operation hasn't dwelled on these scandals but kept focused on the 787. ""It's a really big deal,"" he said. ""It's not like we bring out a new model each year.""'"

"'06-05-07,'0','Making your way through downtown Port Chester in the quaint old manner — on foot, in the open air, looking for a way into a mall known as the Waterfront at Portchester — gives you a lot of time to ponder the problem of ugly malls and thoughtless land-use decisions.The mall, part of a $100 million downtown renewal project, turns its back on downtown. It presents Main Street with a long, sullen wall, a blank stucco barricade without windows or doors — its molded lintels and sills creating merely the illusion of windows — and a gaping truck bay for the hauling of freight. When Allen Ginsberg, in ""Howl,"" wrote ""Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows!"", he might have been anticipating this architectural stinker, which envisions the civic life as something to be conducted within a closed box.The real downtown is across the street, where you will find a dilapidated 1888 firehouse, a sidewalk with the words ""Steamship Tickets"" embedded in the concrete, and a motley assortment of stores, delis, bakeries and other mom-and-pop businesses. Whether this bustling, sometimes dumpy-looking business district strikes you as thriving, decaying or something in between depends heavily on your understanding of what constitutes blight.The mayor and village board and others who like the Waterfront mall feel sure they know blight when they see it. This is bad news for the moms and pops — many of them Latino immigrants — who fear their businesses could be forced out under eminent-domain law, if the current administration's big-box vision of urban renewal expands. An article in The Times by Joseph Berger in February captured the plaintive mood of the residents from Peru, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador who fret about being ordered to make way — as other businesses in Port Chester did — for the chain stores from nowhere.Their worries are echoed on a national scale. The Supreme Court recently upheld the right of the City of New London, Conn., to seize private property for economic development, provoking a nationwide rush by state lawmakers to refine and restrict their states' ability to exercise such power. The legislative scramble is understandable, although the eminent domain principle, which gave down-and-out New London a means to regain its economic footing, is sound.The question is how to balance the scales of justice when the powerful — a municipality and a developer — take something valuable from the weak. In New York State, whose eminent domain law has been criticized as unfair to the little guy, there have been efforts to mitigate the harm. Assemblyman Richard Brodsky changed state law to require that property owners on the losing end of eminent domain decisions be alerted by certified mail or told in person, rather than through a fine-print legal notice in a newspaper.Assemblyman Adam Bradley wants to protect homeowners and small businesses with a law that tries to make sure they are compensated fairly. It would entitle homeowners and mom-and-pop businesses (with receipts of less than $1 million) to a jury trial over eminent domain compensation, and require that they receive at least enough money to relocate in an equivalent area and to cover lawyers' fees, moving expenses and closing costs.'"
"'06-05-07,'0','""It was like a miracle,"" he said. ""The next day, none of them landed.""The wolf figures have been 95 percent effective since September, Mr. Salajka said.Other recent attempts to control the Island's geese population — like spraying sticky liquid on the grass, using fake plastic swans to scare them, addling eggs so they do not hatch or using live Border collies to chase the geese — have had limited success. And experts are skeptical of the long-term effectiveness of the fake wolves.""It's been a constant evolution of tactics,"" said Craig Kessler, the manager of conservation programs on Long Island for Ducks Unlimited. ""The barking dog silhouette is just the latest.""David Feld, a program director for GeesePeace, a group in Falls Church, Va., that says it is dedicated to humane management of geese, said he doubted that the plywood figures would keep the birds away, especially near water.""We haven't had much success with inanimate objects,"" said Mr. Feld, who recalled failed devices like balloons with scary eyes, plastic alligators and even fake dead geese. ""A lot of people are desperate and will try anything.""Alex Korenevski, a maintenance worker at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Church in Centerport, said the dog figures he made from Mr. Salajka's template helped keep some geese off the grass, but certainly not all.""It's at least 50 percent better,"" Mr. Korenevski said. ""The dogs help, but it's not a complete solution.""Our Lady Queen of Martyrs is next to the water in Centerport Harbor, and geese often waddle up to eat the grass. While the plywood dogs may deter some geese, others graze on, seemingly unaware of the lawn ornaments meant to keep them away.Since last fall, local maintenance workers have passed the dog and wolf templates around.Ennio Lapini, the superintendent at Peninsula Golf Club in Massapequa, said he gave Mr. Salajka $150 for two dog cutouts in December. Mr. Lapini used them as outlines to make 50 to 60 dogs, which guarded against geese on the fairways all winter. Mr. Lapini said the fake dogs were making a difference.""This year is the best year I have ever seen,"" he said. ""My greens and my fairways have been so clean.""Mr. Lapini has added his own twist: recorded barking sounds that blare when motion-activated sensors are tripped. Although he said the barking scared the geese away, a few early-season golfers were frightened as well. Mr. Lapini removed the equipment for the golfing season and is waiting for the fall to put it back out.The plywood dogs installed on the Town of Oyster Bay golf course in Woodbury were scary enough to startle passers-by who called the police, saying they had seen coyotes there. Workers use about 20 wooden dogs to keep 126 acres of greens, tee boxes and fairways goose-free.So far, the dogs have been about 60 percent effective in keeping geese off the course, said Matt Shelley, the groundskeeper, and Gary Williams, the maintenance mechanic.Wooden dogs have also popped up on corporate lawns, at schools and in parks, but many are simply stuck into the ground on stakes, like the dogs at Heckscher Park in Huntington, which the geese there mostly ignore.The device that Mr. Salajka and others make pivots in a piece of PVC pipe, allowing the dogs to swivel in the wind. ""The key is the movement,"" Mr. Salajka said, smiling. ""Huntington's doesn't work because they don't move.""Real dogs, like Border collies, have been used to round up geese for slaughter at Jones Beach and Belmont Lake state parks. The meat goes to soup kitchens and homeless shelters.George Gorman, the director of operations for state parks on Long Island, said there had been a half-dozen roundups in the last few years, eliminating a few hundred geese each time. The Department of Environmental Conservation has added goose hunting seasons in the winter to further cull the resident flock. Animal rights groups have regularly protested the hunts and roundups.Despite the efforts, experts say the resident goose population on the Island, estimated at 20,000, will double in five years.Mr. Salajka's cutouts seem to work best against fly-over geese. Once they see the dogs below, geese abort their landing, but it only moves them to other grassy areas nearby. Keeping geese from nesting will be the true test, as they tend to breed where they are born.""When birds molt, they can't fly,"" said Mr. Feld, of GeesePeace. ""They don't care about people, dogs or anything."" Geese will start molting next month. Meanwhile, the wooden dogs seem to be multiplying almost as fast as the geese. And fad or not, many people say they are worth a try.""Parks and golf courses are a perfect location for this to be used,"" said Mr. Gorman, the state parks official. ""We definitely would look into it.""'"
"'06-05-07,'0','After the initial run-through, Mr. Giacchino discusses possible changes by intercom with Mr. Simonec, who listens through headphones from the podium. Identifying the musical bars by number, Mr. Giacchino says: ""Everyone at 46, decrescendo into 47. They should just get softer. In 64, maybe we should just have trumpets there. The timpani at 104? That should be really quiet.""Another rehearsal and a few minutes later, the lights are dimmed and six bare red bulbs around the stage flash on. The recording has begun. ""We'll get your drink orders in five minutes,"" Mr. Simonec says just before the downbeat. "" 'Mission: Impossible III,' 2M1, Take 1,"" announces an assistant in the booth. By 11:10 a.m., Take 4 has been recorded and deemed the best. Four minutes of music down, another 90-plus to go.THE fact that ""Mission: Impossible III,"" which opened in theaters on Friday, is a $150 million picture and Paramount's big summer tent-pole movie doesn't seem to faze anyone. The mood is buoyant, studio executives aren't around to monitor progress, and even Mr. Abrams isn't present half the time. He's running back and forth across town to fine-tune the editing, supervise final visual effects, oversee the dubbing (combining dialogue, sound effects and music) and attend to myriad other last-minute details.""The studio gave us everything we needed,"" Mr. Giacchino said midway through an afternoon of music-mixing at Warner Brothers 12 days later. Mr. Abrams has been allowed to use his team, Mr. Giacchino added: ""not just me, but his editors, the writers, the production designer.""""It's really a group of friends,"" he continued, ""which is the greatest thing about working with him. It makes me feel like I'm 10 again, making movies in the backyard with my friends.""The backyard for Mr. Giacchino, 38, was in Edgewater Park, N.J., where he grew up watching — and listening to — Hanna-Barbera cartoons, ""The A-Team"" and reruns of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."" He graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York, but, as music became his main interest, he took classes at Juilliard and, later, film-music extension courses at U.C.L.A.A period in the late 90's creating music for video games (""The Lost World,"" ""Medal of Honor"") led to a call from Mr. Abrams to score ""Alias"" in 2001. ""Lost"" followed in 2004, as did Mr. Giacchino's debut feature, Pixar's much-admired, high-grossing animated film ""The Incredibles."" For its retro James Bond-meets-the-Jetsons score, Mr. Giacchino was nominated for a Grammy and won the music prize from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. The music for ""Lost"" has since won him an Emmy.His appreciation of 60's action-adventure music made him an obvious choice for ""Mission: Impossible III."" ""It has one foot in the 60's and one foot in the 21st century,"" Mr. Giacchino said of his score. ""That was really the goal from Day 1, to anchor it where it was born and yet take it somewhere, hopefully, very fun and new and different.""That becomes apparent on the third day of recording, when the orchestra tackles cue 4M1, the opening of a long, highly charged sequence that finds Mr. Cruise's Hunt and his Impossible Missions Force team undertaking a complex assignment in Rome. Mr. Giacchino and Mr. Abrams had decided to use Mr. Schifrin's familiar ""Mission: Impossible"" theme as a fleeting celebratory note in what is otherwise a very dark story, but Mr. Giacchino tantalizes the listener with elements of the theme throughout the buildup, making the payoff even greater.Still, much of the music follows the action and is related only peripherally to Mr. Schifrin's original themes. Mr. Abrams explained: ""My goal was to have each action sequence come out of character. We are tracking the emotional state of the characters through it, so that at the beginning, middle and end of those sequences, it was never about the action but always about the characters. Michael gives you the voice of the characters where you can't really have dialogue. He is playing what matters at all times, but he does it in such a subtle way that you don't realize he's been providing you with the information and the emotion that you need to really understand what a sequence means."" In addition to Mr. Cruise, the cast playing those characters includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ving Rhames and Keri Russell.STILL active as a composer and conductor, Lalo Schifrin, 73, has not been asked to score any of the big-screen adaptations of ""Mission: Impossible."" But he is not unhappy. ""I feel great,"" he said in a telephone interview from his home in Beverly Hills, ""because new generations of filmgoers and people in general are becoming acquainted with the theme. It's like a bridge across time. And maybe it's a good idea, because other composers can have a fresh approach.""When Mr. Giacchino landed the assignment, he asked Mr. Schifrin to lunch. ""He is very nice and very humble,"" said Mr. Schifrin, who said he told Mr. Giacchino how much he was enjoying the music of ""Lost.""Among the younger composer's other fans are the actress Jennifer Garner (star of ""Alias""), the NPR personality Sarah Vowell (the voice of Violet in ""The Incredibles"") and the director Thomas Bezucha (whose film ""The Family Stone"" Mr. Giacchino scored last year), all of whom stopped by during the recording sessions. The actor Dermot Mulroney, another ""Family Stone"" alumnus as well as a professional cellist, played in the orchestra. Even Mr. Cruise arrived one afternoon and stayed long enough to be invited to ""conduct"" the orchestra for a publicity photo.Mr. Giacchino is unusual among composers in Hollywood. Although he is conversant with the technology, he generally chooses not to use electronic instruments and insists on employing real musicians, even in budget-conscious television. He also places a high value on the work of those who came before him. One of his five percussionists was Emil Richards, who 30 years ago played bongos on the original ""Mission: Impossible"" theme; and one of his orchestrators was Jack Hayes, 87, whose work with Elmer Bernstein, Henry Mancini and Alfred Newman is legendary among Hollywood musicians.""I think my writing has an old-fashioned feel to it, for whatever reason,"" Mr. Giacchino said. ""I'm just so influenced by the music that I listened to growing up, a lot of it out of the 60's, so it has a natural tendency to feel like it's from another era.""Mr. Abrams agreed. ""Michael follows in that tradition,"" he said. ""It's interesting, because it isn't derivative and it's not a knowing nod to a style. It's a true passion for the glory days of film music, and he writes from that place sincerely. So it's not phony and posturing. It's passion.""'"
"'06-05-07,'0','Consider how often a stock closes within 12.5 cents of one of its option's strike prices. On all days other than the expiration date, the researchers found, this happens about 10.5 percent of the time. But on option expiration days, this frequency jumps a full percentage point, to around 11.5 percent. That suggests that option strike prices are acting like magnets, drawing stock prices toward them.This clustering may not seem a big deal, but the researchers say they are confident that it can't be attributed to chance. And the dollars involved are substantial. Some investors' portfolios will increase in value on the expiration day because of the clustering, while others' portfolios will suffer. The researchers estimate that for the average option expiration day from 1996 through 2002, these portfolio shifts totaled at least $9.1 billion. On an annual basis, this amounts to more than $100 billion.Could the cause of this clustering have nothing to do with options expiration? The researchers believe not, since they were unable to find a similar pattern among stocks for which no options exist. They also examined what happened to these stocks when and if options began to be traded on them. They found that clustering generally appeared almost immediately in these stocks' trading patterns on expiration days.This clustering does not automatically mean that these stocks are being manipulated, the researchers say. It could also be caused by straightforward hedging transactions that are regularly undertaken by market makers on options exchanges. Marty Kearney, senior instructor at the Options Institute, the educational arm of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said he believes that these market makers' hedges cause the bulk of any price clustering on options expiration day.The study's authors don't disagree that market makers play a large role. But they found that the market makers' activities could not fully explain the clustering. They say it is likely that manipulation is also taking place.Who would have an incentive to manipulate stocks this way? One group would be those who sell options short, known as option writers. Traders in this group in effect are betting that the options' underlying stocks will rise (in the case of puts they have sold short) or fall (in the case of calls). They could lose big if these stocks move too far in the wrong direction.You would need to be a very wealthy investor indeed to be able to buy or sell enough shares of a stock to move its price in a given direction. But the researchers believe that some would qualify. They focused special attention on a group known as firm proprietary traders, which includes employees of large investment banks who are trading options for those banks' accounts. The researchers argue that these traders would be in a position to manipulate stock prices by selling large numbers of shares whose prices they wanted to keep from rising and by buying other shares whose prices they wanted to support.The researchers say that it is impossible to identify any particular firm that may have engaged in manipulation because they had access only to aggregate data for firm proprietary traders as a whole.Even if they did have data for individual firms, it would still be hard to prove that any one of them specifically engaged in deliberate stock manipulation, which would be illegal. Such proof would depend on demonstrating what the firm's traders were intending to do when buying or selling stocks on expiration day. And there is no shortage of plausible explanations that those traders could provide for their behavior.In an interview, Lawrence E. Harris, a former chief economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a finance professor at the University of Southern California, says the difficulty in proving manipulation is probably an inherent feature of modern markets. ""Because the markets are so complex,"" he said, ""it is relatively easy for traders engaged in manipulation to offer alternative explanations for their behavior that would make it difficult to successfully prosecute them.""Professor Harris nonetheless said that ""when presented with the data suggesting manipulation by firm proprietary traders, it's reasonable to expect that the S.E.C. would consider investigating the matter further."" The S.E.C. had no comment on the researchers' study.At least two major lessons can be drawn from the study, according to Professor Harris. First, he said, ""there are limits to what the S.E.C. can do to protect you from the actions of clever traders who arrange their trades to put you at a disadvantage."" The second, he said, is this: ""Unsophisticated traders should be wary of trading options.""'"
"'06-05-07,'0','Since then, this amount has certainly risen with the price of gasoline, but so has average income. John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, estimates that in 2006 the average household will devote $2,150 of its $46,302 in consumer expenditures to gasoline — or 4.6 percent.""This proportion is certainly up from recent years, but it is something that most households can cope with,"" said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Deloitte Research. The difference in spending on gasoline from 2004 to 2006, then, is an extra $10.62 a week, about the cost of going to a movie. In 2004, for comparison, the typical household spent significantly less on gasoline than on discretionary things like entertainment ($2,218), or food away from home ($2,434), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Drill down a little further, and it becomes apparent why rising gas prices may not be as economically damaging as has been assumed. A person with a comparatively low income who has to drive long distances — say, a sales clerk in Wyoming who commutes 100 miles — will be hurt a great deal, especially if she drives a gas-guzzling pickup. But for people with high incomes who don't drive much — say, an actress in Los Angeles who drives her Toyota Prius hybrid to the studio lot, or a hedge fund manager who commutes from Greenwich, Conn., to Manhattan by train — higher gas prices won't factor into spending decisions.These may be extreme examples. Still, income and gasoline use vary widely by geography. In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority carries 7.7 million passengers a day in its subway, bus and train systems, more than the combined populations of South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Nebraska.What's more, consumers with a greater ability to absorb the pain of higher gasoline prices buy a disproportionately large amount of the stuff. In 2004, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 26.4 percent of households with more than $70,000 in annual income bought about 40 percent of all gasoline and motor oil. The 41.4 percent of households that earned more than $50,000 accounted for 58.4 percent of total expenditures. Even at the higher prices, these comparatively better-off households — which account for 64 percent of overall consumer spending — are still devoting only a small fraction of their total spending to gas.Maybe that is why prices near $3 a gallon haven't put a significant dent in Americans' overall gasoline use. (Mr. Felmy of the American Petroleum Institute said total gasoline consumption rose about 0.5 percent in the first quarter.) Compared with switching from a car to a commute by bus or train, or undertaking the expense of buying a new, more fuel-efficient car, paying more for gas is a minor inconvenience for many consumers.That doesn't mean Americans should be complacent. Expensive gas is a burden for those at the lower end of the income scale, whose wages have generally stagnated during this expansion. Ms. Franco of the Conference Board noted that consumer confidence fell in April among households making less than $35,000.Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, says that people who worry about the impact of expensive oil shouldn't look just at the prices at the local Mobil station. When a spike in a crucial commodity evolves into a long-lasting plateau, the higher costs can spill over into a wide range of other products and services.""We haven't seen the high price of oil show up in the prices of chemicals, plastics, paint and rubber yet,"" Mr. Goldstein said. ""But when it happens, it is going to drive up the cost of a lot of goods.""'"
"'06-05-07,'0','Despite soaring gas prices, rentals for recreational vehicles are rising. R.V. rental outlets are expecting a 20 percent jump in business this year compared with last year, according to preliminary results from a survey by the Recreational Vehicle Rental Association, an affiliate of the R.V. Dealers Association. Last year, business was up an average of 26 percent compared with 2004.R.V.'s rent for an average of $150 a day during the summer including mileage, according to Cruise America RV Rentals, among the largest motor home rental firms. The company said reservations for the summer were already slightly ahead of last year. Mileage depends on the size of the motor home and the driving conditions. Drivers generally get 7 to 13 miles a gallon.'"
"'06-05-07,'0','IN Tokyo, where cafe floor space is at a premium, some bars are abolishing tables and chairs altogether and stacking customers vertically along a bar.They are known as tachinomiya, or standing bars, and they are sweeping Tokyo. Their popularity is fueled by low prices and the opportunities they offer many young, shy Japanese to mix and mingle with whoever is standing next to them.""It's easy to go in, easy to go out,"" said Sachiko Tabata, who was sipping and snacking with another young woman at a new bar in Shinbashi called Gohiikini, or Nice to Meet You (2-8-9 Shinbashi Minato-ku; 81-3-3502-3132; www.3cs.co.jp). Standing at one end of a polished wood bar, they were discussing their reactions to the movie ""Sayuri,"" known in the United States as ""Memoirs of a Geisha.""Generally found close to Tokyo's major commuter rail stations and open from 4 . to 11 p.m., tachinomiya are ideal for an end-of-the-day stop. A visitor can sip a glass of imported wine, nibble on tapas and rub shoulders at the bar. Many of the tachinomiya are literally holes in the wall. But some, like Gohiikini, have Web sites with maps that can be printed out for an evening of hashigo or bar hopping.Whoopee is across from Ebisu station (81-3-3444-5351), but without a map I circled the block until I figured out that the entrance was across a freshly hosed hall of shuttered fish shops.

"'06-05-07,'0','Health officials are not certain when Ms. Buschkamp and the other passenger were infected — only that they probably flew while contagious with mumps, a viral infection that can cause glandular swelling, deafness and spontaneous abortions. Nor did they initially know how many other passengers might have been infected, which is why the C.D.C issued its advisory April 14.What is known is that more than 1,000 Iowans have had the mumps since last December, the worst outbreak in two decades. Among them is Waterloo's mayor, Tim Hurley.The C.D.C. is investigating the role air travel might play in spreading diseases like mumps.""There is some risk of contracting some infectious diseases during air travel,"" said Francisco Averhoff, a medical officer with the centers' Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. On a plane, he said, mumps can be spread by several means: through the air, by contact with infectious droplets, by direct person-to-person contact or by exposure to contaminated surfaces.""But the air circulation pattern in today's modern aircraft cabins results in flow generally from the ceiling to the floor, and that is felt to mitigate some of the risk,"" he said.While the risks of infection are in many ways no greater than they are in an average office or public space, some air travelers are suspicious of the role of air circulation in disease transmission. Nicholas Coury, a photographer from New Philadelphia, Ohio, remembers a trans-Pacific flight several years ago on which he sat next to a man who was obviously ill.""It was like he was going to cough up a lung for the entire 12-hour flight,"" said Mr. Coury. ""I told my wife, 'This isn't going to be good' — and it wasn't. A few days later, I had contracted an Asian flu that required three different types of antibiotics.""Some airlines are moving quickly to address passenger worries about the current mumps outbreak. American Airlines, one of the carriers that flew a mumps-infected passenger, immediately contacted all the customers and flight crews who were on the affected flights after being notified by the C.D.C. An American spokesman, Tim Smith, said the airline took care to follow up with the passengers who were seated next to the contagious person, urging them to be tested immediately.American and the other airline affected by the mumps advisory, Northwest, are cooperating with the centers' investigation.Experts on infectious diseases say passengers can take steps to prevent an infection, but that the chances of getting sick are low. ""Statistically, the vast amount of infections are acquired from someone outside of an airplane,"" said Stanley Plotkin, an emeritus professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania who is an expert on infectious diseases.Mumps, for example, is spread through direct contact with respiratory secretions or saliva. Among the precautions that Dr. Plotkin and other physicians recommend are frequent hand washing, avoiding surfaces that may be contaminated (like door handles) and keeping your distance from a person who shows symptoms of an infection.The experts were divided on the question of whether to wear a face mask. Although such a preventative measure can be effective, many masks are useless because they don't properly fit.SO what are the odds of getting a disease like mumps on a plane? No one knows with complete certainty. Most commercial airlines recirculate about half of the air inside a passenger cabin. It is passed through special filters that remove bacteria, fungi and viral particles. Mumps is caused by a virus that could be filtered out. For that reason, the consensus is that the risk of infection remains low.""The risk of contracting an infection in the setting of shorter flights of several hours or less is probably minimal, unless you are sitting nearby a symptomatic person,"" said Dr. Ellen Gould Chadwick, a professor of pediatrics at the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University.But mumps is not the only communicable disease that can potentially be caught within an aircraft. Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection whose symptoms include a hacking cough, chills and fever, also has some travelers worried. Experts say that as with mumps, the risks of being infected on shorter flights within the United States are difficult to determine. But on longer trips — say, a flight from Asia, where TB is much more prevalent than in the United States — there is a greater chance of exposure.""TB is a concern on flights, because it is spread by an airborne route,"" said Dr. Michael D. Iseman, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, where he specializes in infectious diseases of the lungs. And on a plane, with many passengers sharing the same air, that increases the chances of an infection.Dr. Iseman added that airlines could significantly reduce the risks of making passengers sick by circulating more air through the cabin — something he says they are reluctant to do because it consumes more fuel.But like mumps, experts say the prospect of catching tuberculosis on a flight is unlikely. ""Compared to colds or influenza,"" said Richard Chaisson, director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Tuberculosis Research, ""TB is rarely transmitted on planes.""'"
"'06-05-07,'0','READING fiction while keeping an eye out for the news it holds is something of a vice. We all like the sensation that we're taking in something useful, or at least informative, but fiction's news is ultimately about interiors, not exteriors. Fiction is news of a soul! But having said that, I must admit that I couldn't help approaching these two new collections of stories — set in Panama and Israel — hoping to learn about faraway places.I learned many things about Panama in Cristina Henríquez's first book, ""Come Together, Fall Apart."" One is that Panama City is not a great place to sell household appliances. Two of her eight stories feature young women who have been employed at a store called Mattito's, and it's clear that finding a market for items like washers and dryers is an uphill battle in a city where, as one narrator puts it, ""people don't want to change or else they can't afford it."" Panama City is also a place where two new highways, meant to ease traffic congestion, charge tolls that make them far too expensive for the locals. ""I guess real life is often unsightly,"" the same narrator remarks, ""so they built a highway straight through the heart of the city to keep tourists away from what's real, away from the heart of us.""Henríquez's fiction provides intense close-ups of young Panamanians whose lives are in enormous flux. Although one story is told from the point of view of a man and the title novella is narrated by a teenage boy, the book's strongest characters are young women. The narrator of ""Drive"" tells us about her druggy boyfriend, her furious (about the boyfriend) mother and her ne'er-do-well father, who lives in Panama City but has abandoned his family. When the narrator sees him in the bar of a restaurant, he waves ""in a way that made me know he didn't want me to come over."" Sitting on the restaurant's patio eating chicken with her boyfriend, she ""watched my papi's back through the window and tried to will myself into thinking of him as just any old man with a skinny hunch and a chin pointy as a spade and graying hair.""Henríquez was born in Delaware and educated in the United States, but she spent summers in her father's native Panama. While her Panamanian characters are utterly convincing, her prose reads as if it grew up drinking water that had been fluoridated with traces of John Updike and Ann Beattie. Her sentences have a muted calm that suggests, paradoxically, something quite remote from inner peace: it's the state you will yourself into so you can hold on to the many disparate threads of a life. Henríquez writes without judgment — especially about the men in her stories, who, despite their frequently awful behavior, can seem unexpectedly amiable, at times even likable. Always she appears to be probing for rare moments of grace.One of these comes in the story called ""Ashes."" The narrator is slicing meat in the back room at the Casa de la Carne when word comes that her mother has dropped dead of a heart attack. Her father is ""sick, mentally gone,"" but even in his better days he was often absent — unfaithful and unloving. Thinking back, the narrator can remember only one gesture of affection between her parents, when she returned from an errand to find them sitting together on a couch, her mother's feet on her father's lap: ""He was tickling the soles of her feet with his fingertips and she was flinching, but laughing. Then he reached over and tucked her hair behind her ear. She followed the movement of his hand with her head, like a horse. That was all. But there was real tenderness in it.""The almost trancelike clarity of Henríquez's stories is quite different from the rollicking mood of the Israeli writer Etgar Keret's latest collection, ""The Nimrod Flipout,"" translated by Miriam Shlesinger and Sondra Silverston. It contains 30 stories, most of which straddle the line between a joke and a fable. The tone is what Rod Serling might have sounded like had he decided to make ""The Twilight Zone"" a comedy set in Israel, with each episode lasting just a few minutes. Sometimes, though, this affect gets amped up a little, and begins to shift toward Crazy Eddie.'"
"'06-05-07,'0','""The Essence of Rembrandt,"" ""Rembrandt and the Bible"" and ""The 'Jewish' Rembrandt."" With exhibitions like these, it must be an anniversary year for — you guessed it — Rembrandt. The Netherlands is celebrating the master's 400th birthday with a flurry of events (for more information, go to the Web at www.holland.com/rembrandt400). But the headliner appears to be ""Rembrandt-Caravaggio,"" an exhibition on view in Amsterdam at the Van Gogh Museum (Paulus Potterstraat 7; 31-20-570-52-00; www.rembrandt-caravaggio.nl), its only venue, through June 18.Organized with the Rijksmuseum, the show brings together nearly 40 paintings by Rembrandt and Caravaggio. ""It's a totally unprecedented comparison of these two masters, who never met,"" said the exhibition's co-curator, Taco Dibbits, pointing to correlations in their realism and treatment of light, eroticism and emotion. The show claims a number of important loans from other institutions — among them, Rembrandt's ""Bathsheba Bathing"" and ""The Sacrifice of Abraham"" and Caravaggio's ""Omnia Vincit Amor"" and ""The Conversion of the Magdalen."" However, the Rijksmuseum (Jan Luijkenstraat 1; 31-20-6747-047; www.rijksmuseum.nl) holds what is perhaps Rembrandt's most famous painting, ""The Night Watch."" And that work will be the subject of an unorthodox installation by the filmmaker Peter Greenaway, at the Rijksmuseum, from June 2 to Aug. 6.Mr. Greenaway will present his own interpretation of the 1642 work, which portrays a group of militiamen. In one room, the painting itself will be bathed in changing light and ""swathed in red theatrical curtains,"" Mr. Greenaway said. In other rooms, he will present period artifacts and interactive short films offering fictionalized accounts of the people pictured in the work. ""We're going to push the notion of the painting as an act of theater,"" he said.Judging by the response in New York, ""Drawing Restraint 9,"" the latest film-of-epic-proportions by the art star Matthew Barney, will not go unnoticed this spring and summer as it opens in cities nationwide. Those who still can't get enough — or are curious about all the fuss — can seek a fuller immersion at ""Matthew Barney: Drawing Restraint,"" a major survey of Mr. Barney's work, from June 23 to Sept. 17, at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (151 Third Street, 415-357-4000; on the Web at www.sfmoma.org).Mr. Barney's undertakings are dense in symbolism, visually rich and notoriously esoteric; ""Drawing Restraint 9"" can be described as a Japanese whaling romance starring Mr. Barney, Björk and tubs full of Vaseline. It will be included in the San Francisco exhibition alongside all of the work that Mr. Barney has so far created under the title ""Drawing Restraint,"" a series he began as an art student in the late 1980's.""This is a unique opportunity to gain a very good insight into Barney's work,"" said Benjamin Weil, who is curating the show's presentation in San Francisco. (It appeared earlier in Korea and Japan. San Francisco is the show's only American — and, as of now, its final — stop.)Mr. Barney is best known for his ""Cremaster"" films, which are not included in the exhibition. Nevertheless, ""Drawing Restraint"" features many definitive works that capture Mr. Barney's obsession with struggle and resistance, as expressed through ritual, athleticism and performance.Among about 150 objects on display will be videos of writhing satyrs and drawings, photographs and large-scale sculptures.The Victoria and Albert Museum in London ambitiously claims that its current blockbuster, ""Modernism: Designing a New World, 1914-1939,"" is the first in-depth exhibition about the modern movement. Considering the museum's stature as the grandfather of design museums — and in light of the show's rave reviews — one might be inclined to believe it.On view through July 23, at the Victoria and Albert (Cromwell Road, South Kensington, 44-20-7942-2000; www.vam.ac.uk), the exhibition comprises over 50 film clips and 300 objects spanning design, architecture, art and fashion. ""Britain has a long tradition of anti-modernism,"" said the show's curator, Christopher Wilk, who wants to encourage visitors to see modernism in terms of its social idealism, rather than the dismal housing projects and other blights that it sometimes produced.Among the show's highlights are a restored example of the world's first mass-produced built-in kitchen, a rare Tatra T87 streamlined car, paintings by Fernand Léger and Piet Mondrian and, of course, chairs galore. The exhibition will travel to the MARTa Herford museum in Germany and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. However, many key objects, including an X-ray machine from the late 1920's and a knitted wool swimsuit by the artist Sonia Delaunay, will stay in London.The Victoria and Albert has gone all-out with the exhibition's installation, which features, among other things, a soaring room with six towering frameworks that evoke skyscrapers under construction.Five paintings do not normally make for a blockbuster. But, since last month, a group of five early 20th-century masterpieces by Gustav Klimt has been causing a sensation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (5905 Wilshire Boulevard, 323-857-6000; www.lacma.org).Displayed together for the first time in the United States, through June 30, the works include an exceedingly rare example of Klimt's famous gold paintings — one of only three — and they are also notable for their provenance. Earlier this year, after a lengthy legal dispute, the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna returned them to Maria Altmann, a 90-year-old Los Angeles resident whose family in Austria had lost them when they fled the Nazi takeover there. ""These are five of the most remarkable examples of Viennese high modernism,"" said Stephanie Barron, the curator at the museum who arranged for their current display. The five paintings consist of three richly textured landscapes and two portraits of Adele Bloch-Bauer, Ms. Altmann's aunt — one of them the dazzling and sumptuously patterned gold painting, which dates from 1907. ""It's decorated many, many dorm rooms,"" Ms. Barron said, referring to its often-reproduced image. ""But to actually confront it in person,"" she continued, ""is really like seeing it for the first time.""'"

"'06-05-08,'1','""I repeat I will honor it, with the time plainly needed for my successor to establish himself"" before Britain's next national elections, which must be held by 2010, Mr. Blair said.He said he had no intention of ""going on and on"" as prime minister, and declined to repeat a previous insistence that he would serve a ""full third term"".He also repeated his endorsement of Mr. Brown as his favored successor. ""Of course he is,"" Mr. Blair said.""When have I ever said anything different? That is why I suggest that everyone calms down and lets us get on with the business of governing.""But Mr. Blair refused to set a limit on his own tenure.""To state a timetable now would simply paralyze the proper working of government, put at risk the necessary changes we are making for Britain and therefore damage the country,"" he said. ""It wouldn't end this distraction but take it to a new level.""His words reflected the style of his contest with Mr. Brown, which plays out as a kind of minuet, choreographed in coded gestures and messages while supporters of both men fight a more open public duel. A BBC television reporter said that gauging the contest recalled the Kremlinology of the cold war.The leader of the opposition Conservatives, David Cameron, taunted the prime minister today with the accusation that Labor was gripped by a ""civil war.""Mr. Blair warned his party opponents today that an open leadership war would almost certainly wreck Labor's chances of winning a fourth term in office.""If we want to win a fourth term, we should concentrate on governing,"" he said, laying out a long list of policies and decisions he wished to address before stepping down — pension reform, nuclear energy, transport, the national health service, schools, civil rights and government spending.Mr. Blair also addressed one of the most hotly-debated moves of last Friday's reshuffle when he demoted the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, Britain's main negotiator alongside the United States and the European Union, in the Iran nuclear crisis.The prime minister, a close ally of President Bush in the Iraq war, dismissed as ""rubbish"" news reports that he dismissed Mr. Straw because of his public opposition to invading Iran or ""because the Americans objected to him.""But Mr. Blair also used the discussion of Mr. Straw's fate to strengthen his own public opposition to a nuclear attack on Iran, apparently departing from his previous readiness to follow the Bush administration's line in leaving open options in the Iran nuclear crisis.He said it was ""utterly absurd"" to link the dismissal of Mr. Straw to ""invading Iran — which, incidentally, we are not going to do."" Moreover, he said, ""I don't know anybody who has even talked or contemplated the prospect of a nuclear strike on Iran. That would be absolutely absurd.""Mr. Blair spoke with a familiar, smiling ebullience, frequently reminding reporters that British voters had returned Labor to power with himself as prime minister barely a year ago and he had a heavy work load to get through.He said he would repeat the same message at a closed meeting this evening with Labor legislators, including some of those who have called for his early departure.The prime minister's offer of a ""stable and orderly transition"" did not seem to have met all his critics' demands. Alan Whitehead, a Labor legislator, said: ""We need a framework or protocol which enables everyone to have certainty.""Other legislators said it was crucial for Mr. Blair and Mr. Brown to resolve the issue. ""If this partnership ends in tears or we descend into civil war between the two rival camps, I think the consequences will be with us for many years,"" said John Grogan, another Labor lawmaker.Andrew Smith, a former pensions minister close to Mr. Brown, told BBC Radio that ""we do need the timetable for the transition of leadership sooner rather than later, because the present uncertainty, I fear, can only get worse, and that in itself is a recipe for drift and disunity.""'"
"'06-05-08,'1','Governor Acevedo-Vilá also blames political calculation from the opposition.""They think that if there is a crisis, the governor will get the blame,"" he said in a telephone interview Sunday evening. ""But that is not what is happening. People know that the House is the problem now.""In the end, the two sides were less than 10 yards apart on Calle Fortaleza, separated by wooden security barriers, a few dozen stone-faced riot police officers and the aquamarine awnings of a tourist boutique called Tropical Paradise. They sang. They chanted. They made rude gestures and tried to outshout one another. Both sides summoned the Almighty.""The problem on this island right now is that the last election, in 2004, was too close,"" said Carlos Lopez, mayor of the resort town of Dorado and a supporter of the governor. ""Just a few thousand votes. Power is split. And so now, nothing gets resolved.""The fiscal crisis that has brought turmoil to Puerto Rico for a week has its roots in that razor-close 2004 election. The government has been unable to pass a new budget for two years, meaning that Puerto Rico continues to operate under the old one, even though costs have risen and the size of the government and the population have continued to grow.The result was that last week, Governor Acevedo-Vilá said the federal government had run out of money, almost two months before the end of the fiscal year on June 30. He ordered a partial government shutdown, furloughing 95,000 civil servants — more than half of them teachers — and closing some 43 agencies, including the largest, the Department of Education, which tossed thousands of students out of school and ended daily school-lunch programs that many of the island's poor families depend upon to feed their children.The government shutdown has led to dozens of rallies and protest marches, including the ones on Sunday. The leaders of seven unions, including truck drivers and electrical workers, began the day promising to mount a general strike on Tuesday. But by day's end they altered their tune, saying they would aim at ""paralyzing the profits of the rich"" with a series of unspecified actions aimed at banks, big corporations and major shopping centers.""This is the first time Puerto Rico has had to operate under such a divided government, and they're not used to it,"" said Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, based in New York. ""This thing is really out of control. And it's getting nasty.""Meanwhile, the man at the reluctant center of the current fuss, Alfredo Salazar, head of the Government Development Bank, had caught an early morning flight to New York where he hoped on Monday to persuade Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's not to downgrade Puerto Rico to junk-bond status.Although the teachers' next paychecks are not due until May 15, when the crisis will really hit home, business owners say they are worried that skittish consumers will stop buying, and they warn of potential private-sector layoffs. And at the local level, many of Puerto Rico's towns, which depend on federal support, have had to curtail municipal services like garbage collection.The political parties here do not break down along class lines, or even along liberal-conservative ones. Instead, the central defining issue is Puerto Rico's future status. The opposition party wants it to become the 51st state in the union. Governor Acevedo-Vilá's party favors the status quo, keeping Puerto Rico a territory.And a much smaller third party — their color is green — wants absolute independence for the island.Governor Acevedo-Vilá says he needs $531.5 million to get the government to the end of the fiscal year. He wants Mr. Salazar to deliver a loan of that amount, but not until he and the legislature can agree on how to pay for it.The governor suggests a 7 percent sales tax, an idea that he borrowed from an old platform of the opposition party, which now renounces the idea. The opposition party chief, Pedro Rosello, himself a former governor, has suggested trying a lower sales tax.In the meantime, the Senate passed a 5.9 percent sales tax bill, which the governor said he would support if it was accompanied by measures like a higher tax on some corporations. The House has not taken action on the compromise.Jorge Silva, secretary for economic development and commerce, said estimates of economic losses from the crisis thus far ranged from $14 million to $20 million a day, though he said those numbers would inevitably rise if the crisis continued.And as the governor digs in his heels, opposition leaders claim the actual amount of money needed is around $350 million, much less than Mr. Acevedo-Vilá says he needs. They say they have already passed enough bills to get Puerto Rico through the short-term crisis, partly by borrowing from next year's tax funds.""I say to the governor, send the people to work again and we will continue discussing this,"" Mr. Santini said. ""All he must do is sign the bills that we have sent to him.""But Governor Acevedo-Vilá says he is determined to find a long-term solution.""I am insisting on a real solution to the current crisis, so we don't repeat the same crisis next year,"" he said.Many of the protesters, though, and others on the street are casting a skeptical eye on the behavior of both parties.""This is nothing but a big power struggle between the two parties and even among those within the parties,"" said William Ortiz, vice president of the Teachers Association, which represents 28,000 of those laid off. ""And it is the public employees and the schoolchildren who are paying the price.""'"
"'06-05-08,'1','David Brooks mounts a reasonable argument when he claims that Kevin Phillips, in ""American Theocracy,"" exaggerates or cherry-picks the facts to make his case against the current administration.Having read the book, however, I feel that there is a bigger picture to consider.

These factors, combined with our ever-increasing debt, imperil our country.This is not conspiracy theory — it's plainly obvious to anyone examining the situation. Does Mr. Brooks really contest these realities?'"
"'06-05-08,'1','In a rare study of vulnerability to poverty, Mr. Rank and his colleagues found that the risk of a plummet of at least a year below the official poverty line rose sharply in the 1990's, compared with the two previous decades. By all signs, he said, such insecurity has continued to worsen.For all age groups except those 70 and older, the odds of a temporary spell of poverty doubled in the 1990's, Mr. Rank reported in a 2004 paper titled, ""The Increase of Poverty Risk and Income Insecurity in the U.S. Since the 1970's,"" written with Daniel A. Sandoval and Thomas A. Hirschl, both of Cornell University.For example, during the 1980's, around 13 percent of Americans in their 40's spent at least one year below the poverty line; in the 1990's, 36 percent of people in their 40's did, according to the analysis.Comparable figures for this decade will not be available for several years, but other indicators — a climbing poverty rate and rising levels of family debt — suggest a deepening insecurity, poverty experts and economists say.More people work in jobs without health coverage, including temporary or contract jobs that may offer no benefits or even access to unemployment insurance. Medicaid is offered to fewer adults (though to more children). Cash welfare benefits are harder to secure, and their real value has eroded.About 37 million Americans lived below the federal poverty line in 2004, set at $19,157 a year for a family of four. But far more people, another 54 million, were in households earning between the poverty line and double the poverty line.""We don't track this group of people, and they are very vulnerable,"" said Katherine S. Newman, a sociologist at Princeton University who studies low-end workers.Those suffering a nose-dive say the statistics do not begin to convey their fears and anguish.Only a year ago, Machele Sauer thought she was entering the middle class. She and her husband, a licensed electrician, owned a large mobile home. He was starting his own business and Ms. Sauer, after bearing their fourth child, hoped to stop waitressing and be a stay-at-home mom.""We were the ideal family, the envy of others,"" she said recently as she collected free food and diapers at the Hope Family Support Center, a small charity in Garden Grove, Calif., in Orange County. ""And then, boom, everything flipped upside down.""Life fell apart last spring when her husband was arrested on theft charges, linked to a recent drug addiction she says she did not know about. Because of a prior record, he received a long prison sentence.Now Ms. Sauer, 34, draws on the charity for goods and its director, Gayle Knight, for advice and emotional support, part of a grueling scramble to provide for her four daughters, ages 16 months, 8, 9 and 15. Many days over recent weeks, she dropped them at the baby sitter after school, worked the night shift as a waitress, picked up the sleeping children after midnight then woke up with the baby at 6:30 a.m. before preparing the older three for school.At first she went on welfare, receiving $600 a month along with paid child care and counseling for herself and the children. As she resumed waitress work—four night shifts and two day shifts a week—she earned about $1,300 a month, which led her welfare payment to be cut to $300.She receives $200 worth of food stamps that cover bills for just the first two weeks of each month, she said.""Now the van is breaking down,"" she said. ""With four kids it's really hard to hold a full-time job, and I need to make sure they do well in school."" Her goal is to find a way to prepare for nursing school.The Abbotts, too, sought aid from food banks and other charities, collecting weekly boxes of food and toiletries.In Orange County, about 220,000 people received food from 400 local charities last year, according to the Second Harvest Food Bank, which distributes donations. Recipients include many families, often Hispanic, with several children and both parents working minimum-wage jobs. Over all, half the families seeking food had at least one working adult, according to a recent study by the food bank.In the center of Orange County, a world away from its polished coastal towns, borderline poverty is common but seldom visible. On small streets behind strip malls and fast food restaurants, families, sometimes two of them, cram into small, aging bungalows.What look like tourist motels along Beach Boulevard are mostly filled by working families or single people who stay for months or years, paying high weekly fees but unable to muster up-front money for an apartment rental.Mr. Abbott, now 58, eventually found a lower-paying sales job. With help from church members, the couple amassed the three months' rent of $2,700 required to rent a one-bedroom apartment in Anaheim.Describing their last several years, Mr. Abbott kept circling back to the emotional toll. Motels, like the one they lived in for eight months for $281 a week, are ""dives,"" he said, ""with lots of screaming and fighting and cops being called.""""It was really stressful,"" he said, ""and still you pay a lot of money.""In a new setback, Mr. Abbott has developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He recently had to stop working and go on state disability, which pays $1,436 a month and gives him health coverage.Ms. Abbott has no health insurance — if she gets sick, she says, she will go to a medical van that serves the homeless. But a generous dentist from church helped her get new teeth, and now she plans to hunt for work.'"
"'06-05-08,'1','The visit was a reward for Croatia, which Mr. Cheney said had made substantial progress in recent years. It has shed its nationalist image and helped to bring its last remaining Croatian war crimes suspect, Gen. Ante Gotovina, to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Croatia is now regarded as the favorite among the former Yugoslav states to be accepted into the European Union and NATO.But Croatia has resisted American pressure to sign an agreement that would shield American soldiers from prosecution at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which the Bush administration has not recognized. The United States has cut aid to many nations that have refused to sign immunity agreements, contending that it was acting to protect American soldiers from politically motivated prosecution. Croatia has lost $5.8 million in military aid as a result.But now Croatian officials say they are trying to resolve the issue through a status of forces agreement, to prevent American personnel on Croatian territory from being transferred to the court.On Saturday, Mr. Cheney and his wife, Lynne, toured the old city in Dubrovnik, though it rained and they were subjected to the heckling of a lone Canadian student.Mr. Cheney's visit encouraged local officials to conclude that the Bush administration would stay involved in helping to resolve the problems remaining in the region from the inter-ethnic and political turmoil of the 1990's.""The three of us agreed that alongside the E.U., the U.S. should also be present in solving those issues,"" Ivo Sanader, Croatia's prime minister, told reporters after the meeting on Sunday.This is an important year for the region to try to settle issues festering from the war in Bosnia, which ended a decade ago. Negotiations on the future of Kosovo, the province of Serbia now controlled by the United Nations, are under way, and could lead to it becoming independent.In two weeks Montenegro, which with Serbia makes up all that remains of the Yugoslav federation, will hold a referendum about whether it will sever its remaining ties with the government in Belgrade.Mr. Cheney did not publicly address these issues, but his team sought reassurance from the Adriatic Charter nations that they would help to maintain the timetable, officials who took part in the discussions said.SHANNON, Ireland, May 7 (Reuters) — Mr. Cheney took Russia to task again on Sunday.Heading home from visits to Lithuania, Kazakhstan and Croatia, Mr. Cheney said he had heard repeated concerns about Russia's ""internal developments,"" as well as its use of energy resources to ""obtain leverage"" over its neighbors.He insisted, however, that Russia had nothing to fear from NATO, which has expanded eastward since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.The vice president's plane touched down briefly at Shannon's airport on its way back to Washington.In response to concerns about the repercussions of his criticism, Mr. Cheney dismissed the notion that Russia would retaliate by hardening its position at the United Nations against an American-led effort for action against Iran over its nuclear ambitions.'"
"'06-05-08,'1','On Saturday and Sunday, Mr. Booker — who has outspent Mr. Rice by more than 25 to 1 — addressed crowds of several hundred supporters who treated him as if he had already won. He often sounded more like a mayor-elect than a candidate, ignoring the same attacks on his legitimacy as a Newarker that distracted him in 2002, instead concentrating on how he plans to enact the wide-ranging agenda he has laid out over the past few months.""Let's fight like the dickens over the next three days,"" he told a group of 500 supporters in the North Ward on Saturday. ""And let us remember that the real fight starts after Election Day.""The event, held at Nanina's, a restaurant in Branch Brook Park, was in itself a sign of change. One of the hosts was Essex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo, one of a handful of powerful leaders from the North Ward who helped ensure Mr. Booker's defeat four years ago by working for Mr. James.This year, Mr. DiVincenzo has become a cog in Mr. Booker's own quickly expanding political machine. In an interview at the event, where he embraced Mr. Booker in a bear hug, he promised to flood the streets with hundreds of campaign workers.""There's going to be an army out there,"" he said.The scene at Mr. Booker's campaign headquarters only underscored the role reversal.In 2002, the police were ticketing cars outside the campaign's offices for seemingly minor violations, like parking too far from the corner. Campaign workers, according to several advisers who worked for Mr. Booker's two mayoral efforts, braved fistfights with supporters of Mayor James who tried to keep them from canvassing the neighborhoods.""If this was four years ago,"" said Elnardo Webster Jr., the campaign treasurer, ""there would be a truck out front blaring Sharpe's music so loud we couldn't talk.""This weekend, by contrast, the mood at the campaign office on Martin Luther King Boulevard was calm and cheerful. Volunteers — including several off-duty police officers — were eating from plates of garlic chicken and french fries between leaflet distribution runs through the neighborhood.It was a different scene at Mr. Rice's campaign office a few blocks away on Broad Street. The doors were locked, the lights dimmed, and all that could be seen inside were a few boxes of Success brand rice, which the campaign has been distributing on the streets as an edible promotion.On the streets, Mr. Rice was enthusiastic, but he met with mixed success in trying to connect with residents.After spending 15 minutes alone with Farod Williams, 35, the owner of a clothing store on Bergen Street, Mr. Rice left without the promise of his vote. And at a kaffeeklatsch in the home of a long-time campaign volunteer for Mr. James, Mr. Rice's lengthy diatribe against the news media forced one potential supporter to raise her hand repeatedly before being given a chance to ask a follow-up question.On Sunday, Mr. Rice finally managed to corral the departing mayor, persuading him to speak at a breakfast fund-raiser for about 200 people at the Robert Treat Hotel downtown. It was the first formal campaign appearance Mr. James made on behalf of Mr. Rice since dropping out of the race in late March, and he seemed to have saved his energy for an attack on Mr. Booker.""This is a hostile takeover,"" Mr. James said in his signature raspy voice, invoking one of the lines of attack he used to such devastating effect against Mr. Booker in 2002. He added that electing Mr. Rice would be the ""one way we're going to tell the word we're not as dumb as they think.""But what should have been a dramatic, if belated, passing of the torch turned into another example of Mr. James's tendency to overshadow his former deputy.Mr. Rice filled his speech with repeated expressions of thanks for Mr. James, who from a reclining position at a nearby table, granted him a languid thumbs-up in response. While Mr. Rice tried to get on with his speech, the mayor got up and took over; he began handing out signs and steering supporters to the front of the room, where they served as a visual backdrop.And near the end of a 15-minute address in which Mr. Rice reprised his main campaign themes — his opponent's relative inexperience and gaudy fund-raising total of more than $6 million versus his own long record of local public service — organizers turned on background music, making it louder and louder until Mr. Rice was all but drowned out by the rising beat.""Let's not give up our house!"" Mr. Rice finally urged in a full-throated yell.The attacks from Mr. Rice have hardly shaken Mr. Booker, who at times seems to have forgotten that his old rival, Mr. James, is no longer his opponent.At campaign events, in interviews and when he huddled with voters all over the city, he rarely mentioned Mr. Rice by name, saving his vitriol for the mayor and his allies on the Council.In one speech that was typical, he criticized the administration for ""raping our city of its profits and its values"" by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a hockey arena downtown, and selling land below market rates to politically connected developers.He repeatedly accused Mr. James of conspiring to leave behind a ""financial crisis."" And in a live radio interview on Sunday, he pleaded with voters ""not to choose someone who is part of the same machine.""This weekend at least, some voters seemed to be listening. Lenwood Lewis, a retired bartender, and Catherine Bullock, an usher at Bethany Baptist, said that they had known and liked Mr. Rice since the 1970's. But in the end, they said they had no intention of voting for him.""He's a very nice guy,"" Ms. Lewis said of Mr. Rice, ""but we need someone young. We're ready for Cory.""'"
"'06-05-08,'1','But Paramount executives said that Mr. Cruise's public image did not hurt the film. ""I don't believe that is a factor in how the movie opened,"" said Rob Moore, Paramount's president for worldwide marketing, distribution and operations. He noted that the opening domestic figure was close to that of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" last summer, which starred Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, and said the ""Mission"" franchise was struggling against the fact that it had been six years since the previous installment.Others disagreed, noting that Mr. Cruise personally spearheaded the marketing campaign. He visited four countries in rapid succession ahead of the opening — going to Rome, Paris, London and Mexico City — and on Friday attended four different premieres in Manhattan alone, traveling by helicopter, fire truck, subway and boat in a promotional blitz across the city.""I can't fault the marketing campaign; I can't fault the trailers,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office, adding that the film, directed by J. J. Abrams, received strong reviews. ""The only X factor here is the Tom Cruise factor.""The derision of Mr. Cruise began last spring when he embarked on his relationship with Ms. Holmes just as both actors were preparing to release big-budget movies, ""War of the Worlds"" for Mr. Cruise and ""Batman Begins"" for Ms. Holmes. The news media and fans expressed skepticism at the public nature of the romance, which intensified even as the formerly private Mr. Cruise increasingly involved Scientology in his business affairs.Since then, Mr. Cruise has evolved into a kind of cultural punch line. In ""Scary Movie 4,"" which is still in theaters, one scene is a parody of Mr. Cruise's couch-jumping appearance on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" last May.Several reviews of ""Mission: Impossible 3"" pointed out that Mr. Cruise's public persona had become a distraction when watching him on the big screen. ""It's impossible to watch 'M:I-3' without asking: Do we still, you know, like Tom Cruise?"" the critic Owen Gleiberman wrote in Entertainment Weekly, while Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times: ""It would be a stretch to say that Tom Cruise needs a hit. What this guy needs is an intervention.""In addition to being the kickoff for the summer movie season, ""Mission: Impossible III"" was the first major release that had been given a green light by Paramount under Brad Grey, who took over as chairman in early 2005. Mr. Grey caused a stir last year when the studio threatened to pull the plug on the movie just ahead of production unless the budget was cut and Mr. Cruise — who is also a producer of the film — cut his fee.As a result of that stand, the budget was trimmed to $165 million from about $200 million, and Mr. Cruise agreed to take about 25 percent of the movie's gross revenue, several percentage points less than his original deal, according to a senior Paramount executive.Paramount executives said that exit polls this weekend showed the film's audience to be mainly over 25, adding that they hoped strong word-of-mouth would help drive a younger audience to the film as the summer continued. But market research ahead of the movie's release also showed that Mr. Cruise had lost ground among an important part of his fan base, female moviegoers.In Hollywood many were left this weekend pondering the future of star power and looking ahead to the next test case, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" starring Tom Hanks, on May 19. As Mr. Dergarabedian put it, ""It shows you the importance of the star and their public image.""'"

"'06-05-08,'1','The two companies also continue to fight over legal fees. Lawyers for Apple Corps had said that if they won they would seek undisclosed damages from Apple Computer.""We felt that during the course of the trial we clearly demonstrated just how extensively Apple Computer had broken the agreement,"" said Neil Aspinall, manager of Apple Corps.The decision today failed to resolve one important sidebar to the case: whether the Beatles' recordings, one of the few high-profile bodies of musical work that is unavailable via legitimate digital sites, like iTunes, will soon be made available. In the trial, a colorful spectacle in which the court was given demonstrations of the workings of iTunes on large computer screens, as well as playbacks of musical recordings like the disco classic ""Le Freak"" by Chic, Mr. Aspinall said the Beatles' entire collection was being digitally remastered. Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple Computer, said in an e-mailed statement that he hoped the Beatles' songs would be available soon.""We are glad to put this disagreement behind us,"" he said. ""We have always loved the Beatles, and hopefully we can now work together to get them on the iTunes Music Store.""More than 1 billion tracks have been downloaded from iTunes, far and away the market leader in digital music, which accounts for at least 6 percent of overall music industry revenue, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.But in 1991, when the two Apples resolved a previous round of litigation, the Internet and digital music had yet to develop into viable consumer propositions.The judge, who acknowledged in the trial that he owned an iPod, one of Apple Computer's portable music devices, wrote that his decision hinged in part on a proviso to the 1991 agreement, preventing Apple Computer from using the trademark ""on or in connection with physical media delivering pre-recorded content.""""It would require a serious distortion of fairly plain notions to say that files delivered by ITMS and stored somehow in digital form, and/or the hard disk which stores them, amount to 'physical media' which 'deliver' pre-recorded content,"" Justice Mann said, referring to the acronym for the iTunes Music Store. ""It is true that physical things are involved —servers, communication equipment, wires and hard disks, to name but some, but they do not, in any form of ordinary parlance, amount to ""physical media delivering pre-recorded content.""'"
"'06-05-08,'1','The numbers also include José Lima, battered for five runs in five innings as yesterday's starter, and Jeremi González, a 31-year-old journeyman right-hander with a 1-2 record at Class AAA Norfolk.For now the numbers do not include Aaron Heilman, considered a pillar of the bullpen, and the right-hander Mike Pelfrey, the 22-year-old, 6-foot-7 pet of the farm system. Pelfrey was recently promoted to Binghamton of the Class AA Eastern League after a 2-1 start with a 1.64 earned run average at St. Lucie in the Florida State League.""With Heilman,"" Minaya said, ""we don't want to create doubt in a strength. We want to be careful with Pelfrey. If he forces us, that's a different issue.""Minaya did not sound intent on pursuing a trade for an established starter if another starter is needed, but he didn't disregard the possibility.""Budget-wise and talent-wise,"" he said, referring to the Mets' $100 million payroll and the depth of minor league prospects, ""we can do that.""For the three-game series in Philadelphia that starts tomorrow night, the Mets have their best starters lined up — Pedro Martínez, Tom Glavine and Steve Trachsel. But when they get to Milwaukee on Friday for a three-game series, Manager Willie Randolph will need to assess the numbers before choosing his next two starters.It won't be difficult for someone to replace Zambrano, who was 1-2 with a 6.75 E.R.A. Knowing his elbow tendon was torn, he walked off the mound in the second inning of Saturday's 6-5 victory over the Braves.Zambrano arrived near the trade deadline in 2004 in what has been a haunting trade for the left-hander Scott Kazmir, a prized Mets prospect at the time. Ever since, the Mets have waited for Zambrano to be the pitcher who had been 35-27 with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays over four seasons. Instead, he struggled last season to a 7-12 record with a 4.17 E.R.A. and struggled again this season.Now the Mets are waiting to see who will replace him. Of the healthy candidates, Lima has the best and the least credentials. He has an 89-98 career record with the Tigers, the Astros, the Royals and the Dodgers, including a 13-5 season with the Dodgers in 2004. But with the Royals last season, he had a 5-16 record with a 6.99 E.R.A.Signed to a Mets minor league contract before spring training, Lima started the season at Norfolk, where he was 2-3 with a 5.06 E.R.A. before he was called up to replace Zambrano.In addition to allowing five runs and seven hits against the Braves yesterday, Lima hit a batter, had a wild pitch and was called for a balk — an unimpressive debut that had Randolph saying that he would ""have to see"" before naming Lima as his starter Friday night at Milwaukee.Lima blamed the balk for creating the Braves' two-run second inning. It was called by the second-base umpire, Sam Holbrook.""How could that umpire tell what I did or didn't do?"" Lima said, referring to Holbrook. ""He was behind my back.""The call nullified a double-play grounder that might have allowed Lima to escape the inning without allowing a run. And maybe, as he suggested, his concern about not balking again contributed to four walks and a pitch that Brian Jordan hit for a home run.""I only had six, seven balks my whole career,"" Lima said. ""But tomorrow, the sun comes up again; it's over. I've been successful in the National League my whole career. I'm not going to put my head down. I'm on a great ball club and I'm on a winning team. I just want to be part of this ball club.""But how much a part will depend on how well Lima pitches. Until further notice, he's just one of those numbers.'"

Prices for crude oil, which metals prices are said to track, for June delivery rose $1.03, or 1.5 percent, to $70.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.No single factor seems to be triggering the latest jump, but gold, traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation and rising energy prices, appears to be enjoying a run that is attracting other investors who are eager to get in on the action, analysts said.""The way these things work is solid returns tend to build on themselves, and they don't slow down until they breakdown,"" said Daniel C. Pierce, a portfolio manager at State Street Global Advisors.On the political front, the nuclear standoff between Iran and the West and the ongoing demands by Western officials that China allow its currency to appreciate against the dollar and euro are among a host of concerns being cited as explanations for, and perhaps justifications, for the recent run up. Unlike stocks and bonds, commodity prices thrive on financial and political uncertainty, because they are considered to have intrinsic value unlike companies and governments, which can go out of business or default on their debts.""The environment of geopolitical tensions, growing inflationary fears and uncertainty over currency issues between the U.S. and China remains extremely supportive for gold,"" analysts with Barclays Capital wrote in a research note.'"
"'06-05-09,'1','It was a good year to be a Beatles fan in 1965, the year of ""Help!"" and ""Rubber Soul."" It was also the year the group's publishing company, Northern Songs, went public. That early step in the commodification of the Beatles culminated in, among other things, the recent $200 million refinancing of Michael Jackson, the current co-owner of the Northern Songs catalog. Yesterday, another curious episode in the band's business history came to an apparent close in Britain, where a judge ruled against Apple Corps, the Beatles' management company, in its 2003 suit against Apple Computer.The suit's origin was in Apple Computer's creation of iTunes, which Apple Corps interpreted as a violation of a 1991 agreement that would, in its opinion, have prevented the other Apple from distributing music. (The agreement would also have prevented Apple Corps from making computers.) Apple Corps, which was founded in 1968 to gather the Beatles' business interests under one roof, seems to have been born for trouble. Its logo, designed by Gene Mahon, is as clean and crisp as it ever was, but to many observers the company appears to have done a better of spawning lawsuits over the years than of fostering the Beatles' interests.The judge's decision in this case comes even as the two Apples are working toward something most music lovers have been longing for: the release of the Beatles' catalog for downloading over the Internet. That may now have to wait for two things: an appeal of the judge's decision and the ongoing remastering of the Beatles' records.To us, remastering the songs is more important than making them downloadable. It's hard to imagine a canon of songs more central to the musical imagination of our lifetime, or one more badly served by recording technology since the introduction of compact discs. It would be wonderful to be able to download the Beatles. It would be even better to hear them as they were meant to be heard.'"

Generally, the fault has appeared to be a focus on special effects and cheap thrills at the expense of emotional engagement and character development.For many years, films based on comic books and traditional high-fantasy worlds suffered the same fate. Yet recently, directors and screenwriters ranging from Peter Jackson with ""The Lord of the Rings"" to Sam Raimi with ""Spider-Man"" have come to appreciate that in even the most fantastic setting, a successful film is based on compelling human stories rather than on yet another explosion or dragon.As in Tolkien's Middle Earth with its totemic One Ring, the primary storyline in the Warcraft universe revolves around the temptations of power, told through tragic tales of corruption. Throughout the Warcraft saga, characters like the orc Gul'dan, the mage Illidan and the knight Arthas are seduced by powers beyond their ken. Some find redemption. Most do not. The top bad guy in Warcraft, the demon Sargeras, began as a sort of angel (à la Lucifer), before twisting himself into the enemy of virtue.Formed last year with $500 million in financing from a consortium of Wall Street investors, Legendary signed a deal with Warner Brothers to co-produce and jointly finance at least 25 films over five years.

"'06-05-09,'1','LONDON, May 8 — Apple Computer won the right to keep its logo on its iTunes digital music store Monday when a British judge rejected the claims of Apple Corps, the guardian of the Beatles' musical interests, over the use of the apple logo.Justice Edward Mann of the High Court said that Apple Corps had failed to prove that the use of Apple Computer's logo for iTunes infringed on a 1991 agreement with Apple Corps, in which the companies agreed to stay out of each other's businesses.The logo for Apple Corps is a picture of a Granny Smith apple. The logo for Apple Computer's iTunes is a shape of an apple with a bite taken out of it.Apple Corps, which represents Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono and the estate of George Harrison, argued that by putting its logo on iTunes, Apple Computer was moving into proscribed areas. In particular, Apple Corps said that Apple Computer had taken on some characteristics of a record company by offering exclusive material and repackaged musical compilations on iTunes.Justice Mann said that Apple Computer's use of its logo was ""fair and reasonable"" in connection with its music service. Apple Corps said it would appeal the decision, which is the latest development in a long-running trademark dispute between the Apples.'"

But the committee had given him a significantly higher rating on the two previous occasions he was nominated for the post.In a statement by the committee's chairman, Stephen Tober, the bar association said that a majority of the 15-member committee found Mr. Kavanaugh ""qualified"" for the post, while only a minority found him to be ""well qualified.""That is the reverse of the committee's judgments in 2003 and in 2005 when Mr. Kavanaugh was also nominated. At no time in the three evaluations did any committee member vote ""not qualified,"" the third option.Mr. Tober attributed the change to new interviews the committee members conducted with judges and lawyers, some of whom suggested that Mr. Kavanaugh, 41, was too inexperienced for the job and described his courtroom performance as ""less than adequate.""The bar association report was made public on the eve of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for Tuesday on Mr. Kavanaugh's nomination, which Republicans hope to use to reignite the deeply contentious battle over judicial nominees before Congressional elections in November.

"'06-05-09,'1','The scene wasn't much different at the smaller stages. This was a well-informed crowd, thanks in part to myspace.com, which makes it easy (and free) to sample new music. So there were few surprises: these concertgoers already knew which bands they liked, and they moved among the stages like savvy consumers scouring familiar shops. It wasn't unusual to see a seemingly uninterested fan wandering away from the stage while mouthing every word. In lieu of hard statistics, here's a guess: at least half the bands had at least one song that at least half the concertgoers knew.Right now, some of the biggest bands in this world — and at this festival — are the most theatrical. Fall Out Boy has sold over 2 million copies of its most recent album, ""From Under the Cork Tree"" (Island Def Jam), which is full of witty, petulant odes; the band's set was triumphant proof that few emo bands write better or more infectious songs. Other Bamboozle bands currently near the top of the emo heap: the emerging favorites Panic! at the Disco (which played an impressive set overstuffed with arch, often ridiculous lyrics); the strutters in the Long Island band Taking Back Sunday (whose new album hit the charts at No. 2 last week); the long-running California goth-punk act AFI (which is to release a new album next month).A few bands were eyeing a more straightforward path to success. The Jonas Brothers, a young group that's getting used to being described as a (slightly) louder version of Hanson, played a low-key set on one of the smallest stages; it's getting a huge promotional push, which may well earn it the screaming preteen fans it clearly wants. At the same time, the hard-working pop-punk band Paramore was attracting a bigger crowd. The band is led by Hayley Williams, a tiny and energetic 17-year-old with a big voice. All she needs is a few more catchy songs; here's hoping she gets them soon.Some of the most exciting music at the Bamboozle came from bands that managed to smuggle melodies into chaotic, metal-influenced songs. The band From First to Last has already released one of the year's best emo albums, ""Heroine"" (Epitaph). One of the weekend's highlights was a spitting-mad version of ""The Latest Plague"" from that CD. The Michigan band Chiodos showed off their quick-cut tantrums (metal riffs suddenly giving way to keyboard interludes) on Saturday, then returned on Sunday — under a pseudonym — to do it again.And then there was Underoath, a Christian band from Florida with a good shot at becoming one of this year's emo success stories. While it played, an airplane circled above, advertising its new album, ""Define the Great Line"" (Tooth & Nail/Solid State), due out next month.

"'06-05-09,'1','Re ""Memorial's Cost at Ground Zero Nears $1 Billion"" (front page, May 5):The memorial to the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001, is spiraling out of control as surely as the other rebuilding efforts at ground zero have over the last four and a half years.The mere thought of the memorial costing roughly five times that of the World War II memorial, or that $300 million in desperately needed public funds is earmarked for the project, should be enough to force our leaders to take a fresh look.While it's true that thousands of hours have already gone into design and preparations, there is no sense in throwing good money after bad.Let's have a world-class, meaningful memorial so those of us who survived that horrible day can reflect; those who lost loved ones can seek comfort and solace; and the rest of the world can try to understand what happened. But in doing so, let's not turn it into a boondoggle.Peter Braus New York, May 5, 2006The writer is a member of Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan.If every American gave $1 to the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, wouldn't that $1 billion cost seem a little more manageable? Tell me where to send it, and I will. Remind us about the devastating impact of 9/11 on our country, and we all will.'"
"'06-05-09,'1','Like novelists or, for that matter, music critics, some composers first work out the overall draft of a composition and gradually refine it, edit it and fill in the details. Others begin with the first phrase and get it right before adding the next, and so on.From the fascinating final group of Schubert selections that the tenor Ian Bostridge and the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes performed in their rewarding recital on Saturday night at Zankel Hall, it would appear that Schubert often worked the phrase-by-phrase way. For someone who died at 31, struggling continually, Schubert left behind a stunningly large catalog of completed works. He also began dozens of pieces that he never finished.In this segment, which Mr. Bostridge and Mr. Andsnes simply called ""Fragments,"" they performed six incomplete works, alternating between three songs and three solo piano pieces. In each piece the music, which seems fully worked out, just stops cold. You can understand why Schubert sometimes just gave up on a song. Songs poured out of him, sometimes eight, nine or more in a single day. For any number of reasons he might have thought that a particular song setting was going nowhere.Yet ""Pflicht und Liebe"" (""Duty and Love"") begins beguilingly. So why did Schubert just break it off before the end of the first verse? The reasons ""Johanna Sebus,"" a setting of a powerful Goethe poem, was never finished are easier to imagine. Maybe Schubert felt that this tumultuous song, with its hectoring vocal line and daunting piano part, was ill conceived and out of control. Still, it was riveting to hear the fragment.The piano fragments were particularly moving. A gracious Allegretto in C minor, lovely music, breaks off in the middle section.'"
"'06-05-09,'1','But it's not clear that women concerned strictly about breast cancer will line up for this drug, either. A closer look at the recent study suggests that raloxifene's advantages may not be as great as the government announcement implied. Some cancer experts were less than enthusiastic, and patient advocates were downright skeptical.""The outcome of the study is not as clear cut as we might have hoped for,"" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ""It will take some time for experts to review the data to determine which of the two treatments is preferable.""Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the new study had been hyped adding, ""We have many concerns about it on many levels.""Another group, Breast Cancer Action, said, ""We are very concerned that treating risk as a medical condition will result in substituting one disease for another.""The study included nearly 20,000 women 35 and older who were past menopause and had an increased risk of developing breast cancer. To qualify, their risk had to be at least that of an average 60- to 64-year-old woman — a 1.66 percent chance of getting the disease within 5 years. On average, the participants actually had more than twice that risk, around 4 percent, meaning that 40 of 1,000 would be affected. (Women can quickly figure out their own risk at the Web site cancer.gov/bcrisktool).Half the participants took one drug, and half the other for about five years. Their rates of invasive breast cancer were the same, 163 cases for tamoxifen and 167 for raloxifene — about half as many as would have been expected without treatment.So raloxifene looked just as good as tamoxifen. Even better news, the cancer institute said, was that those taking raloxifene ""had 36 percent fewer uterine cancers and 29 percent fewer blood clots."" Based on those findings, it is easy to see why raloxifene was declared the winner.But numbers can be tricky. Expressed as percentages, the differences between the drugs for uterine cancer and blood clots sound large.""But the actual numbers are small,"" Dr. Lichtenfeld said.Among women taking tamoxifen in the study, 36 of 4,732 got uterine cancer, while for raloxifene the number was 23 of 4,712. (Women who had had hysterectomies were not counted.) As for blood clots, there were 141 in the 9,726 women on tamoxifen and 100 in the 9,745 on raloxifene""Women who took raloxifene did get uterine cancer, and they did have blood clots,"" Dr. Lichtenfeld said. ""Any suggestion that tamoxifen is the only drug saddled with getting these diseases is not accurate.""More important, the difference between the numbers of side effects was not statistically significant, meaning that it could have occurred by chance and that the drugs could be similar or even the same. That fact was not stated in the news release, and the researchers mentioned it only briefly during the news conference, calling the results ""borderline"" significant.Many researchers say that results don't count unless they pass the statistical tests. But Dr. Leslie Ford, an associate director for clinical research at the cancer institute, said that the differences could not be ignored because they came so near to being significant. Had the study gone on a little longer, they might have crossed the line, she said.Another issue is that the message from the cancer institute seemed to play down a shortcoming of raloxifene that cancer doctors consider important. The institute emphasized that raloxifene lowered the risk of ""invasive"" breast cancer, tumors that have penetrated surrounding tissue and that have the potential to spread and turn deadly.But raloxifene did not prevent two other serious breast conditions, whereas tamoxifen did reduce their risk by 50 percent. Those conditions, sometimes called noninvasive breast cancers, are L.C.I.S. and D.C.I.S., for lobular and ductal carcinomas in situ. Lobular growths increase the likelihood of invasive cancer, and ductal ones can become invasive. D.C.I.S. is often treated like breast cancer, with surgery and radiation.""D.C.I.S. is not inconsequential,"" said Dr. Lichtenfeld, adding that it leads some women to have both breasts removed. Since tamoxifen lowers the risks of both invasive and noninvasive tumors, he said, it ""has a broader spectrum of activity against breast cancer.""Dr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he also found it worrisome that raloxifene did not share tamoxifen's ability to prevent the noninvasive growths.When it came to L.C.I.S. and D.C.I.S., the difference between the two drugs was statistically significant, meaning it was likely to be real and not due to chance. Yet that distinction was not pointed out in the news release, and, Dr. Lichtenfeld noted, it was ""de-emphasized"" during the news conference.But Dr. Ford of the cancer institute said raloxifene's ability to prevent invasive cancers was more important.""Invasive cancer is what kills you,"" she said, adding that only about 10 percent of D.C.I.S. turn invasive, and that those that do can be treated. She called it ""twisted logic"" to dwell on tamoxifen's superior ability to prevent the noninvasive cancers because, she said, ""We're not preventing noninvasive cancers because nobody's taking tamoxifen anyway.""Given that there are shades of gray and room for debate about these findings, some critics questioned the way they were made public.The results were announced by the cancer institute in a news release and a telephone conference for news reporters. Contrary to usual practice, the complete data had not yet been revealed to scientists or published in a medical journal, though the institute said it intended to do so. Officials said they announced the findings before publishing them because they had implications for public health.Ms. Visco said, ""How is it ethical to do that, to make this much hype around something that is not a health emergency, and you can't check their data?""She said she also worried that the announcement might have left the impression that the drugs could prevent breast cancer entirely.""It's not prevention,"" Ms. Visco said. ""It's risk reduction, short term, for a subset of women we cannot identify.""The concern is that many women would have to take tamoxifen or raloxifene for a few to benefit. In 1,000 high-risk women like those in the study, for instance, without treatment 40 would be expected to develop invasive breast cancer over the next five years. If all 1,000 were treated, only 20 cases would occur.But since there is no way to predict who will actually get cancer, everyone has to be treated, meaning that 980 will be exposed to the drug's risks but will get no cancer benefit.""The hope is that at some point we'll be able to pinpoint who really is at high risk of breast cancer and then we'll know what to do,"" Ms. Visco said. ""But we're not anywhere near there.""In the meantime, Dr. Ford said, at least tamoxifen and raloxifene give women at risk the chance to do something. She compared the drugs to statins and blood pressure drugs, which people take even though they feel well, to lower their risks of heart attacks and strokes. But others argue that heart attacks are far more common than breast cancer, and the drugs to prevent them much safer.To Dr. Norton, the most important conclusion to be drawn from the study is that more research on breast cancer prevention is needed. He said the next step should be to test another class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, already in use to treat breast cancer, to see if they can do better at risk reduction than tamoxifen or raloxifene.""Until we have zero cancer,"" he said, ""I'm not going to make any claims about a great advance.""'"
"'06-05-09,'1','Children who live near busy roads are more likely to have symptoms of asthma than those who do not, a study of more than 5,000 children in Southern California has found.The study, which appears in Environmental Health Perspectives, found that children who lived within 250 feet of major roads had a 50 percent higher risk of having had asthma symptoms in the past year.The findings, researchers say, suggest that major sources of air pollution like highways should not be the only source of concern.""At this point, there is enough evidence that there may be a problem with local roads that we ought to think about where we do new construction,"" said the lead author, Dr. Rob McConnell of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.The researchers found that the asthma risk decreased to normal for children living about 600 feet or more away from a busy road.The findings were based on a study involving 5- to 7-year-old children in 13 communities. Their families were asked to complete surveys about the children's health. The researchers then charted the answers about asthma against the location of the families' homes.'"
"'06-05-09,'1','An Iraqi interpreter, Salwa Oumashi, also died in the attack. Their killings occurred before the major outbreak of insurgent violence that has made such episodes seem tragically routine. A group of Iraqis wearing police uniforms are believed to have been the triggermen in the killings, but no suspects have been publicly charged.None of the charges in the corruption case mentioned Ms. Holland or Mr. Zangas, and there was no indication that any of those arrested in that case were suspects in their deaths. But as investigators follow a tortuous trail of receipts, vouchers, invoices and purchase orders indicating that Ms. Holland and Mr. Zangas received more than $320,000 in cash for their government work in the last two weeks of their lives, they have found that each of the four people arrested in the corruption case had some role in handling the money or were involved in some way with Ms. Holland's projects.One of those, Robert J. Stein Jr., a former American occupation official in Hilla, pleaded guilty in February to five counts of bribery, conspiracy and other charges, and could serve up to 30 years in prison. Mr. Stein disbursed the cash to Ms. Holland and Mr. Zangas and was involved in accounting for it after their deaths.The name of another American arrested in the corruption case, Philip H. Bloom, a businessman who was working in Iraq, appeared in contracting documents involving changes in Ms. Holland's projects after her death. He pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy, bribery and money laundering last month. Two Army Reserve officers, Lt. Col. Debra Harrison and Lt. Col. Michael Wheeler, who oversaw projects in Hilla, have been arrested and charged with accepting bribes.A lawyer for Mr. Bloom, John N. Nassikas III, declined to comment. Lawyers for Mr. Stein, Colonel Harrison and Colonel Wheeler did not return telephone calls requesting comment.At the core of the corruption case, prosecutors say, was a scheme in which Mr. Stein and other officials had steered at least $8.6 million in reconstruction contracts to companies controlled by Mr. Bloom, in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes, jewelry and other favors. Mr. Stein also pleaded guilty to federal weapons charges for having used the money to buy submachine guns, grenade launchers and other weapons in the United States.Investigators tracing the flow of the cash to Ms. Holland and Mr. Zangas are looking at the possibility that Mr. Stein and others took advantage of the deaths to steal additional money, according to the officials familiar with the investigation.The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, which is investigating corruption in Hilla, provided copies of some of the documents tracing the cash, and described others, after a reporter for The New York Times asked about a paragraph in one of the office's published reports, about the mishandling of cash recovered ""from the office of a paying agent who was killed in the field.""That unidentified agent was Ms. Holland, and the documents indicate that Mr. Stein and Colonel Harrison were in charge of recovering the cash. One of those documents is a ""memorandum for record"" signed by Mr. Stein and Colonel Harrison saying that $71,099 was missing from Ms. Holland's office after her death. But that is only part of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that cannot be accounted for.Through press officers in both the United States and Iraq, the F.B.I. declined to comment on the case.No suspicion for the missing money has fallen on Ms. Holland or Mr. Zangas. And those who knew and worked with Ms. Holland, whose efforts on behalf of women had won her recognition, said it defied belief that she could have lost track of so much money. Adly Hassanein, an Egyptian-American official for the Coalition Provisional Authority who routinely worked with Ms. Holland in Hilla, said it was also unthinkable that she would have been carrying that amount of money with her.""She would never do that, because there was no need,"" said Mr. Hassanein, who recalled that Mr. Stein had directed the recovery of money from Ms. Holland's room and office after she died.As for Mr. Stein's memorandum asserting that money was gone, Mr. Hassanein said: ""He's trying to say, 'I'm a victim.' ""Four people close to Ms. Holland said they have been questioned by investigators from either the F.B.I. or the special inspector general's office.They include Stephen Rodolf, a lawyer in Tulsa who is a friend of the Holland family; R. Richard Love III, a lawyer for the family; Rachel Roe, who knew Ms. Holland in Iraq and worked in a related capacity there; and Ms. Holland's sister Viola Holland.Ms. Roe said that an investigator asked her whether Ms. Holland would have been carrying tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars around in her car when she was killed — possibly explaining a big shortfall. Ms. Roe said that she told the investigator: ""No way — Fern was not a dummy.""But according to the paperwork, she was granted a sizable amount of money in the weeks leading up to her death. On Feb. 7, Mr. Stein approved a request by Ms. Holland for $200,000 for a training program in Jordan on democracy, governance and human rights for 120 Iraqis. A set of papers indicate that by Feb. 25, Ms. Holland had received the money — $199,044 was the precise amount — although her signature never appears on the documents, raising further suspicions among investigators.Mr. Stein controlled the disbursement of nearly all government cash in Hilla. So much was available, often in shrink-wrapped stacks of $100 bills known as ""bricks,"" that it was stashed all over the compound, the inspector general said in earlier reports. Millions were held in filing cabinets, a footlocker, even a safe in a bathroom, investigators found.But the main lode was in a narrow, heavily built safe in the basement of the Babylon Hotel, which served as the American occupation government's headquarters in Hilla. Mr. Stein, who personally paid out the cash for contracts, indicated in the paperwork that he was giving the money to Ms. Holland on Feb. 25 for the democracy and human rights training program.Meanwhile, between March 3 and March 7, records indicate, Mr. Stein paid Mr. Zangas more than $120,000 for television equipment and training for the Iraqi news media programs that he was running. All of that money appears to have vanished without a trace, since none of the paperwork recovered by the inspector general's office indicates that it had been spent for those programs before the slayings in the late afternoon of March 9.Another piece of paper that has caught the investigators' attention is the ""memorandum for record"" signed by Mr. Stein and Colonel Harrison. Written on June 23, 2004, as both were leaving Iraq at the end of their tours of duty with the provisional authority, the memo has as its subject line ""Recovered Funds From Fern Holland (deceased).""The memo says that Colonel Harrison and another woman entered Ms. Holland's office on the day after her death (which the colonel incorrectly recalls as March 11). ""In her office we recovered a box filled with what appeared to be a large sum of money consisting mostly of $100 bills and some smaller bills,"" the memo says.The memo said that the box was found to contain $125,035. But it says, ""According to Robert Stein, Fern Holland signed for and withdrew $196,044,"" referring to the payment that Ms. Holland had not, in fact, signed for. The memo's inference is that missing money is indicated by the difference between what was found and what Mr. Stein said he had paid out. ""These funds ($71,099) cannot be accounted for,"" the memo concludes.Even that was not the end of the story, the inspector general found. Mr. Stein failed to properly account for the money in his records, according to the inspector general's report, leaving it unclear exactly where the $125,035 ended up.'"

He said that Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Russia and China have agreed that the Iranians should not have a weapon or the capacity to make one.""There is a universal agreement toward that goal and the letter didn't address that question,"" he said.""Diplomacy takes a while when you are dealing with different nations like those that sat around the table with Condi Rice the other night.""Mr. Bush was referring to a meeting between Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the other envoys of the United Nations Security Council countries, as well as Germany, this week in New York to forge a common position on Iran. The meeting came in response to a report last month by the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that declared that Iran had failed to meet a deadline to halt the program.Ms. Rice said today that there were ""tactical differences"" over what to do about Iran's nuclear activities and that negotiators would take several weeks to design an offer that would allow the Iranians to have a civil nuclear program.""We agreed that we will continue to seek a Security Council resolution, but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the Europeans design an offer to the Iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program — if that is indeed what they want,"" Ms. Rice said in an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" after the talks.She told NBC's ""Today"" show that the ministers were in total agreement that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the technology that could lead to them.""We have some tactical differences about how to express that in the Security Council, but we have agreement that we need to express it in the Security Council and I can tell you that, that we believe that to give a couple of weeks for this agreement to come together is a good thing,"" she said.""But there will be action in the Security Council,"" Ms. Rice emphasized.Ms. Rice said France, Britain and Germany — the three European countries that have been in the lead in the negotiations with Iran — want to put together a package that shows two courses of action.""Iran can either defy the international community and face isolation and U.N. Security Council action; or Iran can accept a path to a civil nuclear program that is acceptable to the international community,"" she said.""That means that enrichment and reprocessing on their territory can't be permitted,"" she said on NBC.Iran announced last month that it had successfully enriched uranium at a low level for use in power plants and that it would continue to develop nuclear activities.Today, Mr. Ahmadinejad reiterated that Iran would reject any Security Council and decision that restricts the country's nuclear activities, which he says his country, like others, has the right to pursue. ""The Iranian nation has decided,"" he said at a news briefing in Indonesia that was carried by the Iranian news agency IRNA. ""It will defend and never renounce its rights,"" he said.The Iranian president also cast the tensions over Iran's nuclear program as an unfair struggle against technological advancement in Muslim countries.""Iranians are strong enough to defend their rights, but it should also be stressed here that resistance of the Iranian nation will not only be for Iran but for all independent-minded states including Indonesia, Malaysia, Turkey, Egypt and other Muslim countries,"" Mr. Ahmadinejad said.American officials say the evening discussions in New York failed to break an impasse over their drive with the British and French for a United Nations Security Council resolution that would make it mandatory for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities, stop construction of a heavy-water nuclear reactor and resume talks with the West.Russia and China oppose such a resolution as too threatening and say it could provoke Iran to abandon all cooperation with international nuclear inspections.""We're going to continue to pursue the tactical agreement with the Russians and the Chinese on how we go forward,"" Ms. Rice said.'"
"'06-05-10,'1','WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J., May 9 (AP) — Merck, the big drug manufacturer based here, is spending nearly $500 million to buy two smaller research companies, the company announced Tuesday.The acquisitions of GlycoFi, based in Lebanon, N.H., and Abmaxis, based in Santa Clara, Calif., are both expected to close by the end of June.The purchase announcements came two weeks after the company's chief executive, Richard T.

"'06-05-10,'1','Kathyrn LeMieux, a former cartoonist for the paper, said it was perhaps predictable that two intense, brainy editors would dust it up in West Marin.""Life on the fault line is fraught with drama,"" Ms. LeMieux said.Along with oysters, pristine coastal scenery and mildly pungent organic cheeses, idiosyncrasy is part of the culture here.It has been this way since the early 1970's, when an oil spill cleanup first drew environmentally minded hippies, artists and opinionated Berkeley eggheads, who turned this area a short drive northwest of San Francisco into a spirited bastion of the rural left. It is a place where local news can just as easily run to skinny-dippers' rights as agricultural land conservation.Under Mr. Mitchell, The Light acquired an outsized reputation, with hard reporting on the pepper-spraying of two local teenagers by a ranger at Point Reyes National Seashore, for instance, as well as popular features like a comic strip by Ms. LeMieux, whose cast of characters included an organic dairy cow with a secret junk food habit.But last November, burned out and weary of the financial pressures to keep the paper afloat, Mr. Mitchell sold it for $500,000 to Mr. Plotkin, a newcomer to West Marin who turned to newspapers as a second career. After journalism school and several self-financed reporting trips abroad, Mr. Plotkin interned briefly at The Miami Herald, where he quickly became frustrated.""I wanted the control,"" Mr. Plotkin said. ""So I had to have my own paper.""Mr. Plotkin, who still carries a litigator's briefcase, swept into town with big city literary ambitions and an appreciation for the symbolic.In The Light's entrance, he replaced a historic photograph of the former creamery now housing the paper with images of Che Guevara and Joan of Arc, representations, he said in a recent interview in his office, of ""a messianic quest for quality journalism."" Mr. Plotkin also hired a money manager from New York in a perhaps never-before-seen-here pin-striped suit.The terms of the sale transformed the relationship between Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Mitchell into a tenuous one of employer and employee, in which Mr. Mitchell was to continue to write his column, ""Sparsely, Sage & Timely,"" while Mr. Plotkin started an overhaul of the paper that Mr. Mitchell had made a personal mission for 30 years.Though its origins run deeper than any single event, Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Mitchell agree, their disagreements spilled into public view after a conversation in Mr. Mitchell's car on Feb. 16 about a quintessential local controversy: a proposed land swap involving the park service and a ranch that would bring development close to the heart of town.Mr. Mitchell says he cautioned his successor that if he did not consider the ranchers' views, they would want to wring his neck.""I then parodied a rancher getting ready to strangle him,"" Mr. Mitchell explained. ""This was in the context of satirically telling a story.""Mr. Mitchell added: ""Plotkin said I choked him without squeezing. Now, I think that's an oxymoron.""Mr. Plotkin, however, alleges in legal documents that Mr. Mitchell grabbed him by the throat and also tried to assault him with the car.In the documents, Mr. Plotkin said that Mr. Mitchell grew ""visibly, shakingly angry."" Then, he wrote, ""he started shaking his hands in the air and got a crazed look in his eyes — and grabbed my throat and began to shake his clenched hands.""In a sheriff's report, witnesses said the two men had a heated argument in the car and that after Mr. Plotkin got out, Mr. Mitchell rapidly accelerated his red Acura (license plate: LIGHT).The recent sale was the second time that Mr. Mitchell relinquished The Light, which he initially bought in 1975 with his second wife, Cathy. They shared a Pulitzer in 1979 for an exposé of Synanon, a drug rehabilitation center, and sold the paper three years later.A walking repository of local history, as well as the paper's, Mr. Mitchell resumed ownership in 1984 after an interim owner defaulted on payments. But in a column last May, he wrote openly about burnout, the paper's struggling finances and his irritability brought on by depression, which prompted him to work from home.Recent events have ""taken a lot of mental fortitude,"" Mr. Mitchell said, sitting in his redwood-planked cabin with a wood stove he built with a friend in the 1970's.The drama has the community, already divided over the new direction of the newspaper, reeling. In a sense, the friction reflects profound shifts in the culture of West Marin, a place where the smell of manure from dairy farms now hangs over lace-curtained bed-and-breakfasts.Lately, the area has experienced real estate pressures, with the median price of a single-family home in Marin County now up to $927,000. Despite their 1960's contrarian roots, older residents are not embracing the new ones.""They've become quite comfortable, so they view even the smallest change as significant and unacceptable,"" said Steve Kinsey, the county supervisor representing the district.Among the new arrivals is Mr. Plotkin, who comes across a bit like Jerry Seinfeld with a Granta subscription and a trust fund. He lives with his family in Bolinas, a reclusive town of ""genius hermits trying to escape the dominant paradigm,"" Mr. Plotkin said. ""I feel a great kinship with the people,"" he added.But his damn-the-torpedoes style has rubbed many longtime residents the wrong way.""He thinks it's fun to buy a paper and be on stage,"" said Dave Evans, a fourth-generation rancher and owner of Marin Sun Farms, known for its grass-fed beef. ""But is he serving the community?""Steve Costa, a co-owner of Point Reyes Books, however, said sales of the paper — which has a circulation just under 4,000 — were up 20 percent since Mr. Plotkin took over.""He has an urban set of values,"" Mr. Costa said. ""He wants to create this world newspaper.""For better or worse, the brouhaha remains a major distraction, but Jeanette Pontacq, a writer who recently founded an Internet forum for residents, said the tale was a fitting one for West Marin.""It's the island attached to this side of California,"" Ms. Pontacq said. ""Boring people don't come here.""'"
"'06-05-10,'1','They stood before a banner reading ""Our Commencement Is Not Your Platform"" and carried signs saying, ""Pre-emptive War Is Not a New School Value."" And in speeches, they variously had venom for Mr. McCain and Mr. Kerrey.""Senator John McCain does not believe in a woman's right to control her own fertility,"" shouted Ann Snitow, a professor of literature and gender studies. ""He has been opposed to Roe v. Wade for more than 20 years. He is a man who believes in female sexual slavery."" Ms. Snitow added: ""What would he have to do to not be invited? Would he have to say we should drop a nuclear bomb on Iran tomorrow?""Brittany Charlton, the vice chairwoman of the University Student Senate, said Mr. Kerrey's choice of speaker had left many graduates with unpalatable choices of boycotting commencement or attending and protesting.""It is extremely distasteful and hypocritical to allow McCain, someone who does not value the ideals we have consistently been taught in our education, to speak at the ceremony that represents the culmination of our experience with this university,"" she said.Mark Salter, Mr. McCain's chief of staff, said of the protests, ""I am sure it represents a small minority of students."" He added, ""The senator is looking forward to sharing this occasion,""Progressivism has long been at the heart of the New School's identity. It was founded in 1919 by a group of intellectuals, including John Dewey, the progressive historians Charles Beard and James Harvey Robinson and the economist Thorstein Veblen.It now has some 9,300 students in eight schools.Mr. Kerrey, who has been president since 2001, has had his share of difficulties in that role, facing protests when he admitted that he led a combat mission in Vietnam in which unarmed women and children were killed. He also debated his own students over invading Iraq.He sounded thoroughly unruffled about this latest flap, suggesting that the student and faculty protesters did not get it — not the business of running a university, which he said requires inviting the best graduation speaker possible, and not the business of presidential politics. Mr. Kerrey, a former Nebraska governor, unsuccessfully sought the 1992 Democratic nomination and flirted briefly with running in 2000.He said that he extended the invitation to Mr. McCain in January and that there had been nary a complaint until Mr. McCain came under criticism about his intentions to be the graduation speaker at Liberty University, headed by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.Mr. McCain denounced Mr. Falwell and the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson as ""agents of intolerance"" in 2000, when he ran against George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination. This year, when asked about his appearance at Liberty, he compared it to his planned appearance at the New School.""It didn't become a controversy until he agreed to go to Liberty,"" Mr. Kerrey said, adding, ""I am perfectly comfortable having him come. I am comfortable with the students protesting. I am not going to withdraw the invitation.""Mr. Kerrey disputed assertions by protesters that Mr. McCain only chose to speak at the New School graduation, which will be held on May 19 at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, to offset his appearance at Liberty, in Virginia. ""It's the other way around,"" he said.He also said there was no political gain for Mr. McCain in coming to the New School.""That's where I think the students are missing it,"" he said. ""The fact is, to win a Republican primary, coming here is a negative, not an asset."" Mr. McCain has also generated some protest at Columbia University, where he will give the keynote address on Class Day, next Tuesday. School officials invited Mr. McCain, whose daughter is a junior at Columbia, to speak after former President Bill Clinton and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois declined invitations from the senior class.The demonstrators at the New School stressed that they were not seeking to silence Mr. McCain. Rather, they said, they objected to him speaking at commencement.""I would love him to come and give a talk where he could be questioned,"" said Alan McGowan, a science professor. ""But graduation is the wrong place.""Carolyn Thompson, a graduating urban studies major, said she had no intention of attending graduation until she heard that Mr. McCain was the speaker. Now, she is going — to protest.Ms. Thompson, 22, said she believed Mr. Kerrey and Mr. McCain were serving each other's interests by making both the school and the future candidate seem more moderate.""I understand that they are two Vietnam vets, and they are buddy-buddy with each other, they are politicians, but at the same time, the implications for this university and for the presidential election in 2008 are frightening for me as a young woman.""Mr. Kerrey said graduating seniors might learn something from Mr. McCain about character.He recalled the bitter opposition that he and Mr. McCain faced from fellow veterans during their work to normalize American relations with Vietnam. ""My guess is Senator McCain is going to talk a lot about character and part of character is willing to stand before protest,"" Mr. Kerrey said. ""I have been with John when both of us were spat upon for advocating normalizing relations with Vietnam, called him a traitor. I hope they don't disrupt the commencement of other classmates and family members who will be there.""'"

"'06-05-10,'1','""One area where Microsoft and Google are really competing head-to-head now is in the war for talent,"" said Richard S. Tedlow, a historian and professor at the Harvard Business School. ""Historically, the company that won the war for talent, won the war.""Mr. Tedlow points to Montgomery Ward as a company that lost talented managers to its rival Sears, and then lost its way. The crucial defection, Mr. Tedlow said, was Robert E. Wood, a former Army general who joined Montgomery Ward in 1919 as a general merchandise manager.Even in the Army, Mr. Wood was a close reader of the Statistical Abstract of the United States, the Census Bureau's annual tracking of social and economic conditions. Mr. Wood became convinced that America was at the beginning of a huge population shift from rural regions to urban areas.That meant, he understood, that the mail-order giants like Montgomery Ward and Sears needed to move from being catalog retailers serving a dispersed market to department store merchants with stores in city and suburban population centers.Sears, as a company, grasped that fundamental change in the marketplace in a way that initially Montgomery Ward did not, Mr. Tedlow said.In 1924, Mr. Wood left Montgomery Ward to join Sears, and he later recruited others. In 1945, Mr. Wood, then the chairman of Sears, made another smart call on economic trends. The postwar years, he decided, would bring a long expansion, as pent-up consumer demand from the war years was unleashed.So Sears embarked on a national store-building binge. His counterpart at Montgomery Ward, Sewell Avery, made the opposite bet, keeping money in the bank to prepare the company for a postwar depression, which he was convinced was around the corner.Over the next several years, sales at Sears doubled, while Montgomery Ward's shrank 10 percent. ""Losing Robert Wood was catastrophic to Ward,"" Mr. Tedlow observed.In its recruiting face-offs against Google, Microsoft insists that it fares quite well over all. But there have been some high-profile defections of leading engineers, who said they preferred Google's technological direction and corporate culture.The most prominent was Kai-Fu Lee, a stellar computer scientist and manager. Mr. Lee not only established Microsoft's research labs in China, but he is also an expert in areas like natural language and speech-recognition technologies — important ingredients to Internet search today and to the way people will interact with computers in the future.Last year, when Mr. Lee left Microsoft, it sued Google and Mr. Lee. Microsoft claimed, under a Washington state law, that Mr. Lee violated a noncompete clause in his employment contract and misused inside information in going to work for Google. The suit was settled last December.""What does it say about a company when it sues when someone leaves?"" Mr. Tedlow asked. ""It makes Microsoft sound like a prison.""In business, forever tends to last about five years, a decade or two at most. So Sears prospered for a time and celebrated its success by building the Sears Tower in Chicago in the 1970's. Yet even from a height of 110 stories, Sears failed to see Wal-Mart coming. Wal-Mart brought the next revolution in retailing with its shrewd use of computer technology to track buying trends and orchestrate suppliers to become a hyper-efficient, low-cost merchant.The auto industry presents a sobering history of past-success syndrome. The Model T, introduced by Henry Ford in 1908, famously made the automobile affordable, helped along by his pioneering assembly-line production, which started in 1913. Ford's laserlike focus on efficiency drove the cost of a Model T from $850 when it was introduced down to $275 by the early 1920's.But cost and efficiency was all he focused on. The design was not updated, the color selection remained black and only black. Eventually, the single-mindedness caught up with the company. In 1925, the Ford share of the American market had fallen to 45 percent, from 57 percent two years earlier. By then, Alfred P. Sloan Jr., the managerial maestro of Detroit, was president of General Motors and its sales were surging.""Henry Ford was so in love with his brilliant idea that he refused to change,"" said John Steele Gordon, a historian and author of ""The Business of America"" (Walker, 2001).General Motors was well on its way to becoming the world's largest carmaker. Yet as early as the 1950's, the Japanese challenge to Detroit's auto supremacy was quietly getting under way. The architect of the Japanese ascent was a production engineer, Taiichi Ohno, who worked at Toyota. In 1950, Toyota manufactured 13,000 cars, barely a day's production for G.M.Mr. Ohno had to devise an efficient way to manufacture a variety of cars in small production runs. He turned that adversity into an advantage, using rapid tooling changes, constant quality improvements and just-in-time parts delivery to steadily improve the cars.Once again, the corporate giant was complacent, and late to see a fundamental shift in its industry.""G.M. did not take Toyota and the Japanese seriously until the 1980's,"" said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of ""The Japanese Automobile Industry"" (Harvard University Press, 1986). ""By then it was really too late.""History, then, suggests that past success is often an anchor holding a company back, and that Microsoft is at risk from the Google challenge. ""The wind is really behind Google, and Microsoft's main tool for navigating the future is the rear view mirror,"" said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a forecasting consultancy in Silicon Valley.Microsoft bristles at being cast as a laggard. In a meeting last week with online advertisers and reporters, Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, portrayed his company as a force for healthy competition in Internet search. ""We will keep them honest,"" Mr. Gates said of Google. And he vowed to catch up. ""I think this is a rare case where we are being underestimated,"" he said. Microsoft certainly has plenty of money to finance any competitive foray, with $35 billion in cash, while Google has about $8 billion.Indeed, the incumbent-challenger narrative — which portrays the incumbent as an endangered species — may not apply this time. Microsoft has adapted nimbly to big challenges before.Apple introduced point-and-click graphical computing with the Macintosh in 1984, but Microsoft caught up and became dominant on the desktop with Windows.In the mid-1990's, Netscape Communications posed a threat because the Internet browser might undermine the importance of Windows. Microsoft came up with its own browser and rebuffed that challenge, partly with tactics that violated antitrust laws, a federal appeals court ruled.""Microsoft has responded every time in the past,"" said Mr. Cusumano, who is also the author of two books on Microsoft.Now comes Google. It is offering or developing as free Web-based services e-mail, word processing and other programs that could replace Microsoft desktop programs and eat into Microsoft's lucrative software business. But that is by no means certain.Google is cagey about its strategy. When Netscape was flying high, some of its executives talked of making Microsoft irrelevant — a strategic blunder, according to Silicon Valley lore.Google's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, is a veteran of past battles with Microsoft, and he has no intention of making the same misstep. He speaks mainly of Google's limitless potential and ambitions, embellished by intriguing remarks like the one recently that Google is ""building the systems and infrastructure of a global $100 billion company,"" many times its current yearly revenue. Some clues about Google's plans could emerge today, when its executives hold an annual media day at its Silicon Valley headquarters. Google now makes virtually all its money by selling advertisements linked to its enormously popular Internet search service. Microsoft and Yahoo are desperately trying to close the gap with Google, the Internet search and ad sales titan.If Google stumbles, it will be seen as the company unable to move beyond a single stellar success.Since the future is so often the pattern of the past with some twist, what is the expert view? ""I'm a historian,"" said Mr. Tedlow of Harvard. ""Ask me in 10 years and I'll tell you why what happened was inevitable.""'"

"'06-05-10,'1','Commenting on the outcome of the vote, Kristen Silverberg, assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs, said, ""On the whole, we think it is an improvement over the commission.""She added, ""There were some members elected who, in our view, don't share a genuine commitment to human rights, the kind of high standard we would have hoped would have been met on the selection.""Mr. Roth said the council had proved its ability to attract more suitable members even before the vote because countries with poor rights records that had been part of the commission were scared away from running this year by new demands to demonstrate a commitment to rights standards.As examples he cited Sudan, Zimbabwe, Libya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria, Vietnam, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Eritrea and Ethiopia. ""The pool of candidates for the council was significantly improved over the typical pool for the commission,"" he said.Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based UN Watch, said, however, that he was not convinced that the vote signaled much change. ""The council offers a membership with certain improvements, but the election of Cuba, Saudi Arabia, China and other egregious violators suggests that, come June 19, when the council opens, we're likely to see business as usual in Geneva.""The all-day vote was conducted under more stringent rules than in the past. The principal innovation was that countries needed a minimum of 96 votes — an absolute majority of the 191 members — and that the election was for individual candidates rather than for closed regional slates.The 63 nations that declared themselves candidates have been promoting themselves vigorously in recent weeks during meetings with other states and in documents on the United Nations Web site that outline their past records and future commitments to human rights.When the delegates arrived in the General Assembly chamber, their desks were covered with stacks of campaign fliers marked with the colors of the nations' flags and the statement, ""Your support will be highly appreciated.""All 63 candidates voluntarily agreed to a series of pledges that will form the basis for public reviews of their human rights records. Under the rules of the new council, all members of the United Nations must submit to such reviews, and the members of the council will be the first to be scrutinized.Yvonne Terlingen, the United Nations representative for Amnesty International, said: ""The countries that have weak human rights records and are elected to the council must now start re-examining their own records and improve them and implement the pledges they have made to the General Assembly. We will closely watch to see if they do so.""'"

GlaxoSmithKline said in a statement that it had called in the police and had offered its 167,000 shareholders advice on protecting their identities.'"
"'06-05-10,'1','Mr. Lader stumbled into the abortion issue while working on a biography of Margaret Sanger, who around 1910 began her crusade for birth control because of her horror of abortions, then dangerous and illegal. By the 1950's, he said, antibiotics and new technology had made the procedure much safer, but it was still illegal and seldom discussed.Mr. Lader wrote one of the first carefully documented books on the subject, ""Abortion"" (1966). It began, ""Abortion is the dread secret of our society.""The book promoted the argument that the Supreme Court's 1965 decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, which enlarged individual rights to privacy in matters of sexuality and family planning, could apply to abortion. When the court in 1973 made abortion legal in Roe v. Wade, it leaned heavily on the Connecticut case and cited Mr. Lader's book at least seven times.""It is not only an authoritative study of the hypocrisy and absurdity of abortion practices,"" Ms. Friedan said of the book, ""it is a courageous blueprint of what women must do to abolish the state's power to force them to bear a child against their will.""Opponents of abortion differed. ""By stigmatizing criticism of Roe v. Wade as fanatical, Lader cheapens debate,"" James R. Kelly, a Fordham University sociology and anthropology professor, said in a letter to The New York Times in 1983.Lawrence Powell Lader was born in Manhattan on Aug. 6, 1919, and graduated from Harvard, where he helped found a radio station and worked on The Crimson. He was an Army lieutenant during World War II, and The New Yorker published war dispatches he submitted. He became a widely published magazine writer in Look, Reader's Digest and The New Republic, among others.He was also active politically, serving as district leader for Representative Vito Marcantonio, who represented East Harlem and is still considered one of the country's most radical congressmen. In 1948, Mr. Lader ran for the New York State Assembly on Mr. Marcantonio's American Labor Party ticket and lost.He made fun of his minor-party status in a pamphlet. ""Pull the last little lever for Larry Lader,"" it said.When Mr. Lader decided to write his first book, he approached Ms. Sanger about a biography. She had already written several autobiographies but welcomed the proposal.""Working with her completely convinced me that a woman's freedom in education, jobs, marriage, her whole life, could only be achieved when she gained control of her childbearing,"" he said in an interview with The Times in 1991.Mr. Lader's subjects besides abortion included the role of Boston's elite in the struggle to end slavery.On July 30, 1968, a small group of what Mr. Lader described as radicals met in his apartment to plan a national organization. The result was a meeting in Chicago in February 1969, where the first order of business was deciding whether to try to change abortion laws, as was already happening in many states, or to try to repeal them.The answer came in the name they chose: the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. When the Supreme Court legalized abortion four years later, the name was changed to the National Abortion Rights Action League. After two more name changes, it is now called Naral Pro-Choice America.New York was the first battleground in the fight to repeal state abortion restrictions. An unlikely set of circumstances — including the fact that the Catholic Church's attention was focused on a bill for parochial school aid, miscalculations by abortion opponents and a last-minute vote change — resulted in the repeal.""The impossible victory,"" Mr. Lader called it in his book ""Abortion II"" (1973).In 1976, he left the abortion rights league, in part because he believed it was becoming too establishmentarian. He founded a new group, Abortion Rights Mobilization, that aggressively fought his battles against the Catholic Church and for RU-486.Mr. Lader is survived by his wife and a daughter, Wendy Summers Lader, both of Manhattan. As the abortion debate became violent, Mr. Lader's wife said she did not know how often he was threatened by people opposed to his views. She said he hid his mail and smiled a lot, adding, ""He was very capable of denial.""'"
"'06-05-10,'1','There are currently more than 8,000 funds with $1.2 trillion in assets. Driven largely by institutions like Wooster piling into hedge funds, the sector is expected to maintain its rapid growth.Still, the use of hedge funds as an investment vehicle is widely debated: some say that hedge funds lower a portfolio's risk by allowing managers to bet for and against stocks. Mutual funds, by comparison, can bet only that a stock will rise.When markets slide, as they will, mutual fund managers are stuck selling into a falling market or sitting on stocks that are being hammered. But hedge funds have more flexibility across markets and types of investments: in bull markets they can leverage their bets and in bear markets they can bet that stock prices will fall.For their high fees — typically 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of the profits — hedge funds aim for a positive return regardless of market conditions.Since hedge funds seek to make money in good and bad times alike, investing in successful hedge funds create a safer long-term portfolio, said Mr. Massey, who in 2004 founded Massey, Quick & Company, a consulting and wealth management firm. ""I would argue that the structure of our endowment has less risk than those endowments that have a more traditional asset allocation to fixed income and equities,"" he said.Mr. Massey developed his love of numbers as a student at Wooster.When he was a junior, he said, he ran out of beer money and applied for a job at the school. They hired him as a bookkeeper in the office of finance, tracking entries into the endowment ($15 million at the time).He enjoyed watching the numbers, he said, especially when they went up.Today, part of Wooster's endowment is invested in 14 single hedge-fund managers, all long-short, meaning they can buy shares they think will appreciate in value and bet against those whose prices may fall. It also uses five funds of hedge funds — investment pools that invest in a number of funds to minimize the risk by maximizing diversification. From August 1999 through the end of March 2006, the endowment fund returned 45.7 percent, not including net outflows of $19 million.Wooster measures itself against a self-created index, a composite of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a bond index, a global stock index and 90-day Treasury bills. Over the same time period, that index returned 20.4 percent and the S.& P. delivered 8.21 percent. Those returns were generated with significantly less volatility and with less overall risk, according to data presented by Mr. Massey.The committee started looking at alternative investments — private equity, hedge funds and real estate — in 1995. The college made its first investment in a single-manager hedge fund, a pool of money run by one principal manager, a long-short Japanese equity fund, in 1997.Mr. Massey says the college's decision to invest in hedge funds was not a quick one: it required a small, nimble and engaged board and a willingness to drop managers whose investments were not clear enough to the committee.In 1992, when Mr. Massey took control of the investment committee, 16 people made decisions about how to invest the college's funds. Today, eight people are on the committee, including a former partner from Goldman Sachs, a president of a mutual fund company and the former chairman of a reinsurance company.Its philosophy, he says, is simple: ""We don't get involved in exotic strategies. If we can't write it down on a piece of paper, if one of us can't write it in a paragraph, we won't do it.""'"
"'06-05-10,'1','LONDON, May 9 — Saudi Arabia said Tuesday that it hoped to build a Middle East financial district in the capital city, Riyadh, and to sell a majority stake in its stock exchange, the Tadawul, to investors.The changes follow a recent drop in the value of the companies traded on the Tadawul. Oil money helped to pump up stock exchanges across the Middle East in the last year, but in recent months some have experienced corrections.The new Saudi financial center will be the Middle East's ""first financial district on a scale and of regulatory and technological standards"" to match the world's major global financial centers, the kingdom said in a news release.The Tadawul will be renamed the Saudi Arabian Financial Exchange. Its value has not yet been determined.Some analysts said the proposal appeared to be a bid to rival Dubai's growing financial influence.The move is also part of a Saudi plan to pump oil revenue back into the local economy. In addition to the stock exchange and local headquarters for global banks, officials said the financial center would be home to an educational center to train financial analysts and planners.'"

"'06-05-10,'1','Mr. Maloney, the only openly gay candidate in the attorney general's race, may be welcomed enthusiastically at many forums. But with few voters focusing on the race, his candidacy has yet to create a ripple in the polls. Indeed, many in the Harlem gathering said that Mr. Maloney was not even on their radar before the candidates' forum last week.""I had never heard him before and really didn't know anything about him,"" said Fernley A. Murray, a retired educator. ""I found him to be very, very appealing, and someone I plan to look at more seriously. He seems so much more sincere than politicians tend to sound. I was impressed.""In three weeks, statewide Democratic leaders will meet in Buffalo to decide who gets on the Sept. 12 primary ballot.Mr. Cuomo, a former federal housing secretary, is virtually assured a spot. But the five others seeking to make the ballot may not get the 25 percent support among delegates to meet that goal, forcing them to go through a cumbersome petitioning process to keep their candidacies alive.The race also includes Mark Green, a former New York City public advocate and mayoral candidate, who is also believed to have a shot at the ballot; Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester County; Charlie King, a two-time candidate for lieutenant governor who heads a group that helps homeless people; and Denise O'Donnell, a former United States attorney for western New York.Mr. Maloney, 39, was the first of the six candidates in the attorney general's race to have campaign commercials on the air. And in doing so, he used the unusual approach of taking on the Bush administration's domestic eavesdropping program.As is the case with many of the candidates, Mr. Maloney has made reform in Albany a hallmark of his campaign. He has called for an end to the ""pay-to-play culture that exists in Albany"" and for changes in the rules under which lobbyists can operate. He has also called for investigations into the state's public authorities for waste and fraud, and has said that he was committed to investigating Medicaid fraud.Mr. Maloney, who grew up in Hanover, N.H., was a lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher in New York and, in his off hours, worked on Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns.He came to know the Clinton family well and served in the president's second term as staff secretary, a position previously held by John D. Podesta. In speeches, he says that he was the youngest person to serve in that position and the highest-ranking openly gay employee in the West Wing.Since the end of the Clinton administration, Mr. Maloney returned to Willkie Farr & Gallagher, where he specialized in criminal and corporate investigations. He is on leave during this year's campaign.While many of his rivals campaign on similar themes, Mr. Maloney said the difference between him and those candidates was in his level of passion.Even though many political analysts and elected officials insist that Mr. Maloney has little chance of winning the primary, the candidate said that no one should be ruled out.""My faith is in something simpler,"" Mr. Maloney said this week in an interview. ""People respond to passion and substance. And if you show what's in your heart, people will respond to that. People want something new and something fresh. But you need show up with something positive and substantive.""You need to be real, because voters are smarter than we give them credit for being.""'"
"'06-05-10,'1','So what else is new?Well, just this: a year ago, the opposition Conservatives had failed to make substantial gains in the national election. In last week's local elections, they emerged as the strongest party, with 40 percent of the vote. (Labor got 26 percent.)And a national poll published Tuesday in The Times of London showed the Conservatives eight percentage points ahead of a Labor Party debilitated by scandals and missteps. Even though the Conservatives are embroiled in their own political makeover, two-thirds of the respondents thought Labor would lose the next election. More than half said the ""biggest problem is now Tony Blair himself.""But Mr. Blair is not the only one in a bind. With ever more flimsy camouflage cloaking his ambition, Mr. Brown wants to take over. But the nature of his inheritance depends on the manner in which it is bequeathed, as he made clear when he appeared, statesmanlike, in an interview on breakfast-time television on Tuesday.""We have to prove by our actions, by our behavior and also by the measures and policies we take that we are capable of enjoying the trust of the British people, that people have confidence in us and that people believe we can take this country forward,"" he said.In short, the transition should be conducted ""in an orderly, dignified and sensible and proper way,"" he said, ""a way that is unifying as well as unified."" The alternative — ""disorderly,"" ""undignified"" — was the manner in which the Conservatives shed Margaret Thatcher in 1990, he said, a barely veiled warning that Mr. Blair risked a similar putsch if he resisted the pressure to step down.But is it already too late to choreograph a peaceful changeover, without precipitating a potentially disastrous confrontation? As Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said Tuesday, the appearance of ""great divisions"" among Labor lawmakers ""is damaging to the party.""""I do say to people: Don't get into a war about it now,"" said Mr. Prescott, himself reeling from a sex scandal that has lowered his already ambiguous public standing. ""It's an unnecessary distraction.""After the latest Blair-Brown dueling, the consensus in British newspapers on Tuesday seemed to be that by offering Monday to order a ""stable and orderly transition"" with ""ample time"" before the next national election, Mr. Blair had blinked first.Indeed, the likely timing for his departure seemed to have narrowed to next year, or 2008 at the latest, giving Mr. Brown up to two years to get the feel of things. Under Labor Party rules, Mr. Prescott said, there can be no move on the leadership until next October's party conference in Blackpool.Some forecast that the endgame could come sooner. In an editorial, The Times of London listed the challenges to be met before the summer, major issues like pensions and nuclear energy. ""If Mr. Blair and Mr. Brown fail to deliver, their 'sell by' date will have passed,"" the editorial said.There are many oddities to all this. Mr. Blair and Mr. Brown are neighbors on Downing Street, the chancellor's office at No. 11 and the prime minister's at No. 10. Mr. Brown barely needs a U-Haul for the move. They could almost talk over the garden fence. But there can be no more agonized prospective change of address.First off, Mr. Blair must agree to relinquish the leadership of the Labor Party and Mr. Brown must be elected as his successor, enabling him to take over the prime ministry.But then Mr. Brown will have to establish his own legitimacy with the voters, possibly in an early election.Mr. Blair, seeking to build a legacy as a great reforming leader and to emerge from the ominous shadow of the Iraq war, which has obscured so much of his early popularity, wants time to complete his agenda. Mr. Brown wants time to mold his own credentials before seeking a fourth consecutive term for Labor.Yet, the longer the two men circle each other, the more time ebbs for both of them.""This week may mark the beginning of the end, not just for Blair but for Labor itself,"" a columnist, Polly Toynbee, wrote in The Guardian. ""If they carry on like this, there will be no fourth term, and nor will they deserve one.""She continued: ""Blair's legacy may yet be the fall of his party. From the wild look in the eyes of some around him, they wouldn't mind. Anything would be better than a triumph for Gordon Brown. Make no mistake: Labor is in mortal danger.""'"

But on the basis of ""Hammer,"" an hourlong work that fills the current program at her Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet headquarters in Chelsea, she has a way to go.Ms. Laurie is the niece of Sam Walton of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and has a personal fortune estimated at $2.5 billion. Her creation of Cedar Lake's spiffy new space is to be applauded, as is the establishment of her company. A colorful crowd was on hand Monday night to cheer on its efforts.""Hammer"" draws its title from Nietzsche's late, quasi-fascistic notion of making philosophy with a hammer — not that the philosophical implications were fully realized here. There is a big ol' hammer onstage, enthusiastically whacked at the outset by a woman in a pale green dress, Alexandra Damiani, also credited for ""concept,"" along with the choreographer.Five women (including Ms. Damiani) and five men appear, the women in dresses, and the men in dark pants and shirts. They cluster in the upper left corner of a geometrically shaped platform made of dark boards that covers half the stage. Four others, three women and a man in leotards, can be discerned in the distance.But then the choreographer, Benoit-Swan Pouffer (also rendered in the program as Benoit Swan-Pouffer and Benoit Swan Pouffer, though the first version seems to be preferred), loses his grip. He throws in everything he can think of and Ms. Laurie can pay for: dancers wander on and off the platform; its boards are dismantled; costumes change; footwear shifts from none to slippers to point shoes; video projections flicker; an animated film of a hammer plays; there is a fake game show in which the hammer is heralded as the source of all benefits; dancers drop from or leap toward a hole on the back wall.Eventually everyone is cavorting happily, back in dresses and shirts and slacks. At the end Ms. Damiani passes on the hammer to a new bearer of its powers. Whatever they may be.'"

Impressive, actually, that he's allowed to say stuff like that. (His own reader comments are even harsher.)Blogger Warner Crocker (not a Microsoft employee, but a Tablet PC fan honored by Microsoft as a Most Valuable Professional) wrote in his blog: ""Anyone who follows Tablet PC’s and the Origami/UMPC who didn't see this kind of negative response coming is blind or just hopelessly naive. The brain trust behind the Origami viral launch [the UMPC's Apple-esque, suspense-based advance marketing] created a fiasco. Yes, their campaign in marketing standards was a raging success. It got folks talking and buzzing and excited. Lots of folks. But that kind of success often breeds failure in the end when the product can't keep up with the hype.""So my question is: If so many people saw this disaster coming, how does something like the UMPC get past the drawing board? In the years it took to reach fruition, was there nobody at Microsoft or Samsung who could have raised a hand and said, ""Ummm... guys? Have we thought this through?""I had dinner last night with some buddies who asked me precisely the same question--and suddenly, I had an answer. Suddenly, I knew *exactly* why nobody pulls the emergency brake on runaway trains like the UMPC.In my younger days, I was a Broadway theater conductor. I worked on my share of flops. And I remembered a couple of times when *everyone* knew that we were on a sinking ship. Any one of us--cast, crew, orchestra--could have told the show's creators that we had a turkey on our hands.But nobody did.First, because we were employees; it'd be horribly presumptuous and rude to say something like that to our employers. Second, we needed the job as long as it lasted. Third--well, what if we were wrong? Shouldn't we trust our leaders to know what they're doing?So: my sympathy to those on the Microsoft ship who knew that the UMPC was headed for an iceberg. And to their bosses: Um, maybe you should read some of those Microsoft blogs...And now, two follow-ups.Last week in this e-newsletter, I wrote about the ingenious way my favorite calendar program, Now Up-to-Date, keeps multiple computers (Macs and PC's) synchronized over the network. And I wished that that auto-synching even worked across the Internet.Turns out it does. This tidbit isn't in the manual, but many fans of the program emailed me to say that over-the-Net synching can be done if (a) the computer containing the master calendar server has a fixed IP address, or (b) you sign up for a free DNS routing service like dyndys.com. Obviously, this is all geek to average folks, but the point is, it can be done.Finally, a piece of glorious news: My 1.5-year-old Web log, Pogue's Posts, now really is a blog.For the longest time, I quietly posted daily tidbits in my own little corner of NYTimes.com, but it wasn't *really* a blog; it was just sort of a big white Web page. There were no reader comments, no archives, no categories--none of the things that make a blog a blog.But beginning yesterday, the NYTimes.com folks gave it the extreme makeover treatment, so now I can recommend it with pride. It even has an RSS feed, so my daily posts can come to *you*. (Details on that are here.)'"

The reports dismissed speculation about a ""fifth bomber"" and one of them said there was no intelligence reporting to suggest a link with a second wave of look-alike bombings two weeks on July 21, when explosives failed to detonate.The reports also said Britain had foiled three further terror attacks since last July, but did not give details.'"

Cooney, whose Chicago law firm, Cooney & Conway, represents the plaintiffs.The plan, which has an effective date of Oct. 30, would enable the company to exit bankruptcy with a value of $5.86 billion, according to a settlement sheet obtained by The Associated Press. Existing equity would be wiped out and 131.4 million shares of new stock would be issued.The company, based in Toledo, Ohio, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2000 in an effort to shield itself from billions in health claims for damages linked to asbestos products it made decades ago.'"
"'06-05-11,'0','Workers at Ford, as well as G.M., have been badly shaken by their companies' slumps. The two automakers collectively plan to cut 60,000 jobs and close more than two dozen plants over the next few years. They have lost billions of dollars in North America in recent years, and their share of the market has dipped to its lowest point ever because of gains by Japanese and Korean automakers.Just last week, for the first time, Toyota beat DaimlerChrysler in monthly car sales. It has already overtaken Ford in worldwide sales and, if current trends hold, it will overtake G.M. in the not too distant future. On Wednesday, Toyota reported a net profit of $12.1 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, making it the most profitable manufacturing company in the world.That may be why no less than Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of the company's founder, is now warning that blind patriotism to Detroit's old ways is dangerous.""If we are invested in that even 1 percent, we are going to lose,"" Mr. Ford said in an interview late last month. But he also acknowledged the difficulty in changing those attitudes.""This is an insular industry and an insular town,"" he said.Indeed, there are still signs that Detroit is trying to circle the wagons. The troubles at G.M., which lost $10.6 billion last year, have generated enormous sympathy here for the company and its embattled chief executive, Rick Wagoner, who has become something of a symbol of Detroit's fight against outside forces.Those include the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, the company's biggest shareholder, whose representative, Jerome B. York, has publicly pushed for change at G.M. and recently joined the company's board.""We Almost Lost Rick!"" read the headline on a story last month in Automotive News, the trade publication that covers the global industry. In it, the paper detailed how Mr. Wagoner threatened to quit if his board did not back him in the face of a media storm that declared his job to be in jeopardy. (The board did issue a statement of support.)But statewide, the support for the homegrown companies is beginning to wane in one essential way, if ever so slightly. Five years ago, Detroit's Big Three took 90.8 percent of auto sales in Michigan, according to J. D. Power. Lately, that has slipped to 88.3 percent — compared with about 55 percent nationwide.One reason is that the makeup of the state and especially its wealthiest areas has simply changed. Though still a fraction of the whites in the suburbs and the blacks in Detroit, the number of Asians living in the four counties surrounding Detroit has more than doubled since 1990, to over 120,000. Nearly half live in upscale Oakland County, helping to further diversify an area that includes a sizable Arab population, centered in Dearborn, where Ford has its headquarters.The public school that Mr. Ford's son attends in Ann Arbor, home to the Toyota Technical Center, is more than 40 percent Asian, he said. Hiller's Markets, a six-store chain of upscale grocery stores across the metropolitan area, features entire refrigerator and frozen-food cases with a selection of products that rivals a Tokyo shop, including pickled plums, Japanese brands of energy drinks and fermented soybeans.In suburbs like Novi, about 35 miles northwest of Detroit, some real estate agents do 90 percent of their business with Japanese customers. Spots in the city's English as a Second Language program, offered twice a year, fill up as soon as classes are made available.""In an hour and a half, we're done,"" said Bob Steeh, director of community education for the Novi Public Schools.One popular class features field trips to Home Depot, a funeral home and a local hospital, meant to show newcomers how life is lived differently from back home. But others stick to what they know best.Yoko Watanabe, 50, who moved to Novi 10 years ago to join her husband, Yasue, an interpreter, edits a local Japanese business newsletter and teaches Japanese to schoolchildren and businessmen.""My husband sometimes reprimands me for not trying to blend enough or know Americans more,"" she said, speaking through her husband, who interpreted for her.The new environment traps Detroit between its traditional identity and whatever new role it may play in a global automotive world, said William Pelfrey, a former G.M. speechwriter and the author of the book, ""Billy, Alfred and General Motors,"" about two former G.M. leaders: William C. Durant and Alfred P. Sloan.""Clearly the old Detroit as the Motor City is history,"" Mr. Pelfrey said. ""But the jury is still out on what Detroit is going to become.""Michigan's governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, is trying to provide one answer. Facing the loss of thousands of traditional auto jobs, and with a tough re-election race looming this fall, she is zealously competing for an engine plant that Toyota has indicated it wants to build in a Midwestern state.Ms. Granholm, who has already visited Japan once to lobby for the factory, plans another trip soon— as does Indiana's governor, Mitch Daniels, who wants the plant for his state.The changing complexion of the city is one reason a Detroit radio personality, Paul W. Smith, now regularly interviews executives like Carlos Ghosn of Nissan and James Press of Toyota on his morning show, long a platform for the city's auto figures.""Anybody who is paying attention and who is making a difference is not booing Toyota and Nissan,"" said Mr. Smith, who has a show on the Detroit radio station WJR and occasionally sits in for Rush Limbaugh on his national show.At his invitation, Toyota has become a sponsor of Mr. Smith's annual golf tournament benefiting Detroit's Police Athletic League — something that would have been ""impossible"" a decade ago, he said. Mr. Smith said he believed that the region would come through the industry's crisis, but not without some re-examination. ""Things are not going to be the way they were,"" Mr. Smith said.For his part, Mr. Ford does not think everything about the old Detroit needs to be discarded. Despite recent efforts by Toyota and other foreign companies, Detroit automakers still lead in backing the city's vast array of charities, he said.What he wants to see, both for his city and for his employees, is a more realistic attitude about their place in a global industry. ""I see what's happening to this world — how it's shrinking, how immigration is changing, and I think it's fascinating and invigorating,"" Mr. Ford said.Instead of booing the Japanese competition, Detroiters may want to recall the counsel of Mr. Ford's great-grandfather, the original Henry Ford, who once said: ""Don't find fault — find a remedy. Anybody can complain.""'"

"'06-05-11,'0','WASHINGTON, May 10 — The House energy committee heard few encouraging words about high gasoline prices on Wednesday as a senior Energy Department official testified that prices at the pump are unlikely to recede soon.""Crude oil prices are expected to remain at relatively high levels, supporting high gasoline prices for the foreseeable future,"" said the official, Howard K. Gruenspecht, deputy administrator of the Energy Information Administration, in a bleak assessment of the reasons prices are increasing despite adequate supplies.Mr. Gruenspecht argued that world markets, political instability in oil-producing countries, the lack of new refineries in the United States, hurricanes, efforts to change gasoline blends and, perhaps, greedy petroleum companies have combined to keep prices high.He said the current ""crack spread,"" the difference between the prices of crude oil and refined gasoline, had increased to $21 a barrel, leaving him to conclude that American oil companies ""are making good money.""The hearing is to continue Thursday with appearances by presidents of trade groups that represent oil companies, refiners and producers of ethanol and other renewable fuels.Mr. Gruenspecht told the committee that experts projected that crude oil prices would average $68 for a 42-gallon barrel this year and next as demand in the United States grows 1 percent a year.'"
"'06-05-11,'0','""I'm not sure consumers would see it,"" said Rayola Dougher, the manager of energy market issues for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group. ""They might see something, but I'd be astonished if they saw 8 cents across the board.""New York's move is among a variety of measures being looked at nationwide as gasoline prices have topped $3 a gallon in many areas and the summer driving season nears. Last week, for instance, Gov. Mike Easley of North Carolina called for freezing his state's gas taxes.Proceeds from New York's gas tax are distributed to state and local governments. The legislative plan would effectively cap a state sales tax component of the tax at 8 cents per gallon, 4 cents less than the current tax.It would also give counties the authority to take a similar step and save up to another 5½ cents at current prices, which would reduce their local revenue. If all of the counties opted in, it would cost the state and localities about $450 million annually — and it would mean the state would no longer profit from the increasing price of gas.""State and local governments should not reap a revenue windfall from high gas prices,"" said Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, a Republican.Theoretically, a driver filling up a Toyota Camry could save 74 cents in state taxes and as much as $1.76 over all in counties with the highest taxes, if they choose to opt in. But in reality, while a steep cut in gas taxes would almost surely be felt, modest cuts could be lost in the distribution chain from the oil companies to the gas stations, several oil industry officials said. And that could leave at least some of the tax relief in the hands of the big oil companies that have been reporting record profits.Legislative leaders said their bill would require that gas stations pass savings along to customers, and said that the State Department of Taxation and Finance, and the Consumer Protection Board, would be charged with assuring that the modest savings be passed to consumers through audits of gas station records. They said that gas stations did not do so would be fined $5,000 per incident.Asked how they would guarantee such modest savings would reach consumers, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the state's top Democrat, said, ""Guarantee is a hard thing to do,"" adding, ""You've got to look at market forces, you've got to look at pricing patterns.""""Are you going to have a thousand new Tax and Finance workers running to gas stations all over the state and comparing notes? I don't think so,"" said Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat.In an interview from a stop on the New York State Thruway on Wednesday, Ms. Krueger said a gallon of regular was selling there for $3.29. ""I empathize with the desire of government to try to be doing something, and it's not that I have opposition to this, it's that this isn't addressing the real problem,"" she said, adding that the nation should move towards tougher fuel economy regulations.The gas tax cut was part of legislation that included other more modest energy proposals, including granting New York City the authority that other localities already have to reduce or eliminate the 4 percent local sales taxes on home heating fuels, a plan the Bloomberg administration has not signed on to. The legislation would also provide tax credits to people using biodiesel for home heating and credits of up to $500 for people who buy energy efficient heating systems.The Legislature also backed a plan already being carried out by Mr. Pataki to make alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel available on the New York State Thruway.Peter Constantakes, a Pataki spokesman, focused on the alternative fuel measures in a statement. ""While we need to review the specifics of this legislation, the Legislature's proposal appears to contain elements that recognize the need to develop new sources of renewable energy,"" he said.'"
"'06-05-11,'0','""It is a familiar icon of Los Angeles,"" Dr. Krupp said as he led a tour of the unfinished exhibit spaces this week. ""It is, in fact, the hood ornament of Los Angeles.""The 4,100-acre Griffith Park, one of the largest urban parks in the nation, was a bequest of Col. Griffith J. Griffith, an eccentric early Los Angeles land buccaneer who was struck by a pang of public-spiritedness before his death in 1919. He financed the construction of the observatory and the nearby Greek Theater and left enough money to assure that admission to the observatory would always be free.The observatory originally cost $400,000 to build and equip. The renovation will cost $93 million, including $67 million in public money. While the exterior looks basically the same as the original, nearly 40,000 square feet of exhibit and office space has been added by excavating under the front lawn and the west terrace.The new exhibits include a highly detailed composite photograph of a slice of space that is 150 feet wide and 20 feet high. A million galaxies and a half-million stars are visible in the photograph.The heart of the observatory remains the 300-seat planetarium, newly equipped with a $7 million Zeiss Mark IX Universarium, the world's most advanced star projector.But the Griffith is probably better known for its role in films than for its educational mission. The observatory has appeared in scores of movies, including Arnold Schwarzenegger's original ""Terminator"" and Disney's ""Rocketeer,"" as well as a 1995 episode of ""Star Trek: Voyager."" Just west of the observatory is a bust of James Dean, noting the building's co-starring role in the knife-fight scene in ""Rebel Without a Cause.""""We've been in so many movies we ought to have a star on Hollywood Boulevard,"" Dr. Krupp said.Before the observatory shut down in early 2002 for the renovation, Dr. Krupp recalled, he asked visitors what they would miss most about the place. The view, they answered.In Southern California, it is said, topography is destiny. The observatory sits on Mount Hollywood, a few miles north and west of downtown Los Angeles. Twenty miles to its west, on a hillside in the Santa Monica Mountains, sits the other popular cultural bookend of Los Angeles, the Getty Center in Brentwood. It, too, is the bequest of a wealthy refugee from somewhere else, J. Paul Getty, and it, too, is visited as much for its views and public spaces as for its artistic collections.""Height has always meant authority in Los Angeles,"" said D. J. Waldie, a longtime city official in the suburb of Lakewood, and the author of several books about Los Angeles. ""In Southern California, our gods are all gods of high places.""He said Colonel Griffith, Mr. Getty and others who had made their names and their fortunes here staked out the city with monuments to make it more than a wide spot on the road to somewhere else. ""We can be skeptical about the quality of the monuments and the art inside,"" Mr. Waldie said, ""but a place is made by literally putting down a foundation in the ground. These buildings are at least partially successful efforts to make what sometimes seems a flimsy and ephemeral place seem less so.""'"
"'06-05-11,'0','Since the development a generation ago of a vaccine that is given to nearly all children born in the United States and to many adults who are considered at risk, hepatitis B has become rare in this country. While doctors have long worried about the disease in immigrant groups who come from countries like China — which does not have a comprehensive national vaccination program — little has been done to raise awareness of the danger.""The health care costs are enormous,"" said Dr. Henry J. Pollack, the lead author of the study, which is to be published late this week in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's journal, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. ""If you're giving what would be considered to be the proper care for all these people, it would be hundreds of millions of dollars.""People can carry the hepatitis B virus for decades without showing any signs of illness, until it causes life-threatening diseases like cancer or cirrhosis. ""That often is the first sign of trouble,"" said Dr. Pollack, an associate professor at the medical school.The New York State cancer registry shows rates of liver cancer among Asian-Americans 6 to 10 times as high as for whites, Dr. Pollack said, a difference that is mostly attributable to hepatitis B. And those figures may underestimate the disparity, because many immigrants who become sick return to their native countries.Hepatitis B is prevalent in many poor countries, and there are an estimated 350 million cases worldwide. It is most common in China, but scientists do not understand why. In this country, hepatitis B is associated with transmission by sex and intravenous drug use. But in Asia, the disease most commonly passes from mothers who do not know they have it to their children in the womb. It may also be transmitted among children who have close physical contact.Dr. Thomas Tsang, another principal investigator in the study, said the results confirmed that Asian-Americans face a major health problem that is not captured by national statistics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that just 0.4 percent of all Americans have chronic hepatitis B, but experts say that may undercount people from Asia.""In this past week alone, from those people we screened, I have seen 7 to 10 people who needed to be started on medication because they had abnormal liver tests,"" said Dr. Tsang, who is chief medical officer of the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center in New York City. Those are people, who without the screening program, would probably have gone untreated until they got so sick they ended up in the hospital.Representative Mike Honda, Democrat of California and chairman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said California faced a problem similar to New York's, one that was going largely unrecognized. ""To not do something, when we know we can, is criminal,"" he said.Early detection and suppression of the virus can interrupt the cycle of mother-to-child transmission. An adult immune system can usually fight off a new hepatitis B infection, though a small number of cases become chronic. But, Dr. Pollack said, ""If you get it when you're an infant, your chance of getting chronic hepatitis B is greater than 90 percent.""In the last decade, doctors have been able to use an array of new drugs to treat chronic infection, but they do not cure the disease. Rather, they often suppress the virus so that it causes little or no harm. The medication must be taken for life.Previous, smaller studies, cited in the N.Y.U. report, have also found high rates of infection among foreign-born Asian Americans, some as high as 15 percent. But the authors of the N.Y.U. report say theirs is the most comprehensive look at the problem, and the first to search not only for the number of people with hepatitis, but also for significant patterns within those numbers.The researchers found that people from Fujian province — the biggest source of Chinese immigration to the United States in recent years — had the highest rate of infection, which corresponds to findings by the Chinese government. Men between the ages of 20 to 39 were also more likely than other groups to have the virus; overall, men were twice as likely as women to be infected.The researchers screened 1,836 Asian-born adults last year at 12 sites in heavily Asian neighborhoods in Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan. More screenings have been conducted this year, but those results have not yet been analyzed.Some 61 percent of the subjects, who volunteered for the screening, were born in China, and 30 percent were born in Korea. A small number were from other parts of Asia, and those groups had much lower rates of infection than the Chinese.Over all, 24 percent of the people screened were found to carry the virus, but that included a large number of people who said they had been tested before, and may already have known that they were infected. Those people might have sought screening to obtain confirmation or treatment. Among those who had been tested previously, 40 percent were infected.Among those who said they had never been tested, who were just over half the subjects, 15 percent, tested positive. The researchers concluded that this figure, not the higher number, reflected infection rates in the east Asian population as a whole.'"
"'06-05-11,'0','Mr. Bush said his administration was trying to find a diplomatic solution to the Iran standoff. He said Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Russia and China had agreed that the Iranians should not have a weapon or the capacity to make one.""There is a universal agreement toward that goal, and the letter didn't address that question,"" he said. ""Diplomacy takes a while when you are dealing with different nations like those that sat around the table with Condi Rice the other night.""Mr. Bush was referring to a meeting between Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the other envoys of the United Nations Security Council countries, as well as Germany, this week in New York to forge a common position on Iran. It came in response to a report last month by the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that declared that Iran had failed to meet a deadline to halt the program.Ms. Rice said yesterday that there were ""tactical differences"" over what to do about Iran's nuclear activities and that negotiators would take several weeks to fashion an offer that would allow the Iranians to have a civil nuclear program.""We agreed that we will continue to seek a Security Council resolution, but that we would wait for a couple of weeks while the Europeans design an offer to the Iranians that would make clear that they have a choice that would allow them to have a civil nuclear program — if that is indeed what they want,"" Ms. Rice said in an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" after the talks.American officials say the discussions in New York failed to break an impasse over their drive with the British and French for a United Nations Security Council resolution that would make it mandatory for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities, stop construction of a heavy-water nuclear reactor and resume talks with the West. Russia and China oppose such a resolution as too threatening and say it could provoke Iran to abandon all cooperation with international nuclear inspections.Yesterday, Mr. Ahmadinejad reiterated that Iran would reject any Security Council decision that restricted the country's nuclear activities, which he said his country, like others, had the right to pursue.""The Iranian nation has decided,"" he said at a news briefing in Indonesia that was carried by the Iranian news agency IRNA. ""It will defend and never renounce its rights."" Mr. Ahmadinejad also cast the tensions over Iran's nuclear program as an unfair struggle against technological advancement in Muslim countries.""Iranians are strong enough to defend their rights,"" he said. ""But it should also be stressed here that resistance of the Iranian nation will not only be for Iran but for all independent-minded states including Indonesia, Malaysia, Turkey, Egypt and other Muslim countries.""'"
"'06-05-11,'0','LONDON, May 10 — Nasdaq's piece of the London Stock Exchange got a little bigger on Wednesday. With two separate purchases, the Nasdaq Stock Market raised its stake in its trans-Atlantic rival to 24.1 percent, a level that will allow it to count some of London's profit as its own.In addition, the French insurer AXA said Wednesday that it had bought 10.6 percent of the London exchange for ""investment purposes."" Analysts said AXA probably hoped to sell the shares to Nasdaq at a higher price.While the London market has rebuffed numerous takeover attempts in recent years, including one from Nasdaq, its chief executive, Clara Furse, has been unable or unwilling to stop aggressive pursuers from offering sometimes above market prices to longtime investors cashing out. The exchange had no comment on Wednesday's purchases.Nasdaq's investment is expected to provide a quick lift to earnings. Accounting rules allow owners of 20 percent or more of a company to add a part of the company's profit to their own. In its last fiscal year, the London Stock Exchange earned £62.6 million ($116.8 million, at current exchange rates), compared with Nasdaq's $61.7 million net income in 2005.If Nasdaq increases its stake slightly, to 25 percent, it can exert some influence over operations at the London exchange; British corporate governance rules often require three-quarters of shareholders to approve big changes.Nasdaq paid $209.8 million in two installments Wednesday for 13.8 million shares in the London Exchange. After the first purchase, of 10.3 million shares, Nasdaq's chief executive, Robert Greifeld, noted that the transaction ""takes us through the important threshold of 20 percent,"" adding, ""We look forward to working constructively with L.S.E. as its largest shareholder."" Then it bought 3.5 million shares more.Nasdaq paid £12.48 a share for the London stock, more than its Tuesday closing price of £12.445. By Wednesday's close, the share price had increased to £12.565.'"
"'06-05-11,'0','The architects cannot say what they think publicly under their contract with the development corporation. But it is widely understood that Mr. Arad was already unhappy with the decision to eliminate two of the four ramps he originally proposed.Monica Iken, a memorial foundation board member and the founder of September's Mission, which supports development of a memorial park, said the loss of the underground galleries would be damaging.""If you get rid of that, you will lose the experience of what the memorial is,"" said Ms. Iken, whose husband, Michael Iken, died in the attack.""There is a meaning behind the descent,"" she said. ""You become immersed in that space and you enter a place of peacefulness, reverence, reflection and honor. And you become part of that experience. And you forget about everything outside.""Mary Fetchet, founding director of Voices of Sept. 11, a family group, and the mother of Bradley James Fetchet, who died on 9/11, said the original design ""recreated the pilgrimage that people took to the site.""""It can't be done at street level, where you have the hustle and bustle of the city,"" she said.Many people do not share this view. A group called Take Back the Memorial, which has been highly critical of the planning process, asks visitors to its Web site, ""Where should the ground zero 9/11 memorial be built?"" As of yesterday, 2,773 respondents said ""aboveground"" and 552 respondents said ""below ground.""A recently disclosed memo from James K. Kallstrom, Governor Pataki's senior adviser for counterterrorism, called on the architects to ""significantly reduce the opportunity for a satchel charge explosive or airborne contaminant dissemination device to be cast, or a suicide attempt to be made into the void.""It stands to reason that if visitors were not standing around the bottom of the voids because there were no galleries to stand in, their attractiveness as targets would diminish.That is one reason that Thomas H. Rogér, a foundation board member, said eliminating the underground galleries was worth a close look. His daughter, Jean Rogér, was a flight attendant on the jet that crashed into the north tower. ""If you're talking about a briefcase bomb or nerve gas that someone is going to toss into the reflecting pool,"" he said, ""you have a situation where you're putting people in harm's way.""It was not the galleries but the broader notion of the voids that attracted the jury, said Paula Grant Berry, a former juror who is now a foundation board member. Her husband, David S. Berry, worked in the south tower. ""We were looking for the seed of an idea,"" she recalled. ""We liked that seed.""PERHAPS the voids now define a design line that cannot be crossed.The current cost estimate for the memorial and memorial museum is $672 million, out of a total cost of $973 million to build the memorial setting, including mechanical areas, utilities, roadways and other underground structures. State and city officials have set a budgetary target of $500 million for the memorial. ""This happens to designers every day,"" said Michael Van Valkenburgh, a former juror and a landscape architect. ""We're not exactly asking them to do this on a shoestring.""Referring to the memorial architects, he added: ""It's first up to Michael, then up to Pete and Michael, to answer the question of whether the vision has been compromised. Making iterative changes doesn't necessarily water down a vision. Other people imposing changes does.""'"
"'06-05-11,'0','WASHINGTON, May 10 — The American Bar Association has deemed one of President Bush's appeals court nominees unqualified for the post.The special A.B.A. committee that evaluates judicial nominees reached a unanimous decision on the nominee, Michael B. Wallace, who was chosen by Mr. Bush for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans.Mr. Wallace, 54, a lawyer in Jackson, Miss., appears to be the first appeals court nominee in about 25 years to receive a unanimous rating of unqualified from the 15-member committee. He was nominated to fill the seat left open when Judge Charles W. Pickering Sr. resigned.Mr. Wallace, a former aide to Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, aroused the opposition of civil rights groups and Democrats on several fronts. As an aide to Mr. Lott, Mr. Wallace helped promote tax exemptions for Bob Jones University despite the institution's segregation policies at the time.He was also the Mississippi Republican Party lawyer in opposing several redistricting plans from 1982 to 2002 that were intended to increase black representation in the Legislature.""We disagree with the A.B.A. and reject their rating,"" Erin Healy, a White House spokeswoman, said. ""Mike Wallace is a well-respected attorney with extensive experience in constitutional and commercial law. He has an outstanding record and will make an excellent addition to the bench.""'"
"'06-05-11,'0','WASHINGTON, May 10 — Judge J. Michael Luttig, a leading conservative theorist on the federal bench who had been a regular on President Bush's short list for the Supreme Court, said Wednesday that he was resigning.Judge Luttig, whose resignation is effective immediately, said he would be senior vice president and general counsel of the Boeing Company, based in Chicago.In his 15 years as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, based in Richmond, Judge Luttig, 51, has been at the forefront of what is called the new federalism movement. Its adherents have increasingly questioned and limited the authority of Congress to enact wide-reaching legislation.Before working as a judge, he helped press a new conservative judicial approach as a senior aide in the Reagan administration, where he helped select judicial candidates.In an interview, Judge Luttig said his decision was unrelated to Mr. Bush's choice of two appeals judges, John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr., for the Supreme Court. ""No one can or should plan their life around the possibility of a Supreme Court appointment,"" he said.'"
"'06-05-11,'0','JERUSALEM, May 10 — Israel said Wednesday that it could accept a new and temporary mechanism to deliver aid to the Palestinians so long as the money did not reach Hamas and that Israel was prepared to hand over some of the tax revenues it collected for the Palestinians if the money went to humanitarian ends.Meeting in New York on Tuesday, representatives of the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations — the so-called quartet involved in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts — agreed to a European plan to establish a temporary financial structure that would allow aid to go to Palestinians directly without passing through the Palestinian Authority.The Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, told Israeli radio on Wednesday, ""This decision is acceptable, as such a mechanism would allow the transfer of funds to the Palestinians without the money reaching Hamas."" Later she said of the tax revenues, ""Israel will not use this money for salaries but is certainly willing to make additional use of it, above what it has been used for until now, for humanitarian ends.""At the same time, Dor, the private Israeli company that provides gasoline and other fuel to the Palestinian Authority, said it would cut off supplies because of a $26 million Palestinian debt.Israel has paid Dor in the past out of tax and customs receipts collected on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, which Israel stopped handing over after Hamas was elected. Israel is using the receipts to pay for Palestinian electricity and water, but it said it would not pay Dor this time.'"

"'06-05-11,'0','It is appalling that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would abruptly dismiss the letter from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran to President Bush after 27 years of no relations (news article, May 9).Relations between the United States and China thawed through ""Ping-Pong diplomacy."" President Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger, then the national security adviser, were imaginative enough to accept the invitation to visit China from Chairman Mao Zedong and Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, even though neither Ping-Pong nor a simple visit touched on the basic issues between China and the United States.Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger recognized that any angle sufficed to open the possibility of a potential thaw that could spread its benefits to the United States and the world.Now we have unnecessarily humiliated a large and powerful country that went out on a limb to offer us a peace feeler.You report that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran wrote in a letter to President Bush, ""Those with insight can already hear the sounds of the shattering and fall of the ideology and thoughts of the liberal democratic systems"" (front page, May 10).'"
"'06-05-11,'0','The Western classical tradition tends to bring out the worst in China's delicately preserved musical culture. Ancient far beyond our own, and with subtleties that will always elude the Western ear, Chinese music deals in wiry high-pitched vocal delivery, elaborate melisma, nasal wind sound and twanging plucked instruments — all a delight to hear. The China National Symphony Orchestra, on tour in this country, played Tuesday night at Avery Fisher Hall and brought yet another attempt at East-West bonding: Guan Xia's ""Fantasies Symphoniques.""Embedded in Western instruments, symphonic size and a French name were traces of old China: the zheng (a kind of zither), a bamboo flute and the sinuous, if amplified, singing of Junhua Chen. Common ground was hard to come by. Imposing the limited scales of Chinese musical language on European ideas of harmonic movement have a way of leaving us with oversimplifications more common to a Hollywood film than a classical concert stage.Said another way, when given little chance to modulate and develop, music like this in a symphonic setting is left with effects but no substance: either bombast or billowing masses of string sound, and in general the pseudo-modality of a portentous movie soundtrack. As globalization creeps over us all, these kinds of musical peace treaties seem inevitable, but Mr. Guan's piece, elegantly made and well performed, points to the disparities of two arts, not their meeting points.The rest of the evening was Western music that leaned eastward: the Khachaturian Violin Concerto, with a first-rate violinist named Chuan-Yun Li, and Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Scheherazade."" with equally first-rate solos from the orchestra's concertmaster, Yun-Zhi Liu.The China National Symphony has strong players throughout its ranks. They and their energetic conductor, Xincao Li, are still grappling with Western style, at times convincing in their phrasing and expression, at others creating reasonable imitations that can sound stiff and learned. Mr. Li likes high energy and big sound and is perhaps overly fond of the big brass-and-drum explosion. With a conductor seemingly so precise in his beat, it was curious how unsure so many entrances were. This orchestra will only get better, and the chance to hear Mr. Li's violin playing made the evening all worthwhile.'"
"'06-05-11,'0','Then using the data, experts demonstrate how to iron out technical kinks and create an exercise program to fix underlying weaknesses in strength, flexibility and balance.For golfers who have only recently warmed to the gym, these prescribed workouts take the guesswork out of improving their game, and because many are quick they are not overly taxing. Advocates say 3-D modeling is more effective than videotaping at revealing imperfections because it can show the swing from multiple angles and quantify the body's inner workings. But some skeptics wonder whether bombarding players with so much data will better their games, or just be a costly distraction.Three-dimensional modeling was first used in the late 1990's to analyze the golf swings of professionals, but only in the last nine months has a critical mass of programs sprouted to give amateurs this kind of exhaustive analysis. The 50 annual clinics that combine swing, fitness and club-fitting analysis at the Titleist institute are so popular they are sold out until May next year, even though they start at $5,000.At Pebble Beach Golf Academy in California, golfers don a wireless vest equipped with two sensors and use a club with another censor cinched to the grip, and together these measure the swing in action. A computer crunches the data to produce 3-D animation that shows, for example, the club's speed and the precise degree of shoulder turn versus hip turn at the top of the swing. A similar 3-D motion-analysis tool called K-Vest is used at the Omni Interlocken Resort in Broomfield, Colo.Inspired by Tiger Woods, Annika Sorenstam and other pros who are zealous about their intense workouts, more golfers than ever are trying to flatten their stomachs, get stronger and condition their hearts.""The feedback from our members is that the interest level and participation in fitness programs is really on the rise,"" said Rick Martino, the director of instruction for P.G.A. of America, an organization comprising more than 28,000 teaching pros.When Todd Townes, 37, founded Core Golf Fitness, a diagnostic testing and training company in Atlanta, 13 years ago, he estimated that only 5 percent of golfers cared about measuring their fitness levels. ""Since Tiger Woods came into the game, it's closer to 90 percent,"" he said.This isn't just hero worship. As new golf courses have grown longer, extra yardage has become more crucial to good scoring. Those who benefit the most from the latest equipment are the fastest swingers, who are generally in good shape.Still, many golfers like Mr. Vorenkamp find going to the gym a bewildering experience. ""You look at all these machines at the gym, and what do you do?"" he asked. ""It's like going to the vitamin store. There are 400 vitamins, but which ones should you take?""Fitness regimens devised after 3-D assessments help golfers cut to the chase. Players don't need to run and lift weights for a hour daily to see results on the course, said Dr. Rose, who is a chiropractor. ""If the problem is calf flexibility — which we've learned is more important to the swing than you'd think — you can see changes with five-minute workouts,"" he said. ""The ability to fine-tune the workout has made a big impact in getting golfers into fitness.""Tom Ennis, 51, a vice president for 19 Entertainment, which created ""American Idol,"" said that he had been through ""club fittings and golf schools and been videotaped"" but that the 3-D swing analysis he had done at the Titleist institute was invaluable. No other assessment had so explicitly demonstrated how fitness — or lack of it — influences a swing. ""Where I thought I was strong, I wasn't,"" Mr. Ennis conceded. ""I learned so much about what I should be doing to achieve what I was already trying to achieve with my workouts.""Tests showed that one of his major shortcomings was a lack of hip rotation on both sides — only 16 to 25 degrees, about half that of the average PGA Tour pro — hampering proper execution of the downswing. So when his tailored regimen, with instructional video, was posted on a password-protected Web site, it included flexibility exercises like ""hip windshield wipers"" and ""hip drops.""Not all players embrace such recommendations, especially those that involve Gyrotonic exercises, Pilates or yoga to improve core strength and suppleness. ""I've highly recommended Pilates to my golf buddies, and some have tried it and like it,"" said Dr. Bradford Carl, 50, a dentist from Carmel, Calif., who started working with a Pilates instructor based on advice from the staff at Pebble Beach Golf Academy. But other friends ""think Pilates is some weird thing they wouldn't be comfortable with.""Workouts informed by 3-D analysis may better guide golfers in the gym, but some pros say obsessing over technique is likely to ruin play. ""The biggest problem with the average golfer is that he's not playing golf; he's working on mechanics while he's in the middle of a round,"" said Barry Goldstein, a teaching pro at Inverrary Country Club in Lauderhill, Fla. ""It would be like a baseball player thinking about where his hips and elbows are in the middle of a fastball.""Some see an overreliance on gadgetry as part of the problem. ""People think golf is a complicated game, and the more complicated it is, the more technology will help them,"" said Marc Solomon, 37, the owner of Golf Made Simple, which runs three golf schools in Florida and California. ""That's wrong. Golf has taken 'paralysis by analysis' to a whole new level.""There is no guarantee that players will follow their marching orders. After Pinehurst's clinic, Mr. Vorenkamp received a DVD and booklets detailing his new program and practice drills. In the ensuing six months, he stretched for at least 15 minutes daily. He has been ""less religious"" using resistance bands and a stability ball for strength training. He often does only half of the four weekly sessions he is supposed to do. Although Mr. Vorenkamp's handicap has remained the same, he's now hitting the distances he did a decade ago.""I'm much more flexible and strong,"" Mr. Vorenkamp said. ""There are things in my golf swing I always wanted to correct that now I can. But as you're able to do one thing better, there are other opportunities to get cockeyed,"" he added with a laugh. ""Golf is a journey, not a destination.""'"

To start with, did he put that program forward, whose idea was it, why was it started?"" Hagel said. ""He knows that he's not going to be confirmed without answering those questions.""Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, praised Hayden as an excellent nominee but said Congress should ask tough questions about the NSA programs.Collins, chairwoman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said it was disconcerting ""to have information come out by drips and drabs, rather than the administration making the case for programs I personally believe are needed for our national security.""""He's caught right in the middle of this,"" Biden, of Delaware, told CBS' ""The Early Show."" ""I think it's going to make it difficult.""In a poll taken Thursday, almost two thirds of Americans said it was acceptable for the NSA to collect phone records. When asked if they would be bothered if the NSA had their phone records, Democrats and independents were more likely to be bothered than Republicans. The ABC-Washington Post poll surveyed 502 people by telephone.Lawmakers have been demanding information from the Bush administration about the NSA's database of telephone records, begun while Hayden was in charge of the spy agency.The disclosure, reported in Thursday editions of USA Today, could complicate President Bush's bid to win Hayden's confirmation. It also renewed concerns about civil liberties and questions about the legal underpinnings for the government's actions.Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., said the NSA was using the data to analyze calling patterns in order to detect and track suspected terrorist activity, according to information provided to him by the White House.""Telephone customers' names, addresses and other personal information have not been handed over to NSA as part of this program,"" Allard said.The president on Thursday sought to assure Americans their civil liberties were ""fiercely protected.""""The government does not listen to domestic phone calls without court approval,"" said Bush, without confirming the NSA program. ""We're not mining or trolling through the personal lives of millions of innocent Americans.""Several lawmakers expressed incredulity about the program, with some Republicans questioning its rationale and several Democrats railing about a lack of congressional oversight.""I'm not sure why it would be necessary to keep and have that kind of information,"" said House Majority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, who wanted more details.House Democrats called for a special counsel to investigate the NSA's activities.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he would call the phone companies to appear before the panel in pursuit of what had transpired.The NSA is the same spy agency that conducts the controversial domestic eavesdropping program that had been acknowledged earlier by Bush. The president said the NSA listens, without warrants, to international phone calls involving Americans when terrorism is suspected.Hayden would have overseen that program and any efforts to collect phone records of millions of Americans as NSA head from March 1999 to April 2005, when he became the top deputy to National Intelligence Director John Negroponte.AT&T (NYSE:T) Corp., Verizon Communications Inc.

A scooter like the Yamaha Vino Classic will do even better -- it is capable of 115 m.p.g. But the tiny Vino, while fine for local errands, would be hard-pressed to fill a full range of transportation needs.Yet, there is no shortage of small two-wheelers that can meet everyday driving demands while achieving the sort of mileage that car owners only dream about. The Big Four Japanese motorcycle makers -- Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Yamaha -- make a number of bikes with 250 cc engines that are economical, reliable and easy to use. A rider need not be big, strong or even experienced to operate one of these bikes. Most 250 cc models weigh a manageable 300 pounds or so. They have low seats for short riders, yet their frames are long enough to accomodate tall ones.Most motorcycle riding classes use 250 cc bikes -- a smart choice for a first purchase. Here are three models that are both reasonable priced and inexpensive to operate (mileage figures are as tested).'"
"'06-05-12,'0','Cities are destroyed, children disappear, kitties are parboiled. Yes, there's something for everybody in the jazzy triple bill of anime offered at the ImaginAsian Theater.The main attraction for many fans of the genre is likely to be ""Negadon: The Monster From Mars,"" an homage to all those lizard-wrecks-Tokyo films that is billed as ""the world's first completely computer-generated monster movie."" It looks great and even has a respectable dose of the character development and back story that anime sometimes spurns.In the not-too-distant future, Mars is colonized, and when a spaceship returning to Earth crashes in Tokyo, the mysterious cargo it has been carrying turns out to be a slumbering monster, and a mean one. A scientist who abandoned a robot-building project years earlier after a personal tragedy is moved to fire up his dormant invention to do battle with the invader.The setup is lovely, but the film seems in a hurry to get to the big clash, as if desperate not to violate some anime time limit. Too bad; it might have worked at feature length.Just as compelling as ""Negadon"" is ""Kakurenbo: Hide & Seek,"" about children who go to play on a creepy street and disappear. Is this dark place from which children never return a metaphor for drugs? Or, even scarier, adulthood? Hard to say, but the film certainly delivers a chill.And then there's ""Cat Soup,"" the weirdest of the three, in which two kittens, brother and sister, take a hallucinogenic journey, apparently searching for the sister's soul, which has gone missing and left her a vacant lump. These kitties alternate between being cute and sadistic, and the land they're wandering is full of strange shapes that morph into beasts that might have escaped from some twisted version of ""Fantasia."" It's dizzying, indecipherable and great fun.'"
"'06-05-12,'0','Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it — along with some earlier and later pieces — are here.Ms. Hesse's work reflects, however subtly, her traumatic life story. Born in Nazi Germany, at 2 she was sent for safety's sake to the Netherlands with her older sister. They were reunited with their parents for emigration to the United States, where they learned that Ms. Hesse's uncle and grandparents had died in concentration camps.Then came her mother's mental breakdown, her parents' divorce, her father's remarriage, her mother's suicide when Ms. Hesse was not yet 10 and, still later, the failure of her own marriage and her father's death before the onset of her losing battle with brain cancer.An important section of the show, assembled by Mr. Wasserman, is devoted to biographical materials, including her father's moving daybooks that lovingly tracked the lives of his two daughters (the older, Helen Hesse Charash, survives).One of the earliest objects in the sculpture show is ""Compart"" (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. Does it have to do, as the catalog for the drawing show suggests, with an absent mother?The last, most startling and most impressive work is ""Untitled (Rope Piece),"" of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. Of latex over rope, string and wire, it is a tangled drawing in space suspended from the ceiling, some of its ends touching the floor, that looks like the work of giant spiders gone berserk or a doodle that got out of hand. Its strident arrhythmia seems to mock comfortable notions of composition and aesthetic purpose.It could be seen as anti-art and -architecture, a rootless, homeless sort of dysfunctional shelter that may, it has been suggested, have unconsciously expressed Ms. Hesse's emotional dislocation — or is that too easy? At any rate, like the work of her contemporaries Claes Oldenburg, Robert Morris and Alan Saret, it stood out from the anal-retentive neatness of Minimalism.Some works appeal particularly in the way they trap light and glow with it, like ""Sans II"" (1968), a double row of joined boxes of polyester resin and fiberglass that extends along more than 35 feet of wall, suggesting a Donald Judd work gone somewhat soft. More body-related objects include ""Schema"" (1967-68), a floor piece in the form of a flat latex sheet studded with 144 luscious-looking, repetitive protuberances, like breasts or muffins; and ""Area"" (1968), a long, rectangular piece of rough, barklike skin that hugs the wall, then extends onto the floor like a mat.""Several"" (1965), a hanging work of long, slightly curvy, phallic sausages in shiny gray, has an appealing wimpy dejectedness. I can't, however, warm up to ""Aught"" (1968), four large, wrinkly, ruglike rectangles in dull yellow latex and filler over canvas, hung flat on the wall in serial repetition.For the show, the museum has removed the carpeting in its ground-floor galleries to reveal concrete painted light-gray, giving a sense of Ms. Hesse's working studio. The change should be made permanent; it looks great and puts the viewer in better touch with the vitality of Ms. Hesse's creations.As might be expected, the Drawing Center's show, co-produced with the Menil Collection in Houston by Ms. Sussman and Catherine de Zegher, the former executive director of the Drawing Center, deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper. They range from rough sketches or notes to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished pieces that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too.From the early 60's there are lively color drawings whose fanciful components — childlike squiggles, doodles and bizarre shapes dancing over spacey fields — show a wide but still unfocused vocabulary. Ms. Hesse quickly came to regard her excursions in color, however, as dumb and uninteresting. She recognized that her style and inclinations were toward achromatism.Her more restrained and restricted-palette drawings of 1965 to '68, many with circular themes, in shades of black, white and gray, relate to parts of the body, like ""Ingeminate"" (1965), a dimensional drawing of two sausage-shaped objects wrapped in black cord and connected by a shiny black length of tubing. Some beautifully shaded drawings of series of breastlike circles, concentric and otherwise, from this period resemble several at the Jewish Museum.A breakthrough for Ms. Hesse came in the mid-60's, when, on a lengthy stay in Germany with the sculptor Tom Doyle, her husband at the time, she began to explore line in two and three dimensions, like ""Tomorrow's Apples (5 in White)"" of 1965, a relief drawing in which five wrapped cords in different colors are plugged into a drawing of abstract white relief areas. In ""Metronomic Irregularity III"" of 1966, a wall-mounted green board bears three square separated wooden slabs, each with holes bored in it. Green cotton-covered wires emerge from the holes to flow across the board like drawn lines, giving the effect of flowing water, an apt analogy for the freshness of her work.At the Jewish Museum, a welcome innovation is its decision, for the first time, to open on Saturdays (except for the holiday of Shavuot on June 3), from 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., at least until the show ends on Sept. 17. What's more, Saturday admission will be free, although the shops and cafe will be closed, and audio guides unavailable. The new hours are on a trial basis, a spokesman said. Let's hope they become permanent.'"
"'06-05-12,'0','""It's pretty clear that people have been really rattled by it,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ""The big question is how much of an impact has it had on spending?""The International Energy Agency said today that demand for oil would grow by 1.25 million barrels a day, down from its forecast of 1.47 million barrels a day earlier. It said that while growth this year would still outstrip growth from last year, it would be depressed by high prices.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's trade report indicates that Americans' appetite for imports, particularly of oil and other fuels, slackened somewhat in March.Overall, the nation imported $62 billion more than it exported in March, a 5.5 percent decline from the February deficit of $65.6 billion. It was the lowest trade gap since August but was still considerably bigger than the $53.7 billion gap in March 2005. Analysts had expected the deficit to balloon to $67 billion, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.Imports of petroleum-based products fell 8.3 percent, to $22.5 billion, in March, while exports of those products increased by 46 percent, to $964 million.The drop in imports could be a reflection of a brief but sharp decline in the price of oil futures contracts in February, said Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at MG Financial Group.""I don't think we should take any comfort considering the pricing developments, which were positive then but deteriorated thereafter,"" Mr. Laidi said.In January the trade deficit hit $68.6 billion, the highest for any single month on record. Last year the nation's trade gap reached the highest level ever, $726 billion.The trade gap with China, which has become even more politically sensitive than usual this year as the midterm elections approach, widened 13 percent, to $15.6 billion. While imports from China rose 15 percent, exports to the country also jumped 21 percent in March. China reported that its trade surplus with the rest of the world widened to $10.5 billion in April.On Wednesday, the Treasury Department criticized China for not allowing its currency, the yuan, to float more freely against other currencies but declined to label China a currency manipulator as many Democratic and Republican lawmakers had wanted.Following the trade report today, the dollar fell to its lowest level against the euro and British pound in a year. The Japanese yen also strengthened against the dollar.Exports of consumer goods like televisions, household goods and music also rose in March. Exports of automobiles declined.'"
"'06-05-12,'0','The wave of high-tech voting machines was prompted by the 2000 election in Florida, which spotlighted the problems of old-fashioned punch card ballots. But the machines that soon followed have spurred division. Here in Chicago, where voters used both touch-screen and optical-scan systems in a March primary, it took officials a week to tally all the votes because of technical problems and human errors, touching off a flurry of criticism over the Sequoia Voting Systems equipment.In Maryland this spring, the State House of Delegates passed a bill that would have scrapped touch-screen machines, but the Senate last month took no action on the bill, effectively killing the idea.This week, Voter Action, a nonprofit group, assisted voters in Arizona in filing for a legal injunction to try to block the state from buying touch-screen electronic voting systems. The suit is among several the group says it has pursued, in states including California, New York and New Mexico.The new concerns about Diebold's equipment were discovered by Harri Hursti, a Finnish computer expert who was working at the request of Black Box Voting Inc., a nonprofit group that has been critical of electronic voting in the past. The group issued a report on the findings on Thursday.Computer scientists who have studied the vulnerability say the flaw might allow someone with brief access to a voting machine and with knowledge of computer code to tamper with the machine's software, and even, potentially, to spread malicious code to other parts of the voting system.As word of Mr. Hursti's findings spread, Diebold issued a warning to recipients of thousands of its machines, saying that it had found a ""theoretical security vulnerability"" that ""could potentially allow unauthorized software to be loaded onto the system.""The company's letter went on: ""The probability for exploiting this vulnerability to install unauthorized software that could affect an election is considered low.""David Bear, a spokesman for Diebold Election Systems, said the potential risk existed because the company's technicians had intentionally built the machines in such a way that election officials would be able to update their systems in years ahead.""For there to be a problem here, you're basically assuming a premise where you have some evil and nefarious election officials who would sneak in and introduce a piece of software,"" he said. ""I don't believe these evil elections people exist.""Still, he said, the company will in the coming months solve the vulnerability, but not before most primary elections occur.In places where the machines are used, most election officials said they were not worried.""We're prepared for those types of problems,"" said Deborah Hench, the registrar of voters in San Joaquin County, Calif. ""There are always activists that are anti-electronic voting, and they're constantly trying to put pressure on us to change our system.""Aviel Rubin, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, did the first in-depth analysis of the security flaws in the source code for Diebold touch-screen machines in 2003. After studying the latest problem, he said: ""I almost had a heart attack. The implications of this are pretty astounding.""'"
"'06-05-12,'0','In a statement issued this week, the F.D.A. said that though it was still evaluating the data, ""we are recommending that consumers and prescribers follow current advice to carefully observe adults being treated with antidepressants for worsening of depression and for increased suicidal thinking and behavior."" The statement said, ""It is essential that patients taking Paxil do not suddenly stop taking their medication.""Last year, the agency asked psychiatric drug makers to review all their data on side effects in adults after a prolonged international debate over whether antidepressant drugs increase the risk of suicide in some children. Other companies have not yet reported their findings.""This is the first analysis to show a relationship between suicide attempts and one of the antidepressants"" since the F.D.A. required the warning label for children and adolescents, said Kelly Posner, an assistant professor in the department of child psychiatry at Columbia, who has helped the agency interpret bad reactions to antidepressants.Dr. Posner said the Glaxo findings should be treated with caution, because the antidepressant trials done to date were not designed to evaluate suicide risk.""It's not clear that the drug caused the behavior,"" she said.Glaxo sent out the warnings voluntarily, and its data still show that the drug's benefits outweigh the risks for people with depression, said Mary Anne Rhyne, a company spokeswoman.""We are now advising doctors to monitor all patients to make sure their symptoms don't worsen"" in the full course of treatment, Ms. Rhyne said.Previous research has suggested that the risk of suicidal thinking or behavior was highest in the first few weeks of treatment, or when people went off the medication. One large review of antidepressant trials, published last year in BMJ, a British medical journal, found that people taking Paxil and similar drugs like Prozac reported suicide attempts more often.But experts have debated the interpretation and value of these findings. In the Glaxo analysis, the researchers analyzed trials that included 8,958 people who took Paxil and 5,953 who received placebo pills. The study participants ranged in age from 18 to 64 years old and were taking the medication for depression or other disorders, like panic attacks and obsessive compulsive disorder.The analysis found that 11 of 3,455 people who were taking Paxil for depression reported an attempted suicide, compared with 1 in 1,978 taking placebo in the trials. Most were among adults ages 18 to 30, the company said.Over all, the analysis found no increased risk of suicidal behavior in adults over 30.""The new findings are not going to change my practice a lot, but I say, yes, they provide a reason to do even more careful monitoring of people on the medication,"" said Dr. George Simpson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.Dr. Simpson said the warning underscored the need for more careful tracking of side effects once drugs went on the market.""The current system of postmarketing surveillance is lousy,"" he said.'"
"'06-05-12,'0','The scheme ""not only corrupted securities markets but struck at the heart of our judicial system,"" Mr. Schonfeld said.Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference yesterday that having an inside informant on a grand jury showed grave contempt for the law.Mr. Smith, who is a letter carrier in Jersey City and who was a high school friend of Mr. Pajcin, was arrested at his home at 6 a.m. yesterday. He faces charges of insider trading and criminal contempt for breaking his grand jury oath of secrecy. The Securities and Exchange Commission amended its complaint in the case to add Mr. Smith as the 14th defendant. He was being held yesterday after bail was set at $3 million.Yesterday's arrest is just the latest development in a case that seems to get more bizarre with each new charge. Prosecutors say that through accounts in the names of the dancer, who was Mr. Pajcin's girlfriend, and his aunt in Croatia, Mr. Pajcin and other defendants sought to trade on insider information from a variety of sources.Their trades involved companies like Reebok, whose acquisition in 2005 by Adidas Salomon netted the ring more than $2 million through call options bought shortly before the deal closed.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan described Mr. Smith as the third source of inside tips for Mr. Plotkin's and Mr. Pajcin's scheme. Charges of feeding the two information have already been filed against Stanislav Shpigelman, a former Merrill Lynch analyst, and Juan Renteria and Nickolaus Shuster, who were both employees of a BusinessWeek printing plant in Wisconsin.Mr. Pajcin has been cooperating with federal authorities.Mr. Smith was a grand juror in Newark in late 2003 in a case examining whether Bristol-Myers Squibb was inflating its profits by inducing wholesalers to buy more drugs than they needed, a practice known as channel stuffing. Mr. Smith contacted Mr. Pajcin and Mr. Plotkin in late 2004 or early 2005, and the three discussed sharing in profits from trading in Bristol-Myers shares, according to the criminal complaint.Mr. Smith told Mr. Pajcin that a high-ranking Bristol-Myers executive testified multiple times before the grand jury, and that prompted Mr. Pajcin to sell short 2,000 shares of Bristol-Myers through the trading account of his aunt, Sonja Anticevic, the seamstress. A short sale is essentially a bet that a stock will fall. Mr. Pajcin also tipped two others, not named in the complaint, who also sold the stock short, prosecutors said.But the executive was not indicted when the grand jury handed up its decision on June 14, 2005. Mr. Pajcin and the other traders closed out their short positions a day before the results of the investigation were made public, prosecutors contend.If convicted on two charges of securities fraud and one charge of conspiracy, Mr. Smith would face as much as 45 years in prison. Mr. Smith also faces a contempt of court charge from federal prosecutors in New Jersey.Mr. Smith's lawyer, Frank Handelman, said, ""I'm glad bail was set, and I hope he gets out soon.""Mr. Smith may have been involved in the insider trading scheme in other ways. Prosecutors say they have a copy of a check for $7,000 that Mr. Smith made out to Mr. Pajcin to help finance the insider trading activity.After the S.E.C. began investigating Mr. Pajcin's trades, Mr. Pajcin fled to Cuba. According to the complaint, Mr. Smith met him there and delivered about $10,000 from Mr. Plotkin. Prosecutors said that Mr. Pajcin and Mr. Plotkin went to Mr. Smith's home and destroyed the laptop computers, hard drives and cellphones used in executing their trades.They said that in a recorded phone call on April 12, a day after prosecutors arrested Mr. Plotkin and Mr. Shpigelman, Mr. Pajcin, who has been in custody for months, told Mr. Smith that he was considering cooperating with regulators and advised him that he might tell the regulators about ""the jury thing.""'"
"'06-05-12,'0','The arrival of Mr. Goss in September 2004 led to immediate clashes between senior career officers and the Congressional staff members that Mr. Goss brought with him, some of whom had previously served at the agency. Mr. Goss's chief of staff, Patrick Murray, and the other top aides came to be known derisively as the Gosslings.The man Mr. Goss first selected to become the C.I.A.'s executive director, Michael V. Kostiw, had to turn down the job when it surfaced in the news media that he had resigned from the agency in the 1980's after being caught shoplifting bacon.It was finger-pointing over who leaked word of Mr. Kostiw's shoplifting arrest that led to the resignation of several top officials in the agency's clandestine service. Among those who left were Stephen R. Kappes, the deputy director of operations, and his deputy, Michael Sulick. Mr. Kappes is expected to return as the agency's No. 2 if Gen. Michael V. Hayden is confirmed as the new director.Days before Mr. Goss submitted his resignation, the C.I.A. director asked Mr. Foggo to step down as executive director, according to one intelligence official who was granted anonymity to speak freely about the circumstances of Mr. Foggo's departure. The official said that Mr. Goss had concluded that the inquires into Mr. Foggo's activities had become a distraction and had the potential to damage the agency's reputation.Mr. Foggo, 51, has admitted attending poker parties throughout the 1990's that Mr. Wilkes held in a suite at the Watergate Hotel in Washington. The parties were primarily attended by C.I.A. officials and congressmen, and Mr. Cunningham, a California Republican, occasionally attended. Several news media accounts have reported that prostitutes frequented the parties.But Charlie Wilson — the former Texas congressman who helped engineer the C.I.A. mission to arm Afghan rebels in the 1980's — said he attended two of Mr. Wilkes's poker parties, in 1994 and 1999, and that they usually ended by midnight and that he never saw prostitutes at the parties.Mr. Wilson said that the gatherings were small affairs of seven or eight card players that always had ample supplies of Scotch, beer and Dominican cigars. ""The only thing that took place there that was out of order was cigar smoking on a nonsmoking floor,"" Mr. Wilson said.Mr. Foggo was one of many C.I.A. officials close to Mr. Wilkes. In May 2000, Mr. Wilkes paid Brant G. Bassett, a retired German-speaking C.I.A. official known as Nine Fingers, a $5,000 fee to travel to Germany for five days as a consultant on a business deal that Mr. Wilkes was negotiating with a German software engineer, according to a former agency official aware of the arrangement. The official was granted anonymity to speak about the business deal.Documents revealing the $5,000 payment to Mr. Bassett from Mr. Wilkes first appeared on the Internet on Tuesday.Mr. Foggo introduced Mr. Bassett to Mr. Wilkes in the early 1990's in Mexico City, the former official said.Before ascending to the top tier of the agency, Mr. Foggo had spent his career in what was previously known as the directorate of administration, now called the directorate of support. It is responsible for running the business side of the agency, and its duties include buying supplies, renting offices and handling bookkeeping.Before being picked by Mr. Goss to become executive director, Mr. Foggo ran a secret C.I.A. base in Frankfurt that supported operations in the Middle East and Africa. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, as agency operations have expanded in the region, the volume of money and goods handled by the Frankfurt base has grown rapidly, intelligence officials say.According to Mr. Foggo's lawyer, William G. Hundley, the C.I.A. is investigating whether during Mr. Foggo's time in Frankfurt he knowingly granted a contract to Archer Logistics, a Virginia company headed by a relative of Mr. Wilkes. Mr. Hundley said the contract was for delivery of bottled water to C.I.A. operatives in Iraq.The lawyer said that while it was possible that his client had signed off on the contract, Mr. Foggo had no idea that Archer Logistics was associated with Mr. Wilkes.'"
"'06-05-12,'0','TRENTON, May 11 (AP) — Merck & Company said on Thursday that Vioxx users who were in the study that led to the drug's being pulled from the market were not at increased risk of heart attack or stroke in the year after stopping the drug.Merck said data from a ""preliminary safety analysis"" of an additional year of patient follow-up, part of the study's original plan, did not show a statistically significant difference in the rate of heart attacks and strokes among patients who had been on Vioxx and those who had taken a placebo.That means the differences over that year could have been a result of chance.However, there was a higher rate of complications, mainly strokes, among those taking Vioxx over all four years covered in the new data: the original three years of the study and the follow-up year after patients were taken off the medicine.Merck's general counsel, Kenneth Frazier, said the results would not change Merck's strategy of fighting, one by one, the many lawsuits filed by former Vioxx users and their families who are blaming the drug for heart attacks, strokes and deaths.""We believe that the data don't provide for a claim for a patient who had an event after they stopped taking their medicine,"" Mr. Frazier said.'"
"'06-05-12,'0','Even shares in Pakistan, the Philippines and Vietnam are soaring.But the most surprising jump has come in China, where share prices had fallen by as much as 55 percent from their highs in 2001, despite the country's sizzling economic growth.""We're awash in liquidity,"" says Jing Ulrich, chairman of China equities at J. P. Morgan. ""Since I started covering China in the early 1990's, I've never seen this level of interest.""Now, some market analysts say the rally could encourage a wave of mergers and acquisitions in China and also set the stage for more important changes to China's primitive capital markets.Regulators announced here Monday that they would end a yearlong moratorium on new stock listings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, where over 1,400 state-owned companies are listed.And while many analysts cautioned this week that stock prices here could sink again, several experts said there were signs the market could rise even more.""In China, bank deposits equal 160 percent of G.D.P.,"" says Ms. Ulrich at J. P. Morgan.""That's $3.6 trillion in the bank,"" she added. ""Imagine if there was an equity culture here and investors put just 1 percent of that money into the stock market.""That would require a startling turnaround in attitudes among investors who have long held suspicions that listed companies engage in insider trading, cook the books or fabricate financial statements.The plunging market has been devastating for millions of Chinese investors, some of whom plowed their life savings into a market created only in the late 1980's. Some small investors have been furious with the government as their savings evaporated. One man protested by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself on fire outside the offices of regulators in Beijing.The Chinese government has moved aggressively in recent years to restore confidence in the market.It has introduced dozens of changes meant to support prices, including allowing more foreign money to come into the stock market and announcing new financial reporting standards.Market sentiment has been so bearish over the last few years that even the country's major banks have turned to Hong Kong to list their shares.Analysts say this crippled the capital markets and made it more difficult for state-owned companies to borrow, forcing them to turn to the state-owned banks.""Last year 99 percent of the financing came from banks and one percent from stocks and bonds, and that is a very unhealthy way of financing,"" said Michael Pettis, an associate professor of finance at Beijing University.Still, some analysts insist that China's stock market was overvalued even when it hit rock bottom last year.But financial experts say the more serious problem is that the market needs structural reforms to lure a wider base of investors, attracting more long-term investors and fewer speculators.Foreign investors are being allowed to invest more and more in the Chinese stock market. And that may have helped lure Chinese investors back in for the current rally.""I think there's still a lot of Chinese sitting on the sidelines waiting to jump in,"" says Chang Chun, a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. ""But that could also create another bubble.""Mr. Pettis at Beijing University said he believed that the present rally was mostly speculative. Until significant structural changes occur, he predicted, speculators will drive the Chinese market.""We've seen this before,"" he said, noting that the Japanese stock market rallied consistently after it began its steep decline at the end of the 1980's, only to fall even more sharply the next time around. ""If this turns out to be a false rally,"" he said, ""This wouldn't be the first time.""'"
"'06-05-12,'0','There has been research trying to determine if new managers outperformed more established ones. Some studies conclude that new managers outperform their established peers in their first three years, or at least beat those managers included in the indexes used to measure the industry. (The indexes, however, rarely include the investing giants.)This creates built-in tensions for hedge fund investors: how to evaluate properly a manager with little or no track record.Complicating the picture is the lure of fees. Hedge fund managers are always quick to point out that mutual funds are principally paid to gather assets because they receive a paltry percentage of the assets under management. Hedge funds, they would argue, are paid — and paid extremely well — for performance.This is, of course, only half-true. Because hedge funds can command 2 percent of assets as a management fee and 20 percent of profits these days, gathering large pools of assets translates into steady, hefty compensation. Hedge fund investors run the risk of managers' becoming more interested in not losing fee-generating money than making pots of it on risky, and potentially profitable, investment ideas.At the MAR/Hedge conference, a panelist who invests in the funds of emerging managers said that he had seen a successful team of managers self-destruct not because of investment ideas but because they were preoccupied with ""empire building"" rather than investing.That was not the norm, according to the Mayer & Hoffman research.According to the study, the class of 2003, or the 167 managers measured on an equal-weighted basis, returned 11.39 percent in 2004, compared with the MSCI equal-weighted index, at 6.55 percent, and the Credit Suisse/Tremont investable index, at 5.31 percent.In 2005, again on an equal-weighted basis, they delivered returns of 9.55 percent, compared with 8.20 percent for the MSCI hedge fund index and 3.60 percent for the Credit Suisse/Tremont index.Skeptics will point out that not all new managers survive, creating a bias toward the returns of those who do. Hedge fund investing, among the most Darwinian of investment disciplines, is at its core a simple science: perform well and assets flood in; perform poorly, investors redeem their money and if enough is redeemed, the fund closes. It is generally accepted that the average hedge fund life is only 2.7 years.According to the Mayer & Hoffman study, 2 of the 167 funds closed at the end of 2004 and by the end of 2005, 12 more had shut down. The total failure rate was 8.4 percent, mirroring the business's median attrition rate for the year of 8.1 percent, according to four hedge fund indexes.Of course, if everyone bets on the new kids, the funds will grow wildly, and any performance as a result of size will be whittled out. There have been an unusually high number of hedge funds starting off with more than $1 billion, begging the question of how new managers are going to learn to manage a business while immediately having to run a huge portfolio.Fortunately, not all the investors are the same. Pension funds who may want less risk and high single-digit returns can gravitate toward more institutional businesses whose return outlooks may not be what they were when the managers' portfolios were smaller and nimbler. These investors may be more focused on minimizing risk in a portfolio than maximizing returns.But for those seeking big returns, they can gamble on the new managers. After all, the hedge fund universe used to be dominated by big egos, big bets and big returns. Let's see if the new egos can take their place.'"

As interest rates have crept higher recently, mortgage applications have declined.NOW WHAT? As expected, the Federal Reserve raised the short-term interest rate target by a quarter percentage point. But in explaining why, the Fed left many investors wondering what comes next.Investors had expected that the Fed, after raising its benchmark rate to 5 percent from 4.75, would signal a pause in the current cycle of tighter credit, which began in 2004.But, in a statement, the Fed said ""further policy firming may yet be needed"" to curb inflation. It added that ""the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.""Some of that information will arrive next week, when the Labor Department updates the monthly Producer Price Index on Tuesday and the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday.THE GAME GAME A year late and $100 short. That is how some analysts saw Sony's announcement that it would begin selling its next-generation video game console, PlayStation 3, on Nov. 17, for $499. A souped-up model with more memory will cost $599.They said the timing and price would put it at a disadvantage to Microsoft, which introduced its Xbox 360 console last year, charging $299 for a basic set and $399 for an upgraded model. Microsoft has already sold 10 million Xbox 360's.Even at the higher price, Sony will probably sell its new PlayStations at a loss, analysts said, because it comes with a high-definition DVD format called Blu-ray. Sony, however, is eager to take the loss — which may be offset by license fees from game makers — to establish Blu-ray as a popular high-definition DVD format. A rival, Toshiba, is preparing a different, competing format.PlayStation 3 consoles will sell out when introduced because the brand has a loyal following, analysts said. But they added that Sony may have to cut the price eventually to reach a broader audience.STIFF FINE A federal judge fined Henry C.

It defined them as performance bonuses and profits from stock sales.Part of the money will be used to reimburse investors in Gemstar, which publishes TV Guide and operates onscreen channel guides for cable companies.

"'06-05-13,'0','At the same time, another report, from the Commerce Department, said the nation's trade deficit narrowed in March as the country spent less on petroleum imports and exported more raw materials and industrial equipment.Despite the signs of more modest growth, continued fears of inflation sent stocks and bonds broadly lower for the second consecutive day: The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.68 points, or 1.12 percent, to 1,291.24, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.19 percent today from 5.15 percent late Thursday evening.Gasoline prices have topped $3 a gallon in many parts of the country after a resurgence that has pushed oil prices past $70 a barrel, partly on concerns that any disruption to a tight market could create a supply shortage. Such concerns have been fueled in part by the diplomatic standoff with Iran over its nuclear program and supply disruptions in Nigeria, where an oil pipeline explosion killed up to 200 people yesterday.But economists note that for all the worries over gasoline, expressions of lower consumer confidence often do not translate into weaker overall spending. That may be particularly true when incomes are rising and jobs are plentiful, as they appear to be today.Consumers are finding creative ways to cope with higher gasoline costs. Ross Edwards, a corporate project manager from Pittsburgh, said his family's gasoline cost has doubled in the last year, prompting his wife, Toni, and him to take a chartered company bus to New York this weekend, instead of driving. The couple also found other ways to cut spending while in the city.""We're not eating at the expensive restaurants anymore,"" he said. ""It's more Red Lobsters, Friday's and Olive Gardens. We're staying away from the restaurants with white tablecloths.""There are other signs that higher fuel prices are starting to alter behavior. In a report also released Friday, the International Energy Agency said rising energy prices appear to have damped demand for oil globally.The agency, which advises its 26-member countries on energy policy, lowered its forecast for growth in global oil demand to 1.25 million barrels a day from an earlier forecast of 1.47 million. The change was largely based on lower oil demand in the United States and warmer weather in developed countries.The price for petroleum imports to the United States jumped 11.5 percent in April, according to a Labor Department report. Prices for all imports increased by 2.1 percent and were flat for nonpetroleum imports.""There is some change in demand because of price,"" said John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, ""but it's still relatively modest.""The revised I.E.A. forecast sent crude oil prices down $1.28, or 1.8 percent, to $72.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.As for the overall trade picture, the United States imported $62 billion more than it exported in March, a 5.5 percent decline from the February deficit of $65.6 billion. It was the lowest trade gap since August but was still considerably bigger than the $53.7 billion gap in March 2005. Analysts had expected the deficit to balloon to $67 billion, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.Imports of petroleum-based products fell 8.3 percent, to $22.5 billion, in March, while exports of those products rose 46 percent, to $964 million. The drop in imports could reflect a brief but sharp decline in the price of oil futures contracts in February, said Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at the MG Financial Group.""I don't think we should take any comfort considering the pricing developments, which were positive then but deteriorated thereafter,"" he said.Investors are wary about reports on the wholesale and consumer prices that will be released next week, fearing they may point to higher inflation.By this time in a Fed tightening cycle, ""usually the market goes down because investors worry the Fed has gone too far,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's Equity Research. ""In this case, the market is worrying that the Fed may have to go even further and throw us even closer to a dramatic slowdown.""The Dow Jones industrial average fell 119.74 points, or 1 percent, to 11,380.99, after dropping 141.92 points on Thursday. It was the first time since June 2005 that the Dow, which was just 80 points away from its record high earlier in the week, has fallen more than 100 points for each of two consecutive days.The dollar also fell to its lowest level in a year against the euro and British pound yesterday and lost less ground against the Japanese yen.The politically sensitive trade gap with China widened 13 percent, to $15.6 billion. While imports from China rose 15 percent, exports to the country also jumped 21 percent in March. China reported that its trade surplus with the rest of the world widened to $10.5 billion in April.'"
"'06-05-13,'0','In the landmark federal suit against Microsoft, which ended in 2001, the company was found to have repeatedly violated antitrust laws by bullying computer makers to give preferred placement to Microsoft's browser and shun Netscape.No such tactics are involved this time. Sometimes, the automatic, or default, is set to non-Microsoft search engines like Google or Yahoo, if the user has downloaded desktop software from those companies.The Microsoft design, the government and states found, gives personal computer makers and users choice in search services, and thus raises no antitrust issue. ""Plaintiffs have concluded their work on this matter,"" the filing stated.Google replied yesterday that its main concern had been making it easy for users to choose easily between competing search engines. While user choice raises competition issues, and Google talked to antitrust officials, it never filed a complaint or a suit, a spokesman said.""Changing the search engine may be simple by Microsoft's standards,"" Google said in a statement. ""But if it were truly simple, users would be able to change the default with one click.""""Microsoft could have easily designed it that way,"" the Google statement added. ""Instead, they've built it so users have to go through multiple steps to choose a search engine.""The conclusion about the search box issue by the Justice Department and the states came in a periodic status review of Microsoft's compliance with the consent decree. Most of the document described a two-year extension of parts of the decree, through November 2009.The extension focuses on provisions for Microsoft licensing and publishing technical information so competing server software can work seamlessly with the Windows desktop operating system.Other software companies have repeatedly complained about the complexity — and uselessness — of the technical information Microsoft has provided in the past.To address the complaints, Microsoft recently put a top engineering executive, Robert Muglia, a senior vice president, in charge of the program.The Justice Department said the extension of parts of the consent decree and the placing of a senior Microsoft executive in charge were important steps.Bill Lockyer, the attorney general of California, said that Microsoft had ""fallen short"" in compliance with the consent decree. But Mr. Lockyer added, ""To its credit, the company has acknowledged that failure, agreed to go back to the drawing board and accepted this extension.""The issue of competing server software being able to work seamlessly with the Windows desktop operating system is regarded as crucial to future competition. Microsoft has become a large supplier of server software, competing with companies like I.B.M., Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Red Hat.Antitrust officials in the United States and Europe want to ensure that Microsoft does not use its desktop monopoly to give it an unfair advantage in the server market.'"
"'06-05-13,'0','MEXICO CITY, May 12 — The Mexican media company Grupo Televisa said on Friday that it planned to bid for the Spanish-language broadcaster Univision along with five private investment firms, including one owned by the chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates.Univision, which is based in Los Angeles, is the leading media company in the United States aimed at the fast-growing Hispanic market. It put itself up for auction in February.Televisa, the world's largest Spanish-language media company, provides most of the network's prime-time programming.Although Televisa already owns 10.9 percent of Univision, the company's chairman, Emilio Azcárraga Jean, has been outspoken about his desire to own more.But United States regulations limit foreign ownership of a broadcaster to 25 percent.

""There isn't any search and rescue to be done. What we usually would do is just to ensure that injured people are taken to hospitals as quickly as possible and the dead are, well, taken to the nearest mortuary.""Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is the world's seventh-largest exporter of petroleum and the fifth-largest supplier to the United States. More than 90 percent of Nigeria's national income comes from oil earnings.""Bunkering,"" a local term for oil or gasoline theft, is common in the swampy Niger Delta, where the thieves use barges and tankers to transport petroleum products to sell.More than 60 people died in a similar inferno last year in Ilado, a short distance from the site of Friday's explosion. The pipeline at Inagbe belonged to the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.The corporation pumps refined petroleum products across long distances using a network of pipelines, many of which pass through villages or farms and often are barely buried beneath the surface. The pipes are usually easy targets for thieves, many of whom are impoverished.""We are calling on Nigerians to respect our pipelines' right of way,"" Livi Ajuonoma, a spokesman for the company, said in a telephone interview in Abuja, adding that ""the vandalized pipeline has already been repaired and will therefore not affect domestic supply"" of gasoline.He said the blast had occurred while the company was pumping gasoline from its Atlas Cove depot in the outskirts of Lagos.Oil pipeline explosions are not new to Nigeria. At least 1,000 people died in a similar explosion in the town of Jesse in the country's southeast in 1998.'"
"'06-05-13,'0','The fire, which leveled at least 10 buildings in the Greenpoint Terminal Market, attracted attention not just for its size and what was destroyed, but also because of the history of, and plans for, the complex.The buildings, which were bought by a developer, Joshua Guttman, in 2001, were at the center of a failed real estate deal last year.Neighborhood groups and preservationists also had an interest in the complex, which was scheduled to be demolished to make way for high-rise apartment buildings.Reflecting the high-profile nature of the fire, officials announced yesterday that they had formed a joint task force to investigate the fire. The group included members of the Police and Fire Departments, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and marshals from the state's Office of Fire Prevention and Control.This week, construction crews working for the owner, Mr. Guttman, quickly erected a fence around most of the site.Soon after the fire, the city's Department of Environmental Protection ordered Mr. Guttman to secure the site at all times.The developer has attracted some scrutiny in the days since the blaze, as a history of other fires at some of the dozens of properties he owns throughout the city has emerged, from records culled by the fire marshals. At least four of those fires were ruled arson. Mr. Guttman, through his lawyers, has said he had nothing to do with any of the fires.The building the fire marshals have focused on, on the northwest corner of the complex, was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived. Because there was no electricity flowing to that building, which was believed to be vacant, fire officials called the fire suspicious.That was the building that Bucca toured yesterday morning, sniffing through the bricks and wood for a whiff of residue that is left by ignitable liquids.The dog, who is named for Ronald Bucca, a fire marshal who died on Sept. 11, 2001, lives in Albany, and travels around the state helping with fire investigations, said Larry Sombke, a spokesman for the State Office of Fire Prevention.Yesterday afternoon, after a week of occasionally frenzied activity around the destroyed buildings, the work seemed to slow down. In a white van marked K-9 Unit, Bucca and his handlers drove away.'"

"'06-05-13,'0','""Has there been any moment you thought the United States might not withstand the forces of those who were tearing it apart?"" Mr. Moyers asks.""In the year after Pearl Harbor,"" Mr. Heffner answers. With all the losses sustained, he said, the question was, ""Can we do this in time?""In the broadcast, Mr. Moyers also turns to the state of the news media today, which many characterize as a time of the rise of mega media corporations, spin control and ill-tempered sound bites replacing conversation. ""Why do we stand for it?"" Mr. Moyers asks.""I think, in a sense, we're too fat and sassy,"" Mr. Heffner says of the failures of the Fourth Estate and of ordinary citizens. ""We're too busy with material things.""With its origins in a more civil era of television, ""The Open Mind"" sought not to engage in polemical fireworks but to expose ideas, Mr. Heffner said in a recent interview in his cluttered Park Avenue office. The show, he said, has done just that for almost 1,200 programs.""The Open Mind"" was first broadcast on the NBC station in New York. At the time, Mr. Heffner was teaching American history and political science at Rutgers, where he had been since 1948. ""I realized,"" he said, ""there are other ways to teach, to reach people, with ideas and information. The media could be used.""A truly open mind is never over-rehearsed, said Mr. Heffner, an elegant man with a relaxed demeanor. ""The important thing is to let the guest provide the lead. My idea is to let them put their best foot forward, intellectually."" That has meant never relying on a list of questions, but meandering through ideas.With ""The Open Mind"" up and running, and with experience in other jobs in radio and television, Mr. Heffner, in 1961, helped establish Channel 13 in New York City (then known as WNDT) and was its first general manager. ""The Open Mind"" remained on the NBC station (but was seen on WGBH in Boston, too) and moved to Channel 13 in 1966.Mr. Heffner has also written or edited three books, including ""A Documentary History of the United States""; written book reviews and commentary; and lectured on history and communications. The book ""As They Saw It: 50 Years of Conversations from 'The Open Mind' "" includes excerpts from some of the interviews in the series. The book received some criticism by some reviewers for not including enough people in the fields of science and the arts.""In some ways, this simple, sweet program is profound,"" said William F. Baker, chief executive of the Educational Broadcasting Company, the licensee of WNET, Channel 13, and WLIW, Channel 21. ""It takes us back to a time when television was simpler and in some ways better. It shows that real intelligence and honesty and human contact does work.""Mostly, Mr. Heffner said, it all worked because he talked with passionate and powerful people. Among his favorites have been Norman Cousins; Mr. Cuomo (""one of the smartest, with the best sense of humor""); Mr. Helms (""He talked about meeting Hitler""); and Malcolm X. (""There was something so charismatic about Malcolm""). He considers Mr. Moyers ""splendid.""Forget about retirement plans. Mr. Heffner's latest project is with Teachers College at Columbia University and propels ""The Open Mind"" into the digital age. Dozens of the conversations are available on a pilot Web site at www.theopenmind.tv, so anyone can download the show and its transcript. Mr. Heffner said his one caveat was that the project (which needs to raise about $460,000 to add a thousand more conversations) be a free, nonprofit endeavor.""Think of it 100 years from now — there it is,"" Mr. Heffner said. This summer ""The Open Mind"" will also rebroadcast some of what he calls the ""golden oldies"" to commemorate the anniversary.""I realize how lucky I've been,"" Mr. Heffner said. ""I deal with fascinating people who have fascinating ideas. I think I've made it this long because I've been so stimulated. This has been a lifesaver.""'"
"'06-05-13,'0','GREENWICH, Conn., May 12 (AP) — A driver who has been heavily scrutinized by the police in the death of a millionaire developer has lost his job, his lawyer said on Friday.The driver, Carlos Trujillo, was fired recently from his job at the Stamford Tent Company, said the lawyer, Lindy R. Urso. ""I think it's a testament to the fact that the presumption of innocence really only exists on paper in this country,"" Mr. Urso said.Mr. Trujillo, who was a driver and personal assistant to the developer, Andrew M.

No one has been charged in Mr. Kissel's death.Mr. Trujillo has been interviewed several times by the police and has given the authorities DNA, fingerprints and personal documents, Mr. Urso has said. He also took a lie detector test, and the authorities searched Mr. Trujillo's storage bin.'"
"'06-05-13,'0','Like others in his party, Mr. Reid said he was disposed toward supporting General Hayden for the job, citing his professional credentials and reputation. At a private luncheon on Thursday to discuss the handling of Iraq intelligence, two former senior C.I.A. officials offered a favorable view of General Hayden, lawmakers said.But leading Democrats said that his confirmation hearing could evolve into a proxy for questioning the legal foundation of the extensive surveillance programs established by the administration and that General Hayden's handling of the issue would have a bearing on his fate in the Senate.""My inclination had been to support him,"" said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ""From the internal reports you get, he is a man of integrity who has fought for the independence of intelligence agencies. But it will be a test of his independence whether he is able to answer some of these questions.""Initially, Republicans believed they would have the political upper hand if the hearings centered on a warrantless eavesdropping program that they have defended as a narrow effort to isolate calls between people in the United States and suspects overseas. But this week's revelations about N.S.A. efforts to collect data on nearly all domestic telephone calls have added a volatile new element to the Hayden hearings. Even Republicans say the program needs to be explained.""I think this issue needs to be clearly aired,"" said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who is a member of the Intelligence Committee, after a Friday session with General Hayden.Other Republicans say Democrats still risk raising questions about their own national security priorities if they push too hard on the surveillance programs. ""It could hurt them if they go too far,"" Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said about the Democrats.Republicans were able to effectively turn national security issues against the Democrats in the 2002 and 2004 elections. A Congressional fight over the creation of the Department of Homeland Security contributed to Republican gains in the Senate in 2002, and Mr. Bush and Congressional Republicans portrayed themselves as stronger on terrorism in 2004.But Democrats say that sharply declining support for the war in Iraq and Republican political miscalculations like the administration's initial support for turning over some United States port operations to a Dubai company have cut into the historical Republican strength on security issues. At the same time, Mr. Bush's own standing on the handling of the campaign against terrorism has dropped significantly.Still, Democrats are being extremely careful in their comments on the surveillance. Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who was defeated by Mr. Bush in 2004, said Friday that he was not ready to declare the newly disclosed collection of phone records illegal.""It may be that they are doing this in a way that is manageable,"" Mr. Kerry said. ""I don't know the answer to that yet.""Mr. Hayden's own role as a leading defender of the National Security Agency's surveillance efforts is drawing scrutiny from at least one Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. Mr. Wyden, who also met Friday with General Hayden, said he had so far been unable to reconcile the general's previous statements on the narrow scope of the eavesdropping with the reports about the mass collection of domestic telephone records.""The issues that I have go to the general's credibility,"" Mr. Wyden said, adding that he expected Republicans to try to turn the confirmation hearings into a referendum on who is against terrorism.Mr. Reid, the Democratic leader, agreed that Republicans might try to use the hearings and the focus on the surveillance programs to regain momentum on security issues. He said that Democrats would approach the nomination with an open mind but that they would not sell Republicans short when it came to political tactics.""They have taken us to the cleaners twice,"" he said, referring to the last two election cycles. ""I am certainly not going to underestimate their abilities. We have to keep our eyes on the prize.""'"
"'06-05-13,'0','To be good, choreographers need personality. They can have talent and a career sense and a dogged work ethic, but without personality or individuality or style, they sink into anonymity. Chris Elam doesn't sink; his dances burst with distinctiveness.The ""Throw People"" double bill of premieres by his Misnomer Dance Theater, which opened a four-day run Thursday at Performance Space 122, most definitely holds your attention. Mr. Elam — already recognized through awards, good reviews, a classy advisory board for his company and a residency from the Joyce Theater Foundation, where this program was developed — is a talent, no doubt about it.""Throw People,"" the program, consists of two roughly 25-minute halves: ""Land Flat"" and ""Throw People,"" the dance. ""Land Flat"" is a mysteriously diverse and affecting recorded collage, even if the credits seem vague, incomplete and inaccurate. (The Belgian violinist Arthur Grumiaux is referred to as ""Arthur Grumineux."")It enlists four women: Brynne Billingsley, Jennifer Harmer, Dorian Nuskind-Oder and the hard-working Coco Karol, who is also in ""Throw People."" They wear mismatched dresses, some simple, some Victorian-ornate (costumes by Heather McArdle).The four dance, separately and together; hard to describe, beyond that. They are good at controlled, quasi-balletic poses, and sometimes one supports or outlines or caresses the outstretched limb of another. They bow and bend and even bark. There is perhaps an Asian influence, though that may be an assumption drawn from Mr. Elam's biography, since he has studied in Turkey and Indonesia.What makes dance so wonderfully compelling is how one such assemblage of movements can seem meaningless, and another full of ritualistic intent. ""Land Flat"" falls firmly on the ritualistic side of the line.'"
"'06-05-13,'0','Making a choice between expensive health care for a pet or ending the life of that animal companion is never easy. Wallace Sife, who as founder of the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement has counseled hundreds of guilt-racked pet owners, said, ""There is no right answer.""Mr. Sife, a Brooklyn psychologist, has also counseled people who have gone deeply into debt to care for a pet and he has concluded, ""It is purely a subjective gut call, but there is nothing wrong in thinking about the money.""There is no hard and fast advice on what to do when a pet needs expensive care. It doesn't appear, however, that pet insurance is the financial cure, though it may end up making the emotional decision a little easier.Veterinary care is not a trivial expense. Americans will spend about $9.4 billion this year on the health of their pets, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association. Those bills are rising about 9 percent a year, almost three times the rate of inflation.While pet health care costs aren't as high as those for humans, bills can add up. Ten days of dialysis treatment can reach $12,000 and cancer treatment is as much as $40,000.Those are unusual circumstances and most people figure they will never have to pay that much. Pet owners, though, often underestimate what they spend on their animals. James F. Wilson, a veterinarian based in Yardley, Pa., who often testifies in court on the value of an animal, said research completed this year puts the average lifetime cost of a medium-size dog at $10,400. A small dog will cost slightly less and a large one slightly more. Caring for a cat will cost an average of about $10,600.Dr. Wilson took his calculations a step further. He found that among people who have a strong bond with their pet — did you know 5.8 million pet owners celebrate their pets' birthdays? — the expenses more than double. For instance, he found dog owners spend more on treats than on food. He said that the cost of caring for a medium-size dog can go as high as $100,000 for those who make man's best friend their best friend.He estimated that almost 40 percent of the cost of raising a medium-size dog went to health care. The percentage was slightly higher for big dogs; for a small dog, the health care costs were 33 percent. Health care costs for a cat approach a quarter of total expenses. ""The amazing thing is that not one of the people had a clue that this is what they are spending,"" Dr. Wilson said of the pet owners in his informal survey.This, he said, is evidence that owners need to insure their pets. ""Stop thinking of it as a $500 dog, but as a $50,000 investment,"" he said.But most pets are not investments. In purely economic terms, a pet is usually not worth thousands of dollars unless it is a rare show animal used in a lucrative breeding program or a highly trained working dog, like one, for instance, that assists the blind or the deaf. All the kibble, toys and vaccinations are not investments. They are what businesspeople call sunk costs. Whatever decision you face is made independently of what you have already spent.Is pet insurance any more defensible as a money saver? Probably not. A policy on a 2-year-old cat offered by VPI Pet Insurance, the nation's largest provider, carried a premium of $28.75 a month, or $345 a year.If the cat lives 18 years (not uncommon), 16 years of payments would add up to $5,136, or just about equal to what Dr. Wilson estimated as the high end of out-of-pocket health care costs for a cat.There are other costs with the insurance, like a co-pay of $50 for every office visit. Statistics show that the average cat makes 2.3 visits to the vet a year, so add in $115 a year, or $1,840, over the cat's lifespan. VPI estimates that its standard policy. covers 40 percent to 80 percent of the cost of a procedure — $94 for treatment of a urinary tract infection, for example, $165 to treat for multiple lacerations and $840 for a pacemaker.Though pet insurance is more popular in parts of Europe, Americans may have figured out it isn't worth the expense. VPI, which has Procter & Gamble as an investor, has been selling pet policies since 1982; with 369,000 active policies, it says it has about 80 percent of the market. (The other two insurance providers are Petcare and Petshealth.) That's less than 1 percent of the 90.5 million cats and 73.9 million dogs owned by Americans.Don't turn to veterinarians for an easy answer. ""Our profession is split on the issue,"" said Robert Mason, a Kokomo, Ind., veterinarian. Dr. Mason's own view is that insurance allows vets to charge more. ""If you don't care what I can charge you, I can charge you more.""Dr. Wilson characterizes it differently. ""The wonderful part about pet insurance,"" he said, ""is that I get to practice medicine.""He said pet owners have the wrong attitude about health insurance. ""The biggest problem today is that they want to see a return on investment. That's not why you buy car insurance, hoping to have an accident,"" Dr. Wilson said. ""They don't see it as peace of mind.""At the risk of inspiring a lot of angry letters, it has to be said: It's only a cat. Or a dog. (A personal note: I dote on our two cats, Laksa and Molé. And I experienced the untimely loss of a pet when my mother accidentally drove over the family dog.)You buy insurance for your home or car because the cost of replacing a house or defending yourself against a lawsuit filed by someone you hit could crush your finances. ""It would be unusual for you to have a pet health problem that would financially devastate you,"" Dr. Mason said. Indeed, if you are facing that choice, the unfortunate but wisest course may be euthanasia.Dr. Mason also said, ""I've put very few dogs asleep because of the expense.""David T. Roen, a Clarkson, Wash., veterinarian, said: ""If you are a good pet owner, nobody cares more about this animal than you do. So no matter what you do, it will be the right thing."" And if you replace it with a stray or abandoned animal, you are doing a good deed, several vets noted.There may be another reason to buy pet insurance. ""It is an easier decision if you make it with your heart and not your pocketbook,"" said VPI's spokesman, Brian Iannessa. ""It makes pet owners feel better.""And there you have it. The pet insurance is really human emotion insurance. It is there to protect you from choosing what Mr. Iannessa called ""economic euthanasia.""But what does Ms. Kalinoski, Henry's owner, think of spending $5,600? ""Would I do it again?"" she asked. ""Yes.""Within weeks of his surgery, Henry was jumping off the furniture. She said, ""You wouldn't have thought he was 15 years old.""'"

"'06-05-14,'0','LYNCHBURG, Va., May 13 — With the Rev. Jerry Falwell at his side, Senator John McCain offered a spirited defense of the Iraq war on Saturday, telling graduating students at Liberty University that victory there was crucial to world security. But Mr. McCain urged opponents of the war to vigorously ""state their opposition"" in the interest of critical debate on this increasingly unpopular conflict.""If an American feels the decision was unwise, then they should state their opposition and argue for another course — it is your right and obligation,"" Mr. McCain said, adding, ""But I ask that you consider the possibility that I, too, am trying to meet my responsibilities, to follow my conscience, to do my duty as best as I can, as God has given me light to see that duty.""Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican and a likely presidential candidate in 2008, made his remarks to 2,500 graduates in a high-profile appearance at the university, which was founded by Mr. Falwell, a conservative religious leader whom he once described as an agent of ""intolerance"" and a threat to the Republican Party.The appearance came as Mr. McCain — trying to establish an early dominance in the Republican presidential nomination battle — has sought to ease tensions with Republican conservatives who have long been suspicious of his commitment to conservative ideals, a perception that was stirred by his difficult history with Mr. Falwell.Though the two men shared a stage here on Saturday, greeting each other warmly and drawing applause from the festive audience, Mr. McCain made only a brief mention of Mr. Falwell in his 28-minute speech. And Mr. McCain, who is normally eager to talk to reporters, left immediately after finishing his speech and before Mr. Falwell offered his greeting to graduates. Mr. McCain's aides said that he had to catch a plane for a speech later Saturday to the Utah Republican Party.'"
"'06-05-14,'0','And most insurers so far are welcoming retail clinics as a way to save money. The uninsured, meanwhile, typically find the clinics more affordable than most alternatives — including the for-profit storefront clinics that have long offered a full range of physician-provided medical services to a walk-in clientele.Uwe E. Reinhardt, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, said that the store chains, with their reputations on the line, would insist that the clinics maintain high standards and low error rates. ""Primary care is a neglected field in the United States, lagging other economically advanced countries,"" he said. ""The clinics can teach the rest of our health system how primary care could be done and brought to the public.""Whether a fad or the beginning of a fundamental shift, the retail clinic trend comes in response to an erosion in employer-sponsored insurance benefits that is forcing people to pay more or all of their own health costs. It is also a reaction to the growing perception that conventional medical service for routine and preventive care has become too costly and inefficient.""Starbucks has 10,000 locations; health care is certainly more important,"" said Mr. Case, who made his name and fortune on the Internet but is now betting that his chain of RediClinics at Wal-Mart, Walgreens and other retailers can be the next big thing.Mr. Case says his epiphany came a few years ago when he took his young daughter to an emergency room on a Sunday for an ear infection. ""We waited four hours and they just weren't able to see us,"" he recalled. ""This is crazy: a society in which everything is convenient other than what people care most about, which is taking care of their health.""Mr. Case's company, Revolution Health Group, has 11 RediClinics now running, including one at a Duane Reade pharmacy on West 50th Street in Manhattan. He plans to open 90 others in various retail chains by the end of this year, and 500 within three years.Other executives bringing their names and money to the field include Hal Rosenbluth, who sold a travel business to American Express and is now behind a clinic chain called Take Care Health Systems. It has clinics in 16 stores, and Mr. Rosenbluth has raised $77 million with an eye toward expanding to 1,400 in the next few years.Another in the game is Dr. Glen D. Nelson, a Minneapolis surgeon and investor whose company, MinuteClinic, has branches in 73 stores.""The clinic concept is a microcosm of what you could do to the whole system to improve it and make it more consumer friendly and economical,"" Dr. Nelson said.The licensed nurse practitioners who run most of the clinics typically have advanced training and referral arrangements with local doctors for cases beyond the clinics' scope. When Ms. Lyons recently took her son, Daniel, to the MinuteClinic at the CVS in Bethesda, the nurse practitioner on duty was Trish Hughes, who performed a quick swab test to check for a streptococcal bacterial infection. In less than three minutes, that preliminary test came up negative; the swab was retained for further testing.Ms. Lyons said she was pleased with the clinic experience. ""I will be back,"" she said.For Beth Brauning, 54, a self-employed house cleaner who is uninsured, the prices at a clinic in a CVS near Columbus, Ohio, were a big attraction. The nurse practitioner took her blood pressure and wrote two allergy prescriptions she needed.The bill was $49 — ""probably half what my doctor would have charged me,"" Ms. Brauning said. ""It was such a good experience for me. You go to an emergency room, it's $300 to walk in the door.""Having someone in the store writing prescriptions could be a boon for pharmacy chains. ""Pharmacy is 70 percent of our business,"" said Jim Maritan, a CVS vice president for strategy and business development. ""It is a great experience having a nurse practitioner clinic on site.""But some doctors say the clinic-pharmacy relationship could create conflicts of interest. ""We want to make sure that the patient is protected,"" said Dr. Joseph P. Annis, an anesthesiologist in Austin, Tex., who is the chairman of an American Medical Association council that studied the clinics for a report due out later this month.Dr. Anne B. Francis, a pediatrician in Rochester, said it was important for children to have a physician who gets to know the family and keeps a complete health record that can help point to underlying causes of some ailments. ""All earaches are not ear infections,"" she said.Although some physicians are fearful of losing business to the clinics, others say that the clinics may fill a need. Larry S. Fields, a family doctor in Ashland, Ky., who is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said that if the clinics ""stick to this limited scope, they may have a small role in providing acute health care to people who are mildly ill, when their only other alternative at the time might be an emergency room.""With no need for expensive medical equipment or office space, the clinics tend to be cheap to operate — particularly since the nurse practitioners are paid $30 to $45 an hour, compared with the $65 or much more an hour that a primary care doctor can command. A store clinic can be profitable with 25 patients over a 12-hour day, clinic executives said.A clinic company with somewhat grander ambitions is Solantic. Its clinics are staffed by doctors and provide a wider range of services that include X-rays at $90 apiece (or two for $150).For routine services, Solantic's prices may be slightly higher than at other clinics — $55 or more for a Solantic doctor visit compared with $45 to be seen by a nurse practitioner at a rival's clinic. But having doctors on staff ""dramatically increases the number of services we can provide to a patient,"" said Richard L. Scott, the chairman of Solantic, which is based in Jacksonville, Fla.Mr. Scott built Columbia-HCA Healthcare into the nation's largest hospital chain. But in the late 1990's, the company faced an array of charges that it had defrauded the government, charged private insurers for unnecessary tests and improperly paid kickbacks to referring doctors. The board forced Mr. Scott out, and the company paid billions of dollars in fines and penalties; Mr. Scott was never charged with wrongdoing. ""I always wanted to create a clinic business when I was in the hospital business,"" Mr. Scott said.Glenn Habern, Wal-Mart's senior vice president for business development, said that Solantic and three of its rivals would be among the clinic companies leasing space in about 60 of Wal-Mart's 1,300 ""superstores"" by the end of this year.""It's still a test for us,"" Mr. Habern said. ""If customers like it we may open more. So far, we've not seen any reason not to do so."" But a big Wal-Mart competitor, Target, has evidently seen drawbacks.At the end of this month Target plans to close the 11 MinuteClinics in stores in Maryland and Minnesota; the company would not explain why. ""Target will begin remodeling to open new health clinics in these stores in fall 2006,"" the company said in an e-mail message.Dr. Nelson, at MinuteClinic, said in an interview before the breakup with Target was disclosed that ""the pharmacy business is a small percentage of the Target footprint.""""Target also is very disciplined,"" he added. ""They like to have things totally designed and controlled to their own specifications. They struggled with whether they want somebody else talking to their clients.""'"
"'06-05-14,'0','KATMANDU, Nepal, May 13 (Reuters) — The leader of Nepal's Maoist rebels asked for direct talks on Saturday with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala to end a decade-old revolt, but he demanded the release of all Maoist prisoners first.The rebel leader, who goes by the name Prachanda, also said in a statement that a special assembly should be elected that should turn Nepal, the world's only Hindu kingdom, into a secular state.If the talks are held, it would be the first time Prachanda, whose real name is Pushpa Kamal Dahal, would be appearing in public since the insurgency began 10 years ago.He did not give any date for the talks. There was no immediate comment from Mr. Koirala or his government, but the response to the Maoists' proposal was expected to be positive.More than 13,000 people have died since the Maoists took up arms against the monarchy.'"
"'06-05-14,'0','DETROIT, May 13 (AP) — At the beginning of May, the aisles of K&G Food Mart here were flooded with shoppers. But as the month has worn on, the traffic has slowed.The cycle, familiar to many grocers in poor neighborhoods, has a simple explanation: the start of the month is when people get their food stamps.A group of small retailers and wholesalers in Michigan is asking for a change in the way the state administers the federal assistance program. The merchants hope that spreading out food stamp distributions can eliminate such swings in customer traffic, which they say make it difficult to keep stores adequately staffed and stocked.On Monday, the Michigan Food Policy Council is scheduled to vote on the issue as part of its recommendations to Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm on ways to increase the number of stores selling fresh food in low-income areas.While store owners say their food is always fresh, they acknowledge the selection is better on days that they expect more sales. With business so skewed, they say they have no choice but to adjust their merchandise.'"
"'06-05-14,'0','AUSTIN, Tex. — As Ben Barnes was saying before he was so rudely interrupted in 1972 ...Yes, the boy wonder of Texas politics is back. He is 68 now, the towering frame a little stooped and the famous carrot top a yellowing frizz. But Mr. Barnes, a multimillionaire lobbyist who was speaker of the Texas house at 26, lieutenant governor at 30, a presidential prospect at 32, and washed up at 34, is out once again to sway politics in his native state, though this time from the sidelines as elder statesman.In a new memoir, he chronicles his rise as a protégé of Gov. John B. Connally and President Lyndon B. Johnson, and his scandalous downfall — or political assassination, as he portrays it — at the hands of the Nixon administration. He also offers his prescription to revive the moribund Texas Democrats, now too few, he lamented in an interview, ""to even fight among themselves any more.""Texas's oldest living political prodigy and a monument to survival, the 6-foot-3-inch Mr. Barnes serves as a kind of walking time capsule. He provides transcripts of secretly recorded Oval Office tapes that he says show Mr. Nixon and his attorney general, John N. Mitchell, plotting to ensnare him in the Texas banking-stock and bribery scandal known as Sharpstown. He was not implicated in any criminality, but a leaked hearsay account that Mr. Barnes ""takes only cash"" doomed his 1972 run for governor and ended his political career.Yet his book, ""Barn Burning, Barn Building,"" written with Lisa Dickey and published by Bright Sky Press, an affiliate of Texas A&M University, also tackles the future. He derides what he calls the politics of ""death and destruction,"" argues for coalition-building, conciliation and accommodations with business, and appeals to both parties to groom ""farm teams"" of young people eager for public service.""I have an insatiable desire to help people — it's something that Connally and Johnson both taught me,"" he said before a recent speech and tribute dinner here at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, where he is on the board of trustees and was good-naturedly roasted by associates.""He has trouble delineating between himself and God,"" said Bernard Rapoport, an insurance magnate in Waco, a longtime University of Texas regent and a philanthropist. Other well-wishers included Mr. Connally's widow, Nellie, the last survivor of those who were in the limousine with President John F. Kennedy when he was assassinated in Dallas in 1963. Also in attendance were Liz Carpenter, former White House staff director under President Johnson, and Luci Johnson Turpin, one of Mr. Johnson's daughters, a stand-in for her ailing mother, Lady Bird.'"
"'06-05-14,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, May 13 — Sheila Kuehl has done a few things that someday may merit mention in the history books: more than a decade in the California Legislature, a public crusade against domestic violence and a stint as the tenacious busybody Zelda on the classic sitcom ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.""But if such immortality were to happen, Ms. Kuehl says, she would want one fact listed with the rest of her accomplishments: she is gay.So this year, Ms. Kuehl, a state senator representing western Los Angeles, introduced a bill to assure that lesbians and gay men get what she feels is their due in California textbooks. The bill, which passed the Senate on Thursday and is now headed to the Assembly, would forbid the teaching of any material that ""reflects adversely on persons due to sexual orientation,"" and add the ""age appropriate study of the role and contributions of people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.""For Ms. Kuehl, 65, the bill seems to have as much to do with school security as it does with the A B C's.""One of the things that contribute to a safe or unsafe environment for kids are the teaching materials,"" Ms. Kuehl said. ""If you have teaching material that didn't say anything at all about gay and lesbian people, it is assumed that they never did anything at all. But if it said anything about gay and lesbian people, the whole atmosphere of the school was safer for gay and lesbian kids, or those thought to be gay and lesbian.""'"
"'06-05-14,'0','And while many if not most whitening creams are safe, doctors, consumer groups and government officials are reporting dangerous consequences of the trend. Some involve women who use blemish creams in large, harmful amounts; inexpensive black-market products with powerful but illegal bleaching agents are selling briskly, particularly in the poorer parts of South and Southeast Asia.""I have a lot of complaints — with photographs — which show that before the cream is used the face is fine and then after it looks like it's been roasted in the oven,"" said Darshan Singh, the manager for Malaysia's National Consumer Complaints Center, a nonprofit group.Skin-whitening products work in various ways. Some contain acids that remove old skin to reveal newer, lighter skin underneath. Others inhibit melanin, like those with mulberry extract, licorice extract, kojic acid, arbutin and hydroquinone, an ingredient in prescription creams for blemishes as well as in photo processing materials.Some of the most effective agents are also risky — and are often the least expensive, like mercury-based ingredients or hydroquinone, which in Thailand sells for about $20 per kilogram (2.2 pounds), compared with highly concentrated licorice extract, which sells for about $20,000 per kilogram.Hydroquinone has been shown to cause leukemia in mice and other animals. The European Union banned it from cosmetics in 2001, but it shows up in bootleg creams in the developing world. It is sold in the United States as an over-the-counter drug, but with a concentration of hydroquinone not exceeding 2 percent.Sociologists have long debated why Asians, who are divided by everything from language to religion to ethnicity, share a deeply held cultural preference for lighter skin. One commonly repeated rationale is that a lighter complexion is associated with wealth and higher education levels because those from lower social classes, laborers and farmers, are more exposed to the sun.Another theory is that the waves of lighter-skinned conquerors, the Moguls from Central Asia and the colonizers from Europe, reset the standard for attractiveness.Films and advertising also clearly have a role. The success of South Korean soap operas across the region has made their lighter-skinned stars emblems of Asian beauty.Nithiwadi Phuchareuyot, a doctor at a skin clinic in Bangkok who dispenses products and treatments to lighten skin, said: ""Every Thai girl thinks that if she has white skin the money will come and the men will come. The movie stars are all white-skinned, and everyone wants to look like a superstar.""In Thailand, as in other countries in the region, the stigma of darker skin is reflected in language. One common insult is tua dam, or black body. Less common but more evocative is dam tap pet, or black like a duck's liver.Advertisements for skin-whitening products promote whiter skin as glowing and healthier. Olay has a product called White Radiance. L'Oréal markets products called White Perfect.Last year, 62 new skin-whitening products were introduced in supermarkets or pharmacies across the Asia-Pacific region, according to Datamonitor, a market research firm, accelerating a trend that has seen an average of 56 new products introduced annually over the past four years.Meanwhile, Thailand's Food and Drug Administration has published a list of 70 illegal whitening creams. Indonesian officials have identified more than 50 banned cosmetics.Small groups of people in Asia seem to prefer tanned skin. In Japan, young women commonly referred to as Shibuya girls, after the Tokyo neighborhood they favor, have been regular patrons of tanning salons for a decade. But they are an asterisk in Japanese society, and Asia over all.""Everybody else basically wants white skin,"" said Leeyong Soo, the international fashion coordinator at Vogue Nippon. ""People might say to you when you come back from a holiday, 'Oh you have a tan.' But it's not necessarily complimentary.""Thada Piamphongsant, the president of the Thai Society of Cosmetic Dermatology and Surgery, said he believed that about half of all Thai dermatologists prescribed creams with hydroquinone. He stopped prescribing it a decade ago when he noticed patients with redness and itching and with more serious side effects like ochronosis, the appearance of very dark patches of skin that are difficult to remove.Some patients also develop leukoderma, where the skin loses the ability to produce pigment, resulting in patches of pink like those on Ms. Panya's face and neck.When she first began using the cream, which was packaged under the name 3 Days and cost the equivalent of $1, she said she was very happy with the results.Her skin started itching, but she tolerated it because her complexion lightened considerably. She got bigger tips at the restaurant, where she sang folk songs, she said.But when her face became blotchy two months later, her boss told her she could no longer sing at the restaurant because she was unsightly.In April, she told her story on a Thai television program, breaking down as she described how she ruined her face and lost her job.But first, the announcer ran through a list of the show's sponsors, including a cream called White Beauty. ""Use this cream,"" the announcer said. ""It gives you expert treatment.""'"
"'06-05-14,'0','Splitting up the C.I.A. at this time is unwise. In trying to fix the weaknesses of human intelligence collection, we will make integration problems more complicated and probably worse in the short and medium term. Rather than having one insular agency, the intelligence world will be populated by mini-agencies with diminished capacities but all the same instincts to protect turf. Human intelligence collection will still be scattered among agencies, as will technical collection and analysis. To get a net benefit from splitting up the C.I.A., agencies under the control of the Pentagon would have to be merged with the mini-agencies so that there would be just one body devoted to each kind of intelligence work.The goal of creating an integrated intelligence community is the right one, but we risk generating bureaucratic chaos in the process. We don't want to destroy existing capacities in the name of progress or idealized organization charts. Trying to break up the C.I.A. and integrate it at the same time is too much for one structure to bear — especially one that is already weak, demoralized and paranoid about hostile takeover by the Pentagon.Back in the 1990's, under the directorship of John Deutch, the C.I.A. suffered from similar organizational angst. There were unending process reviews, turf battles with the F.B.I. and Pentagon, and a Congressional review that debated the merits of breaking up the agency, which was then called a cold war dinosaur. A sense of paralysis engulfed us. Assigned to an important country in the Persian Gulf, I went to work each day not knowing what I was supposed to do, what secrets to steal or whether anyone remembered I was there, since my mail went unanswered. These were the days when Osama bin Laden first declared war on the United States from his new base in the mountains of Afghanistan — an act that went largely unnoticed by a distracted and demoralized C.I.A.Rather than breaking up the agency, General Hayden and Mr. Negroponte should focus on integrating it in its current form. Strengthening the direct relationship between Mr. Negroponte's office and the C.I.A.'s deputy directors for analysis and operations will tighten command and control without the chaos caused by breaking structures. At the moment, the director of national intelligence does not have access to information about how the C.I.A.'s clandestine and analytical resources are distributed. This makes it impossible to evaluate, for example, whether the C.I.A.'s Iran program duplicates or adds to efforts elsewhere in the community, or whether resource allocations reflect the director's priorities.Once General Hayden is confirmed, his first challenge will be to select a new leadership team. The general should be wary of those who simply advocate the status quo. These forces might be popular with the professional spies, but they will resist real transformation. General Hayden should not shy away from reaching deep down or even outside to bring together a diverse group of leaders who are capable and committed to changing the organization. Furthermore, it is imperative that General Hayden assume the role of a hands-on leader who will deal decisively with festering concerns that might seem trivial but have led to an unhealthy rift between staff officers and senior management.General Hayden's independent thinking, strong leadership skills, and knowledge and respect for the intelligence business will serve him well as he navigates these challenges, which proved too much for Mr. Goss. It is for this reason that other former insiders and I feel that he is the right man for the job.But the vision has also got to be right. So rather than debating the type of suit General Hayden should wear, we should be asking him about his vision for C.I.A. integration, his plans for the agency and his priorities. The details are important because the stakes are high, not just for the men and women of the C.I.A., but for a nation at war.'"
"'06-05-14,'0','The biggest problem, as anyone who invested in technology stocks in the late 1990's will recall, is that investments invariably ""revert to the mean."" This is a fancy way of saying that stocks that are outperforming today will eventually fall back in line with their historic average gains. But to do so, they need to go through a period of underperformance. ""And the markets always have a tendency to overshoot on the downside,"" said Jeremy Grantham, chairman of the asset management firm Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo based in Boston.Of course, there are ways to mitigate some of these short-term risks. One simple method is to practice dollar-cost averaging, which is something we all do in our 401(k)'s. Instead of investing, say, $20,000 in foreign shares all at once, consider spreading your bets over several months or quarters. This way, you'll never be buying foreign stocks at their absolute peak. And should foreign shares begin to lose some value, you will be buying at ever-lower prices.""People make the mistake of adjusting their allocations in one great swoop,"" said Sarah H. Ketterer, chief executive officer and portfolio manager with Causeway Capital Management, based in Los Angeles. ""But if you're moving from a 100-percent domestic position and cutting 30 percent of that in a single day, it can be quite abrupt.""This is particularly true if you're shifting a sizable portion of your assets from, say, domestic blue-chip stocks to emerging-market equities, which are among the most volatile investments around.Mr. Young said that given the run-up in foreign stocks over the last four years, investors who were increasing their foreign exposure should look for short-term pullbacks — say a drop of 5 percent or more — in the foreign markets. ""Just be patient,"" he said, and buy on the dips.Moreover, if you are committing to the foreign markets for the long term, remember to take some profit off the table as you go. That means you have to be willing to rebalance your portfolio not just between domestic and foreign shares, but among different types of foreign holdings.For instance, say you started out in January 2002 with a portfolio consisting of the following: 60 percent domestic blue-chip stocks, 30 percent blue-chip stocks based in Western Europe and Japan, and 10 percent emerging-markets shares.By the end of the first quarter of 2006, that portfolio would have become predominantly foreign had you failed to periodically reset your mix of domestic and foreign shares.But just as important, within your foreign mix, your allocation to the emerging markets would have grown substantially. In this example, you would have started out with 25 percent of your foreign holdings in the emerging-markets equities. But by the end of the first quarter, that allocation would have jumped to 35 percent, far more than many financial planners advise.Jeff Mortimer, head of equity portfolio management at Charles Schwab Investment Management, said investors should probably keep around 5 percent of their equity holdings in emerging-market stocks, with a total of 25 percent of their equity holdings in foreign shares. However, ""if you get too far away from your strategic mix, all of a sudden, you're going to be in an entirely different risk spectrum,"" Mr. Mortimer warned.This means it's vital that investors know what they own. According to the fund tracker Lipper, more than 7 percent of the assets in an average domestic stock fund are invested overseas. So if you own a broad-based domestic equity portfolio, chances are that you have substantial foreign exposure already.Moreover, around 20 percent of the assets in the average international stock fund are in emerging markets, according to Lipper. So it's possible that you already have more-than-adequate emerging-markets exposure without purchasing a separate emerging-markets portfolio.There are other things that risk-minded foreign investors might want to consider. For instance, stick with funds that are themselves well diversified, said Peter Hill, chief investment officer for the asset management firm Bailard, based in Foster City, Calif.According to the fund tracker Morningstar, the average international stock fund owns shares in 177 companies. Those funds that concentrate their bets on fewer names sported a standard deviation — a key gauge of volatility — of 17.1 over the last five years. But funds that own more than 200 stocks are far less volatile, with a standard deviation of just 14.6. Finally, risk-minded investors in foreign markets should probably emphasize blue-chip foreign equities.AS in the United States, small-capitalization stocks overseas have been the market's real darlings. The average foreign growth fund that focuses on small and midcap stocks, for instance, has soared nearly 40 percent a year for the last three years, according to Morningstar. By comparison, foreign large-cap growth funds are up around 27 percent annually.But after such a huge run-up, Thomas Melendez, portfolio manager with MFS Investment Management in Boston, says foreign small caps aren't as attractive from a valuation standpoint.This is in part why the MFS Research International fund, which invests in the ""best ideas"" of MFS's analysts, is 75 percent in foreign large-cap stocks today. Historically, this fund has held around 60 percent of its assets in large-cap names, Mr. Melendez said.But this doesn't mean investors should avoid small caps — or the emerging markets — altogether.Remember, if you're moving a portion of your portfolio overseas for the long term, it's all about diversification. And that means being disciplined enough to stick with your asset allocation strategy through thick and thin.The good news is that over long periods of time, there's usually more thick than thin when it comes to equities.'"

A two-block area at the neighborhood's southern edge, near Macombs Road and Featherbed Lane, contains a 79-family shelter, a 384-bed residential drug treatment program, a 43-unit apartment building for formerly homeless drug addicts, another shelter and a home for developmentally disabled people.Residents reacted strongly to recent news that another yellow dot was coming.

He gives no credit to a designer who equipped nature with the potential to evolve DNA and the brain.Proponents of intelligent design occasion this adversarial mood by insisting on design interference in evolution, particularly to create ""irreducibly complex systems."" Both sides should have faith in science to solve these problems and faith in the designer to have arranged it so that no divine interference is required.Of all the arguments opposing the teaching of intelligent design in our schools, the one advanced by Holden Thorp is the silliest: that by exposing students to this controversy we will hamper their scientific development and thus our own economic prosperity.'"
"'06-05-14,'0','The increasing appearance of pets whose owners say they are needed for emotional support in restaurants — as well as on airplanes, in offices and even in health spas — goes back, according to those who train such animals, to a 2003 ruling by the Department of Transportation. It clarified policies regarding disabled passengers on airplanes, stating for the first time that animals used to aid people with emotional ailments like depression or anxiety should be given the same access and privileges as animals helping people with physical disabilities like blindness or deafness.The following year appellate courts in New York State for the first time accepted tenants' arguments in two cases that emotional support was a viable reason to keep a pet despite a building's no-pets policy. Word of the cases and of the Transportation Department's ruling spread, aided by television and the Internet. Now airlines are grappling with how to accommodate 200-pound dogs in the passenger cabin and even emotional-support goats. And businesses like restaurants not directly addressed in the airline or housing decisions face a newly empowered group of customers seeking admittance with their animals.WHILE most people who train animals that help the disabled — known as service animals — are happy that deserving people are aided, some are also concerned that pet owners who might simply prefer to brunch with their Labradoodle are abusing the guidelines.""The D.O.T. guidance document was an outrageous decision,"" said Joan Froling, chairwoman of the International Association of Assistance Dog Partners, a nonprofit organization representing people who depend on service dogs. ""Instead of clarifying the difference between emotional support animals who provide comfort by their mere presence and animals trained to perform specific services for the disabled, they decided that support animals were service animals.""No one interviewed for this article admitted to taking advantage of the guidelines, but there is evidence that it happens. Cynthia Dodge, the founder and owner of Tutor Service Dogs in Greenfield, Mass., said she has seen people's lives transformed by emotional-support animals. She has also ""run into a couple of people with small dogs that claim they are emotional support animals but they are not,"" she said. ""I've had teenagers approach me wanting to get their dogs certified. This isn't cute and is a total insult to the disabled community. They are ruining it for people who need it.""The 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act states that anyone depending on an animal to function should be allowed full access to all private businesses that serve the public, like restaurants, stores and theaters. The law specifies that such animals must be trained specifically to assist their owner. True service animals are trained in tasks like finding a spouse when a person is in distress, or preventing people from rolling onto their stomachs during seizures.But now, because the 2003 Department of Transportation document does not include language about training, pet owners can claim that even untrained puppies are ""service animals,"" Ms. Froling said. ""People think, 'If the D.O.T. says I can take my animal on a plane, I can take it anywhere,' "" she said.Aphrodite Clamar-Cohen, who teaches psychology at John Jay College in Manhattan and sees a psychotherapist, said her dog, a pit bull mix, helps fend off dark moods that began after her husband died eight years ago. She learned about psychological support pets from the Delta Society, a nonprofit group that aims to bring people and animals together, and got her dog, Alexander, last year. ""When I travel I tell hotels up front that 'Alexander Dog Cohen' is coming and he is my emotional-needs dog,"" she said. She acknowledged that the dog is not trained as a service animal.""He is necessary for my mental health,"" she said. ""I would find myself at loose ends without him.""It is widely accepted that animals can provide emotional benefits to people. ""There is a lot of evidence that animals are major antidepressants,"" said Carole Fudin, a clinical social worker who specializes in the bond between animals and humans. ""They give security and are wonderful emotional grease to help people with incapacitating fears like agoraphobia.""Groups of pet owners with specially trained ""therapy dogs"" have long visited hospitals and volunteered after disasters. Following the 9/11 attack in New York, 100 therapy dogs were enlisted to comfort victims' families at a special center.But Dr. Fudin said that emotional reliance on an animal can be taken too far. ""If a person can't entertain the idea of going out without an animal, that would suggest an extreme anxiety level,"" she said, ""and he or she should probably be on medication, in psychotherapy or both.""The question of when an animal goes from being a pet that provides love and companionship to an emotional-support animal, without which an owner cannot get through a day, is subjective.Elicia Brand, 36, said the role her Bernese mountain dog played in her life changed drastically after Ms. Brand suffered severe traumas — being trapped on a subway during the 9/11 attack and being raped the next year. ""I am a strong person and it almost did me in,"" she said of the rape. ""My dog was my crutch. If I didn't have him I wouldn't be here now."" After Sept. 11, Ms. Brand enrolled her dog in disaster relief training and put him through 10 weeks of training so he could be a therapy animal to others as well as herself. The dog now accompanies her everywhere, even to work. She also sees a therapist and takes medication.One reason it is difficult to sort out the varying levels of dependency people have on their animals is that it is a violation of the disabilities act to inquire about someone's disability, and although service animals are supposed to be trained, there is no definitive list of skills such animals must have.""The A.D.A. started with the idea of the honor system,"" Ms. Froling said. ""The goal was to make sure that people with disabilities were not hassled. They didn't list the services an animal should perform because they didn't want to limit creativity, and they didn't want to specify dogs because monkeys were being trained in helpful tasks.""These days people rely on a veritable Noah's Ark of support animals. Tami McLallen, a spokeswoman for American Airlines, said that although dogs are the most common service animals taken onto planes, the airline has had to accommodate monkeys, miniature horses, cats and even an emotional support duck. ""Its owner dressed it up in clothes,"" she recalled.There have also been at least two instances (on American and Delta) in which airlines have been presented with emotional support goats. Ms. McLallen said the airline flies service animals every day; all owners need to do is show up with a letter from a mental health professional and the animal can fly free in the cabin.There is no way to know how many of the pets now sitting in coach class or accompanying their owners to dinner at restaurants are trained in health-related tasks. But the fact that dog vests bearing the words ""service animal"" and wallet-size cards explaining the rights of a support-dog owner are available over the Internet, no questions asked, suggests there is wiggle room for those wishing to exploit it.One such wallet card proclaims: ""This person is accompanied by a Service Dog — an animal individually trained to perform tasks for people with disabilities. Service Dogs are working animals, not pets."" On the back is a number to call at the Department of Justice for information about the Americans With Disabilities Act.One 30-year-old woman, a resident of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., said she does not see a psychotherapist but suffers from anxiety and abandonment issues and learned about emotional-needs dogs from a television show. She ordered a dog vest over the Internet with the words ""service dog in training"" for one of the several dogs she lives with, even though none are trained as service animals. ""Having my dogs with me makes me feel less hostile,"" said the woman, who refused to give her name.""I can fine people or have them put in jail if they don't let me in a restaurant with my dogs, because they are violating my rights,"" she insisted.In general, business owners seem to extend themselves to accommodate service animals. Though Completely Bare, a chain of health spas in New York and Palm Beach, Fla., has a policy barring animals in treatment rooms, Cindy Barshop, the company's owner, said that she made an exception for a customer who insisted that she needed her large dog for support while she had laser hair removal. ""We had to cover the dog with a blanket to protect its eyes during the procedure,"" Ms. Barshop said.One area in which business owners have resisted what they see as abuse of the law is housing. Litigators for both tenants and landlords say cases involving people's demands to have service animals admitted to no-pets buildings in New York have risen sharply in the last two years, with rulings often in the tenants' favor.""If you have backing of a medical professional and you can show a connection between a disabling condition and the keeping of an animal, I have 99.9 percent success,"" said Karen Copeland, a tenants' lawyer.One of her current clients maintains that she needs an animal in her apartment because she is a recovering alcoholic and, apart from her pet, all her other friends are drinkers. Another client, Anthony Milburn, lives in Kew Gardens, Queens, with five cocker spaniels and one mixed breed. He says he has severe chest pains from stress and has a note from a social worker saying that he relies on his pets for his emotional well-being. He is pursuing a case against his landlord.Bradley Silverbush, a partner at Borah, Goldstein, Altschuler, Schwartz & Nahins, the largest landlord law firm in New York, said people are manipulating the law.""I'm a dog owner and a dog lover but to claim emotional support is beyond affection,"" he said. ""People send letters from doctors saying the person relies on the animal, or a person has just lost a parent and purchased a Pomeranian. Some doctors will write anything if asked by a patient.""Jerri Cohen, the owner of a jewelry store in Manhattan, said she tried living without animals when she married a man who bought an apartment in a no-dog building. ""I went into a severe depression and had to go on medication,"" she said. ""Three years later a friend bought me two pug puppies, and I refused to give them away. My co-op threatened us with eviction. An attorney suggested I get a letter from my psychiatrist. She wrote that I was emotionally needy and the lawyer said that was no good. So she wrote that I can barely function or run my store without them. I won the case.""They sleep with me,"" she said. ""They have a double stroller. They go to restaurants with me and fly with me.""'"
"'06-05-14,'0','New Jersey's property tax conundrum (""School Budget Rumbles,"" editorial, May 7) has only one solution — a solution that no one appears willing or able to address. That is, the number of municipal governments must be cut by one half and the number of school districts by two thirds, all done through consolidation.Downsizing is acceptable. Corporations do it all the time and the economy is still booming. Another option is the complete elimination of either county or municipal governments.However, having personally been involved in efforts to merge police departments in two municipalities, I am concerned that there are so many vested interests, and so many fears that we will lose ""home rule"" (as if we had any in the first place), that it is impossible to make this happen short of state mandate.The bottom line is, if you want all the services you demand, and you want ""home rule,"" then you had better be prepared to pay for it.'"
"'06-05-14,'0','For nearly 30 years, the two families exchanged Christmas cards. In June 2004, Mr. Swiss's parents, visiting the United States, joined the Praticos to see a matinee of the Broadway show ""The Boy From Oz."" Ms. Pratico, then living on the Upper East Side, met them later that day for dinner. There she handed Mr. and Mrs. Swiss her business card and said, ""If your kids are ever in New York, tell them to give me a call.""The invitation was relayed to Kenneth Swiss, who had recently moved from Australia to work in Dubai. He, in turn, sent an e-mail message to Ms. Pratico that November at the insistence of his parents. In it he told her that he would be in New York and asked if she was available for morning coffee on the Sunday of his visit. His flight was three hours later, so he had a built-in excuse to leave in a hurry should the meeting not go well.When he called her the night before to confirm, Ms. Pratico said that she was on her way to a restaurant — where she and her friends had devised their own exit strategy — and suggested that he stop by. Suddenly, her cellphone rang.""I'm here at the bar, but I don't know what you look like,"" Mr. Swiss remembered telling her.""I'm the blonde at the bar holding a cellphone,"" Ms. Pratico said. ""I turned around and saw this amazing, handsome Australian,"" she recalled.They hit it off, and Mr. Swiss changed his flight plans to Dubai to stay another weekend.In the ensuing months, they traveled together to Dubai, Paris, Chicago and Nashville.Last May, Mr. Swiss proposed in front of the Central Park Boathouse.""Despite living on opposite ends of the planet, we found each other,"" Mr. Swiss said. ""It seems now that it was always meant to be that way.""'"
"'06-05-14,'0','Yes, the wedding band was an early Mother's Day gift purchased at the jewelry store inside our local ShopRite in Aberdeen. You can't miss the jewelry store — although I was hoping my wife would. It is directly across from a computer repair center, which is next to a Dunkin' Donuts, which is next to a bank.Map Quest might make it a bit easier to find our ShopRite's portrait studio, bakery, pharmacy, sushi bar, dry cleaners, shoe-repair shop, babysitting room and two full service delis — one of which only serves kosher foods.Want sports memorabilia, CD's, DVD's, paintings and best-selling novels? You've come to the right place.Ending a tour of shopping duty two weeks ago, I realized I had forgotten to buy a dozen eggs, which were now about seven city blocks from where I was parked. After a long day of wheeling and dealing, and with nary a taxicab in sight, I returned home eggless.Before the mother of all ShopRites opened in our town a few years ago, a much smaller one existed on that very site. But that was before a monstrous Stop & Shop opened its jaws across the street, swallowing consumers by the bushel.Stop & Shop has a bank, a florist and its own money-wiring service. It has its own toy section and carts designed to look like sports cars for children to ride alongside their parents, lap after excruciating lap, on a shopping circuit resembling a Formula 1 track.It also had a wider selection of foods and a lot more people at its checkout lines than ShopRite. In an attempt to keep up with the Jones's, the old ShopRite was torn down and replaced by an obscenely large establishment that makes Stop & Shop look more like Mom and Pop.That war alone resulted in several smaller stores in the area getting rubbed out, and innocent shoppers getting caught in the crossfire of a one-stop shopping concept that is raging out of control, forcing them to surrender inordinate amounts of time and money under one roof.Karen Meleta, a spokeswoman for the 192 ShopRite stores in New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, said she was unaware of any supermarket wars in progress, but added, ""We're always looking at what other competitors are doing, and at what is happening in the industry.""The supermarket business has always been competitive,"" she said. ""But stores are changing in response to consumer demand.""Consumer demand? Find me the consumer who demanded that his pants be ironed while he waits at the deli counter, in his underwear, for smoked sausage. Is he related to the consumer who demanded that his shoes be fixed while he cruises barefoot through frozen foods?Ms. Meleta, who pointed out that each ShopRite was individually owned, said that in recent years the average ShopRite had swelled to 65,000 square feet from about 35,000 square feet.She said that ""an explosion of choice,"" was responsible for spawning megamarkets like ShopRite that seem to be taking over the world.In Oakland, Calif., for example, one ShopRite has a beauty salon and a liquor store within its four walls. Closer to home, a ShopRite in Branchburg has an optometrist's office on the premises. Later this month, a brand new ShopRite, complete with a health care center, will open its doors in Somers Point.A health care center? Frosted Flakes and a flu shot on the same visit to my favorite supermarket? How lucky can a guy get? What's next? A horse trail around pet accessories?""We know the needs of our shoppers,"" Ms. Meleta said repeatedly.Not my needs. You want to respond to the demands of this consumer? How about a roulette wheel in Aisle 3? How about a swimming pool and massage parlor in Aisles 4 and 5?When those demands are met, I'm calling my travel agent to book our next family vacation.I'll send you a postcard from the seafood section.'"

"'06-05-14,'0','Edwaard Liang, who choreographed a work for the theater's opening season in October, said: ""I was surprised by how much criticism there was about someone founding a dance company. Of course Nancy Laurie has a lot of money, but if there is no money, you can't start anything like this. She is passionate about dance; it's not just a whim.""Mr. Liang, a soloist with the New York City Ballet, might well have cited his own company's history of patronage: George Balanchine would never have come to the United States if not for the willingness of a wealthy young man, Lincoln Kirstein, to spend his money (and persuade his rich friends to spend theirs). Nonetheless, Cedar Lake suffers the perception of wealthy dilettantism.Its reputation was not helped by its lack of visibility in New York during its first two years. Ms. Laurie, who lives in Columbia, Mo. (where she founded the Columbia Performing Arts Center), bought the buildings in 2004, but a lengthy renovation kept dancers in rented Midtown studios. In addition, her first choice as director, L. Jen Ballard, was little known to the dance world and programmed few performances for the company.""I think that Nancy knew that she needed to do it in a different way,"" said Ms. Molnar, whose ballet ""4 Flights Down"" will be part of a second program this season that will run from May 31 to June 4. ""You only learn by experience.""In August, Ms. Laurie appointed Benoit-Swan Pouffer, a French-born former Alvin Ailey dancer, as Cedar Lake's artistic director and Ms. Ballard left. The 31-year-old Mr. Pouffer, known as Swan, had already created a piece for Cedar Lake and had become its resident choreographer the previous year. For the company's opening season in its 191-seat theater in October, he commissioned works from two promising choreographers, Jodie Gates and Mr. Liang, offering them the novelty of free rein.""Swan's approach was, 'Do what you need to do, and we'll see,' "" said Ms. Gates, a former principal dancer with the Joffrey Ballet and the Frankfurt Ballet. ""It's not that they weren't aware of costs, but on the other hand, no limits were set at the outset. Midway through the rehearsal period I decided I wanted to use a D.J. onstage, and that was fine. It was a great exploratory time for me.""Exploration is exactly what Mr. Pouffer wants. ""I would like us to be seen as a laboratory,"" he said during a rehearsal of ""Hammer,"" his two-part work inspired by Nietzsche's ""Twilight of the Idols,"" which will run until May 21. (Reviewing the work for The New York Times on Wednesday, John Rockwell was not enthusiastic, calling the movement vocabulary ""commonplace."") ""We have the luxury of giving people time to work. They can use the stage as much as they like. I want to create a place where it's O.K. for a choreographer to experiment. We are not trying to fit in somewhere; we are trying to create something new, work that you might not see elsewhere.""Mr. Pouffer and Ms. Elliott are hoping that the current season, following two seasons of new works, will go a long way toward drawing regular audiences. ""One of our problems,"" Ms. Elliott said in the company's stylishly simple office space, ""is that not enough people know that we are here."" To that end, the company is keeping ticket prices low — $30, with reductions for students and people 65 and older — and offering free season previews. Over the summer, there will also be free entry to an installation in which Mr. Pouffer is planning to use a singer as well as dancers and video art.Cedar Lake can, of course, afford not to worry about ticket prices. Mr. Pouffer looked rather charmingly blank when asked about his budget. ""I have no idea,"" he said. ""You'd have to ask Kate Elliott."" On the other hand, without the right artistic choices, no number of low-cost tickets will secure the company's reputation.Mr. Pouffer's energy and enthusiasm about the company's possibilities are manifest, and he is full of ambitious plans for the next season, including lending the theater to other companies that need performance space and establishing an educational show using video. He also plans to commission more new pieces; he says he is inundated with videos from emerging choreographers and watches every one in the hope of unearthing new talent.The company has also attracted excellent dancers. ""The working conditions are so unusual for an American company that there is lots of interest in coming to the company, even from Europe,"" said Nicolo Fonte, whose ""Lasting Imprint"" (along with Ms. Molnar's work and Mr. Pouffer's ""Between Here and Now"") will be performed in the second program. ""There is so much potential for it to be a great creative artistic environment.""Mr. Pouffer says he hopes his first year has shown that Ms. Laurie's enterprise is a serious one and not a vanity project. When asked about guarantees of his patron's future support, he sounded confident (and French). ""Nothing is sure in life,"" he said, shrugging his shoulders. ""But look at this place. It's real.""'"
"'06-05-14,'0','You can't pick up any useful clues as to where you are in the series by merely taking note of who is in charge over at C.T.U., the counter-terrorist unit to which Jack is attached, because the place is always in upheaval, with one new government flunky after another coming in and locking the unit down so the ""protocols"" can be changed, whatever they are. Chloe, her face scrunched up, punching codes into her laptop, is the one constant.Meanwhile the same kinds of things keep happening from season to season. Canisters with ticking digital clocks; Jack going solo, racing around in an SUV and yelling on his cellphone; C.T.U. itself under attack. There is treachery in the White House, and sooner or later a suspect turns up who won't talk and, since the fate of the country is at stake, needs a little chemical encouragement. (With Christopher Henderson, though, the hard case in Season 5, it's odd that no one has noticed he's played by Peter Weller, formerly the Robocop; he's half machine, that is, and instead of drugs, the interrogators should be using a welding torch.)From season to season, the shows also look and feel much alike: the same dark lighting and lingering close-ups; the same slow buildup to the cliff-hanging scene breaks, punctuated by that ominous da-dum, da-dum, da-dum. This is merely to say that, like so many TV series, even very good TV series, ""24"" is formulaic. There are only so many variations that the creators, Robert Cochran and Joel Surnow, can elaborate on the theme of the renegade agent who in just 24 hours — or 24 less-than-hourlong episodes — rescues his country from an overwhelming threat, and when they hit upon something that works they tend to go back to it.But far from diminishing the show, these repetitions add an element of reassurance. It is not just superior self-control that has enabled my wife and me to ration our intake of Season 2 and even to contemplate a Monday-evening outing that might not have us home by 9. Much of the initial excitement of ""24"" depended on its novelty — there had never been anything quite like it on television — and once you get through that initial season, it's hard to imagine how a subsequent one could ever be as riveting.Nor would you necessarily want it to be. Most of Season 1 was shot in the aftermath of Sept. 11; the people making the show and that first-season audience brought to the experience the kind of anxiety we were all feeling back then. If you're a first-time viewer, the early episodes of ""24"" scare the daylights out of you, in part because you have no idea how it's all going to turn out. (The show's creators probably didn't either.)The subsequent seasons deal with similar material — one dire threat after another — and yet we've learned by now that although terrible things may happen (like the pointless death of President Palmer), the folks at C.T.U. will somehow avert even worse ones. Like all good genre entertainment — like mystery novels, for example, or screwball comedies — ""24"" offers both surprise and an even more deeply satisfying element of predictability. You know what you're going to get. In this case the show may even work as a kind of inoculation, jolting us with a little dose of manageable terrorism or nuclear threat or biological warfare as a balm to our deeper, unspoken anxieties.The key to this process is Jack, of course, who it's becoming clearer and clearer must give up any semblance of a normal life just so we can cling to ours. He's a heroic figure but also a sad and tragic one who increasingly seems to carry with him an awareness that he's practically toxic to others with whom he might wish to be close.Jack's dilemma is how to save those he loves while at the same time defusing the larger threat, and if he has to make a choice he invariably sides with people, not principle. He doesn't in the least mind tossing the protocols out the window. That's what makes him different from everyone else in the government — the government on TV, that is, which is in turn a projection of our very worst fears.'"
"'06-05-14,'0','I grew up in Rhode Island, thinking of my native state as the cradle of freedom. Rhode Island boasted some important firsts: it was the first British colony in North America to separate church from state, the first to have a democratic form of government and among the first to declare independence from the mother country. It was democratic America in the making, the future nation in miniature.Having briefly attended the Moses Brown School and lived for a time near Brown University, I had a hazy idea of the Browns of Rhode Island as a clan of forward-looking patriots who paved the way to human rights. But reading Charles Rappleye's ""Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the American Revolution,"" a biography of Moses and John Brown, gave me the same kind of jolt I felt when I learned that 12 of America's presidents, including Washington and Jefferson, were slave owners. Rappleye's book provides vivid testimony to the painful fact that the Browns and the tiny state they helped form were indeed all too much like America, fractured between the ideal of liberty and the reality of chattel slavery.The pugnacious, high-spirited John Brown, born in 1736 (and definitely not to be confused with the later abolitionist), was a Rhode Island business leader and politician whose commercial interests included shipping, rum, banking, iron production — and the slave trade. John's milder younger brother, Moses, participated in all of these businesses. Like John, Moses owned slaves, but a conversion to the Quaker faith in the early 1770's inspired him to set them free. Thereafter Moses was an ardent abolitionist dead set against the traffic in humans that swelled the coffers of his brother.Rappleye, a journalist whose one previous book was about organized crime, skillfully details the complex relationship between these brothers, whose differences over slavery tested but never destroyed their friendship. Their loyalty to each other surfaced dramatically during the American Revolution. In 1772 John helped trigger the Revolution by leading a band of Rhode Islanders that destroyed the Gaspee, a British revenue ship. Moses, a pacifist and conscientious objector, was horrified by the war. Still, when John was later captured by the British, Moses boldly entered the fray, sneaking behind enemy lines and negotiating his brother's release with the British general Thomas Gage.Of the two, John was the more adventurous and entrepreneurial. With breathtaking energy, he started one business after another, rarely missing a chance to turn a profit. Moses, before his religious awakening, proved a capable business partner, and it was not long before the brothers were participating in the so-called triangle trade, in which New England rum was shipped to Africa and exchanged there for blacks, who were chained below decks and taken on a miserable voyage across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, where they were sold into slavery. The proceeds of the slave sales were invested in molasses and sugar that was shipped back to New England to be made into more rum.'"
"'06-05-14,'0','Just in time for Mother's Day — an occasion of anxious ambivalence for most ""children"" over the age of 18 — comes a mother lode of mother worship: gaily painted picture books celebrating the maternal bonds. And what bonds!The brightly colored world in Karen Katz's Mommy Hugs (Margaret K. McElderry/Simon & Schuster, $12.95; ages 1 to 5) begins and ends with Mom: Mom's broad arms in pink sleeves dotted with yellow flowers; Mom's enormous smiling face and heart-shaped mouth; Mom's hands outstretched, as big as the baby they pat, catch and cradle. The words of this ""hug and read book,"" as it's called, describe a dawn-to-dusk day of mama-love, from ""one nuzzle-wuzzle wake-up hug"" to ""10 I love you good-night hugs.""The mothers in Mommy, Carry Me Please! (Holiday House, $16.95; ages 3 to 6), whether simian, reptilian or arachnoid, are similarly omnipotent, though appealingly rendered in Jane Cabrera's tactile acrylic brushstrokes. The mom in Mommy in my Pocket, written by Carol Hunt Senderak and illustrated by Hiroe Nakata (Hyperion, $12.99; ages 2 to 6), is shrunk down to pocket size, for a bunny worried about missing his mother at school. ""All day long, we would never part, Mommy in my pocket, near my beating heart,"" is this bunny's dearest wish.Evolutionary psychology teaches us that young children must stay connected to their mothers at all costs: to fail, or for their mothers to fail them, equals certain death. The myth of the perfectly benevolent mother — her heart pure, her love unconditional — derives from this fundamental evolutionary strategy. Reiterating its truths in picture books like these is a cozy exercise for new moms and their young children. It can be disconcerting — and a tad icky —to read them from a different vantage point, that of an older mom with older kids. From that country, the treacly language trumpeting mom's omnipotence seems almost scary, not altogether wholesome.Soothingly, for those of us not entirely comfortable with a world ruled solely by Mom, the ducks in Martine Kindermans's You and Me (Philomel, $15.99; ages 3 and up) are gender-ambiguous, though painted in rosy watercolors; the book's message, of a parent and child linked forever by love — ""We could cross the world so wide to see what's on the other side"" — isn't so scary-sweet as those perfect-mommy sentiments. I like that the word ""friends"" leavens the message: ""For we are dear and trusted friends, and I will help you home again.""'"
"'06-05-14,'0','As we all know, bad boys are more charming than good ones. Naughtiness, like it or not (and we do), is alluring. Maybe that's why it's easier to forgive a bad boy's captivating faults than a good boy's perfections — assuming, of course, that the bad boy doesn't bite.Here are three books about three dogs — two of them bad boys who try their best to be good, and one almost too good to be true. You can guess who's more appealing.Bobo, the great galumphing hound in Gail Page's ""How to Be a Good Dog,"" is the canine Oscar Madison. He reads with his feet on the coffee table. He rummages in the refrigerator between meals, then eats messy snacks on the living-room furniture. He leaves muddy paw prints everywhere. He chews up homework, though it's not clear whose, since his owner, Mrs. Birdhead, is the only human on the premises. Never mind. This dog finds homework to chew up.When Mrs. Birdhead finally exiles Bobo to the doghouse, he's missed by an unlikely ally — lonely, good-hearted Cat, who plots to restore Bobo to their owner's good graces. Armed with a book on dog obedience, Cat teaches Bobo a few civilizing tricks (lying down comes naturally). The road to perfection is bumpy, and Bobo never quite arrives. But because he tries, he gets a ""good dog"" from his owner, and that's what counts in the end.Pale and plump with a single black spot, Bobo has a Thurberesque squishiness in Page's cartoonlike acrylics. His eyes are never more than two tiny dots, but they're endlessly expressive. How the author accomplishes this, I can't say. But it seems to be an unwritten law that in the world of children's books, the larger the dog, the smaller the eyes, and vice versa.'"

"'06-05-15,'1','Bausch, which is based in Rochester, N.Y., said it had concluded by early last week that MoistureLoc's formulation might raise the risks of eye infections from the Fusarium fungus when contact lens users follow practices like failing to replace the solution regularly or allowing it to evaporate in the lens case.Bausch said its tests showed that in such circumstances, three ingredients designed to make MoistureLoc comfortable on the eye sometimes combine to form a thin film in which Fusarium are protected from MoistureLoc's sterilizing agent. If a lens user is also unlucky enough to have any kind of scratch on his or her cornea, the microbes can then move from the contact lens into the eye and cause a painful inflammation called keratitis.Bausch presented its conclusions to officials from the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. at a hastily arranged meeting in Washington on Thursday that was attended by more than two dozen regulators and technical experts, with others linked in by telephone, according to Praveen Tyle, Bausch's senior vice president for global research and development and chief scientific officer. The F.D.A. asked for a day to review the information and Bausch decided to proceed with the voluntary product recall on Friday, Mr. Zarella said.Mr. Zarella said the announcement was delayed until today because the company needed to contact numerous European health authorities, most of whom were unreachable over the weekend. Because MoistureLoc was withdrawn from the American market in April, Europe and China are the main markets affected by the worldwide recall.MoistureLoc is supplied to Europe from a factory in Italy. Until recently, no Fusarium cases linked to MoistureLoc had been confirmed in Europe, but as of today there have been seven, Mr. Zarella said. There are no known cases linked to contact lens use in China, according to Bausch.The belief that MoistureLoc's formulation is at the least a major contributor to the outbreak is based not just on the company's product tests but also on the lack of evidence turned up for other theories. The inspections of the Greenville factory have produced no sign of microbial contamination of the products packaged there nor of failures in its sterilization processes. Investigators also came up empty when looking into possible tampering with the products during distribution and the possibility that victims had used counterfeit MoistureLoc.Some experts had also theorized that global climate change had allowed Fusarium to spread from the tropics, where it is far more common, or to mutate, but no one has documented such changes, much less linked them to the infections among lens users.Experts in eye infections and fungi were not surprised at Bausch's theory that Fusarium in the lens users' environment had found a weakness in MoistureLoc's defenses. ""Amongst my colleagues, that seemed like the likeliest cause,"" said Dr. Ivan Schwab, professor of ophthalmology at the University of California at Davis. ""Fungi are hardy. They will be here long after all the cockroaches are killed by cosmic radiation.""Dr. Schultz at the F.D.A. said during a news conference that the agency would be reviewing its process for approving Bausch's application to market MoistureLoc but that he did not expect the results to point to any weakness in the agency's regulatory oversight. MoistureLoc, which was introduced late in 2004, was submitted to the F.D.A. as a product ""substantially similar"" to existing products and thus approved with minimal review.Dr. Schultz said the outbreak reflected a complex interaction of design and use that probably would not have shown up even in a far more extensive pre-market review.Instead, Dr. Schultz said, MoistureLoc's problem pointed to the need for closely monitoring how health care products perform after they are in the market, which is not always easy in a country as large as the United States. He noted that the first clear signal linking the outbreak to MoistureLoc came in February from Singapore. All of that country's keratitis infections are treated at single hospital, Dr. Schultz said.'"
"'06-05-15,'1','Paul Lo Duca said the Mets had stolen the game on Saturday night, when he homered in the ninth to beat Derrick Turnbow. But, like they did in at least one of their losses in Philadelphia, the Mets gave away the game Sunday.For the third consecutive day, a Mets starter squandered an early lead. Given a 2-0 advantage in the second inning, Martínez lacked a crackling fastball, so he tried baffling the Brewers by mixing in breaking balls and changeups. Twice, he failed dramatically.Miller and Weeks each homered on changeups, Miller in the second with two runners on — both of whom had walked — and Weeks in the fifth with the bases empty.""Every time I make a mistake, it's a home run,"" Martínez said. ""Not a double, not a triple. A homer.""The Mets put runners in scoring position in four consecutive innings without scoring until finally breaking through with two runs in the seventh to tie the score, 4-4. They needed two Brewers errors to do it.Weeks flubbed a Carlos Delgado grounder with a runner on first and one out. Both runners scored when right fielder Geoff Jenkins failed to bend low enough to backhand David Wright's single, which rolled to the wall. Weeks, the cutoff man, also hesitated before throwing home, costing the Brewers a chance to get Delgado.The game went back and forth from there, but the blown opportunities in the middle of the game — mainly against starter Doug Davis, who threw 104 pitches in five innings and walked five — nagged Manager Willie Randolph afterward.José Valentin's two-out, two-run double in the second, after two walks, provided the only runs off Davis. The Mets finished 3 for 15 with runners in scoring position, 1 for 6 against Davis.""Any time a pitcher is struggling and he gets off the hook, those kind of situations bother you more than any other,"" Randolph said. ""But that's what happens when you don't knock people out when you have them on the ropes and you have the pitches to hit. They came back to haunt us.""The messiness continued. At first base, Delgado mishandled a sacrifice bunt by Weeks in the eighth after reliever Duaner Sánchez got in his way, and Jenkins put the Brewers ahead with a sacrifice fly.Turnbow was one out away from earning the save in the ninth when Xavier Nady beat out a chopper to Hall at short, allowing Delgado to score from third. Hall's jump throw bounced toward the right-field side of first, Prince Fielder dived for it, and the umpire Laz Diaz appeared ready to call Nady out until seeing the ball rolling free.The Mets wasted 10th-inning singles by Valentin, who had four hits, and Kazuo Matsui when Jorge De La Rosa struck out Carlos Beltrán. In the bottom of the 10th, Valentin, who had moved to right field from left, threw out Weeks at second as he tried to stretch a single. But Bradford, in his second inning of work, fell behind Hall, 2-0, and tried to get him waving at a low fastball.""I don't know if I got it there,"" Bradford said.Martínez said: ""Something has to go wrong for them one time in this whole series. One time. Those guys are really hot. Everything is going well for them right now.""The Mets headed to St. Louis looking for their luck to change. ""I'm not going to predict right now,"" Martínez said. ""Hopefully things won't be so difficult over there. Hopefully we'll take more advantage of situations and make better pitches when it counts.""The Mets still have not decided who will start Thursday in St. Louis or Friday at home against the Yankees, WILLIE RANDOLPH said. ... The Brewers played for the third time in their retro white pinstriped uniforms with glove logo (think Harvey's Wallbangers, circa 1982). They lost the two previous games in which they wore the uniforms by a combined score of 18-0. ... PEDRO MARTíNEZ recorded the 107th double-digit strikeout game of his career Sunday. ... The slumping CLIFF FLOYD did not start for the second consecutive game. He entered in the ninth inning in a double switch and struck out looking in his only at-bat to drop his average to .195.'"
"'06-05-15,'1','Molly's story began last summer when, apparently abandoned by her owners, she was found wandering in a pasture in St. Charles Parish after Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana.An animal rescue group alerted Ms. Harris to Molly's plight, and she brought the horse to her farm to join other abandoned animals and 17 ponies she cares for and sometimes provides for children's parties.Among the adopted animals was the pit bull terrier, who Ms. Harris said had shown no signs of aggression until it turned on Molly. Ms. Harris said she did not see the initial attack, but arrived while the dog was still biting Molly.""He gnawed on this pony like a meat grinder,"" Ms. Harris said.She said she did not want the dog euthanized, recognizing that the hurricane left many animals traumatized, so she found a home for him with people who were skilled at handling pets with behavior problems.When Dr. Barca examined Molly after the dog attack, she did not give the horse much hope of surviving. But after Molly's leg became infected, Dr. Barca accompanied Ms. Harris to L.S.U. to try to persuade veterinarians there to operate.Initially the doctors refused. But after observing Molly for a couple of days, Dr. Rustin M. Moore, the director of the veterinary school's equine health studies program and a veterinary surgeon, noticed that the horse would shift her weight and rest her good leg, and he became convinced that she would be a good candidate for a prosthesis.""She's very intelligent, and she knows how to take care of herself,"" Dr. Moore said.The doctors contacted a local company, Bayou Orthotic and Prosthetic Center, to see if it could build a limb for Molly. The company had never made a limb for an animal, but Dwayne Mara, who builds artificial limbs for the company, agreed to try.Dr. Moore consulted with the handful of veterinarians who had tried the operation, asking about technique and about complications. Mr. Mara watched ponies walk to see how their joints bent as they moved. He studied horse anatomy. He calculated how much weight the limb would need to support.In January, during a holiday break at the university, Dr. Moore and a team of surgeons amputated Molly's leg and fitted her with a hollow cast with a pole that she could use to balance. They knew almost immediately after the operation that it had been a success.""She went out and she went right to putting her weight on it,"" Ms. Harris said, ""and I just cried because I knew it was going to work.""The operation cost $5,000, and the prosthesis company did not charge for the artificial leg, Ms. Harris said.After the operation, Molly was taken to the prosthesis center. Children with medical conditions like spina bifida who were being fitted with orthotics flocked to her, amazed at the horse who was getting a metal leg.""She's changed my mind looking at any animal from here on out,"" Mr. Mara said. ""I'll tell you that.""'"
"'06-05-15,'1','PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, May 14 (Reuters) — President René Préval took office and appealed for peace in Haiti on Sunday as his troubled Caribbean nation inaugurated its first democratically elected leader since Jean-Bertrand Aristide fled more than two years ago.Scores of people chanted for Mr. Aristide's return from exile in South Africa as Mr. Préval took the oath of office.Shortly before the ceremony, the police and United Nations peacekeepers fired tear gas at the nearby National Penitentiary to quell a riot.Mr. Préval, a 63-year-old agronomist who was president of Haiti from 1996 to 2001, takes the place of a United States-backed interim administration appointed after Mr. Aristide left Haiti in February 2004 in the face of a rebellion and under pressure from Washington and Paris to quit.Mr. Préval appealed for peace in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas. Haiti is struggling to establish a stable democracy after decades of dictatorship and military rule and recent political violence that took hundreds of lives.'"
"'06-05-15,'1','His remarks followed a bruising controversy over the discovery that more than 1,000 foreign prisoners, including 150 convicted of serious crimes, including murder and rape, had been freed after serving their prison terms without being considered for deportation. Those disclosures cost the previous home secretary, Charles Clarke, his job in a recent government reshuffling by Mr. Blair.In the past week, the debate resurfaced in different forms. In one case, a convicted rapist, Anthony Rice, killed a 40-year-old woman after being freed on parole. Andrew Bridges, the chief inspector of prisons, said too much attention had been paid to his rights.In another case, a High Court judge castigated the government for failing to grant permanent residency to nine Afghans, who hijacked a plane to Britain in 2000 saying they were fleeing from the Taliban.After their conviction in the hijacking was overturned, an immigration court ruled that they should be given refugee status because they would be in danger if they were deported back to Afghanistan. In an unusual harsh criticism of a judicial ruling, which accused the government of abusing its powers, Mr. Blair condemned the decision as ""an abuse of common sense."" Mr. Reid, the home secretary, called the decision ""inexplicable or bizarre.""In the radio interview, Lord Falconer said, ""There needs to be public clarity that the Human Rights Act should have no effect on the public safety issues. Public safety comes first.""In his letter to Mr. Reid, Mr. Blair said, ""We will need to look again at whether primary legislation is needed to address the issue of court rulings which overrule the government in a way that is inconsistent with other European Union countries' interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights.""Mr. Blair asked Mr. Reid to ""ensure that the law-abiding majority can live without fear,"" the letter said. Details of the letter were published in The Observer on Sunday and later confirmed by Mr. Blair's office.In a television interview on Sunday, Lord Falconer said Britain did not plan to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, which was written into British law by the Human Rights Act in 1998. But, he said, the government was concerned about the way the values reflected in the legislation had been applied.In an editorial, The Observer said, ""This hostility to the Human Rights Act rests on the myth that it empowers criminals at the expense of law-abiding citizens; in fact, it protects citizens from the abuse by the state.""But Jan Berry, the chairwoman of the Police Federation, which represents officers, indicated that the organization would support a change in the law, saying, ""In some respects I think our law at the moment has actually got the balance wrong between rights and responsibilities.""Some political analysts interpreted Mr. Blair's moves as an attempt to grab back the political initiative, after days of unrelenting speculation over when he might step down in favor of his rival, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer. In response, Lord Falconer said: ""He is the prime minister. He's remaining the prime minister.""Yet two London newspapers reported Sunday that Mr. Blair had told members of his cabinet that he planned to step down next summer to give a successor time to prepare for the next general election, expected in 2009.Mr. Blair's office refused to comment on the reports.'"
"'06-05-15,'1','""When I started raising the issue, many politicians didn't even know the term downloading,"" Mr. Ridouan said. ""My role often involves telling politicians and audiences what high school students like me are doing today.""When he was on vacation from school in early May, Mr. Ridouan spent five days in Paris meeting members of Parliament and juggling more than half a dozen media appearances before leading several hundred protesters through the streets of Paris.""Aziz has been courageous in fighting the medieval-style crusade the music industry runs against music downloaders,"" said Christian Paul, a member of the Socialist Party. ""Sooner or later the music industry will learn they need to adapt to Aziz and his generation.""To adversaries, Mr. Ridouan merely offers facile rationalizations for theft.""You might call him Robin Hood if he gave to the poor by only stealing from the rich. But downloading doesn't just take money from Tom Cruise and Madonna,"" said Pascal Rogard, the director general of the Society of Dramatic Authors and Composers, a group dedicated to protecting authors' copyrights. ""There are many smaller artists who live from the earnings that Aziz refuses to give them.""French-born of parents, now divorced, who immigrated from Morocco, Mr. Ridouan lives in a government-subsidized building in the central Loire region of France with his mother, who works as a cleaning woman. He introduced his association in 2004 by declaring his downloading habit in the middle of a news conference called by a music industry trade group to announce a crackdown on 50 Internet pirates.""Until we started speaking out in public, downloaders were only shown on television like terrorists, with their face hidden and voice scrambled,"" Mr. Ridouan said.At the news conference, where he held the Hewlett-Packard laptop computer he always seems to carry above his head, Mr. Ridouan added: ""I am proud to tell anyone that I download and have plenty of music, movies and TV series on my computer.""The amount of media and consumer attention given to Apple Computer's iTunes service serves only to demonstrate how badly the entertainment industry has addressed young people, Mr. Ridouan said.""The price for downloaded music is set at a level that includes the cost of making and shipping a compact disc,"" Mr. Ridouan said, pointing to the similarity of music prices in shops and online. ""You can be certain that the money they saved is not going back to the artists.""Mr. Ridouan said he was eager and willing to compensate artists, but not at the rate that record companies demanded. As for the amount he can pay, Mr. Ridouan said that for a high school student living with his single mother, he cannot afford much.""The Internet is a magnificent new way to distribute culture, and why should I be stopped because of my limited means?"" Mr. Ridouan said. ""The Internet serves my generation the same role as the library did for previous generations.""The solution advocated by Mr. Ridouan is to create a fund, financed by fees from Internet users and Internet service providers, to pay artists based on the popularity of their works, similar to the system used by radio stations.Legalizing all Internet downloading for a small fee was briefly tagged onto the copyright law in December by the National Assembly, then discarded.Mr. Ridouan, who intends to study political science in college, said his Audionautes-financed lobbying did not hurt his studies. He has missed some school but has a note from the French interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, excusing him from class when he meets with government officials.""There's no need for me to fake notes to skip class ever since I got Sarkozy's written permission,"" said Mr. Ridouan. ""I don't even have the note anymore because my teacher wanted to keep it as a souvenir.""'"
"'06-05-15,'1','When David Horowitz, the editor in chief of the conservative online journal FrontPage, published the pamphlet ""Campus Support for Terrorism"" last year, he put a photograph of Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford, on the cover. The move effectively relocated an ideological battle between Mr. Horowitz and Mr. Beinin, who has criticized the war in Iraq, from the pages of newspapers and magazines to the courtroom.In March, Mr. Beinin filed a complaint charging copyright infringement against Mr. Horowitz and the Center for the Study of Popular Culture, which Mr. Horowitz founded and heads. He said an earlier request faxed to Mr. Horowitz to take his likeness off the pamphlet had been ignored, leaving him no recourse but legal action.""The title of the booklet clearly means to say that I am a supporter of terrorism and there is absolutely no truth to that. There is not even a claim of that within the booklet itself,"" said Mr. Beinin, who asked for and was granted the rights to the photograph after he learned of the cover. (The cover has four photos, including one of Sami al-Arian, a former professor who last month pleaded guilty in Tampa, Fla., to helping the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad.)""I have spoken against terrorism, written against terrorism many times, and I object to the illegal use of my photograph for that reason,"" Mr. Beinin said.Mr. Horowitz said he never saw any fax from Mr. Beinin and first learned of the complaint through the lawsuit. A formal answer to Mr. Beinin's complaint, filed last week on behalf of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture, asserted that revised covers of the pamphlet in subsequent printings would not have the photograph.But the picture, Mr. Horowitz said, is beside the point, adding, ""The leftists claim to be concerned about the chilling of free speech, but think nothing of using the courts to chill speech.""

"'06-05-16,'0','Boeing declined to comment, but said in a statement that ""Boeing will accept responsibility for the conduct of its employees and make additional commitments regarding ongoing compliance.""News of the settlement was first reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal.Analysts estimate that the settlement will depress Boeing's 2006 earnings by 59 cents to 75 cents a share, but say the agreement will lift a taint of corruption from Boeing and better position it to bid on Pentagon business. Boeing's stock, which had been rising for two years, closed at $85.86 yesterday, down $1.15.""This is a heck of a penalty,"" said Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst with Jefferies & Company. ""But it has eliminated the 'bad citizenship' knock from being on the company. It pushes into the past things that were done in the past. And it gets rid of the uncertainty that a defense contractor could have been convicted of fraud or a felony.""Settlement of the charges also reflects efforts by the chief executive of Boeing, W. James McNerney Jr., who was hired last year after the two previous Boeing chief executives resigned under fire. Mr. McNerney responded to the ethical controversies by reorganizing the company's military business, putting a new emphasis on training and pressing for a resolution of the investigations.""McNerney inherited a company in crisis,"" said Loren B. Thompson, a military industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, a Washington-area research group. ""There was a danger that all these controversies would distract the company from getting business. His top goal was to eliminate these distractions. To announce that this controversy is behind them would be a major breakthrough.""The settlement grew out of two investigations into the company. In one, Boeing employees were found to have stolen thousands of pages of proprietary documents from Lockheed in the late 1990's and used them to help bid for government rocket-launch business.To penalize the company, the Pentagon stripped Boeing of $1 billion in Pentagon rocket-launch business in 2004. In March, it was allowed to bid for rocket-launch business after a 20-month suspension, the longest for any major military contractor.In the other case, Boeing was found to have improperly recruited an Air Force contracting official, Darleen A. Druyun, while she was still at the Pentagon, where she was overseeing billions of dollars in Boeing business. Ms. Druyun later admitted to steering contracts to Boeing to help her get a job with the company. Ms. Druyun was fired from Boeing, and then pleaded guilty to conflict-of-interest charges and was sentenced to a nine-month prison term. Michael M. Sears, Boeing's former chief financial officer who had met with Ms. Druyun to recruit her, was also fired, and later jailed.Those scandals also led to the resignation of Philip M. Condit, then Boeing chief executive. His successor, Harry C. Stonecipher, was fired last year after an extramarital affair with a Boeing employee.Mr. McNerney has taken several steps to clean up the company. He allowed Boeing's in-house counsel, Douglas G. Bain, to make a blistering presentation to Boeing executives at a meeting in Orlando, Fla., this year about unethical behavior.He reorganized Boeing's military division to provide for greater accountability. He has brought in J. Michael Luttig, who resigned last week from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, based in Richmond, Va., to replace Mr. Bain, who is retiring. Mr. Luttig's name had surfaced as a possible candidate for the Supreme Court.In addition, the Boeing board recently altered the company's executive compensation plan to put more emphasis on ethical behavior.""One by one, McNerney has addressed all the issues getting in the way of running the company smoothly,"" Mr. Thompson of the Lexington Institute said.'"

"'06-05-16,'0','""We have been talking to the Department of Labor, and they will come out and conduct the tests they deem necessary when we report to them that we believe the tram is ready to resume operation,"" Mr. Liff said.On April 18, 68 people were trapped after the tramway's primary electrical system failed. The diesel-powered backup system also failed. In the end, rescue workers had to ride out on the lines in an emergency cage and finally on a crane to bring all of the riders to safety.Operators have tried 400 test runs since the 30-year-old tramway broke down. All the runs failed until the primary electrical system was replaced, Mr. Liff said. Since then, every test run has been successful. Tramway workers are examining the old system, which was installed in 2001, to determine whether a wiring problem caused the tram to stop.Whatever the problem, Joyce Mincheff, a longtime Roosevelt Island resident who has been using the tramway since it opened, said she was hoping for an announcement that operations were about to resume. She said residents had had a hard time getting around, especially late at night, without the tram.A private bus that operates on Roosevelt Island taking commuters to Queens and the Upper East Side has expanded its service, but Ms. Mincheff said the system was far from perfect. The bus runs every half hour during peak commuting times and every hour otherwise but ends at 11 p.m.Although the F line runs to Roosevelt Island, she said the lack of a direct connection to the Lexington Avenue line made subway travel inconvenient for many.She said the limited transportation had been particularly hard on the island's school-age students, 65 percent of whom attend school in Manhattan and used the tram to get to their buses. In addition, more than 400 employees, students and faculty members at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center live on Roosevelt Island and use the tram to get to work.Years ago there was a ferry that ran to and from Roosevelt Island, she said, adding that the island clearly needed the ferry service again, not as a replacement, but as a backup to the tramway. The subject of ferry service, as well as other alternative transportation, is likely to come up during Thursday's meeting, Mr. Liff said.""What happened is a catalyst to speed up those conversations,"" he said.'"
"'06-05-16,'0','MINNEAPOLIS, May 15 (AP) — The Target Corporation, the nation's second-largest discount retailer, said yesterday that its fiscal first-quarter profit rose 12 percent, but the results narrowly missed Wall Street estimates.Target earned $554 million, or 63 cents a share, for the quarter ended April 29, up from $494 million, or 55 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The results were a penny a share below the estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial.First-quarter revenue rose 12.1 percent, to $12.86 billion, from $11.5 billion a year earlier. Sales rose 5.1 percent at stores open at least a year, a crucial retail barometer.Target said profit rose on the strength of store revenue and contributions from its credit card business, which added $162 million to earnings before taxes. That was an increase of $60 million, or almost 60 percent, from the period last year.The company said its credit card profit grew because of higher interest income and the short-term benefit of expenses for bad debts because many people rushed to file for bankruptcy before the rules changed last fall.Target is second only to Wal-Mart Stores among the nation's biggest discount retailers.Douglas A. Scovanner, Target's chief financial officer, said analysts' estimates that the company would earn 69 cents a share for the second quarter and $3.11 for the full year ""appear reasonable.""""On balance, our first-quarter performance gives me even greater confidence than 90 days ago in our ability to generate a midteen percentage increase in 2006 earnings per share,"" he said'"
"'06-05-16,'0','WASHINGTON, May 15 (AP) — Cynthia A. Glassman, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced on Monday that she would not serve a second term after her current one expires next month.Ms. Glassman's move will open one of the three Republican seats on the five-member commission.In January 2002, as the controversy over the collapse of the Enron Corporation swirled in Washington, President Bush used his recess appointment power to put Ms. Glassman, then a principal at the accounting firm Ernst & Young, on the commission — bypassing the Senate confirmation process. She was approved by the Senate in the summer of that year.On several occasions during the tenure of William H. Donaldson as S.E.C. chairman, Ms. Glassman sided with a fellow Republican commissioner, Paul S. Atkins, to vote against initiatives favored by Mr. Donaldson, a Bush appointee, and the two Democrats.Ms. Glassman made her intention to resign known in a letter to President Bush on Monday. She did not set a date for her departure. Her term ends on June 5; S.E.C. commissioners often remain for up to 18 months if they are not replaced.Ms. Glassman, who is also an economist, did not disclose plans for her next job.She is credited with leading the initiative to establish an $85 million fund for investor education using money collected from Wall Street's biggest investment houses in a landmark $1.4 billion settlement of conflict-of-interest charges.Ms. Glassman has also advocated the use of more stringent cost-benefit analyses in S.E.C. decisions on new rules.'"

"'06-05-16,'0','The estimate comparing how much money the government collects up front versus the taxes it will lose in the future comes from the Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit research organization that often produces reports critical of the administration's tax policy but whose computer model the Treasury Department considers reliable. The center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, is run by tax experts who served President Ronald Reagan, the first President Bush and President Bill Clinton.Part of the tax savings arises from rules, set by Congress, that require people to withdraw money from traditional retirement accounts starting the year after the one in which they turn 70. For Roths, mandatory withdrawals apply only to heirs, permitting the magic of compound interest to swell the accounts' value for a much longer time for those willing to leave the money alone.Leonard Burman, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, said the estimated tax savings was based on current income tax rates. The savings would be greater if tax rates rose in the future, as Mr. Burman says they will because the government is spending more than it is taking in.The Treasury Department made two senior tax policy advisers available on condition that they not be named. Those advisers expressed respect for the care Mr. Burman applies to his work. But they noted that the government makes tax estimates only for 5- and 10-year periods, while Mr. Burman's is for 43 years.Under the 10-year period covered by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation's official estimate, the Roth conversions would raise $6.4 billion in taxes in the short run. But because the government will not collect taxes on the future investment gains, the Tax Policy Center estimates that through 2049, the conversions will cost the government $53.3 billion.The center calculated the value of the taxes and savings as if everything happened today, known to economists as the net present value. The center estimated that those taxpayers who took full advantage of the deal would stand to gain $3,500 for every $1,000 of tax paid, for a net gain of $2,500, costing the government the same amount.The Treasury officials noted that if tax rates fell or the government switched from an income tax to a consumption tax, the estimated tax savings would shrink or even vanish.The Treasury officials also warned that people who converted to Roths might be worse off, especially if they withdrew their money quickly instead of allowing their Roth accounts to grow in value.And one of the officials, in discussing the expected advertising by investment houses encouraging conversions, warned that much of the tax advice on Roths that he saw promoted on the Internet was flawed. He noted that even technical violations of retirement savings rules could result in draconian tax penalties. ""This is a very tricky area,"" he said.Roth IRA's are now available only to couples making less than $160,000 and single people making less than $110,000. But in 2010 anyone, regardless of income, would be permitted to roll over unlimited sums from IRA's into a Roth.Everyone interviewed agreed that the smart strategy would be to pay the taxes from a source outside of the retirement account being converted to a Roth. That would preserve the amount of money available to generate tax-free returns.To help people cover the tax on the conversion, the measure would permit the taxes to be paid in two installments, in 2011 and 2012. An almost identical deal was signed into law by President Clinton, permitting such conversions to Roths in 1998, but with the taxes paid in four annual installments.Ed Slott, a Long Island accountant who publishes a newsletter about how to get the most out of retirement accounts, said that for savers, this was the best deal from the government in a long time.""You can't beat a zero tax rate,"" said Mr. Slott, author of ""Parlay Your IRA Into a Family Fortune.""'"

"'06-05-16,'0','The strategy, studio representatives say, is to preserve a climate of mystery and excitement around the movie, despite the fact that anyone who is interested probably already knows the plot.""There was an inordinate amount of interest in this film, and we wanted to contain the excitement and anticipation,"" said Valerie Van Galder, president of domestic marketing for Sony Pictures, speaking from London, where executives and the cast had gathered to take a train with selected media representatives down to Cannes. ""We wanted people to see the movie for themselves and not react to months of endless debate about the movie.""While that approach has not prevented the debate, it was particularly championed by Brian Grazer, the film's producer, said executives involved with the film, who were granted anonymity because of the studio's policy of secrecy regarding the film. To limit exposure in the age of blogs and constant leaks, both Sony and Mr. Grazer's company, Imagine Entertainment, decided to forgo test screenings, a form of market research usually considered critical to fine-tuning a picture.In the past, Mr. Howard has said he would be loath to release a film without it. In a 1998 interview with CNN about test screenings, he said: ""What I would hate to do is put the movie out there, find out that the audience is confused about something or upset about something that you could have fixed, and go, 'God, I had no idea they'd respond that way.' ""Instead, the film was shown on the Sony lot, with strict security, to close friends and family of the filmmakers, said Michael Rosenberg, the president of Imagine. Their comments were used in place of more scientific feedback, he said.The concerns, said executives involved with the picture, were that information about the film could start a nit-picking debate over the filmmaker's choices in adapting the book, rather than focus on the movie overall, or that it might fuel religious opposition to the film.Early in the marketing, tension arose between Sony and Imagine over the approach to take, with Sony more inclined to feed mass interest in the film, and Imagine focused on trying to maintain more of the film's mystery, said executives close to the project. In addition, Sony was worried about contributing to a religious controversy over the perceived anti-Catholic aspect of the film — which has elements in the Catholic Church conspiring to conceal the secret life of Christ — while Imagine wanted to use the controversy as a promotional tool, an executive said.At one point Sony favored taking out an ad during the Super Bowl, which Imagine opposed. The studio and producers also turned down the offer of a Time magazine cover, which some might consider to be the Holy Grail of free publicity (perhaps a misnomer in this case, however), because the magazine editors needed to see the film to do so.Jeff Blake, vice chairman of Sony Pictures, disputed the notion of tension with Imagine. ""I have been as close to it as anybody, and I found them to be so helpful in this process,"" he said. ""A lot of issues come up that don't normally come up. We're very happy with the result.""With movie research showing awareness of the film at 96 percent, and the barometer of ""definite interest"" polling at around 60 percent, the studio is most concerned to do nothing that could put a dent in those figures. Industry estimates of the film's expected ticket sales for the opening weekend at the domestic box office range from $70 million to over $100 million. The marketing materials were also designed to nod at elements of the film without revealing too much: first came the iconic image of the Mona Lisa from the cover of the best-selling book, followed by pictures of Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou as the characters trying to solve a murder in the Louvre, followed by a picture of Silas, the evil conspirator from the Catholic group Opus Dei and Mr. Hanks and Ms. Tautou — photographed from above — as they rush past a group of nuns.But much is at stake with this film, as even the most close-mouthed officials will privately acknowledge. One executive close to the film, who acknowledged being nervous, said, ""There are amazing expectations on this title, and there is no knowledge of what the audience and the critics will think.""'"

"'06-05-16,'0','Built in 1852 to house an orange grove, with a glass facade facing south across the Seine, the Orangerie was used to billet soldiers on leave from the trenches during World War I. After the armistice of Nov. 11, 1918, the French prime minister, Georges Clemenceau, invited his friend Claude Monet to display his large-format nymphéas there.Monet had been working on them since 1914 in a spacious studio added onto his Normandy home in Giverny. And he would continue painting these vast canvases until his death at 86. The following year, 1927, eight were finally installed in two specially designed oval-shaped rooms in the Orangerie.Waterlilies dominated the last 30 years of Monet's life.""These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me,"" he wrote to a friend in 1909. ""It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."" In total, he painted some 250 oils of the vegetation in and around the Japanese-style lagoon at Giverny.They are to be found in major museums around the world, as well as at the Musée d'Orsay and, prominently, at the Musée Marmottan-Monet, both in Paris. Yet the Orangerie series is unique, not least because of its size: each painting is two meters, or six and a half feet, tall. If lined up side by side, the works would measure 91 meters, or 298.5 feet, in width. They are also conceived so that the four in one gallery represent sunrise, and the four in the other evoke dusk.Most striking, though, is how these paintings, particularly those of dusk, come close to abstraction: it is as if this master of Impressionism had chosen to leap beyond post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Cubism and other new movements and prepare the way for Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko more than two decades later.After World War II, Monet was himself somewhat out of vogue. And in the 1960's, when Juliette Walter sold the collection of her first husband, Paul Guillaume, to the French state, no one thought it odd to alter the Orangerie to accommodate those 144 paintings. Twice married and twice widowed, Mrs. Walter also named the collection after her second husband, Jean Walter.It was at this point that the 328-foot-long rectangular Orangerie was given a second floor, one that blocked the natural lighting intended for the nymphéas. For a while, at least, the newly arrived works by Renoir, Cézanne, Picasso, Matisse, Modigliani, André Derain and Chaim Soutine became the stars of the museum.Today, however, with Monet one of the art world's biggest draws, the new renovation was aimed at restoring the museum to the way he had imagined it. The second floor was demolished so that once again the nymphéas enjoy natural light, which, with the changing weather, seasons and hours of the day, constantly alters their mood.Mr. Brochet, the architect, said unexpected problems arose because, despite the Orangerie's elegant neo-Classical exterior, it was in fact constructed shoddily. ""It was thrown up quickly, without proper foundations,"" he said. ""I have just been in Shanghai. They would have torn it down and rebuilt it properly. But that would not be possible here.""A fresh complication was posed by the discovery of remnants of a 16th-century city wall in the area assigned to the new Walter-Guillaume galleries. This led to a prolonged bureaucratic squabble over how the wall should be treated: in the end, a 30-foot section has been preserved and is now incorporated into the design.In these new galleries, natural light floods a wide corridor where oils by Renoir and Cézanne are given pride of place. Other rooms are devoted to more modern masters like Picasso and Matisse. The museum's collection of works by Soutine is arguably the best in Paris.Still, for all the extra space gained, what perhaps matters most is that the Orangerie is once again a shrine to Monet and his beloved waterlilies: anyone lucky enough to be alone with the nymphéas is invited to meditate, perchance to dream.'"

"'06-05-16,'0','Older men with low levels of estrogen are at greater risk for hip fractures, a new study reports, and those with low levels of both estrogen and testosterone are at the greatest risk of all.Researchers at Boston University and the Hebrew SeniorLife in Boston examined 793 men with an average age of 71 at the beginning of the research. The participants, followed by these researchers for almost 20 years, were part of the long-term Framingham Heart Study.Their total levels of testosterone and estradiol, an estrogen hormone, were measured at the start, and by the end of the study, 39 men had suffered hip fractures stemming from minor accidents like falls.After adjusting for age, body mass index, height and smoking status, the scientists found no correlation between testosterone levels and hip fracture. But men with the lowest estrogen levels were three times as likely to suffer fractures as those with the highest levels. Men with the lowest levels of both estrogen and testosterone had a risk more than six times as great as those with higher levels of both hormones.The study appears in the May issue of The American Journal of Medicine.Men and women produce estrogen and testosterone, though in different proportions.

One of the more extensive studies was published in 1999 and focused on flight attendants.From 1973 to 1994, the study examined the medical records and work activity of 1,751 pregnant flight attendants. The study, published in The Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, did not find high rates of complications.It did find that the flight attendants who worked during the early stages of pregnancy had a slightly higher risk of miscarriage than their peers who took time off, but it was unclear whether undue stress or various other factors were to blame.'"

It sheds so much light onto Microsoft's master business plan, that I couldn't help reproducing most of it here:""The group you want to think about isn't an insular group of Microsoft employees--it's Microsoft and its OEMs [original equipment manufacturers, the companies that build the computers that Microsoft suggests]. The Microsoft people were probably more aware of the coming failures than the OEMs ever were.""Microsoft relies on OEMs. And OEMs, in their slim-margin business, rely on a healthy volume of people upgrading or buying new hardware. The tablet PC, the UMPC and the ill-fated Mira (a portable display-only tablet), were joint efforts whereby Microsoft--in the interminable stretches between releases of Windows--attempts to advance the Windows platform AND keep its OEMs engaged, excited and healthy.""Imagine being an OEM, like Dell, that ships Windows boxes. 'Windows Vista is delayed again for HOW long?', you might think. 'Maybe I should keep up with all this Linux excitement. And by the way, I better figure out how to keep Wall Street and my suppliers happy for another 6-month--12 month--(sigh)--delay.'""So Microsoft approaches these OEMs with a prototype and says, 'Wouldn't it be great if the market could have something like THIS? In fact, we have a great piece of software for this. All you guys need to do is design one with your own logos and sell it. We'll promote it with you, partners.'""Now, often, Microsoft really *has* thought the problem through. First, it has years of experience, and failures, to call upon. Second, reference [prototype] designs fill in most of the blanks for a manufacturer. The prototype has probably been usability tested at Microsoft, along with the software, in ways OEMs would and could never spend to do. And reference designs often also include market research that suggests things like a price.""That's when reality kicks in. First, the manufacturers have to add their own touches, partly for differentiation and partly because they believe that THEY know their customers best. These touches add delays and cost to the effort. Second, politics often also come into play. When Microsoft sits down with a Dell, an HP or a Samsung, the business of ALL their business come into play--including the all-important Windows licenses--and support for or against something like the UMPC becomes a bargaining chip for both sides. 'You do this, and I'll stand up at your press event and also buy/invest in this standard or that standard,' etc.""And so, a compromised design or an unnecessary feature gets added here and there, adding time/delay, adding cost...""Finally, at the other end of all that, there's the issue of follow-through. A few months later than planned, and some factor more expensive than originally planned, the train is rolling. Microsoft puts its weight behind the concept and, correctly I think, keeps pushing for what it believes is truly a winner in version 2, version 3. If you read between the lines, you can tell where Microsoft thinks a product is in its 'maturity' based on which executive announces it, where, and when.""It's like when a new Robin Williams movie comes out and he appears on the requisite TV circuit put together by the studio. Sometimes he spends his entire interview talking about his movie. Sometimes, even if he's done a great job himself, he spends his time talking about politics or feng shui. We all know what he thinks about the movie, based on the distance he keeps from it.""I hope this helps you see how Microsoft and OEMs, all acting pretty rationally, sometimes have to take a longer route to get from point A (a good idea) to point B (a good execution). There are MANY potential pitfalls when one entity controls too much of a design, including cost, insular thinking and inevitable blind spots.""It does indeed, Mark. Many thanks!'"
"'06-05-17,'0','LONDON, May 17 — The rumors began almost as soon as they began dating: that she was a publicity-crazed fantasist; that he was too addled by romance to notice that, among other things, his children detested her. But all the pessimism about the marriage of Sir Paul McCartney and his wife, Heather Mills McCartney, seemed justified today when the couple announced that they had formally separated after four years of marriage.Despite reports in the British news media of knock-down fights in recent days, the couple said in a joint statement that the split was amicable and that ""both of us still care about each other very much."" But, they added, they have ""found it increasingly difficult to maintain a normal relationship with constant intrusion into our private lives."" They asked ""for the sake of our baby daughter, that we will be given some space and time to get through this difficult period.""The statement made no mention of trying to get back together. Nor did it mention divorce, an issue potentially complicated by the fact that Sir Paul has a massive fortune — 825 million pounds, The Evening Standard reported — and by the lack of a pre-nuptial agreement. Although the British news media reported at the time of the wedding that Sir Paul's children had insisted that he sign such an agreement, he later said he had not, considering it ""unromantic."" Besides, a publicist for Lady McCartney said on her Web site, ""he knew it was completely unnecessary.""At first, the relationship between Sir Paul, the now-63-year-old ex-Beatle with the preternaturally boyish face, and Lady McCartney, now 38, a former model whom he met in 1999 through her charity work, seemed blessed.He was a famously uxorious man who was said to have spent only one night away from his first wife, Linda, in 29 years of marriage (she died of cancer in 1998). Ms. Mills, as she was then, had overcome a brutal past that included an abusive father, periods of destitution and homelessness, and the loss of her leg after she was hit by a police motorcycle while crossing a street in London in 1993.'"

"'06-05-17,'0','The Heat's plan has included forcing Jefferson to drive the ball to the middle of the lane. Once there, several defenders can clog the lane and make him pass the ball. Each time he has tried to spin around a defender, Heat guard Gary Payton said, another defender has been there to meet him.""We have been making him make plays that he has not normally been seeing,"" Payton said. ""He's been kicking the ball, and it's not been easy and comfortable for him.""The Heat has also focused on not letting Jefferson, or any other Net, get out in transition. Payton said that each time a Heat player shoots, at least two teammates should be backpedaling.Jefferson, with point guard Jason Kidd leading the way, has shown a penchant for running in the open court more than any other Net. Some have wondered whether the bruised bone in his right ankle has hampered his quickness.But Jefferson has called the injury he sustained in Game 1 a ""nonissue.""Vaughn said it seemed as if Jefferson has not been getting the same looks that he did before the injury. Before Jefferson was hurt, he was more effective in transition and in one-on-one situations against Heat forward Antoine Walker, Vaughn said.""The time and value of the shots were a little different"" before the injury, Vaughn said.Jefferson has not been able to take advantage of Walker, who is bigger yet slower.Jefferson has not openly expressed frustration over his offensive struggles, but he has been disappointed by his inability to get to the free-throw line. He shot only 10 free throws in the first four games.But Jefferson has tried to deflect the focus from himself.""I'm more concerned with the team,"" he said.SURPRISED BY SUSPENSION Nets forward Lamond Murray said that several Nets, including himself and forward Cliff Robinson, took what they thought was their final drug test of the season in early April. That was about six weeks before the N.B.A. suspended Robinson last Friday for violating the league's anti-drug program.League policy states that all players are subject to up to four random drug tests a season. But because of a prior marijuana offense, Robinson is subject to testing at any time.He could have been asked to take another test since then.Either way, Murray said he did not see the suspension coming.""I was surprised, period, that he got suspended,"" Murray said.Robinson's five-game suspension has severely hampered the Nets. He has been their best reserve, and his defense against Heat center Shaquille O'Neal was a valuable asset.On Monday, Robinson made his first appearance at the Nets' practice facility in East Rutherford, N.J., since his suspension.

"'06-05-17,'0','In a relatively mild protest, dozens of Columbia College seniors opened brightly colored umbrellas and wore matching buttons yesterday during a graduation event to symbolize opposition to the featured speaker, Senator John McCain of Arizona.Mr. McCain, who is considered likely to seek the Republican nomination for president in 2008, spoke about his support for the Iraq war and his own captivity as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He urged Americans to argue over matters of war and peace, but to do so civilly.On balance, the applause for Mr. McCain outweighed the boos, and students limited their demonstrations to the visual variety. Some seniors scrawled ""No War"" and ""Pro-Choice"" on their orange-and-white umbrellas; the buttons read, ""McCain does NOT speak for me."" Several also stood and turned their backs to Mr. McCain as he spoke.In interviews, some of the students expressed hostility on a range of issues before taking their seats amid hundreds of parents and relatives who endured a soaking rain for the ceremony for Class Day, which honors undergraduates.Kate Berthold, a theater major from Long Island, who wore a button on her baby blue graduation gown, criticized Mr. McCain's lack of support on some equal rights issues for gay people. Her friend Dan Kessler, an English and physics major from Peekskill, said he believed that the senator was ""a transparent politician"" using commencement speeches to further his own interests.Other seniors used their own visual aides to signal support for Mr. McCain. Zachary Kleinhandler, an American studies major, wrote on the back of his gown, ""Baby Blue is the opposite of orange."" Baby blue is Columbia's official color.Mr. McCain's speech yesterday was a slightly shorter version of the one he delivered on Saturday at Liberty University, an avowedly evangelical institution founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. For instance, he made the same six references to God in both speeches.'"
"'06-05-17,'0','Several diplomats in Kabul voiced concern about Mr. Shinwari's close ties with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, an Islamist jihadi leader in Parliament.Recent reports on Afghanistan single out the judiciary as one of the major obstacles to progress in the country. ""The lack of judicial reform has become a bottleneck for security, governance and economic development,"" under Mr. Shinwari, according to a report by Barnett R. Rubin, a New York University professor and expert on Afghanistan, who recommended that the chief justice be replaced.The International Crisis Group, an advocacy organization, in a new report on the Afghan Parliament, called the lack of judicial reform ""one of the major failings of both the national political will and international donor attention since the fall of the Taliban,"" also blaming the conservative Supreme Court.But for Mr. Karzai, Mr. Shinwari is a valuable political ally. His religious conservatism and his background — for many years he led a madrasa, a Muslim religious school, in Pakistan during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan — make him acceptable to religious clerics and mullahs around the country. That background also helps to deflect criticism from those who support the Taliban and oppose the foreign military presence.Mr. Shinwari helped contain the uproar over the case of Mr. Rahman, the convert to Christianity, when many members of the clergy were calling for the convert's execution, presidential aides said. Yet others in the government suggested that the case was exploited by conservatives to strengthen the argument for retaining Mr. Shinwari as head of the Supreme Court. In March, Mr. Rahman was granted asylum by Italy and was secretly flown there.Mr. Shinwari also heads the Ulema Shura, or Council of Clerics, a group of 100 religious clerics from around the country, which meets monthly in Kabul and provides Mr. Karzai with a stamp of approval on many issues. The clerics are financed directly from Mr. Karzai's office, according to the secretary of the council, Fazel Ahmad Manawi.Mr. Karzai has sought to placate Western donors financing judicial reform by removing the other eight Supreme Court judges, and by appointing well-qualified judges beneath Mr. Shinwari. The judges are appointed for 4, 7 or 10 years, and can serve only one term. Mr. Shinwari has been appointed for 4 years.Government officials said that the new Supreme Court had been appointed with a clear message from the president to end corruption, and that progress would be closely watched.""Much more than the cabinet, the president was concerned about getting the Supreme Court right, with an overriding emphasis on getting the system fixed,"" said Jawed Ludin, the president's chief of staff. ""The president judged it right to reappoint him, but give him an entirely new team,"" he said of Mr. Shinwari.But critics of Mr. Shinwari said he rarely listened to the other judges on the council and tended to intervene personally in cases.It is unclear whether the 249-member lower house of Parliament will approve Mr. Shinwari, as required under the Constitution. Members of Parliament interviewed Tuesday said they were not sure Mr. Shinwari would win approval, even if he can prove his qualifications.Yet judging from the approval of the cabinet, in which 20 of the 25 ministers were confirmed, Mr. Karzai has enough allies in the Parliament to swing all but the most controversial appointments.'"
"'06-05-17,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, May 16 — The new chief executive of Sun Microsystems said on Tuesday that the company was working toward making its Java programming language available free as open-source software, providing further evidence that Sun's new management sees it as more of a services company than a network computer maker.In one of his first appearances since taking the helm of the struggling company three weeks ago, the executive, Jonathan Schwartz, told a gathering of software developers here that Sun viewed open-source software as a major part of its turnaround strategy. Turning Java into open-source software would allow outside programmers to examine and modify its underlying code.Java has been one of the dominant programming language of the Internet since its release more than a decade ago and is used in millions of cellphones. But for years Sun's focus was on providing cheaper hardware to compete at the low end of the computer server market with Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other rivals.Last month Sun reported that it lost $217 million in its third quarter, compared with a loss of $28 million a year earlier. On April 24, Sun's board announced that Mr. Schwartz would succeed Scott McNealy, a founder, who will remain chairman and continue to work with large corporate and government customers.Mr. Schwartz has suggested over the years that Sun's future lies in its ability to offer services and fundamental technological tools, rather than just software and hardware.'"
"'06-05-17,'0','TRENTON, May 16 — Keeping up a habit of generosity dating to his days as a Wall Street executive, Gov. Jon S. Corzine lent a total of $75,000 to $150,000 last year to two people who worked on his staff in the United States Senate, according to a financial disclosure statement released on Tuesday.Those details were among the highlights of Mr. Corzine's 36-page statement, required of some state employees. And while the statement does not provide as much detail as other forms Mr. Corzine has filed in the past, it still offers a reminder of the extent of both his wealth and his generosity.While he was co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, Mr. Corzine gained a reputation for giving thousands of dollars to colleagues in need.Less than two weeks ago, state disclosure statements revealed that at the end of 2005 Mr. Corzine gave nine staff members up to $99,000 in total. The money was described as holiday gifts to the staff members, all of whom had either worked on his campaign for governor last year or for his United States Senate office.And most notably, in 2002, Mr. Corzine provided a $470,000 mortgage loan for a former girlfriend, who is the president of one of the state's largest state employees unions. That loan was later forgiven.'"
"'06-05-17,'0','There's something about the news that the United States is renewing diplomatic relations with Libya after more than 25 years that justifiably leaves a lot of Americans feeling dissatisfied. For almost three decades, Libya has been synonymous with terrorism, fanaticism and undiluted anti-Americanism.This is the country that used its vast oil wealth to finance Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's fantasies of international revolutionary leadership by sponsoring coups, invasions, assassination attempts and terrorist atrocities across the world. Americans got a taste of Colonel Qaddafi's methods in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, an attack that killed 270 people. A year later, another Libyan terrorist bomb killed 170 people on a French airliner over Africa.Libyans themselves have endured decades of assassinations, abductions and torture. Somehow, the idea that this can all be washed down the memory drain with new diplomatic flourishes doesn't seem right.Yet the reality is that the world has changed immeasurably since the days when relations were so bad that President Ronald Reagan bombed targets in Tripoli and Benghazi after accusing Libya of ordering the German disco bombing that killed three people. There is the obvious: the Sept. 11 attack, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the crisis over Iran's nuclear ambitions. But beyond that, the truth is that Libya isn't so much of a player in the world of state-sponsored terrorism anymore.In recent years, Colonel Qaddafi has withdrawn from direct involvement in international terrorism. He also agreed in 2003 to dismantle Libya's unconventional weapons programs, and all reports say he has done just that. In addition, he has apparently refrained from channeling any funds into financing weapons programs or terrorism.Colonel Qaddafi's one-time protégé, Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president and warlord, has now been neutered and is behind bars, where he belongs. There is a strong case for easing Libya's economic isolation and improving the lot of its people.But the Bush administration's decision to make nice with Libya does highlight the apparent schizophrenia of America's relations with other countries — like Iran. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in announcing on Monday the restoration of full diplomatic ties with Libya, called Libya an ""important model as nations around the world press for changes in behavior by the Iranian and North Korean regimes.""'"
"'06-05-17,'0','The other big Bell company, Qwest, has declined to comment, though its former chief executive, Joseph P. Nacchio, said through his lawyer last week that the company had rebuffed requests from the security agency to provide calling data in the aftermath of 9/11, citing a lack of legal process.The New York Times reported last December that the N.S.A. had gained access to some of the telecommunications industry's major arteries to trace vast amounts of phone and e-mail traffic and look for patterns of possible terrorist activity.USA Today, in its article last week, said the agency had amassed a database with tens of millions of call records in an effort to create a log of virtually every call made in the country. But the logistics of how the agency's phone-tracing operation works — and whether the agency has direct access to the call records or relies on phone companies to provide their own records — remains unclear.A senior government official, granted anonymity to speak for publication about the classified program, confirmed on Friday that the security agency had access to records of most telephone calls in the United States. The official said the call records were used for the limited purpose of identifying regular contacts of ""known bad guys."" The official would not discuss the details of the program, including the identity of companies involved.In their hunt for terrorists, spy agencies could find it more efficient to focus on long-distance calls, rather than local ones; long-distance call records would include not just information about cross-country traffic but also about international communications, said Tony Rutkowski, vice president for regulatory affairs and standards for VeriSign, a company that offers security services for Internet and telephone operations.""The odds are that somebody calling a neighbor is not going to be a communication pattern of interest,"" he said. By ignoring those local call records, he said, government agents ""are obviously significantly diminishing the burden"" of combing through billions of calls to find patterns that could identify a threat.In 2004, more than 80 percent of the 463 billion domestic calls made in the United States were local, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Verizon said yesterday that ""phone companies do not even make records of local calls in most cases because the vast majority of customers are not billed per call for local calls.""While the Bell companies have operated long-distance divisions for years, they typically only connected calls in states where they offer local service. To connect calls outside their regions and overseas, they often handed off calls to long-distance carriers like MCI, Sprint and the old AT&T.Because federal law protects the privacy of phone records in the absence of warrants, companies providing such records could face legal action. Yesterday in Manhattan, a class-action suit filed against Verizon after the USA Today article appeared was expanded to include BellSouth and AT&T as defendants, The Associated Press reported. It asked $200 billion in damages.'"
"'06-05-17,'0','A lawsuit by the Coalition of 9/11 Families seeking to compel the preservation of the concrete floor slab where 1 World Trade Center stood has been dismissed by Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich of the State Supreme Court. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the lead defendant, received the decision yesterday. Justice Kornreich said it had been known since April 2004 that the slab would not be subject to historical preservation review, meaning that the lawsuit was filed too late. She wrote that the historical review process ""has been met.""'"
"'06-05-17,'0','Executives usually talk up the great cost savings and synergies in mergers. While such benefits rarely materialize, deals are usually made in hope of them. In exchange consolidation, investors look for liquidity, technology savings and diversification.A combination of Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange, if managed on one electronic trading platform, would meet the test of costs savings and diversification. Nasdaq would obtain access to a global listings business that would finally allow Nasdaq the opportunity to close the gap with the marquee listings business of the Big Board, which is a unit of the NYSE Group.Robert Greifeld, the chief executive of Nasdaq, said he could save money by creating a single platform with the London Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones news service reported.It remains unclear, however, if London wants its platform to be absorbed by Nasdaq, which operates on the trading engine it acquired from Instinet. It also remains unclear how such a platform would be regulated.Euronext, which runs separate trading platforms for equities and futures and derivatives, would offer the NYSE Group diversification, but it is not clear that it would offer either more liquidity or cost savings. The most recent talks between Euronext and New York were reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal.But there are other benefits. For the NYSE Group, combining forces across the sea would expand product options to higher-margin, faster-growing derivatives, permit trading in more time zones, expand listing locations — important since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has discouraged companies from listing in the United States — and could produce more fees for data products. And diversification would help the NYSE Group weather any storms in American stock markets.But are the exchanges worth the premiums they will command?""I haven't heard the question of 'Why go global?' answered satisfactorily to date,"" said Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Asset Management, a Canadian money management company that owns dozens of exchange seats. ""I think to go global at this juncture in our corporate evolution would be to short-circuit the incredible potential we have as the jewel in the crown. I would not like to see it diluted with Euronext.""The clock is ticking, which may explain the frenzy. Euronext is being pushed into merger talks by an investor group, Winchfield Holdings. In March, Winchfield requested that a merger between Euronext and Deutsche Börse be put to a shareholder vote at Euronext's annual meeting next Tuesday. The item is on Euronext's agenda, but a vote will not be binding. Euronext has urged shareholders to reject it.Several people who have spoken recently with Euronext's chief executive, Jean-François Theodore, say he has increasingly turned against the idea of a merger with Deutsche Börse.""He's always wanted to do a deal with the London Stock Exchange, and now there are even bigger fish to fry,"" said a London executive who advises on stock exchange deals but is not directly involved in the recent consolidation talks.On May 3, Euronext said it was abandoning talks with the London Stock Exchange about a deal, apparently scared off by Nasdaq's purchase of a large chunk of London shares.The major players seem to have picked their prom dates. Nasdaq is seeking London, an exchange that would give it the listing business it craves and an electronic platform familiar to its own. Euronext would give John A. Thain, the NYSE Group's chief executive, what he has clearly said he wants: product diversification and global exposure.Governments have decided that exchanges, once monopolistic public utilities, should be for-profit entities, a positive development encouraging rampant competition. But the question remains whether they will continue to serve their investors with the same care with which they tend to their shareholders.""I worry that the public interest and the public utility concept gets pushed aside for the pursuit of market share and profitability,"" said Andrew Brooks, head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price.'"

So, he bought the York (Pa.) White Roses, a Class AA affiliate of the Washington Senators.He later became commissioner of the Eastern League, the International League and the Pacific Coast League, and he also owned the Tucson Toros, then the Class AAA affiliate of the Chicago White Sox.""Roy trained with me for a couple of weeks in Spartanburg and then headed on to Macon,"" recalled Pat Williams, senior vice president of the Orlando Magic, who was the president and general manager of the Spartanburg minor league team in the late 1960's.

Jackson and Convest worked with Posada, Beltrán, Edgar Martínez, Doug Jones and others.Jackson never exactly had a stare-down with Steinbrenner, owner of the 2005 Kentucky Derby favorite Bellamy Road and principal owner of the Yankees, but he did help win a new contract for Posada early in his major league career.Jackson was doing well, but he eventually sold his share of Convest to turn his full attention to horse racing.When Jackson was growing up, his parents owned a few racehorses they had bought from Elizabeth Arden, the cosmetics executive. Jackson owned a few horses while working in baseball. But it was not until he got out of baseball that he had the time to go full tilt into racing.In the late 1990's, the Jacksons began to build their stable, focusing on quality horses they thought could become top broodmares. One mare was La Ville Rouge, whom they bought as a 2-year-old in 1998 and bred to Dynaformer four years later. The result of that mating was Barbaro. Though relatively new to the business, Jackson was well aware that the odds were stacked against Barbaro.""What are the chances of this having happened to us?"" he said. ""They're pretty remote. There have only been 132 winners of the Kentucky Derby, and every year there are about 36,000 foals born in the country. Just getting a horse there is somewhat of a miracle.""The Jacksons got two to Churchill Downs. They also own Showing Up, who finished sixth in this year's Derby for his first career loss. On the same day, another horse they bred, George Washington, won the 2000 Guineas, the first leg of England's version of the Triple Crown.To have a day like that, you have to be a little bit lucky. Jackson's success in racing has not been an accident, his son, Hardie Jackson, a sports agent, said.""With my dad, everything he gets involved in is a challenge, and he loves a challenge,"" he said. ""He is very analytical and statistically oriented. That's one of the reasons he loved baseball. I remember him sitting at home reading volumes and volumes of breeding books and statistical data on bloodlines.""After studying both baseball and horse racing, Jackson said he realizes it is hard to win a triple crown in either sport. He never represented a baseball player who came anywhere close, but he has a terrific horse who is a third of the way there. It's understandable that he likes racing better.Michael Matz, the trainer of Barbaro, said the colt would not arrive at Pimlico until Friday, a day before the Preakness. Until then, Barbaro will remain 60 miles away in Elkton, Md., at the Fair Hill Training Center, where Matz stables horses.'"
"'06-05-17,'0','LUXEMBOURG, May 16 (AP) — Millions of Nazi files that describe the Holocaust in gray, bureaucratic tones will be opened to researchers under an agreement announced Tuesday by a panel that has kept the archives locked away since the end of World War II.Once ratified, the decision will give the public access to some 50 million files stored in a German spa town, Bad Arolsen, including the registration of concentration camp inmates by the numbers on their arms, stacks of identity booklets and meticulously kept records of executions.""Bad Arolsen is the most complete file,"" said Paul Mertz, a Luxembourg diplomat and the chairman of the 11-nation commission.The files will be available to Holocaust survivors and families of victims whose fates may not be clear. While survivors and their relatives have been able to request information, they sometimes have had to wait years.Amendments to two 1955 agreements controlling the archives are to be signed at a ceremony in Berlin before they are submitted to the governments for ratification, Mr. Mertz said. It could take until the end of the year before the process is complete.'"
"'06-05-17,'0','By The Associated PressInflation fears pushed stocks modestly lower yesterday as data on wholesale prices obscured statistics showing signs of moderating economic growth.The Producer Price Index showed that high energy costs had not yet affected core wholesale prices — those that exclude food and energy. But a stronger-than-forecast jump in overall producer prices compounded fears that soaring oil prices would inevitably drive other prices higher.On the other hand, a drop in new-home construction fed hopes that economic growth was tapering and could bring an end to the Federal Reserve's campaign to raise interest rates to contain inflation. But a strong reading on industrial activity and a fresh rise in crude oil kept investors on edge.""When you add up all the numbers, the economy is doing well, but there's still a hint of inflation around,"" said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst for Wachovia Securities. The mixed economic numbers muddled the outlook for interest rates and countered excitement over solid earnings from Wal-Mart Stores and a rebound in bonds. Investors were already looking ahead to today's report on consumer prices for more clarity about the inflation picture.At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 8.88 points, or 0.08 percent, to 11,419.89. Broader stock indicators also declined. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.42, or 0.19 percent, to 1,292.08, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 9.39, or 0.42 percent, to 2,229.13.'"
"'06-05-17,'0','Lou Carrol, an unknown traveling salesman from Texas whose spontaneous act of generosity one summer day in 1952 — packing a puppy into a crate and shipping it to two little girls in Washington named Tricia and Julie — has been credited with altering the course of American history, died on April 3 in Highland Park, Ill. He was 83 and lived in Barrington Hills, Ill.Mr. Carrol's death, which was made widely public only recently, was reported by the Solimine Funeral Home, in Lynn, Mass., his hometown. No cause was announced.The puppy, a black-and-white cocker spaniel named Checkers, became a famous political asset for the girls' father, Richard M. Nixon, then the Republican vice-presidential candidate. In a nationally televised address in September 1952, Nixon, responding to charges of fiscal impropriety, invoked Mr. Carrol's gift to sentimental effect.Known ever after as the Checkers speech, the address was widely believed to have solidified Nixon's precarious position as Dwight D. Eisenhower's running mate. The two men won in 1952 and again in 1956.Elected to the presidency in 1968 and 1972, Nixon resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal.Louis Leon Karavoulias was born in Lynn on March 28, 1923. (The family, Greek immigrants, later Americanized their name to Carrol.) He earned a bachelor's degree in business from Indiana University in 1948 and began a sales career. He retired in 1996 as a senior executive vice president of Lawson Products, an industrial manufacturer in Des Plaines, Ill.In July 1952, Mr. Carrol happened to read a newspaper article in which Nixon's wife, Pat, said her daughters longed for a dog. Mr. Carrol was a Republican and an admirer of Nixon, then a senator from California. He also happened to have a litter of purebred pups, recently born to his spaniel, Boots.'"
"'06-05-17,'0','Bonds rose yesterday and stocks closed down slightly. At the end of last week, the financial markets posted two days of significant declines as investors worried that higher inflation would prompt the Fed to raise short-term interest rates again.Today, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its April estimate of an even more important barometer of inflation, the Consumer Price Index.""The telling variable between now and the end of June will be the core inflation numbers we get for April,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.Unlike consumer prices, wholesale prices do not include taxes and distribution costs. Energy prices rose 4 percent in April as gasoline reached $3 a gallon in many parts of the country. Food prices rose 0.1 percent. Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices were up 4 percent; excluding food and energy, they were up 1.5 percent.Prices earlier in the production process rose even more. Raw materials increased 1.2 percent in April from March, after decreases of 2.7 percent in March and 9.2 percent in February. The price of intermediate goods rose 0.9 percent after small declines in the previous two months.The increases do not seem to be slowing manufacturers. Industrial production increased 0.8 percent in April after a 0.6 percent rise in March and a 0.4 percent increase in January, the Fed reported. Capacity utilization, a measure of how fully factories, mines and power plants are running, rose to 81.9 percent, from 81.4 percent. Production has increased for three consecutive months and is up 4.7 percent from April 2005.The cost increases ""are a challenge economically and they are a challenge to pass on"" to customers, said Cliff Waldman, an economist at Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a policy research group in Arlington, Va. But businesses ""have managed to always find ways to use raw materials more productively.""Mr. Waldman noted that strong global demand, particularly for capital goods like airplanes, was bolstering production. And the recent drop in the value of the dollar against other currencies should help keep factories humming through the rest of the year by making American goods cheaper overseas.In housing, the number of permits issued for new homes, an indication of future construction activity, fell 5.4 percent, to an annual pace of 1.98 million, in April after smaller declines in the two months before.It appears that a 13.1 percent jump in the number of homes started in January may have been a blip caused by unusually warm weather, as many analysts suspected. The number of housing units being built fell 1.6 percent, to 1.39 million.'"
"'06-05-17,'0','""The U.S.D.A. understands under 40 degrees or over 140 degrees,"" said Brian Polcyn, the chef at Five Lakes Grill near Detroit and an author of ""Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking and Curing.""""But they don't understand this process,"" he said.The intricate chain of events that produces dried sausages has many built-in safety measures, producers say. According to Mr. Polcyn, the acids that give cured salami its deep flavor also inhibit the growth of bacteria. Mr. Buzzio said the liberal use of salt — preferably Mediterranean sea salt, rich in natural curing agents that keep the meat pink — also keeps the product safe.And the makers say it's easy to tell when the occasional sausage goes bad: it develops air pockets, brown spots or a hardened exterior. ""When I don't see mold on the outside, that's when I get worried,"" said Sal Lioni, an owner of the A&S Italian Pork Store in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. ""If the mold isn't on the outside, it's on the inside.""But state and federal officials say that none of these steps guarantee safety to their satisfaction. And even if some producers could meet government standards, the steps needed to prove that they had, and the daily inspections needed to sell cured meats wholesale, are onerous for the producers.In 2003 Agriculture Department inspectors shut down Mr. Buzzio's business, Salumeria Biellese in Manhattan, because he was not using an approved kill step. Rather than change the production method, Mr. Buzzio and his partners spent more than $100,000 on laboratory testing and legal fees, finally satisfying officials' safety concerns — mainly by showing that pathogens were killed by the curing process.""I would rather go out of business, like all those other guys, than ruin my product by freezing it or cooking it or irradiating it,"" Mr. Buzzio said.Death has already claimed many of the pork stores that used to dot the New York area, including Danny's on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx and the Corona Heights Pork Store in Queens.""The landscape has totally changed,"" said David Greco, whose father, Michele, started making sausages in the spicy, gnarled style of his native Calabria on Arthur Avenue in 1951. David Greco said he moved production of his dried sausages to Canada in 1999, when inspections became too intrusive.Many have simply stopped making their own product, like Pasquale Sciannantena at Bari Pork Store in Bay Ridge. Even John Esposito of the legendary Esposito's Pork Store in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, said he believes the tradition will die with him. ""Making sausage is hard work, and on top of that to have to answer questions and fill out forms, it's too much,"" he said. ""All I know is that people love my sausage, we never had a problem and it sent my kids to college.""To chefs the incomparable flavor of the real product is worth preserving at all costs. ""We realize that raw meat at room temperature is the kind of thing that keeps U.S.D.A. inspectors up at night,"" said Frank Falcinelli, who serves beautiful platters of old-school soppressata from Faicco's at Frankie's Spuntino locations on the Lower East Side and in Carroll Gardens. ""But there is no other way you can get the right flavor.""""Salami is a funky product, no question,"" said Sara Jenkins, the chef at Bread Tribeca, who grew up in Tuscany and now serves thin slices of imported salami with bread, butter and anchovies. ""When I was growing up, everyone made their own — it was the first thing you were offered when visiting someone's house — but the commercial product seems to be taking over.""Some large European producers, notably Vismara in Italy and Palacios in Spain, have built plants that are inspected by the Agriculture Department so they can export dry sausages to the United States.In New York, restaurant chefs who make their own cured meats, a sideline that has become a badge of culinary honor, must follow City Health Department guidelines. Chefs say that they are careful to follow the rules that they are aware of, but that modern notions of food safety and traditional methods of curing are an uncomfortable fit.On Monday inspectors destroyed all the cured meats at Il Buco restaurant in NoHo. They did so, according to the owner, Donna Lennard, not because of any evidence of contamination but because the temperature in the curing room was six degrees higher than it should have been.""These are pigs that were raised for us,"" Ms. Lennard said. ""We knew their names. We were trying to do something sustainable and traditional, and this is what happens.""The process of curing meat has been refined over thousands of years by people who are on intimate terms with their handiwork. Food historians believe that the Romans picked up the craft from the Lucanians, a tribe that for almost 1,000 years ruled part of what is now Basilicata in southern Italy, developing a reputation for sausages while fending off imperial conquerors. The Greek sausage loukanika and its Mediterranean cousins the longaniza (Spain), luganega (Italy), and linguiça (Portugal) are all descendants of the ancient lucanicus.Unfortunately, it's impossible to do a complete taxonomy of salami: it's a big clan whose members all bear a strong family resemblance and are given to taking one another's names at whim. Variations show up in the fat-to-meat ratio, the grind and the seasonings — usually garlic, wine, hot chili peppers and peppercorns, black or white. In Central Europe, sausages are smoked before drying to make German landjägers, Polish kabanosy and Hungarian salami.In Italy, itinerant pig butchers called norcini long roamed the peninsula (as some still do), making hundreds of regional salamis like cacciatorini (small portable ""hunter's sausages""), finocchiona (a fine-ground salami with fennel seed) and soppressa vicentina, a specialty of the Veneto. (Though so-called Genoa salami is popular in the United States, in Italy, Genoa is not known for its salami.)Next month Paul Bertolli, a longtime chef and advocate of handmade foods in the San Francisco Bay Area, will release his first batch of soppressa vicentina — ""a beautiful mosaic of meat,"" he said — along with five other dry salamis. Mr. Bertolli has spent four years building a company — Fra'Mani Handcrafted Salumi — and a large-scale government-approved plant, with computer-controlled aging rooms for each stage of a salami's life: gocciolamento, dripping; asciugamento, drying; stagionatura, ripening.Even so, Mr. Bertolli said, ""you can't make salami by computer.""""You have to touch it, feel it, smell it,"" he said. ""The machine is dumb. You need the person to go in, see that the mold is growing faster on one side and turn the rack around.""REAL dry-cured sausage is famously difficult to make — one salumiere called it ""the pinnacle of the art of meat.""It is also increasingly hard to find. Salamis drying over the deli counter have mostly been replaced by commercial products, most of it cooked, not cured. Look for sausages that are not shrink-wrapped, short ingredient lists, natural casings and a firm, dry texture.Thin-sliced salami makes an especially appealing appetizer in the summer, served with good bread and sweet butter, before an entree of pasta with seasonal vegetables or a composed salad.In general, cured sausages made in the Mediterranean tradition (Italian, Spanish, French) are simply air-dried; ones from Central and Eastern Europe (Hungary, Germany, Poland) are smoked.These are some places that make or import traditional dry sausage:'"
"'06-05-17,'0','""It's because it's such a strong franchise that allowed us to do that,"" he continued.But Brad Adgate, senior vice president and research director at Horizon Media, a media planning and buying agency, said the show was ""hard to find"" and that moving it to 10 p.m. right after trying to showcase its family appeal had been a mistake.""There are a lot of people who don't let their kids be up at 10 o'clock,"" he said. ""It was one of those 'What were they thinking?' type of things.""Bertram van Munster, who created the show with Elise Doganieri, conceded that this season had not been easy. But he spoke excitedly on the telephone last week about tonight's two-hour finale, and what he saw as a creative resurgence in the show.Was he frustrated about bouncing around the schedule? ""Here's my answer to that: that is just the way it is,"" he said. ""We are the producers of the show; we deliver the show to the network. We really have no say in the programming. What my personal feelings are is irrelevant.""Later Mr. van Munster added: ""Ideally, you have your time slot and you stay there. That's not what happened this time around.""He sounded sanguine even when he discussed the fall's family edition, which he produced at CBS's suggestion. ""It sounds really good, 'Oh, let's do a family show,' "" he said. ""It sounds maybe better than it is. It was fun. But it wasn't necessarily what we expected.""There were too many contestants, which undermined one of the show's strengths: creating characters for the audience to root for and against. ""I don't want to keep pounding on that thing, but to tell the story of 40 people is not easy in the first hour,"" Mr. van Munster said with a laugh. ""I think we deserve a medal to tell the story of 40 people.""Another problem with the family installment, fans complained, was that the challenges were made easier so that teams with children could compete. Linda Holmes, who writes recaps for the show on the Web site Television Without Pity, said in an interview: ""They had to go find, like, the world's largest office chair. It's one of those things you'd see on a postcard, but it's kind of a joke.""Ms. Holmes, who also oversees the site's forums on ""The Amazing Race,"" said that viewers also disliked the normally globe-trotting show's being limited to North America. ""As soon as they figured out that they weren't going to go significantly outside the U.S., and that they basically were going to drive around in trailers a lot, the crowd became very hostile,"" she said.In a telephone interview last week, Phil Keoghan, the host of ""The Amazing Race,"" said he had heard similar criticisms from the audience. ""I underestimated how much of a star the places were in the show,"" he said.But, he continued: ""I don't want to be the one who says I told you so, because I was excited about it. I thought it was a bold move.""""The Amazing Race"" has been renewed for one more edition, and is in negotiations for more. Mr. Adgate pointed out that even with its ratings dips, it still attracted CBS's youngest audience, making it a valuable series for the network, which is poised to finish the season behind Fox and ABC in the important 18-to-49 age demographic. ""I think 'Amazing Race' and 'Survivor' prove that CBS can put on a show that's going to draw a median age in the 18-to-49 demographic,"" he said.Mr. Kahl of CBS said: ""Nobody expected to be talking about 'Survivor 13' or 'Race No. 10.' As long as they're performers, we'll keep them on the air.""Mr. van Munster scouts all of the show's locations with Ms. Doganieri, his wife. They have just returned from their test run of the next race and are preparing to film the new edition. He is happy to live this nomadic life as long as the show has an audience, he said.""I'm not keeling over,"" he added. ""I just got all my tests back; they're phenomenal. We put our heart and soul in it.""'"
"'06-05-17,'0','At the time, Ms. Fleming tried to lower expectations about her Violetta so that she could bring her own approach to a role she loved. I found her performance vocally luminous and deeply personal. Ms. Fleming has said that she tends to hide behind unfamiliar repertory, like the title role of Handel's ""Rodelinda,"" which she sings on Friday at the Met. As grateful as I am for her remarkable Rodelinda, I wish she felt encouraged to take on more roles like Violetta.The instrumental world has always been looser about letting artists stretch themselves. The pianist Peter Serkin, for example, recently gave a Carnegie Hall recital in which he played on a modern concert grand some Renaissance works by Dowland and Bull intended for the virginal, an early keyboard instrument. By juxtaposing these pieces with a new work by Elliott Carter, he invited his willing audience to hear the hints of strangeness and modernism in the old music and echoes of history in Mr. Carter's score.I have heard the French pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard give astounding performances of Ligeti, Messiaen, Boulez, Berg, Ravel, Debussy, even Liszt. His account of Schumann's ""Carnaval"" last October at Carnegie Hall took adjusting to. His playing was incisive and colorful, if lacking in rhapsodic freedom. This was not my idea of Schumann style, but it was riveting, and if Mr. Aimard gave a Schumann recital, I'd be there.Singers, naturally, must be more cautious in their choices. Voices take time to settle. Young pianists can stretch their techniques by working on a formidable Prokofiev sonata, but an aspiring lyric soprano could actually damage her voice by trying to sing a weighty role like Strauss's Salome.It is true that Ms. Voigt has been adjusting her voice and technique to her slimmer, post-surgical body. How her voice has weathered the striking change in her physique after gastric bypass in 2004 is a legitimate question for debate. The reservations about her Tosca have come over matters of style and temperament.I heard Ms. Voigt sing the role again on May 5, and she was more confident in her portrayal, both vocally and dramatically. Her conception of Tosca had me thinking of the much more fleshed-out character we encounter in the play by Sardou from which Puccini's opera is adapted.In the play we learn that Tosca was a wild orphaned girl tending goats in the field when a group of Benedictine nuns found her and took her to their convent near Verona to rear her. As the girl grew, her singing in church proved so extraordinary that the pope himself sanctioned her pursuit of a musical career.Tosca's past is only hinted at in the opera. When we meet her, she is a wealthy and celebrated diva. But might not her tumultuous childhood have taken its toll? The way the great Maria Callas played her, Tosca covers any remnants of childhood insecurity with tenacious possessiveness and blazing jealousy over her lover Cavaradossi.Though I may be reading too much into Ms. Voigt's portrayal, she lets more of Tosca's insecurity come through. Tosca's life is rich with art and with love. Yet her chaotic childhood has left this Tosca fearful that the whole works could easily come tumbling down, as indeed it does. When the conniving Baron Scarpia, the police chief, leads Tosca into thinking that Cavaradossi is deceiving her with the beautiful Marchese Attavanti, Ms. Voigt's poignant Tosca, though furious, seems utterly humiliated.Her portrayal is a work in progress. I'd ask this of those who question Ms. Voigt for her daring: Who are the great Toscas of the last 20 years that she is challenging? No one has dominated the role the way Callas and Renata Tebaldi did in the late 1950's and early 60's. When the Met's current production by Franco Zeffirelli was introduced in 1985, the Tosca was the soprano Hildegard Behrens. Though a compelling actress, Ms. Behrens was, if anything, far less suited to the role vocally than Ms. Voigt.During the 2009-10 season, the Met will present a new production with Karita Mattila singing Tosca for the first time at the house. Though the role would seem a stylistic stretch for this dazzling Finnish soprano as well, she could be amazing in it. And if Ms. Mattila triumphs, I bet Ms. Voigt will be as excited as the rest of us. She doesn't want to own the role; she just wants to perform it. More power to her.'"

"'06-05-18,'0','Two of the firm's prominent partners are named in the indictment: David J. Bershad and Steven G. Schulman. The two men, who sat on the firm's executive committee, decided to take leaves of absences late last week in the hopes it would stave off an indictment of the entire firm.While the indictment caps off a six-year investigation by the Justice Department into the firm's activities, prosecutors have been stymied in their efforts to bring charges against the two primary targets of the investigation, Melvyn I. Weiss and his former partner William S. Lerach.Before a bitter split in 2004, when Mr. Lerach began his own firm, the two dominated the securities class-action arena through their firm Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach. Mr. Weiss ran the East Coast operations of the firm, ""Milberg East,"" and Mr. Lerach headed up the San Diego operations, known as ""Milberg West.""Both men were told in February that they would not be indicted at this time, although people involved in the talks believe they still remain targets of prosecutors.The indictment against the firm and Mr. Bershad and Mr. Schulman was included in a revised indictment that was originally handed up last summer against a retired California lawyer and former Milberg client, Seymour M. Lazar.Beginning in 1981 and continuing through about 2004, Mr. Lazar or members of his family served as plaintiffs in approximately 70 lawsuits for Milberg Weiss and received about $2.4 million in ""secret and illegal kickback payments,"" according to the new indictment.While Mr. Lazar has long stated his intentions to fight the charges, another Milberg Weiss client, Howard J. Vogel, signed a plea deal with prosecutors last month, agreeing to provide information against the firm.A retired mortgage broker, Mr. Vogel admitted that he or members of his family served as plaintiffs in approximately 40 lawsuits from 1991 and as recently as 2005, receiving approximately $2.5 million in ""secret and illegal kickback payments,"" according to the new indictment.A third figure named in the indictment, a Beverly Hills ophthalmologist named Dr. Steven G. Cooperman, or members of his family acted as plaintiffs in nearly 70 lawsuits, receiving approximately $6.5 million in payments, the new indictment said.Testimony by Mr. Cooperman prompted the original investigation six years ago. He is a highly controversial figure, however, as he offered to provide evidence to prosecutors in hopes of receiving a reduced sentence on his conviction of art fraud charges.Under New York law, it is illegal for a lawyer to promise or give anything of value to induce a person to bring a lawsuit or to reward a person for having done so, according to the indictment.Furthermore, the kickbacks created a conflict because the paid plaintiffs had a ""greater interest in maximizing the amount of attorneys' fees awarded to Milberg Weiss than in maximizing the net recovery"" to others in the class, the indictment said.'"

""As for visas, officials have given interviews in the press. They keep saying they have been offended unjustly, but one can see they are quite concerned, though frankly Lukashenko does not allow them to go abroad very often.""The freeze applies to Mr. Lukashenko, senior members of his presidential administration, the ministers of education, information and justice, ranking members of Parliament, the prosecutor general and the head of the security service, still known by its Soviet-era abbreviation, the K.G.B.The European Union's statement, issued in Brussels, called the officials on the list those ""who are responsible for the violations of international electoral standards and the crackdown on civil society and the democratic opposition"" around the March 19 election. The statement said the freeze also applied to ""those natural or legal person, entities or bodies associated with them.""A European diplomat in the Belarussian capital, Minsk, said that meant family members or others, as well as trust funds or companies, that hold accounts abroad under other names. It also applies to stocks or other assets. A White House report issued before the election accused Mr. Lukashenko of personally enriching himself and asserted that he was ""likely among the most corrupt leaders in the world.""Following the election, the police and security forces arrested dozens of protesters and shut down an encampment that lasted five days on the main square in Minsk. A second challenger, Aleksandr V. Kazulin, was arrested the next day and remains in prison, facing charges of organizing anti-government protests. Mr. Milinkevich, along with other senior opposition party leaders, were arrested in April and sentenced to two-week prison terms on lesser charges. They were released late last week.The European diplomat said in a telephone interview that the decision would force the union's members to scrutinize financial transactions in search of Mr. Lukashenko's money abroad. ""We suspect there is,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because his was not authorized to discuss the policy publicly. ""But we've never gone after it before.""A senior State Department official in Washington said that the Bush administration would follow suit, though perhaps not for several weeks because of legal requirements involved in freezing foreign leaders' accounts. That official said the action would be disruptive, piling more pressure on a man the United States has declared Europe's last dictator.""It disrupts financial activities that would either directly go through the U.S. and Europe or would go through indirectly,"" the official said.The official explained that assets in Russia, for example, could also be barred from transfers to or through European and American banks. The new freeze also prohibits transfer into Belarus from European, depriving the listed officials of in-flows of cash.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','There were rumors as the creation of the D.C.I. post was being debated that Mr. Rumsfeld was trying to hold on to the Pentagon's large intelligence-gathering role and was resisting the change.Senator Levin asked General Hayden whether he had disagreed with Douglas J. Feith, the under secretary of defense for policy, who established an intelligence-analysis cell within his office. The senator recalled that Mr. Feith's unit suggested a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda, and whether the general was ""comfortable with Mr. Feith's office approach to intelligence analysis.""""No, sir, I wasn't,"" the nominee replied. ""And I wasn't aware of a lot of the activity going on, you know, when it was contemporaneous with running up to the war. No, sir I wasn't comfortable.""Another committee Democrat, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, said he was not convinced, based upon General Hayden's record at the N.S.A., that he would be as open with Congressional committees as he pledged to be in his opening statement. The senator said he could not tell whether the general had ""simply said one thing and done another, or whether you have just parsed your words like a lawyer to intentionally mislead the public.""""What's to say that if you're confirmed to head the C.I.A., we won't go through exactly this kind of drill with you over there?"" Mr. Wyden said.""Well, senator,"" the general replied, ""you're going to have to make a judgment on my character.""In his early remarks, the general seemed to dispute, at least implicitly, any assumption that the C.I.A. had been reduced to a secondary role because of the overhaul of the intelligence bureaucracy that resulted in the creation of a national intelligence directorship that seemed, at least on paper, to end the C.I.A.'s dominance.""C.I.A. remains, even after the Intelligence Reform Act, central to American intelligence,"" said the nominee, who appeared in his Air Force uniform. ""No other agency has the 'connective tissue' to the other intelligence agencies that the C.I.A. has,"" General Hayden told the committee.In opening remarks spiced with sports metaphors and obscure acronyms, the general addressed past agency failures, including faulty assessments of the threat posed by the Iraq of Saddam Hussein, and pledged to instill a culture of total candor and discretion.""I would emphasize simply getting it right more often, but with a tolerance for ambiguity and dissent manifested in real clarity about our judgments, especially our confidence in them,"" General Hayden said. ""We must be transparent in what we know, what we assess to be true, and what we just don't know.""He defended the retiring C.I.A. director, Porter J. Goss, who was forced out after conflicts with John D. Negroponte, the national intelligence director whom General Hayden has been serving as deputy. ""As director, Porter fostered a process of transformation that the agency must continue in the coming years,"" the general said.The nominee's initial reception was friendly and courteous, but it signaled tough questioning, if not in the open hearing this morning then in the closed session that was to follow in the afternoon.The panel's chairman, Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, quickly volunteered a defense of the domestic surveillance program run by the National Security Agency during General Hayden's time there — ""It is legal, it is necessary, without it the American people would be less safe"" — but asked the general how he would prevent the kind of ""egregious intelligence failure"" that preceded the war in Iraq.General Hayden replied that he would ensure that healthy dissent in intelligence analysis is not buried ""by a footnote or other kind of obfuscation,"" the very thing that some agency critics say led to gross exaggerations of the threat posed by the old regime in Iraq.Senator Levin acknowledged the nominee's impressive credentials, but said he wanted to see ""objectivity"" restored to intelligence-gathering and analysis. (The committee's vice chairman, Senator John D. Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, was not present because he is recovering from back surgery.)The general offered a pre-emptive defense of sorts, asserting that the N.S.A., the biggest agency in the sprawling intelligence network, had operated under ""care, patriotism and the rule of law.""""Ultimately, we have to get analysis right — for, in the end, it is the analytic product that appeals before the president, his senior advisers, military commanders and the Congress,"" the nominee testified. ""Intelligence works at that nexus of policymaking — the nexus between the world as it is and the world we are working to create.""General Hayden expressed dismay over what has happened to intelligence-gathering and spycraft in recent years. ""Respectfully, senators, I believe that the intelligence business has too much become the football in American political discourse,"" he said. ""Over the past few years, the intelligence community and C.I.A. have taken an inordinate number of hits, some of them fair, many of them not.""The general's portrait of the C.I.A. he would like to preside over seemed to be one of esprit, imagination and discretion. ""C.I.A. needs to get out of the news, as source or subject, and focus on protecting the American people by acquiring secrets and providing high-quality, all-source analysis,"" he said.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','Stocks failed to rebound today from a sharp sell-off on Wednesday, with prices falling in the afternoon as traders remained concerned about the prospect of higher inflation and interest rates.After showing little change for much of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.32 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 11,128.29.The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 8.51 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,261.81, while the Nasdaq composite index lost 15.48 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,180.32.The latest decline in stock prices came a day after the Dow average suffered its biggest loss in more than three years, dropping 214.28 points, or 1.9 percent, on Wednesday. That decline left the Dow down 437 points from a week earlier, when it hit a six-year high.Bond prices, meanwhile, recovered from Wednesday's selling. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 22/32 of a point, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direct of its price, was down to 5.05 percent late this afternoon, down from 5.14 percent late Wednesday.The drop in stock prices on Wednesday was attributed by analysts to investors' fears that inflation is not as well under control as they had hoped.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','Those workouts could begin as soon as Monday. But a team spokesman could not say for certain when workouts would begin, or identify which prospects may be there, or state for certain that Brown would indeed preside. But that is the expectation.It may also be the first time that Brown speaks with anyone in the Knicks' hierarchy since the season ended last month. A frustrated Brown has told friends that he has been left in the dark by team officials. Neither the team's president, Isiah Thomas, nor the Cablevision chairman, James L. Dolan, has responded to Brown's requests for a meeting.That could change soon. Thomas, who is being pushed by Dolan to replace Brown on the bench, is also expected to be at the workouts.That potentially uncomfortable moment will happen in private. While reporters are usually invited to the workouts to interview players, they are not allowed in the gym. It is highly doubtful that Thomas or Brown will speak to the news media.As a matter of corporate policy, the Knicks will not comment on Brown's status. In practical terms, that means there would be no vote of confidence or a denial of the news reports, even if they were incorrect.Aside from potential embarrassment, there is no urgency to resolve the situation. Team officials intend to have Thomas take over for Brown, so there will be no coaching search to undertake. Likewise, Thomas will already be present for all workouts and meetings concerning the draft June 28.Glass has waved off news reports about Brown's job status. But he has also insisted that if the team wants Brown gone, it will have to fire him and pay the full $40 million-plus he is owed.Glass declined yesterday to address anything about Brown's job status, saying, ""There's nothing new to talk about at all.""The last time Brown and Thomas spoke to reporters, on April 20, they presented a united front, sitting side by side in the lunch room at the team's training center in Greenburgh, N.Y. Despite a 23-59 season — the Knicks' worst in 20 years — Thomas said he and Brown would be back.Brown noted at the time that he and Thomas spoke daily during the season and that he met with Dolan and Steve Mills, the Garden president, weekly.""I've never, ever gotten a feeling that they didn't want me to be part of this,"" Brown said then.But Brown, who alienated most of his players, wants a major overhaul of the roster — a task that team officials consider to be a practical and financial impossibility. It will be simpler, and possibly cheaper, to replace Brown instead.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','The health insurer UnitedHealth Group said yesterday that it had received a subpoena from the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, requesting documents from 1999 relating to the granting of stock options.The company also said it had received a request from the Internal Revenue Service for documents from 2003 relating to stock options and other compensation for executive officers named in its annual proxy statements. UnitedHealth said it would cooperate with both offices.Last week, UnitedHealth said it might have to restate past earnings by as much as $286 million as it reviewed stock option practices.The health insurer also said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an informal inquiry into its stock option granting practices. It said previously that it had received a call from S.E.C. staff members on the issue.UnitedHealth has been under scrutiny for possible backdating of options. Backdating occurs when a company sets the grant price for the stock option retroactively to maximize potential profit to the recipient.The company has granted unexercised stock options to its chief executive, William W. McGuire, worth some $1.6 billion as of the end of 2005, according to the company's proxy statement filed April 7.'"

"'06-05-18,'0','The S.E.C. statement came as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board announced plans to change the auditing standard involved, with the aim of making the rules clearer and permitting audits to be done more efficiently.The Sarbanes-Oxley law, which was passed in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom scandals, established the board to regulate the auditing profession. Section 404 of the law required management to report to shareholders on the adequacy of internal financial controls, with auditors required to review the controls as well.The provision has taken effect for most American companies, exempting only those with less than $75 million worth of stock in public hands, but many companies have complained about the cost of the audits. The commission and the board issued guidelines last year aimed at reducing the cost. Those guidelines will now be incorporated into the auditing standard.In addition, the commission plans to propose guidance for managements on doing the control assessments.Mr. Cox said all five commissioners had agreed to the decisions announced yesterday, which include requiring smaller American companies to begin assessing their internal controls in fiscal years beginning after Dec. 16, 2006. For calendar-year companies, that would be the 2007 year.But he said no decision had been made on when those controls would have to be audited. And, he added, there was no consensus on when foreign companies, which have also been permitted to delay compliance with Section 404, would be covered.Surveys have shown the cost of compliance for larger companies is falling in the second year of such audits, although those costs have been much higher than some expected.A study by CRA International, paid for by the Big Four accounting firms, found that the average cost for companies with revenue of more than $700 million fell 44 percent, to $4.8 million, in the second year.But it has been difficult to weigh the benefits, since there is no way to know how many problems might have been headed off by fixing the controls. Some studies have indicated that companies whose controls have been given a clean bill of health may pay less for capital than those with deficiencies.But the talk has grown heated. ""Sarbanes-Oxley was well intended, but it is actually crippling businesses across America,"" said Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, as he introduced the bill to exempt most companies from Section 404.In a telephone interview, he called it ""a trillion-dollar problem.""Representative Tom Feeney, Republican of Florida, complained that the bill was ""outsourcing America's lead in capital markets"" by causing companies to list in other countries.Legislation is not expected to pass in this session of Congress, but it could have a better chance next year, after the retirements of the sponsors of the original legislation: Senator Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, and Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio.The bill would exempt from internal control audits any company with a market value of less than $700 million, or revenue under $125 million, as well as any company with fewer than 1,500 owners of record. Because many shares are held in so-called street names by brokerage firms, the number of owners of record can be far lower than the number of actual owners. If passed, the bill would exempt most public companies from the rule.Opponents of Sarbanes-Oxley have also gone to court. An organization called the Free Enterprise Fund has filed a lawsuit in federal court in Washington seeking to have the accounting board deemed unconstitutional. The fund praised the bill introduced yesterday.Also yesterday, the accounting board filed its answer to that lawsuit, asking that it be dismissed because the plaintiff lacked legal standing and, in any case, had not followed provisions of the law permitting board decisions to be appealed to the courts only after the S.E.C. turned down an appeal.And, in Houston, the trial stemming from the scandal that started the push for the Sarbanes-Oxley law went to the jury. Jurors will decide if the two former Enron chief executives, Kenneth W. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, defrauded investors by lying about the company's financial condition.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','A federal judge approved a two-year extension of court supervision for Microsoft yesterday, in an effort to ensure that the company meets the terms of its antitrust settlement.Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said in Federal District Court in Washington that the move was necessary because of ""disappointing"" progress by Microsoft in helping rival software makers link with Windows-powered computers.She urged the company, based in Redmond, Wash., to do all it could to expedite the process.""I want to make sure we have the resources to get things done,"" she said. ""I want to make sure we are not shortchanged.""Microsoft and the Justice Department had asked the judge to continue overseeing one central provision of the 2001 settlement through November 2009. That provision gives competitors access to the Windows source code so their server software can communicate smoothly with desktop computers using the Microsoft operating system.In approving the request, Judge Kollar-Kotelly said the provision could be extended for three years beyond 2009, if necessary.She also asked whether the rest of the consent decree, which bars Microsoft from penalizing computer makers for promoting rival products, should also have extended court supervision.A Justice Department lawyer, Renata Hesse, said that such a move was not necessary.The judge set a court date of Sept. 7 for the next report on Microsoft's progress.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','Indeed, the sudden unwinding in the market began on May 11, the day after Fed policy makers raised interest rates another quarter-point, to 5 percent, and left open the prospect that more interest rate increases ""might yet be needed to address inflation risks.""Higher interest rates, by raising the cost of borrowing, curb spending by consumers and companies. That helps to prevent bottlenecks in the economy and takes the pressure off prices.Many investors had been counting on the Fed to finally take a breather after nearly two years of predictably raising rates at every meeting. But Fed officials, by signaling that they would henceforth be driven by fresh economic data, turned Wall Street's attention to scrutinizing every new statistic for clues to their next move.Yesterday's government report was seen as the worst omen yet. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced a jump of 0.6 percent in the Consumer Price Index for April, mostly because of gasoline prices, but also because, as the government calculates it, the cost of owning a house and renting an apartment was up smartly. The latest increase in consumer prices came on top of a 0.4 percent increase in March.Many economists, however, are not as alarmed by the inflation figures as the market reaction suggests. Because of a quirk in the way the C.P.I. is calculated, they explained, the latest reading may actually be signaling a slowing economy and, eventually, less inflation.Those subtleties are not always immediately apparent to market participants. Traders have also been whipsawed by conflicting data lately. Earlier this month, a government report showing relatively weak job gains encouraged the view the Fed would stop raising rates after this month, setting off a four-day rally that sent the Dow up close to its record last week.""If you are trading in the market, you have to put a lot of weight on each new bit of information, even if you know the data is perhaps not significant,"" said Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial Services. ""It is, after all, the latest information and so you have to react to it, and almost always it is an overreaction.""If there was an overreaction, it may be because many traders do not take into account how the Consumer Price Index measures the cost of housing, which gets more weight than any other item.The bureau, relying on data that is relatively easy to compile monthly, uses the cost of renting as a proxy for the cost of owning a house or an apartment as well as the cost of renting one.Now that home sales are leveling off, the demand for rental properties has risen and so have rents.Rising rents, more than any other item, explain why the core C.P.I. — which excludes volatile food and energy prices — jumped 0.3 percent last month. For the first four months of this year, the core C.P.I. rose at an annual rate of 3 percent, up from 2.2 percent for all of last year.For the overall C.P.I., including food and energy, the annualized increase this year through April was 5.1 percent, up from 3.4 percent last year.The Fed's focus, however, is on the core rate — and so is the market's. That may be leading to a perverse reaction to the Fed's efforts to keep inflation under control.""In a way you could argue that the rental phenomenon is a result of rising mortgage rates, which in turn reflect the Fed's rate increases,"" said Nigel Gault, the United States economist for Global Insights. But ""as the housing market slows, so will the economy, and that will bring down inflation. Pursuing this line of reasoning, you can also argue that the Fed's rate increases so far are enough.""That was not the view yesterday from the stock market, which fears that the Fed is now more likely to raise rates at its next meeting in June. The big drop in the Dow yesterday followed two earlier declines of more than 100 points last Thursday and again on Friday.The index closed last Wednesday at 11,642.65, or just 80.28 points shy of its record 11,722.98 on Jan. 14, 2000.While the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq were also down sharply yesterday, they never regained as much ground as the Dow since their peaks in 2000 and have generally been less volatile.For investors, the biggest concern is that rising oil prices will feed into the cost of goods and services dependent on oil. So far, the main impact is on gasoline pump prices, which averaged $2.79 a gallon in April and $2.97 a gallon in May, according to Energy Department surveys.An indirect effect is evident in rising air fares, in surcharges on overnight air freight, and in a few chemical products made from petroleum. But those increases are still isolated.""You are really not seeing much pass through yet,"" said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ""What worries me is that the markets' reaction to the inflation numbers will push the Fed into tightening more than is necessary.""'"
"'06-05-18,'0','The impact on bookings troubles the state officials who are charged with overseeing the state's investment in the development, known as Adriaen's Landing.""The state has invested a lot of money, and we are sort of at a juncture here,"" said Michael Cicchetti, assistant director of the Capital City Economic Development Authority. ""We don't want it all thrown away because one union has said 'our way or we go to war.' ""The dispute does not concern salaries or benefits. Nor is it about whether the workers can unionize. Rather, it concerns whether the developer must abide by a Hartford ordinance that requires developers of city-subsidized projects to sign an agreement with any union seeking to organize workers promising that there will be no strikes, boycotts or pickets.The idea behind such an accord is to ensure that the city's investments will not be derailed, or slowed, by protracted labor disputes, according to Matthew J. Hennessy, the chief of staff for Mayor Eddie A. Perez. ""The reason for labor peace is simple: If the city is an investor and partner in a development, we don't want our investment degraded,"" Mr. Hennessy said, adding that labor discord ""hurts the viability of the project.""But Len Wolman, the chief executive of the Waterford Group, has refused to sign a labor peace agreement with Unite Here, a hotel and restaurant workers' union that wants to represent Marriott workers. He argues that the ordinance does not apply to his hotel.While it was under construction, the hotel was exempt from city rules under a state law intended to expedite the project. And now that the hotel is up and running, he has argued, it should not be considered a ""development project"" under the ordinance that requires the labor peace accord.The city disagrees. City officials say that any project that receives $100,000 or more in subsidies from the city is bound by the ordinance, whether the project is in development or operating.City officials have shown they are willing to play hardball. Mr. Wolman's organization received 15 years of property tax abatements as an incentive to build the hotel, in a deal that the mayor's office estimates is worth as much as $30 million. The city has threatened to revoke the tax abatements if Mr. Wolman fails to comply with the local law. ""We don't intend to look the other way,"" Mr. Perez said. ""The law is the law.""On March 28, the city gave the Waterford Group 30 days to sign a labor peace agreement with the union. Mr. Wolman responded by asking the National Labor Relations Board to conduct a secret-ballot election to determine whether workers want to be represented by the union. The board turned down Mr. Wolman, who filed an appeal on Tuesday.Union officials do not want their options limited to a secret-ballot election. ""We're open to many ways of resolving the labor peace ordinance,"" said Anthony Dugdale, a senior research analyst for Unite Here.Though he declined to discuss other organizing approaches, unions are increasingly turning to a card check process in which companies grant recognition once a majority of workers sign cards saying they favor a union. Many businesses oppose card checks because they say the procedure makes it much easier for unions to secure majority support.With the 30-day deadline for Mr. Wolman to sign the labor accord having passed, Mayor Perez said that he was ""considering all his options,"" but that he did not want to say more because litigation was likely.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','Now, in the eyes of some, this combination of record capital inflows and indications that investors have once again have become indiscriminate in their buying, spells trouble.For James Trainor, a portfolio manager at Newgate Capital in Greenwich, Conn., a leading emerging markets hedge fund, the sign that the fever for emerging market stocks was running too high came earlier this month when he overheard the short-order cook at his local diner debating which oil stocks in Venezuela he should be buying. ""He was saying, 'Just wait until oil hits $100 — then these stocks will double,' "" he recalled. ""My reaction was: now things are really getting top-heavy.""Mr. Trainor, who manages more than $3 billion in assets and is a survivor of the previous decade's market meltdowns, sees other warning signs as well. ""Brazilian banks are trading at five time earnings. Russian debt has become investment grade. The risks associated with international investing have been pushed aside because of the returns,"" he added, his voice rising to be heard above the din of a traffic jam in Mexico City, where he was calling from.Despite the market turmoil this week, there is no indication yet that developing markets are prepared to collapse. Dollar reserves are at historic highs and the broad macroeconomic health of many of these countries is vastly improved, helped by soaring commodities prices and robust exports.Indeed, these economies have undergone startling economic transformations. Not only do China and South Korea hold more than a trillion dollars in reserves between them, but companies like Gazprom in Russia and Samsung in South Korea have emerged as influential global conglomerates that are among the world's largest companies.""The center of gravity has shifted,"" said Antoine van Agtmael, a long-time investor in developing economies, who coined the term emerging markets. ""These countries have become creditors instead of debtors. Current-account deficits have become surpluses.""Nevertheless, the pell-mell rush of funds into these markets as well as the push for more exotic, riskier investment fare suggests that memories of past emerging market crises may have dimmed. Last week, funds that invest in emerging markets took in one of their highest weekly sums ever, bringing this year's figure to $33 billion, already outpacing last year's record $20 billion, according to EmergingPortfolio.com.For hedge funds, always on the lookout for the next hot investment fad, it has been an opportunity not to be missed — 153 funds were formed last year to invest in emerging markets, according to Hedge Fund Research.There is much anecdotal evidence to be found that shows how investing in emerging markets has evolved from a niche area for hardened globetrotters and steel-nerved investors.In India, for example, a market that has shot up 141 percent over the last two years, some of the largest shareholders of top Indian companies are American mutual fund companies like Janus, known more for its momentum style of investing than for its emerging markets expertise.Just as technology stocks were good to Janus in the late 1990's, so have Indian stocks been this time around. In the foreign large-growth mutual fund category, according to Morningstar, the top three performing funds over a one-year period are all from Janus. And all three funds have Reliance Industries and Tata Steel, two Indian companies that have gone up 166 percent and 71 percent, respectively, as their top two holdings.Bidding wars have broken out between hedge funds for Indian investing talent; investment banks like J. P. Morgan, with limited experience in India, are now marketing closed-end Indian real estate funds to their high-net-worth clients; and Arshad R. Zakaria and Vikram S. Pandit, both of whom rose to be top executives at Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, respectively, formed funds to invest in India's private and public markets after leaving their old firms.In Russia, where the stock market is up 150 percent over the last two years, investors have been piling into commodity-based stocks. Indeed, the excitement for Gazprom, whose shares are up 266 percent over the past year, has become such that James Cramer has begun to shout out the company's virtues on his ""Mad Money"" program on CNBC, while more sober-minded industry analysts talk of it becoming the world's first trillion-dollar company.It is not just foreign money that is pushing up stocks abroad. In Pakistan, where suicide bombings remain a frequent occurrence in Karachi, the country's commercial center, an aggressive economic overhaul has lured billions of dollars from Pakistanis at home and abroad into the stock market. Since 2001, the stock market capitalization has exploded from $10 billion to its current $55 billion, and it has only been in the last six months that foreign investors have started to dip their toes back into the market.Perhaps the broadest indicator that shows how comfortable investors have become with emerging market risk is the historically narrow interest rate spread that separates the government bonds of countries like Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey and Pakistan from United States Treasury bonds, long the paragon of risk-free investment. In the past, the gap separating the paper of emerging economies has been wide, reflecting the higher economic and political risk associated with these countries.But as these countries have turned their economies around, narrowing budget deficits and accumulating current-account surpluses, their credit ratings have improved. In a curious reversal, many of these countries, in Asia especially, are now the largest buyers of the Treasury securities that the United States government has been selling as its own budget deficit has widened.""For the first time in modern history, poor countries are financing the rich,"" said Marc Faber, a global investment analyst noted for his gloomy prognostications. ""I would not rule out one day that Brazil will have a better credit rating than the U.S."" As an example he cites the time this spring that the yield on 10-year Polish bonds actually fell below United States bonds of the same maturity — a highly unusual occurrence for an emerging market bond.But with spreads widening, seasoned investors like Mr. Trainor worry that that the sudden influx of new money, especially from hedge funds, many of which now are among the largest shareholders of companies in Turkey, Argentina and Mexico, may not have the patience or experience to withstand the volatility of these markets.""Shining returns have attracted all walks of investors like mosquitoes around a lamp post,"" said Mr. Trainor, this time in an e-mail sent from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""For an asset class best left to dedicated investors, those that aren't afraid to kick the tires in some of the most remote parts of the world, these mosquitoes better be careful or they might just get zapped.""'"

"'06-05-18,'0','The operator of the Roosevelt Island Tramway said yesterday that it would probably take 10 to 12 weeks to complete repairs and upgrades, at which point it will call in state inspectors to authorize the resumption of service on the line, which broke down last month, stranding dozens of people.Bob Liff, a spokesman for the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, which operates the 30-year-old East River gondola system, said it hoped to have the tram running by the fall. After repairs are complete, he said, it is unknown how long inspectors from the State Department of Labor will require.Officials have scheduled a news conference today to provide details on the plan to bring the tram, which has been grounded since April 18, back into service.""As soon as we are convinced, and as soon as state regulators are convinced, that the tram can be operated safely, it will open,"" Mr. Liff said.The tramway corporation has said test runs have been encouraging since its primary electrical system was replaced earlier this month. At least 200 of the tests have been done successfully, Mr. Liff said yesterday.But he said a hurdle remained in replacing a diesel-powered backup system that is needed to get passengers back to the station in an emergency, like the one on April 18.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','CARSON CITY, Nev., May 17 (AP) — Chic Hecht, a conservative Republican known as much for his verbal miscues as for his upset victory over a powerful Democratic incumbent in a 1982 United States Senate race, died Monday in Las Vegas. He was 77.His death, of cancer, was confirmed by Francine Pulliam, a longtime family friend.Former Senator Paul Laxalt, Republican of Nevada, recalled thinking that Mr. Hecht, a onetime Las Vegas clothing store owner, was ""half crazy"" when he ran for a State Senate seat in a heavily Democratic district in 1966. Mr. Hecht won that race, and went on to defeat United States Senator Howard Cannon, Democrat of Nevada, by a slim margin of 6,000 votes, after Mr. Cannon was caught up in a Teamsters union scandal.Mr. Hecht served one term in the Senate, and was defeated in his bid for a second term by Dick Bryan, a Democrat. He served for five years as the United States ambassador to the Bahamas, before returning to private business.In the Senate, Mr. Hecht became known for his verbal slips, once referring to the proposed nuclear waste repository that the federal government wants to open at Yucca Mountain as a ""nuclear suppository.""Mr. Hecht served on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and was chairman of the Housing and Urban Affairs subcommittee. He also served on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence, which oversees intelligence-gathering activities of federal agencies.Born Mayer Jacob Hecht in Cape Girardeau, Mo., Mr. Hecht was known since childhood as Chic (pronounced chick), a nickname given him by an uncle. After graduation from Washington University in St. Louis in 1949, Mr. Hecht served as an Army counterintelligence agent in Berlin in 1952 and 1953.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','The authorities said Mr. Arslan shot the members of the court, which handles state administrative matters, during their morning meeting. As a licensed lawyer, Mr. Arslan had relatively easy access to the courthouse, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said.Judge Mustafa Yucel Ozbilgin was shot in the head and died after surgery. Another judge, Mustafa Birden, who was shot in the stomach, was described as being in stable condition, as were the other three who were shot.President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said, ""Pressures and threats will not defeat Turkish justice.""Turkey is overwhelmingly Muslim, but its law prohibits Islamic attire, including head scarves, at schools and other public buildings, in an effort to control religious influence on social and political life. In February the court ruled that a nursery school teacher would not be allowed to wear a head scarf, even away from the school premises. Critics saw this as an intrusion into her private life.The state-run Anatolian News Agency, citing the accounts of investigators, reported that Mr. Arslan, in detention after the shootings, had identified himself as an ultra-nationalist who was independent of any organization, and had said he was influenced by the debates on the head scarf. The investigators said they had found a handgun in his car.The NTV news channel showed a front page of Vakit, a pro-Islamic newspaper, from February that featured an article that heavily criticized members of the court for supporting the ban on head scarves. The paper printed photos of the judges, including those attacked Wednesday. An Istanbul prosecutor has ordered an investigation of whether the newspaper violated the law by encouraging violence and making targets of official figures.Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who leads the Islamic-inspired Justice and Development Party, has periodically criticized the court for rulings like the one on head scarves. But at a news conference after the shootings, he rejected implications that such criticism heightened public anger toward the court.""This incident is one to be denounced,"" Mr. Erdogan said. ""Building an association between the attack and the head scarf issue, or my views in the pre-election period, is an even uglier approach.""Sumru Cortoglu, the chairwoman of the Council of State, said the government had rejected her plea for more protection in face of news media reports that seemed to make judges targets of violence. But Mr. Cicek, the justice minister, said additional protection was ordered last month.'"

Justice Plummer E. Lott of State Supreme Court ordered Mr. Gargiulo to jail until his sentencing, scheduled for June 7.""Your crime is no different than any other defendant convicted of murder,"" Justice Lott said, rejecting a request for bail and adding, ""No amount of money would keep him here.""Mr. Gargiulo, who faces 25 years to life in prison when sentenced, listened impassively.During the trial, he had delivered an animated account of self-defense, rolling on the courtroom floor to re-enact the fight with his wife's brother, Preston J. Geritano. He said he was afraid of Mr. Geritano, whose behavior had turned erratic. His lawyers played a recording of Mr. Geritano making violent threats.On April 22, 2004, Mr. Geritano confronted Mr. Gargiulo with a stickball bat at Amici, a restaurant in Bay Ridge, and Mr. Gargiulo stabbed him with a hunting knife concealed in a scabbard attached to his garter sock.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','Galas are a big part of operatic tradition. You need to have one every few years. At the Met they have become practically part of the standard opera landscape. This Saturday's season-ending gala, a tribute to the departing general manager, Joseph Volpe, is being billed as a particular blockbuster. Yet, inevitably, people are already comparing it to another blockbuster gala in recent memory, the 1996 celebration of James Levine's 25th year at the house, which went on for more than seven hours.Length is one measure of a gala, but the event rises and falls on the question of who is going to sing. Or who is not going to sing. At Mr. Volpe's gala, a whole generation of singers seems to be missing in action.The point of a gala is to present a cross section of an era: generally, all the big current stars will perform, as well as a range of beloved elder statesmen and -women returning for a last farewell. The Levine gala represented the final Metropolitan appearances of James King, Bernd Weikl, Carlo Bergonzi, Ileana Cotrubas, Alfredo Kraus, Gwyneth Jones and Grace Bumbry. An august company indeed.So it's interesting that Mr. Volpe's gala, celebrating a nearly 16-year reign that is being bruited (an inevitable accompaniment to the passing of the baton) as one of the Met's most illustrious, is focused so firmly on the present. Plenty of contemporary stars will raise their voices to Joe: Renée Fleming, Deborah Voigt, Susan Graham, René Pape, Dmitri Hvorostovsky. And there will be a few grand figures from earlier eras, including the redoubtable Plácido Domingo (still very much a part of the Met scene), Kiri Te Kanawa, Frederica von Stade and Mirella Freni. Luciano Pavarotti is tentatively scheduled, but health problems may prevent him from performing. There will be relatively few touching farewells. Most singers appearing on Saturday are still active; most are still fairly young. A perusal of the schedule reveals what could be called a generation gap. Ms. Fleming and Ms. Voigt are in their 40's. Mr. Pavarotti is 70.Where are the singers in between: the stars of the 1990's, of the early years of Mr. Volpe's tenure? Where are the stars now in their 50's? There are precious few of them.Where, for example, is Jerry Hadley, the tenor whose star burned so brightly in the 1980's? He appeared in the news last week, for his arrest on a drunken-driving charge. (He didn't actually start the car.) News reports said he was 54, awfully young to be a has-been, but a recent recording of Bernstein's ""Mass"" documents a voice that is not in great shape.'"
"'06-05-18,'0','LONDON, May 17 — The rumors began almost as soon as the couple started dating: that she was a publicity-crazed fantasist; that he was too addled by romance to notice that, among other things, his children detested her. But all the pessimism about the marriage of Paul McCartney and Heather Mills McCartney seemed justified yesterday when the couple announced that they had formally separated.Despite reports in the British news media of knock-down fights in recent days, the couple said in a joint statement that the split, after four years of marriage, was amicable and that ""both of us still care about each other very much."" They said they had ""found it increasingly difficult to maintain a normal relationship with constant intrusion into our private lives"" and asked ""for the sake of our baby daughter, that we will be given some space and time to get through this difficult period.""The statement made no mention of trying to get back together. Nor did it mention divorce, an issue potentially complicated by the fact that Sir Paul has a large fortune — £825 million (about $1.55 billion) pounds, The Evening Standard reported — and by the lack of a pre-nuptial agreement. Although the British press reported at the time of the wedding that Sir Paul's children had insisted that he sign such an agreement, he later said he had not, considering it ""unromantic."" At first the relationship between Sir Paul, 63, the ex-Beatle with the preternaturally boyish face, and Lady McCartney, 38, a former model he met in 1999 through her charity work, seemed blessed.He was a famously uxorious man who was said to have spent only one night away from his first wife, Linda, in 29 years of marriage. (She died of cancer in 1998.) Ms. Mills, as she was then, had overcome a past that included an abusive father, periods of destitution and homelessness, and the loss of her leg after she was hit by a police motorcycle while crossing a London street in 1993. They were both devoted to charity, raising money for people who had lost legs to land mines and later campaigning against cruelty toward animals.By the time they married, there was already a strong tide of anti-Heather opinion in the British press, abetted by an army of anonymous ""friends"" of the couple.'"

Take the Xtatix Freefone, a self-contained player with an FM radio tuner that offers hands-free playback.The Freefone, which weighs about four ounces, is essentially a pair of headphones studded with buttons. A U.S.B. cable transfers music from a Mac or PC and charges the built-in battery, which lasts about seven hours between charges. Like the iPod Shuffle, the device plays songs at random or in the order in which they were uploaded.The 1-gigabyte version costs $159 and can hold up to 300 songs; a version with half as much storage costs $119. Both are available at www.xtatix.com and from online retailers.A switch on one side of the headphones flips from FM to MP3 mode, and buttons control power, audio playback and equalizer settings. The other side has controls for FM tuning or to fast-forward and rewind.In addition to music, the Freefone can store computer files, should you want to wear your important data around your ears.

"'06-05-18,'0','Apple's line of laptops aimed at consumers took a leap forward this week when the company released its new MacBook model. Intended to replace the slower iBook laptops, the new MacBooks have either a 1.8-gigahertz or 2.0-gigahertz Intel Core Duo processor under the hood.The new laptops have a bright, glossy 13-inch wide-screen display and a built-in iSight camera for video chats on the go. The MacBooks come with Apple's Front Row software and a tiny remote control for browsing your photo, movie and music collections without having to fiddle with the keyboard or trackpad.The MacBook is available in white like the older iBook, but a sleek black model is also available; prices start at $1,100, and configurations can be compared at www.apple.com/macbook.Like the high-end MacBook Pro, the new MacBook comes with a MagSafe adapter that connects the power cable to the laptop magnetically — and easily pulls loose to keep the computer from taking a dive if somebody trips over its cord.It can connect to the Internet through wireless or Ethernet connections, but the days of dial-up are over — unless you pay an additional $49 for an external modem.

"'06-05-18,'0','Still, Ms. Brooks, who is a psychology major, said she realized that her compromises may someday catch up with her.""It's so ironic that you think a tan makes you look healthier, even though it's just the opposite,"" Ms. Brooks said as she waited for a tanning booth last Friday afternoon in the crowded foyer of Portofino Sun Center, a tanning salon on Third Avenue at 75th Street in Manhattan. ""I am nervous that this could cause cancer and wrinkles.""But, then again,"" she said, ""I don't want to be pale.""With Memorial Day the height of the indoor tanning season, people are bronzing their bodies for proms, weddings, graduations and other social events, even as doctors and government officials are ratcheting up warnings.An estimated 30 million Americans visit a tanning salon at least once a year, the majority of whom are women 20 to 35 years old, according to the Indoor Tanning Association, an industry trade group in Washington.Ms. Brooks said that giving her naturally pale, freckled skin a caramel tone makes her feel ""a little thinner and prettier."" Others say that indoor tanning is relaxing and creates an inner sense of well-being. A session costs $20 to $50.But some prominent dermatologists say that indoor tanners run a risk of getting skin cancer and of accelerating the skin's aging process.""Young, healthy people who think they are invulnerable cannot really imagine that someday they are going to be 40, 50 or 60 and get skin cancer,"" said Dr. Barbara A. Gilchrest, the chairwoman of the dermatology department at Boston University School of Medicine and a skin cancer researcher. ""What drives them is not health concerns. They go to tanning salons or sunbathe because of pervasive and persistent societal beliefs that tan skin is attractive.""Dermatologists, including Dr. Gilchrest, are concerned less about where people tan than about the overall problem of exposure to ultraviolet radiation.Dr. James Spencer, a dermatologist in St. Petersburg, Fla., who has studied the risks of tanning devices, said that short-length UVB rays, which affect the skin's outer layers, and longer-length UVA rays, which penetrate more deeply into the skin, can damage the skin's DNA, leading to genetic mutations that can cause skin cancer. Ultraviolet radiation can also weaken the skin's immune system, making it less able to fight off disease, Dr. Spencer said.These doctors say that indoor tanning may give clients a false sense of safety because the tanning industry has done a good job of promoting the notion that tanning booths offer ""moderate"" UV exposure compared to the sun's rays. The Web site of the International Smart Tan Network, tanningtruth.com, in fact, promotes the notion that indoor tanning can be beneficial.""Every year, millions of indoor tanners successfully develop 'base tans' before embarking on sunny vacations,"" the Web site says. The site also asserts, ""Your skin is designed to tan as a natural body function, and the body is designed to repair sun damage as a natural process.""Not so, said Dr. Allan C. Halpern, a melanoma specialist who is chief of dermatology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. There is no such thing as a safe tan, he said. A tan is a defense mechanism: the body produces the brown pigment melanin to protect itself from ultraviolet radiation. And only after skin has sustained DNA damage, he said.""UV radiation is an important cause of skin cancer,"" Dr. Halpern said. ""It's a carcinogen. Indoor tanning is just substituting one culprit for another.""Those who work in the tanning industry say the risks are overblown.""Most likely, getting a little sun isn't worse than getting too much sun or too little sun,"" said Jan Meshon, a co-owner of City Sun Tanning, a salon on East 13th Street. ""Generally, we promote moderation.""But government officials said they are not convinced, and want better warnings for consumers.""Fifty years ago, warnings on cigarette packages said smoking may be dangerous to your health,"" said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who with Representative Ginny Brown-Waite, Republican of Florida, has introduced a bill asking the Food and Drug Administration to consider making warning labels on tanning beds more prominent and strident.""Now cigarette packs say smoking causes cancer,"" Ms. Maloney said. ""We don't want to wait another 50 years to have labels that adequately warn people that tanning beds cause cancer.""But John Overstreet, executive director of the Indoor Tanning Association, said the agency is adequately regulating the industry, and Ms. Maloney's bill is unnecessary.Many people who regularly visit tanning salons choose to set limits on their exposure, rather than eliminate it.Kristyn DeAngelo, 23, who graduated last week from Parsons School of Design, said she visits City Sun five days a week. She said she believes she's protected, as long as she does not get sunburned, and so prefers newer tanning machines that emit lower levels of UVB light. Even so, she said, she covers her face with a towel to avoid tanning because she does not want wrinkles.""I know that I won't get burned,"" she said, ""so I think it's a lot safer than being out in the actual sun.""But Dr. Spencer cautioned that sunlamps that have lower levels of UVB intensity may give off UVA energy that can be more than 10 times stronger than that of the sun.""More UVA energy is more efficient because you can cook yourself faster,"" he said. ""And you can fry body parts like your bottom, eyeballs and genitals that you might not normally fry on the beach.""Many salon regulars said they believe that a rich tan does a better job of setting off white or brightly colored clothing, an idea fostered by the fashion industry. But even in that world, accommodations are being made. The most chic tan is now a lighter, more caramel color than it used to be, said Hal Rubenstein, the fashion director of In Style magazine.""The whole idea of baking until you look like hazelnut chocolate ice cream, the mahogany look, is not the goal anymore,"" said Mr. Rubenstein, who is known in fashion circles for his perfectly maintained bronzed looks. Mr. Rubenstein said he sunbathes on weekends while wearing sunscreen and rarely goes to a tanning salon.""You don't want your skin to look like an old Louis Vuitton wallet,"" he said. ""You want a little golden glow that is not extreme.""Dr. Gilchrest said that is one tanning trend that gives her a little comfort.""Today the most gorgeous, tan model is not as tan as she used to be,"" he said. ""At least that's a step in the right direction.""'"
"'06-05-18,'0','With 8,584 United States Open entries this year, local and sectional qualifying is needed to whittle the field to a manageable 156 golfers at Winged Foot. At least 75 marquee names among those players are exempt from qualifying because of previous accomplishments, which leaves about 80 spots available to those players who survive the sectional qualifying.The Open has always been this way. Nicklaus, Woods and Jones all hoped to qualify as teenagers.At 16 and 17, Woods didn't get through the sectional. At 18, Jones shot 75 and 76 to qualify for the 1920 United States Open at Inverness outside Toledo despite a skulled pitch shot that soared over the green while playing with Harry Vardon, the six-time British Open champion. When Jones, in his embarrassment, said, ""Mr. Vardon, have you ever seen a worse shot?"" Vardon coolly replied, ""No.""Nicklaus, who at 16 won the Ohio Open against the state's best pros, was 17 when he qualified for the 1957 United States Open at Inverness.""On the first hole, I drove with a 3-wood, hit a 9-iron to 35 feet and made the birdie putt,"" he has often recalled. ""After three holes I was on the leader board, then I made a double bogey and I was gone. I shot 80-80 to miss the cut by 10.""If Wie qualifies for the United States Open at Winged Foot, she will have done it at a younger age than Nicklaus, Woods or Jones.As the medalist with a par 72 at a United States Open local qualifying Monday in Hawaii, Wie advanced to the sectional qualifying at Canoe Brook's tree-lined 7,066-yard par-72 North course and somewhat easier 6,707-yard par-72 South course. Both courses were modernized in recent years by Rees Jones, the golf architect who is known as the Open doctor.""When Fuzzy Zoeller was here for an Open qualifying a few years ago,"" said Greg Lecker, the Canoe Brook pro, referring to the 1984 United States Open champion at Winged Foot, ""he said the South was a sporty course but that the North was a course you just wanted to finish.""The actual number of golfers and spots for the United States Open at Canoe Brook won't be announced for another two weeks by the United States Golf Association, but in 2004 there, 138 golfers competed for 22 spots. More than two dozen were PGA Tour pros, including 18 who had won a Tour event. Among those who failed to qualify were familiar names like Jeff Sluman, Loren Roberts, Blaine McCallister, Brett Quigley, Robert Damron, David Gossett and Jim McGovern.In a United States Open qualifier, it's not how familiar your name is, it's how low you score that day. In the 2004 sectional qualifying at Canoe Brook, J. P. Hayes, a two-time winner on the PGA Tour, and David Morland, a Toronto pro, were each at 10 under for two rounds. The last of the 22 spots were earned with 140, four under par, the early target number that Wie will probably need to shoot.All of her headlines and highlights and all of her reported $50 million contracts with Nike and Sony won't help Michelle Wie on June 5 in an exam that will be tougher than any she takes at Punahou Academy.'"

The governor of Kandahar confirmed that a very senior Taliban commander was among three members of the leadership council of the insurgent movement who had been captured, but said he could not identify him for reasons of security.Security forces continued hunting for insurgents after two days of fierce fighting in Kandahar and the adjoining province of Helmand.The capture of Mullah Dadullah, and the two other leading figures, would be a significant success for the United States-led coalition and for the Afghan government as they battle a spreading insurgency across the provinces of southern Afghanistan and a suicide bombing campaign that continues to take a toll in foreign and Afghan casualties.Some 24 Afghan police, an Afghan soldier and a female Canadian soldier were killed in fighting since Wednesday, officials said. An Afghan civilian and an American counter narcotics official also died in two suicide bombings Thursday. An Afghan truck driver was also mistakenly shot dead by American investigators at the scene of one of the bombings when he seemed to be driving straight at them, the United States embassy in Kabul said in a statement.Mullah Dadullah, who is accused of numerous atrocities during the 1990s when he led much of the fighting against anti-Taliban forces in central and northern Afghanistan, has also been blamed for some of the worst killings by insurgents since the fall of the Taliban four years ago.'"
"'06-05-19,'1','A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.Russia's minister of trade and economic development, German O. Gref, rebuked law enforcement agencies for extorting money from private business in a blunt speech widely covered by the Russian press. ""Government structures blackmail owners and the management of companies,"" Mr. Gref was quoted as saying by Nezavisimaya Gazeta, referring to raids and inspections conducted solely, as he put it, ""in the interest of the law enforcement agencies.""He noted the government's current impotency to improve the country's corporate atmosphere, a striking acknowledgment of the pervasiveness of corruption. ""Hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars are being stolen right under our nose,"" Vremya Novostei quoted him as saying, and he blamed ""the complete lawlessness of the legislation."" Nezavisimaya Gazeta noted that in business, ""owners were helpless without a government 'roof',"" or protection by highly placed government officials.Mr. Gref's comments follows a series of government efforts to showcase its fight on corruption in advance of the Group of Eight meeting, which will be held in St. Petersburg in July. Numerous customs officials were recently arrested on corruption charges, and many more arrests are expected. Mr. Gref said he, too, planned on rooting out corruption in his ministry, by introducing stricter policies to regulate property confiscation, among other things, according to Vremya Novostei.EXTERNAL PASSPORT PROCESS IMPROVED: Authorities have eased the cumbersome process of getting an external passport by hiring intermediaries who specialize in preparing documents — no easy task in post-Soviet Russia — to help expedite the process.PUTIN TRIES TO REACH YOUTH: At a meeting on Thursday with the pro-Kremlin youth organization ""Nashi,"" President Vladimir V.

""Check out Ford's all-new line of cars and trucks.""Seconds later, via mlb.com, I flipped to the WFAN broadcast of the Mets' game. Bottom of the eighth, Gary Bennett at bat for St. Louis. Howie Rose immediately described the ""luxury, refinement and sophistication"" of a Chrysler.The raft of commercial intrusions into the flow of a game is not new. It is simply getting worse. A few friends implored me to listen to a full Yankee game to hear for myself, and I said, ""Will you pay for my post-Sterling traumatic stress rehab?"" But it's not just a Yankee radio clutter issue. In-game commercials clutter sports radio and the TV screens, particularly with advertiser-sponsored features, graphics and statistics.Those little ads that have jutted out of the score boxes on World Cup broadcasts did nothing to inform viewers about soccer but satisfied sponsors that they would not be forgotten until halftime, when commercials resumed.I was listening to the Oakland-Yankees game Saturday, which enabled me to hear Sterling sing a brief snippet of ""Tomorrow"" and drop a message for the Fox News Channel into describing the first-inning run scored by Johnny Damon on Alex Rodriguez's homer. In the second, before a 2-1 pitch to Damon, Sterling said, ""If you're looking to buy or sell a home, call 1-800-Remax-NY."" Then: ""The pitch, a breaking ball, cut on and missed.""Consider the pseudo-creativity of the advertisers and/or the station as they try to devise ways to make this irritating commercial policy blend with the game. It doesn't work, and there is little to admire in their effort.There's that Time Warner Triple Play contest, a real loser for any entrant because the Yankees have gone 6,009 games without turning a triple play.Then this: When Bernie Williams made the 15th out of Saturday's game against Oakland, Sterling read from this inspired copy: ""Geico wants to remind you that a 15-minute call can save you 15 percent on your insurance."" (Full disclosure: I am insured by Geico.)Or this: In the fifth inning Saturday, Williams fouled off the first pitch from Chad Gaudin, which prompted Sterling to say, ""Foxwoods Resorts knows all about perfect swings"" — a come-on for the Lake of Isles golf course.And yes, there is more: the Yankee Power Report is brought to listeners by the Indiana Point Energy Center, the home of nuclear power plants.These ads are educational. The first lesson is that one sponsor (like the digital phone service by Time Warner Cable) is needed to summon a reliever, but another (like Foxwoods — ""the wonder of it all"") is needed to remind listeners, after the commercial break, that the reliever called in courtesy of the Advertiser No. 1 is on the mound courtesy of Advertiser No. 2.The other lessons are: (1) when a batter makes an out, pause before the next batter to contemplate the late-closing pick-up windows at Wendy's, (2) when you're listening to Sterling and Suzyn Waldman call the game, it's not from a booth named for Mel Allen, Red Barber or even Bob Gamere, but for the Lowe's home improvement chain, and (3) when you need to buy or sell a car at the very moment Andy Phillips is ahead 2-0 in the count and runners are on second and third, ""pick up or click up"" Car Buyers Market.Look what I've done: product placement everywhere.'"

"'06-05-19,'1','WASHINGTON, May 18 — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit brought by a man who says he was an innocent victim of the United States government's program transferring terrorism suspects secretly to other countries for detention and interrogation.Judge T. S. Ellis 3d ruled in favor of the Bush administration, which had argued that the ""state secrets"" privilege provided an absolute bar to the lawsuit against a former C.I.A. director and transportation companies. Judge Ellis said the suit's going forward, even if the government denied the contentions, would risk an exposure of state secrets.The case involves Khaled el-Masri, a Kuwaiti-born German, who was arrested on Dec. 31, 2003, in Macedonia, where he had gone for a vacation. From there, he was flown to a prison in Kabul, Afghanistan, where he was held for five months before being released. During his incarceration in Kabul, he has said, he was shackled, beaten and injected with drugs.United States officials have acknowledged the principal elements of Mr. Masri's account, saying intelligence authorities may have confused him with an operative of Al Qaeda with a similar name. The officials also said he was released in May 2004 on the direct orders of Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, after she learned he had been mistakenly identified as a terrorism suspect.Judge Ellis said Mr. Masri's claim involved the clandestine program of transferring terrorism suspects known as ""extraordinary rendition"" and ""the means and methods the foreign intelligence service of this and other countries used to carry out the program.""'"
"'06-05-19,'1','Taking that risk has paid off handsomely so far. Since it opened its first two stores five years ago today, the Apple chain has become a retailing phenomenon. Necessity and inspiration led Apple to toss out the conventional textbook on computer stores and to ignore the rules of location, design, staffing and services provided.Revenue for each square foot at Apple stores last year was $2,489, compared with $971 at Best Buy, the big computer and electronics retailer, according to Forrester Research, a market research firm.This evening, Apple is opening a showcase store in Manhattan that will burnish the company's reputation for clever design. The entrance to the store, on Fifth Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets, is a glass cube, 32 feet on each side, with a suspended Apple logo inside. Customers walk down a circular staircase — or take a cylindrical glass elevator — to the 10,000-square-foot store below. The store will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week — a first for Apple and an acknowledgment of New York's status as a round-the-clock city.""We wouldn't do that in Palo Alto, but this is New York,"" Mr. Jobs remarked in an interview.Apple now has 147 stores — all but 14 in the United States — and is adding new ones at the rate of 40 a year. Sales at the stores more than doubled last year, to nearly $2.4 billion, and same-store sales, those open at least a year, increased 45 percent. But in the most recent quarter ended in March, same-store sales fell 18 percent from a year earlier. That prompted some to ask whether Apple was running out of gas.Apple says that the slippage was an aberration, caused mainly by its announcement in January that it was shifting to Intel microprocessors in its Macintosh computers, though the new machines were not yet in the stores. It says that the problem is mostly behind it now.Intel processors also power most machines running Microsoft Windows, the dominant PC operating system, and using Intel chips makes it easier for Apple users to also run Windows programs.Apple holds less than 5 percent of the personal computer market, and is often cast as the innovative underdog in a Windows world. The stores are crucial in turning Windows users into Apple fans because they allow them essentially to test-drive machines, with plenty of assistance from store personnel. The company says that nearly half of the people buying Macintosh computers at Apple's stores are converted Windows users.""The dip in the March quarter was not unexpected,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""We knew there would be a bump during this transition. But the longer-term objective here is that Apple stores are the place people are going to go to switch, to buy their first Mac. We've got to be ready for that.""At first glance, some of the company's moves seem, in stark financial terms, to be costly indulgences. Almost half of the store staff is there not to sell but to provide free help on how to use Macintosh computers, iPods, software and third-party accessories like digital cameras. Nearly all of the computers have Internet access, and the stores are crowded with people checking their e-mail, browsing the Web or listening to music on the iPods.Staff members receive salaries and do not depend on sales commissions, as such employees do at most other computer stores. And the stores are organized around different uses of computing technology: organizing music, editing digital photos or movies, creating podcasts and blogs — all done with Apple's software.""The Apple stores are selling digital experiences, not products,"" said Ted Schadler, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""Its stores can be seen as solutions boutiques. And that's the direction that selling technology to consumers, from cellphones to HDTV's, has to go to be successful.""At Apple, Mr. Jobs is the guiding hand behind most of the big decisions and many of the small ones as well. But Mr. Johnson, analysts say, deserves much of the credit for the success of Apple's stores.""He's a truly innovative merchandiser and a great manager,"" said Charles R. Wolf of Needham & Company.After earning an M.B.A. from Harvard in 1984, Mr. Johnson was offered a job in investment banking by Goldman Sachs, but turned it down. Sitting on a stool at another Apple store, in the SoHo district of Manhattan this week, he explained that he thought retailing would be more stimulating. He started at the Mervyns store chain, working on a loading dock at a branch in suburban Los Angeles. ""Fill a 40-foot trailer in 40 minutes — that was the goal,"" he recalled.Mr. Johnson then spent 16 years at Target, where he rose to vice president for merchandising. He forged a partnership with Michael Graves, the interior designer, that helped build Target's image as a marketer of affordable yet stylish goods.The lesson from his Target years, Mr. Johnson said, was that ""if you have great products that are merchandised and marketed clearly, the impact can be almost unlimited.""He saw the same kind of opportunity at Apple when Mr. Jobs approached him. Other computer stores were giving Apple short shrift, Mr. Jobs thought, in part because they lacked skilled employees that could explain why Apple was different. ""Steve felt with every bone in his body that Apple had to do retailing,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""It was not an experiment for him. He saw it as an essential business strategy.""To develop the concept, Apple built a prototype store in a warehouse near its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. The work, like much at Apple, was a secret, and for his first year at the company Mr. Johnson was given an employee alias: John Bruce.The first two Apple stores opened in McLean, Va., and Glendale, Calif., 17 months after Mr. Johnson arrived.The conventional wisdom of retailing is that when selling expensive products that are purchased infrequently, like cars or computers, stores should stand alone on cheap land. The assumption is that shoppers will drive a distance for such special shopping trips.But Apple decided that it could not afford to have its stores be out of the way. Instead, it opened in more expensive sites, like malls and downtown areas, where shoppers were gathered already.""Steve's view was they'll never drive 10 miles to look at us, but they will walk 10 feet,"" Mr. Johnson said.In retrospect, success has a way of looking inevitable. But there was considerable skepticism at the outset about what Apple was doing. And others have failed; Gateway closed its retail stores two years ago.One worry Mr. Jobs and Mr. Johnson had at the start was whether the stores could attract enough skilled people to explain Apple technology to nonexperts.As it turned out, there were plenty of young Apple enthusiasts who wanted to work for the company: 5,000 applied for the 300 jobs at the Fifth Avenue store.'"

"'06-05-19,'1','William R. Ginsberg, a leading advocate for the preservation of open space, a professor of environmental law and a New York City commissioner of parks and recreation in the Lindsay administration, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 75.The cause was lung cancer, his son Joshua said.From a boyhood in Flushing, Queens, when that community was still a patchwork of farmland, through his stewardship of the city's parks, Mr. Ginsberg evolved into an influential voice and legal tactician in the state's environmental movement.He was the lead lawyer in a 1979 case that for the first time allowed tax exemptions for privately owned nature preserves. He helped write state legislation creating conservation easements, which protect property owners' rights while preserving open space. He wrote the state report on the nearly 22,000 tons of toxic chemicals buried in steel drums near a residential development beside Love Canal in upstate New York.Mr. Ginsberg retired in 2004 as the Rivkin Radler distinguished professor of environmental law at Hofstra University, where, in 1974, he originated one of the first environmental law classes in the country. He was also an associate of the Manhattan law firm of Sive, Paget & Riesel since 1983. Eric A. Goldstein, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Mr. Ginsberg a pioneer in environmental law, about which he taught and wrote extensively.But what most motivated Mr. Ginsberg was saving open space. In an interview with the Hofstra Law Report, the law school's alumni magazine, at the time of his retirement, Mr. Ginsberg said: ""I take credit for having been involved in the preservation of 30,000 acres in New York State.

This week, the company said it would have costs of as much as $32 million through June 30, 2005, for options granted since 1994 that had effective dates earlier than when they were granted.The company is also the focus of an informal S.E.C. inquiry, and some of its top officials are named in shareholder lawsuits claiming that the company violated grant rules.Vitesse Semiconductor, of Camarillo, Calif., said it was being investigated by the S.E.C. over stock option grants.

""I have to look at the actual details of the bill,"" he said, calling it a step in the right direction but adding that it was more important for the state ""to look at the broader picture and make New York the renewable energy capital of our country.""Federal, state and local taxes add an average of 67.9 cents to the price of a gallon of gas in New York State, where gasoline taxes are the highest in the nation. Legislative leaders in Albany agreed last week to cut 4 to 9 cents a gallon from the tax, even though it was unclear that it would actually lower prices.Until yesterday, Mr. Pataki had not taken a position on the measure. He said he would still urge the Legislature to do more to reduce dependence on foreign oil, like creating incentives to encourage the purchase of hybrid vehicles and increasing the availability of alternative fuels.Mayor Michael R.

"'06-05-19,'1','The Palestinians, Mr. Olmert insisted in his excellent English, ""are the victims of their own extremist, fundamentalist, religious, inflexible and unyielding leadership, and we will do everything in our power to help these innocent people.""After the victory of Hamas in late January, Israel decided to withhold $50 million a month in customs and tax receipts, though it continues to pay Israeli companies about $5.5 million a month from those receipts for the water and electricity used by the Palestinians.Mr. Olmert said he was ""ready tomorrow"" to end the customs agreement and allow the Palestinians to collect the receipts directly. ""Let them collect the money and see what happens,"" he said. ""This money would disappear into the private pockets of the corrupt administration of the Palestinian Authority.""The Hamas government has been unable to pay salaries for more than two months.Israel, the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations — as well as the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas — have demanded that Hamas recognize Israel's right to exist, forswear violence and respect previous Palestinian-Israeli agreements, or lose nonemergency aid. Hamas has said it cannot recognize Israel, and though it has largely held to a truce with the Israelis, it has supported the right of other militants to continue their ""resistance against Israeli occupation.""Mr. Olmert, 60, was elected as head of the new Kadima Party on an explicit promise to try to set Israel's ""permanent borders,"" unilaterally if necessary. An estimated 70,000 Jewish settlers live beyond the West Bank separation barrier, which would form the basis for the border. He has called his ambitious project ""hitkansut,"" which best translates as consolidation.If he is to succeed, he will need financial support from the United States. His West Bank plans are estimated to cost at least $10 billion.This first trip to Washington is for discussion, Mr. Olmert said, calling consolidation ""a dynamic concept"" requiring preparation. ""What I can talk about at this point is the basic desire to set borders for Israel, to separate from the Palestinians, and to create a contiguous territory that will allow the Palestinians to fulfill their national dreams and establish their own independent state alongside the state of Israel.""The plan, he said, ""needs to be coordinated with a lot of sensitivity with our different partners, particularly the United States government and the president, and of course, the United Nations, the Europeans, the Russians.""What about the Palestinians?He stopped and said, ""I don't believe that at any time in the future we will change things without talking to the Palestinians."" But the decision, he made clear, would be Israel's.Mr. Bush is the crucial figure, Mr. Olmert said. ""I feel that I come to my senior partner, and I hope that he is ready to accept me as his partner.""His predecessor and ally, Ariel Sharon, believed that the United States was Israel's only real ally. Mr. Olmert, almost 20 years younger, is a professional politician who did not come out of the election with as strong a mandate as he and Washington might have hoped. Some American officials are concerned that Mr. Olmert may have bitten off more than he — or, perhaps, a politically weakened Mr. Bush — can chew.Mr. Olmert refused to specify his timetable, but Washington and the European Union want him to try to negotiate first with Mr. Abbas. Mr. Olmert does not want to get trapped into talks whose failure could start another round of violence.Asked if it was possible to negotiate seriously with Mr. Abbas about a final settlement while Hamas is in power, Mr. Olmert said, ""This is the main question."" Mr. Abbas must first dismantle Hamas as an armed terrorist group, Mr. Olmert said. ""He must rise to the opportunity and to the challenge and take vigorous action against the terrorist organizations, including Hamas.""Isn't that a call for Mr. Abbas to start a civil war?""It's not a call automatically for a civil confrontation,"" Mr. Olmert said. ""At the same time, I have to say, how can any political entity tolerate the existence of many armed groups fighting against each other in the streets?""Mr. Abbas, Mr. Olmert said, ""has to force Hamas to change, has to impose on Hamas the acceptance of Israel and the recognition of all the agreements signed with Israel and the disarming of its militant groups, because if not, then the damage threatening the Palestinian Authority is devastating.""Mr. Olmert called the Palestinians natural partners of Israelis but the historical victims of ""irresponsible, reckless, corrupt leadership and a total lack of democratic traditions that always drew them away from the mainstream and into the sidelines, and into tragedies and pain.""The Palestinians, unlike Iran, were no existential threat to Israel now, he said, ""But the challenge of the Palestinians raises fundamental issues of identity for the state of Israel."" He compared the issue, and implicitly the occupation, to a suppurating wound. ""When you have an open wound, and you're bleeding in your belly, even when this doesn't jeopardize your life, it occupies all of your attention most of the time and it deprives you of the joy of life.""An Israel without final borders ""is a significant absence, which I think stretches far beyond the political aspect into almost all aspects of life,"" he said. ""We have to set borders, and to define strict lines of what is right and what is wrong. It's not just a political issue, it's a social issue, it's a cultural issue.""Mr. Olmert knows that given the often short shelf life of Israeli governments, he cannot wait too long, despite world pressure to negotiate, before beginning his unilateral pullback from the West Bank.""Like all the prime ministers that were elected, my desire is to last in power for enough time in order to be able to carry out my dreams,"" he said, then added a little wistfully, ""Yet I know that if I wait too much, then maybe the dreams will remain dreams, and they will never become reality.""'"

"'06-05-19,'1','Diplomats and nuclear experts say the diminished view increases the risks of miscalculation, and possibly armed confrontation, just as the atomic impasse with the West is reaching a volatile new stage.The atomic energy agency, whose credibility as nuclear watchdog is at stake, is particularly worried. Full access ""increases our ability to detect possible undeclared nuclear activities,"" said the agency's director, Mohamed ElBaradei. Its absence severely limits ""our ability to provide credible assurances.""The new restrictions were alluded to in the agency's most recent report on Iran, in April. But their scope and repercussions emerged in interviews with diplomats, nuclear analysts and government officials.American intelligence officials say the restrictions are particularly significant because their own assessments depend heavily on the agency's findings. The reasons include the scarcity of human intelligence emerging from Iran, and suspicions about American intelligence after the failures in Iraq.""To build a public case, we need the international inspectors,"" a senior administration official said. ""The president knows that he cannot go out and give a speech describing our suspicions, not in this environment."" The official declined to be named because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Iran insists that until negotiations with the West over wider inspections collapsed, it had offered ""full and unrestricted access"" to prove that its atomic work was entirely peaceful, intended for nuclear power and medical isotopes for fighting disease.But the United States, Israel and many European governments see the situation as more complex. They say that Tehran opened up only after being caught hiding its nuclear advances for nearly two decades, and that when it did cooperate, a steady accretion of clues suggested that more remained hidden.Now that Iran has cut international access to the minimum required under arms-control accords, analysts are left with far fewer tools to penetrate those mysteries, many of which involve how close Iran is to mastering the transformation of uranium and plutonium into atomic fuel.Inspectors recently confirmed Iran's claims of having enriched very small quantities of uranium to low levels, and they can continue to monitor such narrow steps. But the inspectors have lost their window into the future — for instance, into the factories where, Iran has claimed, it will build tens of thousands of centrifuges, which concentrate uranium into fuel. Low-enriched uranium can fuel reactors; highly enriched uranium can power bombs.Nor can the inspectors investigate Iran's boasts that it is forging ahead with research on a more advanced centrifuge that could accelerate its efforts to make atomic fuel.The Iranians have also stopped cooperating with investigations into the possible existence of clandestine work on uranium and plutonium, an alternate bomb fuel. Just last week, diplomats disclosed an inquiry about traces of highly enriched uranium linked to a razed military research base at Lavizan, outside Tehran.The new reality is ""myopia compared to what they had before,"" said David A. Kay, a former inspector who in 2003 and 2004 led the American hunt for unconventional weapons in Iraq. The danger of such an information void, he added, is that officials will fall back on ""defectors, anti-regime elements and what foreign intelligence services tell you they know — sort of an Iraq redux.""American intelligence officials say the Iraq experience has forced them to consider a range of possible outcomes in Iran, including the best case, rather than assuming the worst. For that reason, they say, intelligence officials have not budged from the official estimate that Iran would need 5 to 10 years to produce a weapon, though some foresee a shorter time frame.Now, refining that forecast is harder than ever. As one senior European official put it, ""You need to roam around.""Iran's legal obligations began in 1968, when Tehran signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which requires countries to forgo nuclear weapons in exchange for aid in developing peaceful atomic energy. Six years later, Iran signed the treaty's safeguards agreement, which mandates detailed reports on steps that could lead to weapons and allows inspectors to hunt for cheating.The era of expanded openness, though, did not begin until early 2003, after an Iranian opposition group reported the existence of the vast nuclear facility at Natanz. Iran had no choice but to cooperate with inspectors if it hoped to prove that its nuclear program was peaceful. The buildup to the invasion of Iraq added to the pressure.Iran invited Dr. ElBaradei and his inspectors to Natanz. Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Agency, proudly led the tour, showing off the centrifuges and claiming that Iran's scientists had learned how to build them in only five years with information from the Internet.The inspectors saw that as a lie and concluded that Tehran had long been violating the treaty's safeguards agreement.Iran, determined to reassure the West, agreed to suspend much of its atomic program while negotiating with Europe over its fate. Beyond the basic safeguards, it agreed to abide by the treaty's ""additional protocol,"" adopting ""transparency measures.""Together, these steps let inspectors travel widely, even to military bases, and expand their investigations far beyond radioactive materials, to things like air samples and old files that might produce serendipitous discoveries.Thus began a game of nuclear cat-and-mouse in which inspectors praised the Iranians for the information they divulged, while criticizing them for what they appeared to withhold. Little by little, the agency pieced together deceptions dating from 1985, showing that Iran had done secret work that could help fuel a bomb.Over nearly three years of inspections, reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency documented dozens of surprises, including these:Iran was found to have used lasers to purify uranium starting in 1991, and in 2000 established a pilot plant for laser enrichment.Significant research was uncovered on polonium 210, a rare element that can help trigger an atom bomb.Many ties emerged to the black market of A. Q. Khan, the rogue Pakistani atomic pioneer, who supplied Iran with its centrifuge designs. Inspectors found one Khan document offering to help shape uranium metal into the ""hemispherical forms"" needed for bomb cores.Even on their best behavior, the Iranians could delay and stonewall. They are still refusing to turn over an important Khan document that inspectors have sought for two years.Sometimes, the excuses bordered on the comical. Keys to a centrifuge hall at the Kalaye Electric Company were lost. The Lavizan-Shian military physics research base, on the outskirts of Tehran, which was recently linked to the discovery of highly enriched uranium, was razed because, City Hall said, it needed the land for a park.In a sense, Iran's candor backfired. It always came up with detailed explanations for its omissions, discrepancies and hidden programs. But each new disclosure raised new doubts and demands for better information.""It's true to say the Iranians went beyond what they were strictly obliged to do,"" said Pierre Goldschmidt, a former safeguards director for the international agency who is now a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""But it doesn't mean what they did was enough.""Even that qualified cooperation ebbed last year after the talks with Europe collapsed and Iran got a new, hard-line president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Tehran resumed uranium enrichment at Natanz in January, and the next month, after the 35-nation board of the I.A.E.A. sent Iran's case to the United Nations Security Council for possible punishment, Tehran made good on a threat to drop all but the bare-bones inspections.Now, the agency estimates it can visit only 20 percent of the buildings at Isfahan, the oldest and largest part of Iran's nuclear program, where, among other things, raw uranium is prepared for enrichment.At Natanz, inspectors once had the right, on two hours' notice, to visit any building, and did so dozens of times, diplomats said. Now, they can go only to the few areas where the Iranians are enriching uranium or handling radioactive materials, or preparing to do so.So the inspectors can no longer enter plants where Iran makes centrifuges and their numerous parts. Iran has said that these factories and warehouses, some at Natanz, will produce 54,000 centrifuges for the cavernous underground enrichment halls.This loss of access is important because estimates on how fast Iran could get the bomb are based mainly on understanding its potential rate of centrifuge production. The Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has estimated that based on past production, Iran could make up to 100 centrifuges a month. Now, however, no one outside Iran knows if that pace has slowed or accelerated.Inspectors would also like to know if Iran is designing more sophisticated centrifuges. The international agency has repeatedly asked for information about an advanced type, the P-2, which could speed the making of atomic fuel.Iran had long insisted that it abandoned work on the project three years ago. Then, last month, Mr. Ahmadinejad made the startling announcement that Tehran was ""presently conducting research"" on the P-2, boasting that it would quadruple Iran's enrichment powers. Since then the agency, which suspects Iran has a hidden P-2 research center, has written to the Iranians demanding an explanation. They have not replied.There are also questions about plutonium. Last month's report by the agency on Iran tells of subtle discrepancies in Iran's experiments with plutonium made at a research reactor in Tehran.Iran says the agency is exaggerating the significance of a simple case of contamination. But inspectors say that without the freedom to explore the nooks and crannies of the Iranian program, they cannot pursue other possible explanations, like clandestine reactor runs or the smuggling of plutonium from abroad.In recent weeks, the West has sought to fashion a package of incentives to persuade the Iranians to limit their nuclear program and reinstate fuller inspections.Tehran has offered a counterproposal: it would be happy to reopen the window, but only if the Security Council drops its case against Iran and returns it to the atomic energy agency. That would remove the threat of sanctions, and possibly war.Washington dismisses such moves as playing for time. But Iran says it genuinely wants to prove that its aims are peaceful, as it pledges to be more forthcoming.""We have every interest in cooperating,"" said Javad Zarif, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations. ""But if the other side wants to adopt an approach of confrontation, cooperation is hard to justify.""In recent days, Iran has threatened to drop out of the nonproliferation treaty entirely.Mr. Zarif echoed Western views on the likely repercussions of the reductions in access, presenting them, almost tauntingly, as a potential problem that Washington and its allies had the power to fix.""The fewer inspections there are, the more potential there is for misinterpretation,"" he said. ""The other side doesn't have access any more to reliable information and has to rely on information that is suspect. Is this the path it is choosing?""The Iranian strategy, it seems, is to keep its nuclear program and force the West to find a way to verify that it is peaceful.""What the world should be looking for,"" said Mr. Aghazadeh, the director at the Iranian agency, ""is a way to remove the ambiguities.""'"

""But the only emotion they expressed to me was they wanted to be able to continue to do their work. You know, their fear was not for themselves or that they had done anything wrong, but that they wanted to be able to continue to do what it is they had been doing.""He also told of his talks with a handful of agency lawyers about the legality of the program under the president's authority as commander in chief under Article II of the Constitution. ""I talked to the N.S.A. lawyers, most of my personal dialogue with them, they were very comfortable with the Article II arguments and the president's inherent authorities,"" General Hayden said.At the same time, however, he acknowledged under questioning from Democrats that he did not read the Justice Department's formal opinion laying out the legal rationale for the program. He also said he did not recall any substantive discussion about the Congressional authorization in September 2001 to use all necessary force against Al Qaeda — a resolution that the White House now says helped give it legal authority for the wiretapping operation.""Our discussion anchored itself on Article II,"" he said.He acknowledged that there had been significant discussion within the administration — and between the White House and the security agency — about undertaking the program.ATLANTA, May 19 (AP) — The BellSouth Corporation is pressing USA Today to retract assertions that the telecommunications company provided customers' phone records to the National Security Agency.The Atlanta-based company's chief lawyer, Marc Gary, sent a letter on Thursday to the publisher of USA Today, the Gannett Company's flagship paper, to retract ""false and unsubstantiated statements"" made in a May 11 article, said a BellSouth spokesman, Jeff Battcher.A newspaper spokesman, Steve Anderson, said, ""We are reviewing it and will be responding.""'"
"'06-05-19,'1','YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia, May 18 — World Health Organization officials said Thursday that the five avian flu deaths confirmed this week on Sumatra were probably not a result of human-to-human infection and did not suggest that the virus had mutated into a more deadly form.Five family members were confirmed dead from the A(H5N1) strain of avian influenza by the World Health Organization on Wednesday, the largest such cluster recorded. A sixth family member died of flulike symptoms but was not tested for the virus.Clusters like the one in Kubu Sembilang village in northern Sumatra, where the victims lived, worry health officials because they indicate that the virus may have been transmitted between humans. Health officials have long feared that such a mutation could set off a worldwide pandemic capable of killing millions.Gina Samaan, a field epidemiologist for the World Health Organization in Kubu Sembilang investigating the recent cluster, said that the number of deaths had raised eyebrows but that so far the outbreak was similar to others in Indonesia that were caused by close contact with infected poultry.""Current evidence doesn't suggest at all that the virus was passed between humans,"" she said in a telephone interview.'"
"'06-05-19,'1','LONDON, May 18 — If animals have rights to escape cruelty, and humans have rights to study in tranquillity, where does that leave the civil rights of avowed animal lovers who want to protest loudly with bullhorns in one of Britain's supposedly hushed groves of academe?In a case that could determine which set of rights takes precedence, Oxford University petitioned Britain's High Court on Thursday to extend curbs on protesters trying to thwart the construction of a biomedical research center in the city.In response, animal rights protesters warned that further legal restrictions on them could force some of them into what one of their leaders, Mel Broughton, called ""a process outside the law."" He said his right to protest was under attack.But it was not simply a matter of colliding definitions of entitlements. The case further sharpened the lines between animal rights advocates, accused of using intimidating tactics, and an increasingly vocal array of adversaries including academics, leaders of the pharmaceutical industry and Prime Minister Tony Blair.""The appalling details of the campaign of intimidation — which include grave-robbing — show the depths to which the animal extremists are prepared to stoop,"" Mr. Blair wrote in The Sunday Telegraph last weekend.'"
"'06-05-19,'1','TRENTON, May 18 (AP) — Previously unpublished data from the study that led the drug maker Merck to halt sales of its blockbuster painkiller Vioxx appear to show the drug raised the risk of heart attack and stroke within just a few months, not after at least 18 months' use, as Merck has consistently argued.The company disputed that Thursday, saying it was ""not scientifically appropriate"" to draw conclusions based on a key graph in a 108-page report on the data. The news, first reported by National Public Radio, comes after prominent doctors said Merck misrepresented other data from the same study last week.Merck officials said last week that the new data, from a follow-up of patients a year after they stopped taking Vioxx, showed heart and stroke risks ended soon after they stopped taking it. The officials also said patients who later had such complications did not have a legitimate lawsuit. But several doctors said that depending on how one interpreted the data, the heart and stroke risks could persist for at least a year or longer.Now, a closer look at that same data indicates that the increased cardiovascular risk with Vioxx use most likely begins as early as four to six months and then gets bigger, said Dr. Steven Nissen, a Cleveland Clinic cardiologist and frequent Vioxx critic who is leading an international study of the risks of other painkillers.""It didn't really make a lot of sense that nothing happened for 18 months and then all of a sudden you would see a hazard,"" Dr. Nissen said.'"

"'06-05-20,'0','An Abbas spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeina, said: ""The assassination attempt of the head of the Palestinian intelligence services chief, Tareq Abu Rajab, is a serious escalation and an attempt to undermine national security.""But the spokesman for the Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniya, said the explosion would be investigated. ""We are asking not to make early judgments, accusations or responses that might lead to tension in the Palestinian streets,"" said Ghazi Hamad, the cabinet secretary.Some Palestinians in Gaza suggested that Sunday's explosion could be revenge for the killing on March 31 of Abu Youssef al-Quqa, 44, the leader of the Popular Resistance Committees, a Gaza militant group consisting of disaffected fighters from other groups. Mr. Quqa was killed in a car-bomb explosion outside a mosque that sparked gunbattles in which three others were killed and 36 wounded.Israel denied responsibility for the car bomb and others in the Popular Resistance Committees blamed Fatah security forces with close ties to the Israelis and promised vengeance. Abu Abir, a spokesman for the committees, accused Palestinian security officials of collaborating with Israel and singled out several by name, calling them ""traitors"" and vowing, ""we will behead them."" Among those he accused was Mr. Rajab and Muhammad Dahlan, the former head of Preventive Security in Gaza.At the time, the Hamas interior minister, Said Sayam, said the government would investigate, but no results have been announced.Mr. Rajab, who was close to the late Yasir Arafat, survived another attempt on his life in August 2004, when he was wounded in a drive-by shooting. He was badly hit in the chest then and brought to an Israeli hospital in Ashdod; he was appointed to his current post by Mr. Abbas in April 2005.Last week, Mr. Abbas sent Mr. Rajab to Jordan to look into Jordanian accusations that Hamas was trying to smuggle explosives into Jordan and even carry out attacks there, charges Hamas has denied.After Saturday's bombing, a group calling itself the Fatah Protection Unit demanded that Mr. Abbas dismiss the Hamas government and call new elections. As president, Mr. Abbas has the power to dismiss the prime minister, but not necessarily to call new elections. The group demanded that Hamas disband its new militia within three days and warned against the militia taking action against any member of Fatah.Armed Hamas and Fatah groups have clashed over the last week in Gaza. As Mr. Rajab and the wounded were driven to the Gaza hospital, agents fired from the windows to clear the streets, and some members of the new Hamas militia fired toward the convoy, apparently believing themselves under attack.Mr. Abbas, at a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, is scheduled to meet on Sunday with Israel's vice prime minister and foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, and the deputy prime minister, Shimon Peres. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, leaves for Washington on Sunday to meet President George W. Bush and speak to a joint session of Congress; he is expected to meet Mr. Abbas after the trip.'"
"'06-05-20,'0','Testing company executives, who were sent drafts of the legislation last week, said yesterday that they were still studying it. But the College Board, which runs the SAT, released a letter it sent to Mr. LaValle this week, saying that some provisions ""appear to be inconsistent with professional standards in educational testing."" Chiara Coletti, a spokeswoman for the board, said yesterday that she could not be more specific.The LaValle legislation also calls for requiring testing companies to respond more quickly to student requests for copies of the questions and answers on a test, including their own answers, and to make them available at no charge. Companies would also be required to keep — and make publicly available — the records of errors they made. They would also be required to rescore 1 percent of their exams each year as a quality check.Mr. LaValle sponsored truth-in-testing legislation in 1979 that allowed students to pay to see questions and answers for some exams each year, as well as to see their own answers. This has been the industry standard ever since.Testing experts say that there has been an increase in reports of testing errors in recent years.Mr. LaValle said his committee would take up the legislation on Wednesday morning, and he expected to move it to the floor the same day. ""I think the support will be there,"" he said, adding that he has bipartisan backing.Robert A. Schaeffer, the public education director of FairTest, a testing watchdog group that advocates a testing oversight agency, praised Mr. LaValle's legislation.""It would provide the best consumer protection for test takers anywhere in the country,"" he said, adding that he hoped it would become ""standard operating procedure nationwide.""""In the past, the test makers have extended New York's protections nationally, rather than have separate systems for one large state,"" he said.The testing tax, to be paid by the companies, would be imposed on the SAT as well as on other tests, including the LSAT, the GRE and the ACT. The oversight board would be part of the attorney general's office.Assemblyman Ron Canestrari, a Democrat from the Albany area and chairman of the Assembly's higher education committee, said that he was studying the testing proposal, but that he thought it would be ""difficult to move that quickly on something that controversial.""""We have the best testing system there is,"" he said.

In response, Symantec has raised its ThreatCon to Level 2, which means an outbreak is expected.""What we're seeing is a continuation of the targeted threat using zero-day vulnerabilities,"" Mr. Weafer said.

We have not seen anyone else get it.""Microsoft is preparing a security update for Word that repairs the vulnerability, a Microsoft representative said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The fix is scheduled to be released on June 13 as part of security updates, or sooner, if warranted.The malicious software arrives as a Microsoft Word file attachment to an e-mail message. When the document is opened, the vulnerability is exploited.In the Japanese case, the Word document actually displayed some text related to a treaty with China, but while the text was displayed, a backdoor was installed on the system, Mr. Weafer said.

"'06-05-20,'0','""A lot of my friends were wait-listed at their top choices,"" she explained. ""You're in limbo; you're not sure if you're in or out.""But some parents and consultants counter that they double deposit to continue negotiating financial aid with several colleges. And they argue that since colleges market so aggressively, trying to attract more applicants than they can admit, consumers have every right to engage in their own strategems.""If colleges are going to play games, can they blame families for also playing games?"" said Dodge Johnson, a private college counselor.Double depositing allows a student to mull over the summer where he or she really wants to go. And in a year in which some elite high school seniors have applied to 15 or 20 colleges, and received nearly as many offers of admission, some students are having trouble deciding.""They are accepted to so many colleges that they can't come to a decision by May 1,"" said Andy Morris, the associate director of admissions at the State University of New York at Binghamton.Mr. Morris said a few parents unapologetically told him this year that they wrote checks to two or more universities, even offering to tell him where.""I think parents are of a generation in which the idea of booking two airline flights or booking multiple hotel rooms are things that these parents do,"" he said. ""They are trying to hedge their bets.""Bruce J. Poch, a vice president and dean of admissions at Pomona College, said he had been surprised, and angered, when a friend told him two weeks ago that he had sent deposit checks to two colleges. ""It's an utterly selfish thing to do,"" he said.Ms. Navarro, who was placed on a waiting list by Connecticut College, committed to Bowdoin College. She was then offered admission to Connecticut College two weeks ago, but after some serious soul-searching, decided to attend Bowdoin after all.Of students who double deposit, Ms. Navarro said: ""They should just choose. They got in and they should decide.""There is no hard data on how many students double deposit, in part because colleges do not formally share information on who has committed to enroll. But the checks sent to Allegheny and St. Lawrence, and the other examples, are part of an accumulation of anecdotal evidence that has led many admissions deans, though not all, to conclude that double depositing is on the rise.""Absolutely, it's become more common,"" said Richard Whiteside, vice president for enrollment management and dean of admission at Tulane University, who said parents had also told him they had sent off several deposit checks. ""My strong belief is that more families are doing it.""Carolyn Lawrence, who created a blog, admissionsadvice.com, that provides information to students and parents, said that, for the first time this year, many parents had asked whether it was appropriate to commit to more than one school.In the past, admissions officials learned indirectly that a student had probably committed to several universities. In May and June, some students who have sent in deposits notify universities that another institution has offered to admit them from their waiting lists; this is legitimate, under the rules, although universities do not usually return deposits.But when students who sent in deposits by May 1 begin to fall away in July and August officials have assumed the students decided to attend another college to which they had also committed.Tulane, for instance, loses at least 75 people, and many of these are presumed to have double deposited, Dr. Whiteside said.""Personally, I don't get too upset about this,"" he said. ""Like other things about our business, it's just another force to deal with.""Several deans, including Eric J. Kaplan of Lehigh, said there had been talk of raising deposit fees to make double depositing more onerous, although some suggested that nothing would prevent some affluent parents from trying to get around the rules. Another idea deans talked about is to create a clearinghouse to identify offenders.Other admission officials, including Lee Stetson of the University of Pennsylvania and Robert Massa of Dickinson College, said they had not seen evidence that double depositing was increasing. Dr. Massa said Dickinson did not formally forbid students from committing to more than one college, although he said ""common sense and fairness"" suggested that it was inappropriate. He added that next year the college would, however, officially prohibit double depositing.Some parents said many colleges do not make clear the rules against double depositing. Ken Levin, a father who participates in an online discussion of college admissions, said it was unreasonable to bind parents and students to rules created by the admissions officials' professional association.Fear of getting caught may discourage people from making multiple deposits, even though the most severe punishment — the rescinding of admissions offers — appears to be seldom invoked.The young man who sent deposits to Allegheny and St. Lawrence nearly forfeited his admissions offers. Dr. Friedhoff of Allegheny said that administrators had initially considered that penalty, but that after considerable discussion, he and Terry Cowdrey, vice president and dean of admissions and financial aid at St. Lawrence, decided the punishment would be too harsh. The student was given a day to decide which college he wanted to attend. He chose Allegheny.Many admissions deans and college counselors said that although they expected to see more blatant examples of double depositing, it was time to end the practice.""The leadership in our profession needs to sit down and see what can we do realistically about this,"" said Brad MacGowan, a college counselor at Newton North High School.""This college admissions process — what messages are we sending to kids?"" Dr. MacGowan added. ""That this is a game in which you win or lose.""'"

The lower the price on the grant date, the more the executives stand to make when the shares rise.""It's totally inappropriate for companies to do this,"" said Dennis Beresford, a professor at the J. M. Tull School of Accounting at the University of Georgia; he was chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board from 1987 to 1997. ""My own experience would say that the options should be dated when the compensation committee approves them.""UnitedHealth said on Wednesday that it had received subpoenas from the United States attorney and the Internal Revenue Service.UnitedHealth and executives including the chief executive, William W. McGuire, and the president, Stephen J. Hemsley, were sued in Federal District Court in Minnesota by shareholders. The suit seeks unspecified restitution and damages, as well as corporate governance changes and a trust for future option contracts.Shareholders have also filed a lawsuit accusing Affiliated and some of its executives of violating grant rules.An S.E.C. spokesman, John Nester, declined to comment yesterday. Bridget Kelly, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Manhattan, Michael Garcia, said she could neither confirm nor deny the subpoena reports.Media attention to the issue has led the United States attorney and the S.E.C. to ""cast a wide net"" in their investigations, said Lisa Gill, a J. P. Morgan Securities analyst in New York.On Wednesday, Vitesse fired its chief executive, Louis Tomasetta, and two other executives and expanded its stock option inquiry to include the recording of revenue.

""I consider this a time of crisis, and I feel obligated to speak.""She continued, ""Senator McCain will also tell us about his strong-headed self-assuredness in his youth, which prevented him from hearing the ideas of others, and in so doing he will imply that those of us who are young are too naïve to have valid opinions.""I am young, and although I don't profess to possess the wisdom that time affords us, I do know that pre-emptive war is dangerous and wrong,"" she said.She added, ""Osama bin Laden still has not been found, nor have those weapons of mass destruction.""As Mr. McCain came to the lectern, dozens of students and professors stood and turned their backs on him. Many waved their fliers.Before his speech, Mr. McCain thanked Ms. Rohe ""for that CliffsNotes version of my address.""Mr. McCain seemed uneasy, but stuck to his script and did not acknowledge the barbs. As Ms. Rohe had predicted, he spoke about the importance of civil discourse, and he reiterated his defense of the war.""I believe the benefits of success will justify the costs and risks,"" he said. The protests grew louder and more frequent as he spoke. Some graduates walked out. Others laughed. When Mr. McCain returned to policy after briefly quoting Yeats, someone shouted, ""More poetry!""At another point, someone yelled, ""We're graduating, not voting!""The heckling continued when Mr. Kerrey returned to the lectern, with one audience member shouting, ""You're a war criminal!""Mr. Kerrey, a Medal of Honor winner, has admitted to leading a mission that resulted in the deaths of 13 to 20 unarmed civilians.If Mr. McCain was playing politics, he seemed to be trying to bolster his conservative credentials, with an eye toward the Republican primaries, and not, as some New School students had suggested, trying to gain credibility as a moderate. Aides to Mr. McCain said that they had expected that he would be jeered by a liberal crowd in New York.And by giving the same speech to graduates at Liberty, Columbia University and the New School, Mr. McCain appeared intent on restoring his reputation as a straight talker, after assertions that he has been kowtowing to conservative Christians ahead of a presidential run. In 2000, Mr. McCain called Mr. Falwell an agent of intolerance.After yesterday's event, Mr. McCain told reporters he felt ""fine"" about his reception. ""I feel sorry for people living in a dull world where they can't listen to the views of others,"" he said.Mr. Kerrey, on stage, had accused the protesters of ""heckling from the audience where no bravery is required.""But one graduate, Aisha Nga, 22, of Atlanta, said protesters were not hiding in the crowd. ""Bob Kerrey said we weren't very brave, but I think a lot of people who were booing would say it to his face,"" she said after the ceremony.

The new organization would be an ""independent, privately run service provider,"" Deutsche Börse said, implying it would sell its equity clearing business to a new entity.But the management of the new exchange would be dominated by Frankfurt and the structure would be similar to the German exchange. A Euronext spokeswoman, Antoinette Darpy, said the official offer outlined by Deutsche Börse was ""nothing new.""Euronext executives viewed the proposal as akin to ""a takeover without the premium,"" said one person involved in the negotiations on Friday who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive and fluid nature of the talks.Euronext said Thursday that it would announce plans for a ""transformational"" deal at its annual general meeting this coming Tuesday.Thierry Breton, the French finance minister, said that senior government officials in Paris had met with both New York Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse representatives to discuss a merger with Euronext.Talks about the structure of a merger between the New York exchange and Euronext have progressed to the point where most of the big decisions have been made, and a plan is expected to be presented to the board of the New York Exchange shortly, if it has not been already, this person said. Any deal is expected to be presented as a merger of equals.The New York Stock Exchange, a unit of NYSE, had no comment.Nasdaq said that it had purchased another 2.2 million shares in the London exchange, pushing its stake just above the crucial 25 percent threshold, and giving it power under British law to veto big deals that the London exchange might want to do.The London exchange has been the target of several unwanted bids in recent years, which it has rebuffed, including a £2.4 billion bid from Nasdaq this year.Robert Greifeld, chief of Nasdaq, said he was ""pleased to have increased our strategic investment in L.S.E. in excess of the important threshold of 25 percent."" The London exchange had no comment.Euronext also got a boost on Friday from the Borsa Italiana of Italy, whose president, Angelo Tantazzi, said Euronext was its ""first choice"" as a partner. At a board meeting on Thursday night, the borsa voted to seek an international alliance, a spokesman, Lorenzo Brufani, said.Borsa Italiana will now approach Euronext about working out the details, as it also prepares an initial public offering later this year.Euronext welcomed the move. ""It supports our belief that Euronext's federal model can accommodate to the European market and we look forward to beginning discussion with Borsa Italiana as soon as possible,"" Ms. Darpy of Euronext said.Deutsche Börse's proposal would put cash equities trading and a new pan-European bourse for newer, high-growth companies in Paris, while the derivatives business would be in Frankfurt and London, where the Euronext.Liffe futures bourse is based. A majority of its executives would be based in Frankfurt, but its legal incorporation would be in the Netherlands with the data business.Deutsche Börse also proposed that its chief, Reto Francioni, and Euronext's chief, Jean-François Theodore, serve as co-chief executives for an undefined transitional period, after which Mr. Francioni would lead the company and Mr. Theodore would assume a ""leading function"" in the supervisory board. It also proposed a board with equal representation of both companies, though a Deutsche Börse-nominated chairman would have the decisive vote.The German company also proposed a European organization that would handle the clearing of stock trades, an issue that has attracted the attention of major European banks and brokerage firms, which pay fees for this service and worry about the creation of a monopoly provider. Deutsche Börse integrates clearing directly into its business, but Euronext does not.'"
"'06-05-20,'0','ALBANY, May 19 — The auto industry has dropped a lawsuit against New York State over strict new regulations governing global warming emissions, but will still continue to fight the rules. The suit, which was filed last year, was dropped on Tuesday, according to court documents.The move represents a tactical shift for the automobile industry in a broad legal fight against California and states like New York that seek to mimic its global warming regulation requiring automakers to improve the fuel economy of their cars.""This illustrates that the car companies' legal assault on New York's rules that will reduce global warming emissions from cars is meritless,"" said Yueh-Ru Chu, an assistant attorney general of New York State. ""We welcome their withdrawal of their lawsuit and look forward to the day when these critical regulations will be fully implemented.""Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the industry trade group leading the suit, said, ""we reviewed our strategy and decided that this particular action doesn't fit in with the approach we're pursuing.""When, and if, New York's regulation actually takes effect remains to be seen.In 2004, California adopted the nation's first regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, a move that sent shudders through automakers from Detroit to Tokyo. Unlike smog-forming pollutants, carbon dioxide and other global warming emissions from vehicle tailpipes cannot be filtered. That means that cutting such emissions depends largely on making cars and trucks much more fuel efficient.Several states in the Northeast have moved to adopt California's regulation, due to go into effect on 2009 models. The auto industry's legal fight is likely to stall those regulations. The industry is suing California in federal court to block the regulation, and also suing in federal court in other states as well, though not in New York.'"
"'06-05-20,'0','R. Bruce Merrifield, who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing a much quicker way to synthesize proteins, streamlining many medical and scientific experiments, died Sunday at his home in Cresskill, N.J. He was 84.His death was announced by Rockefeller University, where he was an emeritus professor.To speed up the synthesis of proteins and snippets of proteins known as peptides, Dr. Merrifield had a simple insight: He nailed down the first building block of the protein on a solid surface. Other building blocks would then be added, step by step.With the end of the protein firmly attached, the unused ingredients in each step could be easily washed away. Previously, chemists synthesized proteins in liquid solutions. At each step, they needed to carefully fish out the partial protein before adding on the next piece.Dr. Merrifield's technique, called solid phase peptide synthesis, cut the time of many experiments from years to days. In other instances, it made the impossible possible.""There were materials we simply could not make by the older techniques with an infinite amount of time,"" said Richard DiMarchi, a professor of chemistry at Indiana University who worked in Dr. Merrifield's laboratory as a postdoctoral researcher three decades ago.'"
"'06-05-20,'0','A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supported the decision by Bausch & Lomb to recall its ReNu With MoistureLoc contact lens solution, which has been linked to cases of a serious eye infection, the company said yesterday.Bausch & Lomb said the report should restore confidence in its other lens care products, which had been under increasing scrutiny since the outbreak of cases of Fusarium keratitis, a fungal infection that can lead to blindness.""The C.D.C.'s conclusion that the MoistureLoc formulation was the only product with a statistically significant association with reports of Fusarium keratitis in the cases they have evaluated should put to rest any further speculation that other products may also be implicated,"" Bausch & Lomb's chief executive, Ronald L. Zarrella, said in a statement.The cause of the infection has yet to be found and there have been Fusarium cases reported in users of another Bausch product, as well as a few cases associated with products made by other lens care companies.This week, Bausch announced a complete recall of ReNu With MoistureLoc. The company withdrew the product in the United States last month and in parts of Asia earlier this year after it was linked to an outbreak of the fungal infections.After ruling out a contamination problem at one of the company's plants, the Food and Drug Administration said the Fusarium outbreak appeared to be related to the design and use of ReNu With MoistureLoc.'"
"'06-05-20,'0','Until and unless it dies, theater will always be a place where, on a good night, a society can see itself, fears and obsessions made flesh, the future glimpsed in the dark. When the plays are by teenagers, probably all the more so.That is the case now at the Young Playwrights Festival XXIV, which opened on Wednesday at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater with a program of three one-acts. They were chosen from more than 1,000 entries in this national playwriting competition for writers 18 or younger founded by Stephen Sondheim in 1981 to encourage new works for the theater. Well-known dramatists whose early writings were selected include Rebecca Gilman and Kenneth Lonergan. This year the winners are young women who were 18 when their plays were submitted. All three have a lot to say, some of it funny, poignant, brutal and at times confusing — like life.Interestingly, for these times, two of the plays involve religion, in one case pitting science against the Bible. Incest, alcoholism and attempted suicide are also in the spotlight. The first two plays are naturalistic, while the third is more a collage of scenes and video projections. The performances — all by Equity members — and direction are as professional as in many Off Broadway productions, and two of the actors are quite wonderful.Those performances come in the evening's first and second plays, ""Los Angeles Lullaby"" by Kit Steinkellner and ""Suicide Club"" by Miriam Eichenbaum, both directed by Valentina Fratti.Ms. Steinkellner's story is simple on the surface but full of emotional undercurrents for her three characters: a lonely young woman, Sonia (played by Laura Breckenridge), who has had a baby out of wedlock; her estranged, alcoholic father, Abbott (Mike Hartman), whom she summons in desperation; and a teenage neighbor, Chaz (James Miles), who wants them to become a substitute family, since his own has disintegrated.'"

Alito Jr.: softball questions lobbed to the candidate by his fawning Republican allies; assurances to his cowed Democratic interlocutors that the general will provide detailed answers to their questions in a ""closed session""; and the result a foregone conclusion in which the president will get what he wants.This is the sham democracy we wish to impose, by force of arms, on the rest of the world?There are good reasons to maintain secret intelligence capabilities in a complex and dangerous world — especially one in which our nation is so widely hated. Those of us who have worked on or with the United States intelligence services know that satellite cartography, electronic surveillance, algorithms generated to track network communications and many other sophisticated systems may help protect us from harm.But we also know that our government is populated by liars and ideologues who cannot be trusted to use these resources legally and with prudence.

"'06-05-20,'0','FOR all the improvements in computer security, using the Internet is growing only more dangerous — both at home and at work.The annual Web@Work survey, conducted by Harris Interactive for the security firm Websense, found that the number of companies reporting spyware infestations had jumped 50 percent in the last year alone, and now nearly 92 percent of companies report that they have found spyware on their networks (websense.com).Spyware is a somewhat loose term, and can mean anything from often innocuous Web cookies to Trojan programs that can hijack a computer.But more dangerous varieties of spyware are on the rise, said Michael Newman, a vice president at Websense. He told John Gordon of ""Future Tense"" on American Public Media (futuretense.publicradio.org) that information technology managers were increasingly finding keylogging software on their systems. This ""particularly malicious"" type of spyware detects every keystroke made on a computer and can pick up passwords and other sensitive information, Mr. Newman said.Pornography sites are among the most dangerous, with many of them replete with pop-up ads and spyware. The good news is that the number of employees reported to have visited a porn site at work dropped to 12 percent from 17 percent the last year. Of those, 95 percent said their visits to porn sites were ""accidental."" Whoops!'"

"'06-05-21,'0','Many essential details have already been hammered out, a person familiar with the negotiations said. Jan-Michiel Hessels, the chairman of Euronext's supervisory board, would be chairman of the new company, and John A. Thain, chief executive of the NYSE Group, would be chief executive. Jean-François Théodore, the Euronext chief executive, would have a senior management role that was still to be determined.Finance has long been globalized, with money, deals and labor seeking opportunities around the globe. A combination of the NYSE Group and Euronext would catapult stock exchanges from national or continental entities to trans-Atlantic behemoths with diversified businesses and tremendous pricing power.If completed, the deal would alter the architecture of global stock trading, combining two major trading businesses and opening up new pools of investors to companies, which could be listed in two major market centers. It is also expected to speed the modernization of the Big Board and signal more aggressive growth for Euronext.A deal would combine the N.Y.S.E.'s floor-based stock exchange and Archipelago's electronic stock and options businesses with Euronext's all-electronic trading platform, which encompasses the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Portugal, as well as the London derivatives exchange.For years, Mr. Thain has expressed an interest in expanding the Big Board's business to include derivatives, building on its options business and taking a lead in the global consolidation of the trading of all types of financial products.A NYSE Group spokesman declined to comment on the plans.The scramble to find a partner comes amid a broader dance of global exchanges. In March, Nasdaq made an informal, $4.1 billion bid for the London Stock Exchange. After the offer was rebuffed, Nasdaq built up a 25.1 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange, paving the way to either own it or protect against someone else owning it. And in the last few years, the London Stock Exchange has been courted with little success by Deutsche Börse, Macquarie Bank and Euronext.A Euronext-NYSE deal could foreshadow an interesting potential outcome for the European stock markets, exporting the rivalry between the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq while transforming every exchange's businesses in significant ways.If Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange ultimately paired up, it would create a powerful European listings business as well as an all-electronic stock-trading business. The combined entity, however, would have no exposure to options or derivatives trading — two high-margin, fast-growing businesses — and Nasdaq's debt has already been downgraded to junk by the major credit rating agencies as the result of its purchase of a quarter-stake in the London exchange.A NYSE Group and Euronext matchup would create a formidable competitor, bolstered by the Big Board's global branding power and the backbone of many of Europe's exchanges. It would leave Deutsche Börse, operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange, without a partner but in control of its profitable clearing and settlement business.Both potential cross-border pairings could meet political resistance as nationalistic sentiments on both side of the Atlantic weigh the reality of creating, maintaining and regulating a global exchange. The deal will pose significant technological challenges, in particular because New York operates a floor-based trading system and Euronext does not.A NYSE-Euronext combination would represent another major upheaval for the NYSE Group. In the last year alone, Mr. Thain has overseen the purchase of Archipelago Holdings, an all-electronic exchange, which he used as a vehicle to transform the Big Board from a member-owned, nonprofit entity to a for-profit, publicly traded company.The acquisition gave the NYSE Group an electronic trading engine to trade stocks listed over the counter, as well as an option business housed in the Pacific Stock Exchange. At the same time, Mr. Thain has introduced a hybrid trading system intended to give customers more choices in how to trade stocks via specialists or electronically.It is unclear how the proposed merger would affect that hybrid system, if at all.NYSE Group's offer comes days after Deutsche Börse outlined why it believed it should be the exchange to do a deal with Euronext. Its plan was not well received, according to one person familiar with Euronext's plans, paving the way for the NYSE Group to make a move.The New York Stock Exchange will probably move to build on Euronext's listing platform. The listings business in the United States has suffered as companies have responded to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the intense regulatory scrutiny here by choosing other exchanges, like London and Shanghai. The combined entity could offer companies the ability to list in the United States on the Big Board, as well as Euronext. Regulators in each country would regulate its country's trading, a potential challenge as platforms are combined.In 2005, Euronext earned revenues of 961.9 million euros. Derivatives trading constituted 331.9 million euros of the total revenues, while cash trading provided 215.7 million euros. Sales of software were the third-largest category of revenue, with 195.2 million euros. It earned 241.1 million euros in 2005, or 2.18 euros a share.In 2005, the New York Stock Exchange had 2,672 companies worth $21.2 trillion. On average, it traded 1.6 billion shares a day, with two days in which more than 3 billion shares were traded. Euronext has 1,225 listed companies worth 2.6 trillion euros. In 2005, it traded 347 million derivatives contracts, up 11 percent from the year before.'"

""We are asking not to make early judgments, accusations or responses that might lead to tension in the Palestinian streets,"" Mr. Hamad said.Some Palestinians in Gaza suggested that the explosion could be revenge for the killing on March 31 of Abu Youssef al-Quqa, 44, the leader of the Popular Resistance Committees, a Gaza militant group consisting of disaffected fighters from other groups. Mr. Quqa was killed in a car bomb explosion outside a mosque that set off gun battles in which three others were killed and 36 wounded.Israel denied responsibility for the car bomb, and others in the Popular Resistance Committees blamed Fatah security forces with close ties to the Israelis and promised vengeance. Abu Abir, a spokesman for the committees, accused Palestinian security officials of collaborating with Israel and singled out several by name, calling them traitors and vowing, ""We will behead them."" Among those he accused were Mr. Rajab and Muhammad Dahlan, the former head of Preventive Security in Gaza.At the time, the Hamas interior minister, Said Sayam, said that the government would investigate, but no results have been announced.Mr. Rajab, who was close to the late Yasir Arafat, survived another attempt on his life in August 2004, when he was hurt in a drive-by shooting. He was hit in the chest and taken to an Israeli hospital in Ashdod.Mr. Rajab was appointed to his current post by Mr. Abbas in April 2005. Last week, Mr. Abbas sent him to Jordan to look into accusations by its government that Hamas was trying to smuggle explosives into Jordan and carry out attacks there, charges that Hamas has denied.After the bombing on Saturday, a group calling itself the Fatah Protection Unit demanded that Mr. Abbas dismiss the Hamas government and call new elections. As president, Mr. Abbas has the power to dismiss the prime minister, but not necessarily to call new elections. The group demanded that Hamas disband its new militia within three days and warned against the militia taking action against any member of Fatah.Armed Hamas and Fatah groups have clashed over the past week in Gaza. As Mr. Rajab and the wounded were driven to the Gaza hospital, agents fired from the windows to clear the streets, and some members of the new Hamas militia fired toward the convoy, apparently believing themselves under attack.The Israeli airstrike later on Saturday killed Muhammad Dahdouh, 32, a commander of Islamic Jihad who the Israeli Army said was responsible for launching rockets into Israel. The Israelis fired at least two missiles, which also killed two women and a child who were traveling in a car close to Mr. Dahdouh's pickup truck. The child was identified by Palestinians as Fadi Amman, 4, and his mother as Hanan Amman, 29. Five people were wounded.Yossi Beilin, the leader of the dovish Meretz party, called for the government to stop its policy of assassination strikes that kill innocent people as well. He said on Israeli radio that the killing of Mr. Dahdouh was insufficient justification for the killing of a small boy, his mother and grandmother.Mr. Abbas, at a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, is set to meet Sunday with the Israeli vice prime minister and foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, and with Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, will leave for Washington on Sunday to meet President Bush and speak to a joint meeting of Congress. He is expected to meet Mr. Abbas after the trip.'"

"'06-05-21,'0','There is sorrow at the loss of the 27-year-old center, which offered an array of programs under one roof. But displaced teachers have continued their classes at more specialized places like the Katonah Art Center or at the Harvey School, a private school in Katonah that is developing an after-school community arts program for its new 25,000-square-foot space.Ken Marsolais, a former executive director of the Mount Kisco center, is now the director of arts programming at the Harvey School. Students have also been taking classes privately in whatever available space their teachers from the closed center can find, including a boxing gym in Mount Kisco.Jennifer Eyges, a voice teacher who directed the music department at the Northern Westchester Center, now teaches 32 of those students independently at the Soundview School, a private school in the same building that the center occupied.Alan Reingold, who headed the visual arts program at the center, said 75 of his students in painting and drawing had followed him to the Lutheran Church of the Resurrection in Mount Kisco, where he teaches privately after school and in the evenings.The instruction is as good as ever, said Kristin Flaherty, a high school senior, but now she must take her own supplies to classes. ""You can't count on anything being there,"" she said, recalling the center's ample paper, pencils and drawing boards.Other continuing programs picking up the slack include the Insights and Revelations series of cultural events that Anna Becker, who produced them for the center, has moved to the Rosenthal J. C. C. in Pleasantville. Children who attended the center's summer camp, which was directed by Beth Vaculik, can still paint and sing under her direction this summer; she has taken on the camp as a private venture and will continue it in its usual location at St. Mary's School in Katonah.Some ballet students joined Mimi Wallace, the Northern Westchester Center's longtime dance director, and other dance teachers at Rudy's Boxing in Mount Kisco, where classes take place in a multipurpose gym. But, Ms. Wallace said, ""It's small, and the floor is not sprung,"" and classes dwindled over the winter.Next fall Ms. Wallace and the other teachers will hold their classes at the Harvey School, but even that space, though it is new, is not ideal. ""It's just one studio, and it has to be shared with the school,"" Ms. Wallace said. ""I don't know if we'll be able to have a full curriculum.""One student who has continued to study ballet with Nancy Zander, formerly of the Mount Kisco center, is Kendall Coniaris, of Katonah, who takes classes at Rudy's and at the Harvey School. Her mother, Tara Coniaris, said all the changes have been a little chaotic. The tuition issue also still rankles: The center closed after collecting tuition for the fall session, and Ms. Coniaris has not received a refund of her year's tuition of $1,200, she said."" Nancy and Mimi have been so sweet and wonderful,"" she said. ""They're just asking us to kick in for rent at Rudy's. But at the Harvey School, we are paying tuition again."" Ms. Zander said the cost of a group lesson ranged from $15 to $20, but that longer-range tuition at the Harvey School was still being decided.Ms. Wallace began teaching at the Northern Westchester Center when Bira Rabushka, its founder, ran it in a one-room former schoolhouse in Goldens Bridge. The subject of its demise is still ""very painful, very raw,"" she said.But Mr. Perez, of Pulse, was more upbeat. ""The spirit of what we had is still functioning,"" he said. ""The services to the community are still there. What's missing is just the convenience of having everything under one roof.""That is not such a small thing, Ms. Wallace and others said. While students have scattered to other schools and centers, some teachers feel a distinct creative community has lost its cohesion.""There was something exhilarating about it,"" said Maija Veide, who headed the art department at the Northern Westchester Center and now teaches drawing at the Katonah Art Center. ""I'd hear rhythmic music from the dance studio on my way to the art studio. We attended each other's concerts and recitals and art openings.

"'06-05-21,'0','In a separate phone interview Mr. Penn acknowledged, ""There's no question that there's an Oedipal drama played out."" He added that Grey's psychological deterioration took its toll on the filmmakers, who were divided as to whether she would ever be well enough to rejoin the good mutants in their country refuge.""There were a lot of extremely tense arguments of how far we could go with the Jean story,"" Mr. Penn said. ""Some people really didn't want us to have her come back to the mansion. It was as tense arguments as I've even been involved with on a movie.""THE EUGENICS DEBATE ""Mutant cure shots available here"" reads a sign on the outside of Mr. Ratner's editing room on the Fox lot. And as anyone who has followed Web chatter about the movie knows, the ability to cure mutants isn't necessarily a good thing. Or a bad thing.Instead it's a terrible social dilemma that entangles the X-Men and their adversaries in questions that would befuddle the shrewdest of medical ethicists. It might be wonderful if a ""cured"" Rogue, played by Anna Paquin, could finally touch her lover without destroying him. But maybe Wolverine without his claws is just another hairy guy.Is it better if mutant Goths — urged to ""be what you are"" — destroy the cure? Or should we hope their more wholesome mutant adversaries — though wary of dull normalcy — will save it? As in life, the questions outnumber the answers, if not the action beats.RACE AND TERROR Lurking deep in the tortured soul of this ""X-Men,"" as with its predecessors, are questions about the way society treats its racial minorities — those who are born looking different — now compounded by the geopolitics of a mounting war against mutant terror. It is probably no accident that Dr. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammer) is a shaggy blue mutant in the halls of the government, trying to mitigate the excesses of authority from within. (Think of an increasingly embattled Secretary of State Colin Powell holding the hawks at bay.)Responsible leaders can hardly be blamed for striking back at a deadly threat from the equally blue Mystique and her ilk, as they do in ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" But is the president truly fighting evil when the worst mutants are carted off for their cure? Or is he lashing out at an entire ethnicity?Mr. Penn said he doesn't see a hidden reference to immigrants, Arabs or any distinct ethnic group in his film. But he allowed that his thinking about the Department of Homeland Security may have influenced the script. And as to the ruminations about a besieged society's way of dealing with the Other, he said, after a moment's thought, ""You may have a point.""GAY ACCEPTANCE In the wake of Tony Kushner's ""Angels in America"" plays and mini-series, it is difficult not to see a metaphor for the plight of young gay men in a subplot that involves Warren Worthington III, a k a Angel. Young Worthington, played by Ben Foster, on discovering that his own mutant gift is a pair of large, feathery white wings, tries to hack them off. His shocked father, played by Michael Murphy, sets off on a quest for the cure, which his son and other mutants may not want. The filmmakers thus add another layer of psychological drama to a movie that is meanwhile pretty busy setting up battles between fire and ice, and testing the stability of the Golden Gate bridge.Even if the X-Men themselves are too busy saving the world to seek expensive therapy, more earth-bound crew members, Mr. Kinberg said, may have benefited in unexpected ways. ""This is stuff that everyone working on the movie pays people in Beverly Hills $185 an hour for,"" he noted. ""And I thought, 'Why don't we get rid of it through our day job?' ""'"
"'06-05-21,'0','This top-heavy pattern makes promoting literary fiction a challenge. ""You need 15 things to happen in the right order on time,"" said Bill Thomas, the editor in chief of Doubleday-Broadway, whose recent successes include ""The Curious Incident,"" as well as Jonathan Lethem's ""Fortress of Solitude"" and, yes, ""The Da Vinci Code."" Those things include drumming up enthusiasm inside the publishing house, spreading the word to booksellers and reviewers by sending out manuscripts months before publication, and securing a front-of-store display at Barnes & Noble and Borders and prominent placement on Amazon.com. To show booksellers you're serious, Thomas said, you have to ship a minimum of 20,000 copies to stores at the time of publication.But literary novels rarely sell that many copies in hardcover, and the need for a high print run sets up expectations that can be difficult to meet. Printing 20,000 copies off the bat also requires the commitment of the entire publishing apparatus. To get ""in-house support"" for a book, editors vie against one another to win over the marketing and art departments so the book gets advertising dollars and the best jacket possible. That means literary fiction editors are increasingly called upon to become businesspeople and lobbyists. ""The stereotype of the introverted book editor scribbling away in a dimly lit office may have once been true, but now if you're that way, your books fail,"" said Geoff Shandler, the editor in chief of Little, Brown, which publishes Rick Moody and David Foster Wallace.Today, ""it's a zero-sum game and the publisher knows they can only push so many titles per season,"" said Eric Simonoff, a literary agent at Janklow & Nesbit whose clients include Jhumpa Lahiri and Edward P. Jones. ""There's an enormous amount of internal triage that goes on. Rarely is a publisher surprised at the success of a work of fiction."" That doesn't mean their best efforts always bear fruit. ""A lot of preplanned successes turn out to be flops,"" Galassi said. Benjamin Kunkel's ""Indecision"" sold 19,000 copies from its release last August through the end of April, according to Bookscan — a respectable figure for a first literary novel, but disappointing for such a heavily promoted title (though it was much discussed in literary circles, which to some is the true measure of success).After the internal lobbying, publishers turn to winning over the single most powerful person in American literary publishing. No, not Oprah, but a woman you've probably never heard of: Sessalee Hensley, the one literary fiction buyer for Barnes & Noble. (Other buyers handle romance, mystery and additional genres.) Publishers are reluctant to talk about Hensley on the record, for fear of jeopardizing their rapport with the gatekeeper to a company with 799 stores and 17 percent of the United States book market. But most say they respect her judgment, even if they sometimes complain she has middlebrow taste. Hensley can decide whether to place a book on an attention-grabbing front table and often advises publishers to change a book jacket. (The company wouldn't make her available for an interview.)It's a delicate dance: buyers use a writer's past sales to determine how many copies of a new novel to order; publishers try to convince buyers that a book has potential even if they can't justify spending the money to promote it the way they would a commercial title. Publishers frequently argue for the bottom quarter of their list — the books that get the least marketing support and often sell the fewest copies. That's ""where the major writers of the future usually start,"" Galassi said. ""It's where much of the best writing is, the work of the odd, uncooperative, intractable, pigheaded authors who insist on seeing and saying things their own way and change the game in the process. The 'system' can only recognize what it's already cycled through. What's truly new is usually indigestible at first.""With so many factors in play, it's hard to know what makes a book take off. ""When I started, I used to think it was 80 percent hard work on the part of your author and 20 percent luck,"" said the literary agent Nicole Aragi, whose authors include Jonathan Safran Foer and Monica Ali, young writers who have broken out of the pack. ""Now, I think it's 50 percent hard work and 50 percent luck."" To promote novels, publishers often seek ""nonfiction hooks"" to draw readers in. ""The Plot Against America,"" by Philip Roth, a major literary event when it appeared in 2004, has sold extremely well — 412,000 copies so far in hardcover and paperback, according to Bookscan — in part because it was seen as an oblique commentary on the Bush administration. (The normally reclusive Roth also made his first American television appearances since 1968, on the ""Today"" show and PBS's ""Newshour."") It's not enough to say a book is ""beautifully written and ambitious and wonderful,"" said Janet Silver, the vice president and publisher of Houghton Mifflin, which publishes Roth. You have to find ""different ways of talking about a book that go beyond its intrinsic merit.""Publishers will often use a writer's background to promote a book. But taken to the extreme, this places more value on the writer's pedigree than on the quality and originality of the prose. Consider the case of ""How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life,"" a first novel whose intense marketing strategy emphasized that the author, Kaavya Viswanathan, was a photogenic 19-year-old Indian-American Harvard sophomore. It was pulled from stores last month by its publisher, Little, Brown, after Viswanathan was accused of recycling from multiple sources. It soon emerged that the book had been delivered to Little, Brown by a packager who encouraged Viswanathan to aim for broad commercial appeal. But these days, even established editors have been known to advise literary novelists to tailor their plots and characters to the presumed appetites of the public.It can become a vicious circle: publishers lament that literary fiction has trouble finding a foothold — then flood the market with overhyped and often derivative work in the hope of meeting some vague idea of reader expectations. In the end, what will rescue literary fiction from the crushing commercial demands of publishing today is exactly what has always sustained it: the individual writer's voice. There is, after all, a difference between a reader and a market.'"
"'06-05-21,'0','Hannah is a social paralytic, a state only worsened by her own relentless self-awareness. Months into her freshman year at college, she gets ready for her first night out. She hasn't got any makeup for dolling herself up, but she does clip her nails — ""that's not festive, but it's something."" This is something Tom Wolfe's Charlotte Simmons might have said, had she been written with any verisimilitude.Out with her new sort-of-friends, Hannah is terrified at the prospect of hooking up: ""Her inexperience at the age of 18 makes her feel by turns freakish and amazing, as if she should be placed under glass and observed by scientists. Also, in times of danger — turbulent plane flights home, say — it makes her feel immune. She thinks that it must be impossible, against the laws of nature, to make it through high school and then die before kissing another person.""I knew a guy in high school who made life so difficult for himself that everyone called him ""Hard Way."" Hard Way made his own bad times, and so does Hannah. Sittenfeld gets this down especially well in a funny, painful chapter describing a kayaking trip Hannah takes in Alaska with her sister, her sister's fiancé, and his brother. The other three are quite literally happy campers, but Hannah feels excluded, angry at her sister for getting married and above all worried about bears. Even the grandeur of the Alaskan scenery isn't enough to soothe her: ""This is the world: the clearness of the air, the wind stirring the tall grasses, the way the late-afternoon sunlight glints off the tiny waves hitting the rocks. And yet she feels silly; thoughts about how small you are always feel small themselves. Besides, amazement does not preclude anxiety.""Hannah can't stop judging her fellow travelers, or feeling judged by them. Sometimes the judgments are fond: ""Allison is a social worker, and Sam is a sixth-grade teacher. They make thoughtful dinners that involve cilantro."" But sometimes the judgments are furious and raw, as when she wonders of her sister: ""At what point is her optimistic denial the same as shallowness?"" There's no redemption in this trip. Hannah simply flies back to Tufts, where she is ""safe and alone again.""Sittenfeld's two books can be said to be about anger. Both protagonists appear to the people around them to be passive saps; both are seething. But while ""Prep"" was a volatile, hilarious, rage-fueled overhead smash, in ""The Man of My Dreams,"" Sittenfeld stands on the sidelines. She's trying to figure out what makes anger happen.All this is heightened by the treacherous Alaskan landscape. This is one of the few sections of the novel that are graced by a sense of place. If ""The Man of My Dreams"" does away with the context of ""Prep,"" it also pretty much does away with context altogether. The milieu feels, in fact, a lot like a Peanuts strip: generic houses, trees, armchairs, all as a backdrop to the main character's tragicomic angst.Not everything here works. The therapist is a Yoda, a kind of trumped-up wisdom-delivery system. There are characters who never quite coalesce into believability, like Hannah's earthy aunt, or for that matter her angry father, too central a figure to be left so one-dimensional. And the thing ends with a hokey confessional letter from Hannah to her therapist. But Sittenfeld proves herself once again to be a rigorous and wily stylist. She writes clear, funny, unadorned prose, and packs her pages with clever observations without appearing to be trying. This kind of intelligent self-effacement is harder and harder to come by in new fiction. And it's a style perfectly suited to her heroine.There are authors who write solid books for years until, finally, with luck, they break out ahead of the pack. ""The Man of My Dreams"" shows us a writer who is in it for the long haul; she just happened to write her breakout anomaly on the first go-round. The legions of readers who loved ""Prep"" will most likely not flock to this quiet novel. But Sittenfeld's determined exploration of her character's interior life feels like bravery.""Prep"" rode to its wild success on the impression that Sittenfeld, a prep school teacher, was spilling some beans. By stepping outside that dynamic, Sittenfeld has surrendered an easy advantage. I admire that sacrifice. ""The Man of My Dreams"" reads like the next necessary step in a serious career.'"
"'06-05-21,'0','He would not say what the contingency was nor would he reveal the lower price. The documents indicate that $54,460 in state taxes were paid at the closing, the correct amount for a $3.89 million sales price. Professor Geanakoplos said that if the price is adjusted, he expects part of the taxes to be refunded.Sam Miller, a spokesman for the city's Finance Department, said that buyers and sellers were required to supply accurate information when reporting sales to the city. ""Whatever's on the deed is the official price,"" Mr. Miller said.The house was owned by Robert F. Van Lierop, a lawyer who has represented Spike Lee, the movie director, and has served as the representative to the United Nations for Vanuatu, an island nation in the South Pacific. Mr. Van Lierop has also gained recognition as a filmmaker, having made two documentaries in the 1970's about Mozambique's fight for independence from Portugal.City records show that Mr. Van Lierop bought the Convent Avenue house for $292,500 in 1993. He refused to discuss the sale to Professor Geanakoplos.Two of the brokers involved in the deal, Brian Phillips of Sotheby's International Real Estate, and Shelley Rankin of the Warburg Realty Partnership, said they were bound by confidentiality agreements that barred them from talking about the transaction.The previous record price for a town house sale north of 110th Street was $2.6 million for a house on 138th Street that sold last May, according to Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Halstead Property.Listing information for the Convent Avenue house, which is nearly 20 feet wide, said it had eight bedrooms and five bathrooms. A broker who had toured the house said that much of the original detail was intact but that most buyers would want to update the kitchen and bathrooms.Professor Geanakoplos refused to say what his plans were for the house.TOMMY HILFIGER, the fashion designer, has agreed to pay about $18 million for a five-bedroom house with 4,700 square feet and a swimming pool on Further Lane in East Hampton.""I took one look and said I'll take it,"" said Mr. Hilfiger, recalling his first visit. ""It's like a resort-type home right on the water; a lot of glass, very modern, very clean, great appliances, great attention to detail. I thought it would be fantastic. It's an ideal location, sitting right on the water, with a pool and Jacuzzi.""Mr. Hilfiger said that he expected to close on the house on Monday and that after some redecorating, it should be ready to use this summer. He is creating his own furniture, for both indoors and out, with Jason Lamberth, a furniture designer. ""We went to Bali together and designed a whole line of furniture for the house,"" Mr. Hilfiger said.For the last 15 years, Mr. Hilfiger has spent his summers on Nantucket, where he owns a home. (He also has a house in Greenwich, Conn.; a Manhattan apartment; a Vermont ski house; and an island getaway on Mustique in the Caribbean.) But he has been wishing for a summer house closer to New York.He said his broker, Deirdre Jowers of Allan Schneider Associates, ""has probably shown me all the waterfront in the last few years, and they were either too big, too small, in need of too much work or not my style.""He came close to buying houses a few times: one deal fell through, he lost another in a bidding war, and one other time he walked away when the seller raised his asking price after Mr. Hilfiger made an offer.The current owners of the house are Robert Marc and William Roach. Mr. Marc's name is on a chain of fashionable optical shops in Manhattan and Boston. Elaine Stimmel, a broker for the Corcoran Group in East Hampton, who was not involved in the sale, said the house was desirable, in part, because the pool is on the ocean side, which is often not permitted in newer houses.In April, Mr. Marc and Mr. Roach sold a four-story town house they owned in Manhattan, at 66 Charles Street, for $4.4 million. Robby Browne of the Corcoran Group was the listing broker.AS the real estate market becomes less frenzied, the competition among Manhattan's top brokerage firms for exclusive sales agreements on new condo developments is becoming more intense. And as the number of new condos entering the market increases, some developers may be showing signs of anxiety when sales are slower than anticipated.Prudential Douglas Elliman this month took over sales at the TriBeCa Summit, a new condo at 415 Greenwich Street, which had previously been handled by the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.The defection comes after the developer of the Cipriani Club Residence at 55 Wall Street paid $500,000 in February to break an exclusive sales agreement with Corcoran Sunshine to shift its business to Elliman. Pam Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, said that the agreement with TriBeCa Summit's developer had expired and that Corcoran was not interested in remaining on the job.The Sunshine Group, which merged with Corcoran last year, has been a leader in marketing new developments, a field in which Elliman is eager to increase its presence.""For certain firms looking to build a large book of new development business, they can be less choosy about the projects they take on,"" Ms. Liebman said, referring to her competition.Howard Lorber, the chairman of Douglas Elliman, disagreed. ""They're in a defensive mode, trying to hold on to what they have,"" he said.But Elliman is also feeling pressure. Kathleen M. Sloane, a senior vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, took over sales this month at 823 Park Avenue, a condo conversion that had been an Elliman exclusive. It has about a dozen units, including a $35 million penthouse. Ms. Sloane said only two units had been sold before the developers changed brokers. ""There's a lot of shifting going on,"" she said.ANDRÉ BALAZS, the hotelier and developer, has another apartment to sell in SoHo.Mr. Balazs, who is building luxury condos designed by Jean Nouvel at 40 Mercer Street, has decided to put the loft apartment he lives in on the market. He will be asking $10 million for the apartment above the New Museum at 158 Mercer, three blocks north of the new condos.Mr. Balazs paid $5.75 million for the apartment in 2003 and then worked with the architects Enrico Bonetti and Dominic Kozerski to design the interior.Mr. Balazs said he was unsure where he would move next, although he may eventually take an apartment at 40 Mercer. The Mercer Hotel, which Mr. Balazs also owns, is across the street from the New Museum apartment, so he has no shortage of places to stay in the neighborhood.Mr. Balazs's apartment has five bedrooms and about 4,500 square feet. It will be listed with Robby Browne and Wilbur Gonzalez of the Corcoran Group.'"
"'06-05-21,'0','I had fantasies of moving into a city apartment after graduation with some blurry-faced guy, my partner. We'd cook dinner together, read the paper in bed. Later, we would shield our children from sex-stereotyped toys and take turns driving to rid them of the notion that Dad is always the captain. There would be true equality in our home, and there would also be candlelight and Ella Fitzgerald records and adorable baby shoes in the hall closet.BUT when I graduated and moved to Manhattan three years ago, none of the men I met were up for my proposed life of egalitarian bliss. In fact, most of the young people around me—male and female—seemed to think of feminism as a quaint and unnecessary practice from days of old, not unlike churning butter. I remembered then what one wise women's studies professor at Smith had said about feminism: ""None of this means anything unless we can get men on board. That's not achieved by marches or movements, but by one individual changing another individual for the better.""I wanted to get men on board — or one man, at the very least — but I seemed unable to find an audience for a simple discussion beginning with the words ""I am a feminist and here's why.""Friends wondered why I couldn't leave my politics at the door and just go on a date for goodness sake. My uncles joked that perhaps I'd be happy if I could find a nice Irish girl to settle down with.All of my relationships, or lack thereof, began to take the same shape. I would meet a man, and our first date would consist of that lovely unraveling of mundane details. Then would come the second date. With our vital stats out of the way, we'd begin to discuss other, seemingly benign, topics. But somehow, every road led to sexism. A comparison of our favorite movies turned into me complaining about Quentin Tarantino's senseless misogyny. Perusal of the dessert menu somehow ignited a screaming match about women's socially imposed body-image issues.Often there was no warning. One minute we would be talking baseball, and the next we'd be embroiled in a standoff about pornography, which would end with me refusing to return his calls and express mailing him a copy of Catharine MacKinnon's ""Only Words"" without a note.Soon I began to recognize a familiar look on the faces of the men I went out with, the physical incarnation of Check, please. I knew that I could be too harsh, too quick to judge and probably guilty of the very sexism I railed against. But I couldn't back down.I couldn't because the stakes are too high, and the large-scale issues of sexual inequality remain: Women still don't make equal money for equal work; we are still the victims of rape and domestic violence; we are, for the most part, still solely responsible for child-rearing and cooking and cleaning, no matter what our career choices.But the smaller, more personal issues are perhaps even more divisive, more threatening, at least when it comes to romantic relationships.In a country where you can't show a penis on television, the popular rap star Snoop Dogg can sing a song on the radio called ""Can U Control Yo Hoe,"" in which he says a man has to do what it takes to put his woman ""in her place"" even if it means ""slapping her in the face.""Outside my office building in Times Square stands a billboard for the new HBO series ""Big Love"" — three women of varying ages stare blank-eyed and weary at one exhausted, oversexed man. Beneath them are the words ""Polygamy Loves Company.""A block away, there's a long row of sex shops and strip clubs. When I run out to grab a sandwich at lunchtime, men are waltzing into these places without so much as a hint of embarrassment.Who are they? I often wonder. What are their lives like?It seems impossible that they all live in caves or in their mothers' basements. Most must have jobs, homes, wives, girlfriends. They are not considered abnormal, any more than the guy who purchases a Snoop CD, or tunes in to see how Bill Paxton deals with those three demanding wives, poor lamb. If this is the culture in which we live and love, how must men, in their heart of hearts, view women?When I think of men this way, as I often do, I want to go back to Smith and stay there among the shaved-headed sisterhood until I die.On the other hand, no matter how enraged I become, I still adore men and the possibility for romance they bring. I love the smell of a man's skin. I enjoy the breathless feeling of waiting to see if he'll call back. I like dressing up for dates and dissecting a dinner conversation with a new guy to determine if he might be The One. I admire the linear and decisive way a certain kind of man thinks, to my curlicue boundless overthinking. And nothing beats the feeling of a man's arms wrapped around me. Nothing.I'll never fully reconcile those ideas, I know. But sometimes love surprises us with its timing and its lessons. Ten months ago, I finally met someone who, so far, has stuck. And to my Catholic family's great relief, that someone's name is not Irene.His name is Colin, and I liked him immediately. And so I vowed, this time, not to sabotage things by mentioning sexism right away. But on our very first date, he asked about my thoughts on the feminist movement (apparently, he had been prepped by our mutual friends). When he pressed the issue, I finally blurted out: ""I can't talk about feminism until you know me better, O.K.?""And he wasn't. He gets it, yet he's bold enough to stand up to me when he thinks I've gone too far. Confronted by my beliefs, Colin offers neither the typical blow-off of other men nor the mea culpa that I thought I was looking for. Instead, he listens and discusses sexism with me at length, agreeing most of the time, but not always. And when he disagrees, he says so, challenging me to think about my long-held beliefs in new ways, and occasionally even changing my mind.In Colin's view, a man who goes to a strip club for his bachelor party is not necessarily a misogynist. And my argument that the women's movement has hardly made a dent ignores decades of true progress, according to him. But he has come over to my side in debates about pornography, prostitution, movie violence and domestic roles.Not that there aren't moments when it seems like we're still looking at each other across a great gender divide. One discussion about sexual violence in horror films ended with his screaming, ""Do you ever just lighten up?""AND last night he mentioned that a friend of his, a screenwriter, was optioning a book that Colin described as ""a man's guide to stringing chicks along without ever having to marry them.""""And yet you think he's a good guy?""""I don't know how someone can be good, but not do good,"" I shot back. I said this, but at the same time I thought about the friend in question, a man more devoted to his wife than anyone I've ever met.Colin and I went a few more rounds before he finally said, ""I admire your passion,"" and I conceded that his friend was indeed a pretty good guy. Then we took a walk, got a couple of beers and laughed about it all.Both love and life are rich in contradiction, and who am I to fight it? After all, I was the teenage girl with a framed photo of Gloria Steinem hanging on her bedroom wall, right beside a larger photo of a young Frank Sinatra.And now I have fallen for a man who understands and respects my feminist beliefs, and who also takes me to dinner, holds the door, calls me Babydoll in a slow Southern drawl.Embracing those contradictions has led me to discover a world between the harsh reality of sexism and the airy wishes of my love-drenched fantasies.It's true what my Smith professor said about progress depending upon one individual changing another for the better. What she didn't say was that, inevitably, the change goes both ways.'"
"'06-05-21,'0','IN many years of reviewing Connecticut restaurants, I have found a reassuring number worthy of an Excellent rating (more in recent years than ever before). An Extraordinary is rare, but Thomas Henkelmann at Homestead Inn in Greenwich is so clearly deserving of this designation.To me this rating means a restaurant must be memorable in every category: impeccable service; congenial comfortable surroundings that welcome guests; a wine list of depth, breadth and complexity, and above all else, creative food prepared and presented flawlessly. Extraordinary also means day-by-day consistency and no shortcuts, with virtually everything, from soup to dessert, prepared in house.At Thomas Henkelmann even the superb rolls and intensely flavored fruit sorbets and ice creams are made on site. The large wine list is a gem, with two-thirds French vintages, plus select California and other choices ($35 and up).The restaurant, in a charming steamboat Gothic house, consists of three dining rooms. The main one, with posts and exposed beam ceilings, has a fireplace, soft lighting and cozy dining groupings. The second room is small, almost private. My favorite in warm weather is the airy porch, which provides an extra treat: a view of beautiful flower gardens. Among many personal touches, each table has a different large, colorful Murano-glass candleholder, and every handmade service plate is different.The inn's French-accented restaurant has always been Excellent, but since Thomas and Theresa Henkelmann bought the property in 1997, they have ratcheted it up a notch. Mr. Henkelmann, formerly executive chef at La Panetière in Rye, was born in Germany, near the border of Alsace, and received his early training at the Michelin three-star inn, Auberge de l'Ill, in Illhaeusern, France. Some dishes on the spring menu reflect the Alsatian proclivity for game and substantial fare imaginatively prepared.'"
"'06-05-21,'0','The view is humbling: you stand just above the treetops of Central Park, with Central Park West and South beyond, so you can imagine how much those with similar views must have paid for them. The non-petty can ponder Cai Guo-Qiang's installations, including a noontime poof of black smoke and two cast-resin crocodiles pierced with sharp instruments seized by airport security.The view from the rooftop deck of this Brazilian-Peruvian-Japanese restaurant in the West Village is pedestrian enough that it could be in just about any city, but the place is abuzz with a good-looking multiethnic crowd. The drinks menu is creative but serious and (relatively) inexpensive, with a regular caipirinha for $9 and a ginger caipirinha with real kick for $10.If the New York rooftop convention is plastic cups, palm fronds, white picket fencing and the Heineken-Corona-Amstel troika of over-marketed beers, Bookmarks, at the Library Hotel, is raging against the machine. Glasses made of glass! Decidedly deciduous plants! Pilsner Urquell and Dos Equis Amber for $7!This midtown place is also among the most tasteful of rooftops, with wicker furniture, a brick and stone railing and a high-ceilinged greenhouse for chilly nights. It may be crowded after work on Fridays, but it is much more manageable on a Saturday evening. The view is a pleasant cityscape, good for spying on the bottled-water preferences of nearby offices.When this bar at the Gansevoort Hotel opened in 2004, it was all the rage, the mere idea of being 15 stories above the meatpacking district setting trendsetters' hearts aflutter. Plunge is now more of a standard, as evidenced by the wholesale shift in buzz to downstairs at the G-Spa. But stock the G with models and it would still not hold a candle to Plunge's Hudson River views as the sun sets.Except for 1010 WINS traffic reporters, who might appreciate the perfect angle for spotting jams on the Williamsburg Bridge coming into Manhattan, the roof deck at this rock 'n' roll club, also known for its live shows in the basement, is not a stunner. (And the view disappears completely when the retractable roof is closed.) But the beers cost only $5 or $6 — with occasional $3 Millers— and the crowd is mostly made up of laid-back Lower East Siders.Buried deep in the West 20's club land, BED New York has two faces: late at night, a velvet-rope wait to enter a thumping rooftop club; earlier, a restaurant serving seared foie gras, rack of lamb and tiramisù in the shape of a bed. It's not just the tiramisù, of course: the tables are themselves beds.Reservations are recommended for dinner and brunch on Sundays — which is not for early risers: it is served 2 to 8 p.m., which means you could dance there until 4 a.m., sleep eight hours (elsewhere — no overnight guests allowed) and still be twiddling your thumbs waiting for your reservation.A60 at the 60 Thompson Hotel, 60 Thompson Street between Spring and Broome Streets; 212-431-0400; www.thompsonhotels.com.

"'06-05-21,'0','The Byram riverfront is also poised for a transformation, as town planners and the neighborhood association complete a master plan for improvements that include a boardwalk and parks along the length of the river. A 20-unit town house community and marina has been approved for construction on two riverfront acres previously reserved for industrial uses on South Water Street. Called Greenwich Landing, the high-end development replaces a heating oil company.""This is pretty much setting the tone for up and down the Byram River,"" said John Wahba, a Byram native who is developing the project with his brother James.Interstate 95 bisects Byram, effectively creating two very different areas, one containing some of the town's most expensive homes, and the other some of its most affordable.Above the highway and away from the shoreline, the hilly terrain is covered with modest single- and multifamily homes set on small lots. The narrow, winding streets and closely set houses give this end of Byram a distinctive village feel, and residents regularly walk to the Byram Shubert Library, which serves as the community hub, and the small shopping district along Mill and Water Streets.Below the highway, Byram Shore Road follows the shoreline. This avenue dates to the era of the great industrialists, and their grand ""summer cottages,"" some hidden behind gates, are still interspersed among newer palatial properties.""I find that people new to Greenwich, and those with new money, have trouble saying they live on Byram Shore Road; they say they live in Greenwich,"" said Kaye Lewis of Kaye Lewis & Associates, a real estate brokerage firm. ""But there was an $18 million sale on that road last year. I mean, this is not for the faint of heart.""In the village area, residents tend to be fiercely loyal to their Byram roots, and old-timers abound. The large number of rental properties have attracted Hispanic immigrants, some of whom are buying multifamily homes to live in, and renting the other units themselves.Young couples discouraged by the out-of-reach prices elsewhere in Greenwich are also giving Byram a second look. ""This is the only area of town that we could afford,"" said Amy Repik, who bought a three-bedroom home in Byram with her husband, Josh, in December. The couple had previously rented in Greenwich, and spent two years shopping for houses as far up the shoreline as Norwalk. But Mr. Repik, a municipal employee and Greenwich native, was reluctant to leave his hometown.They bought their 1929 colonial for ""close to $600,000,"" said Mrs. Repik, who commutes to work at Gartner Inc., a market research company in Stamford. The tradeoff was a small yard, she noted, but not so small that they can't have a few friends over for a cookout. The planned revitalization of the riverfront also figured into their purchase. The town has allocated about $1.5 million for design and development of the parks and boardwalk. A second phase calls for the addition of trees, landscaping and benches in the commercial district.""This side of town has been neglected until now, and this is going to bring the value up,"" Mrs. Repik said.While the average price of a single-family home in other areas of Greenwich has shot up more than 30 percent in the last two years, ""Byram is still under $1 million for a single-family home,"" said Roberta Jurik, an agent with Prudential Connecticut Realty.Primarily colonials and Capes built in the early 1900's, these small homes start at around $600,000; multifamily homes start at around $800,000. Many have been improved upon over the years.""You won't see many houses being torn down because they're over the current allowable floor-area ratio for the lot size, and you couldn't replace them with as big a house,"" said Paul J. Pugliese, president of the Greenwich Land Company, a real estate company, and chairman of the town's architectural review committee. The new condos will broaden the housing opportunities in Byram and add a little luxury, he said.The town homes at Greenwich Landing will feature custom kitchen cabinetry and granite countertops, master bedroom suites, three-car garages and 20 boat slips. Priced at about $2 million, each unit will have three bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths. The setup is convenient for boaters, said Kathryn Clauss, an agent at Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage. ""It's a five-minute boat ride from there to the Sound, but you're in a safe harbor while your boat is docked in the river,"" she said.Sales have just begun on the converted condominiums at Greenwich Place, formerly an apartment complex known as Putnam Green. Antares is renovating the exteriors of the buildings and upgrading the interiors with new kitchens, bathrooms, flooring and doors. Prices start at $600,000 for a studio and range as high as $2 million for a three-bedroom. Greenwich Fine Properties is handling the sales.At Greenwich Shore, an apartment complex completed in 2004, all 55 units are rented, and turnover so far has been minimal, Ms. Lewis said. Situated on a ridge high enough to allow some units glimpses of the Long Island Sound, the apartments start at $1,975 a month for a one-bedroom. The largest unit, at roughly 2,400 square feet, rents for $5,100.What to DoGreenwich is known for its many parks and beaches, and one of its gems is the 30-acre Byram Shore Park. Located on the Long Island Sound, the park's many shady areas entice picnickers, while the beach boasts the only public swimming pool in town. Public boating facilities have slips for 300 small boats and 90 moorings for larger crafts.The busy Byram Shubert Library offers special programs, from preschool story hours to Spanish-language forums on first-time home buying. The library is about to undergo a $3.8 million expansion that will double its size, providing space for more computers, a community room and separate areas for the children and teenagers who flock to the library after school.Byram's commercial district, once pocked with vacancies, has begun to attract some architects, boutiques and salons. There are also banks, delis, a pet shop, an upholsterer, and a popular restaurant called That Little Italian.Shopping opportunities have expanded considerably since the opening of a big-box retail complex with a movie theater just across the bridge in Port Chester. Dining options on the riverfront include Sam's Bar & Grille, which attracts young crowds in the evening, and the Black Bear Grille.The Greenwich school system, which rates among the state's highest-performing districts, is a major draw for families. Byram's New Lebanon School is the smallest of the town's 11 elementary schools, with about 240 students in kindergarten to Grade 5. About 40 percent of the student population is Hispanic. The average class size is 18 students.Nearly 600 students in Grades 6 to 8 attend Western Middle School, also in Byram. About 70 percent of the school's students in eighth grade met the state goal on the Connecticut Mastery Test in reading and mathematics in the 2004-05 school year, compared with about 80 percent for the district as a whole.Greenwich High School is one of the largest in Connecticut, but manages its size by dividing the roughly 2,780 students into four houses. The school has extensive programs in music, athletics and the visual arts. Average SAT scores for the class of 2005 were 563 for verbal, and 586 for mathematics. Statewide averages were 508 for verbal and 520 for math. Eighty-eight percent of graduates went on to higher education.Byram is the section of Greenwich closest to Manhattan. The 30-mile commute by car can take as little as 45 minutes on I-95, or twice that, depending on the time of day.The Port Chester train station is closest. Metro-North Railroad trains to Midtown take about 40 minutes. The one-way peak fare is $14; a monthly pass is $197.Known by several names since Colonial times, Byram acquired its present name only in 1947. Just before that, the area was known as East Port Chester, which makes sense given the community's economic reliance on the foundries and other industries that rose on both sides of the river during the 19th century. One of the well-known industries was a granite quarry, which eventually became what is now Byram Shore Park.What We LikeThis is a truly walkable community with the feel of an old New England fishing village.Redevelopment on the Port Chester riverfront is aggravating cut-through traffic, which empties into Byram residential areas off the I-95 exit ramp. ""The trucks rumbling down Mill Street are the biggest issue,"" Mr. Pugliese said.'"

"'06-05-22,'0','WASHINGTON, May 22 — A federal investigation concluded today that rapidly rising gasoline prices over the last year have not been the result of unlawful price manipulation by the industry.In a report that Congress ordered last summer after price spikes following the hurricanes that struck the Gulf Coast, the Federal Trade Commission said that the sharp jump at the pump was attributable to market forces — namely big drops in supply and production as well as runs on inventories after major damage to refineries, ports and pipelines. The commission found no evidence of price collusion, or improper reductions of inventory or supplies to increase company profits.""The evidence collected in this investigation indicated that firms behaved competitively,"" the commission said.Unable to find an industry villain in the sharp increase in prices, the report is certain to add political pressure on Congress to take steps to lower prices or reduce the record earnings of some oil companies. While the agency had been expected to reach the conclusions that it formally announced today, senior commission officials said they expected the agency would come under criticism when the five commissioners appear before the Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday.The commission said it found 15 examples of pricing by refineries, wholesalers or retailers that technically fit the definition of ""price gouging."" But it said that in virtually all of those instances, there probably was not unlawful gouging because of regional or local trends that justified the higher prices.'"
"'06-05-22,'0','""It's the first true cross-Atlantic, international alliance or merger of securities exchanges,"" said Michael Pagano, an associate professor of finance at the College of Commerce and Finance at Villanova University. ""It has the opportunity to provide institutional and retail investors the ability to trade in a global framework, to trade U.S. stocks, European stocks, in one seamless environment.""A combination of the NYSE and Euronext would create the world's largest stock market, with a combined $26.9 trillion in market value for its listed companies, more than the next four largest markets combined. The merged entity would have 22 hours of trading on seven exchanges in six countries, handling $2.1 trillion in stock trades a month, twice as many as Nasdaq.In addition to stock trading in the United States and Europe, the New York exchange would add an arm to trade derivatives in Europe — the Liffe market in London — to complement the options-trading business that the New York exchange obtained as part of its recent acquisition of Archipelago, an all-electronic market. Trading derivatives — complex contracts whose value depends on an underlying security — has been a booming business and is more profitable to exchanges than the trading of plain-vanilla stocks.Exchanges make money three ways: from the fees they charge companies to list their stocks, from the fees they charge for trading and from the data they produce from all the trading, which can be packaged and sold to businesses like newspapers and brokerage firms.The deal outlined today faces many obstacles. Euronext management has said it welcomes the offer, but the company's shareholders will vote Tuesday on an alternative proposal from Deutsche Börse, the operator of the Frankfurt exchange. Many Deutsche Börse shareholders have expressed strong interest in pairing up with Euronext to create a ""European champion."" The proposal is non-binding, but Euronext's management would be challenged by a vote in favor of the German exchange.Any deal with New York or Frankfurt would have to be approved by regulators.A deal between Euronext and the NYSE would have little impact on brokerage firms that already trade billions of dollars around the world daily.""Technology already exists to access global exchanges,"" said Jamie Selway, president of White Cap Trading, an institutional brokerage firm.It likely will not affect investors who buy stock in their national markets through brokers or electronic trading firms. But it could help small and mid-size companies attract new global investors as foreign stocks become available in local currencies, facilitating more trading of them. Small and mid-size listed companies would benefit from that added trading.""When more institutions can trade more shares more quickly and efficiently, the bottom line is these institutional investors can generate greater net returns for their investors, the retail investors,"" Mr. Pagano of Villanova said.There is fear, however, that the deal will allow companies to shop for the least strict regulatory environment to list a stock. One major attraction for American exchanges that are shopping for European counterparts is the ability to attract companies that choose not to list in the United States because of the greater regulatory scrutiny and cost that has come as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires companies to certify the quality of their internal financial controls.""The only benefit I can see from the NYSE perspective is the benefit from regulatory arbitrage, all the listings moving to Europe from New York,"" said Seth Merrin, founder of LiquidNet, a competitor to the New York Stock Exchange that electronically and anonymously trades big blocks of stock.Exchanges around the world were once sleepy, not-for-profit utilities that garnered little interest beyond their own hectic floors, where traders ran around in search of buyers and sellers. In the last few years, those exchanges have transformed themselves into mostly electronic, for-profit, mini-monopolies. As their shares have soared, a race to use those rich prices to do deals has ensued.""Historically, exchanges were always a source of national pride,"" and deals between two countries were off limits, said Tom Kirchmaier, a corporate governance specialist at the London School of Economics. Euronext was one of the first successful cross-country combinations of exchanges.The NYSE Group is still in the throes of its own reinvention. It used its merger with Archipelago to change from a not-for-profit entity to a publicly traded company and is in the process of rolling out a new hybrid system that incorporates elements of electronic trading with traditional floor trading.The board started looking at the other exchanges ""the day after the Archipelago deal closed,"" said a person close to the negotiations. Discussions were put on hold while the NYSE Group completed a follow-on stock offering, and in recent weeks negotiations heated up.Negotiations to get to a deal had to be kept secret. When Jean François Théodore, Euronext's chief executive, met Mr. Thain for dinner in New York, they picked the skybox at Daniel, one of Manhattan's top restaurants. Overlooking the restaurant's chefs, the two discussed the possibility of creating the first trans-Atlantic global exchange. In Paris they dined quietly at the Ritz.As the two negotiated across the ocean, the NYSE's traditional rival, Nasdaq, was building a stake in the London Stock Exchange, with an eye to owning it or seeking to prevent someone else from acquiring it through its stake. While many expected the NYSE Group to make a bid for London, those who listened to Mr. Thain knew his interest was in building out the business to include global stock, futures and derivatives trading.His deal for Euronext will face its greatest obstacle on Tuesday when Euronext shareholders will vote during their annual general meeting on whether or not the company should, in principle, merge with Deutsche Börse.The vote was put on the agenda earlier this year by a group of hedge fund investors, said to be led by the Children's Investment Fund, which has been pushing for a deal.On Friday, Deutsche Börse outlined its merger proposal for Euronext, but it was not greeted with enthusiasm, because much of the management of the combined company would remain in Germany.In contrast, under the New York offer, Jan-Michiel Hessels, the chairman of Euronext's supervisory board, would be chairman of the new company, and Mr. Thain would be chief executive. Mr. Théodore, the Euronext chief executive, would be deputy chief executive and would run the European business.Under the negotiated terms of the deal, the NYSE Group will pay $10.2 billion and will continue to have oversight of the U.S. stock business. The new company would be listed in both New York and Paris, with ownership split 50-50 between investors from each exchange.With the New York offer on the table, a shareholder vote to combine with Deutsche Börse is unlikely to pass, analysts said.Ultimately, financial markets may be moving to a point where there will be a limited number of global players who compete against each other, not unlike the car industry, Mr. Kirchmaier of the London School of Economics said. Both businesses are capital intensive, and both are consolidating. The result so far, he noted, at least in the car industry, has been more choice for customers.'"
"'06-05-22,'0','Gen. Yuri N. Baluyevsky, the chief of the Russian military's general staff, has sought to stir up Polish opposition to the plan.""What can we do?"" General Baluyevsky told the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza in December. ""Go ahead and build that shield. You have to think, though, what will fall on your heads afterward. I do not foresee a nuclear conflict between Russia and the West. We do not have such plans. However, it is understandable that countries that are part of such a shield increase their risk.""The proposed antimissile site is the latest chapter in the long-running saga of the United States missile defense program, which began with President Reagan's expansive vision of a space-based antimissile shield.More than 20 years and billions of dollars later, the Bush administration is proceeding with a limited antimissile system, one that is no longer intended to make nuclear weapons ""impotent and obsolete,"" as Mr. Reagan famously put it. Instead, it is designed to counter prospective dangers from nations like North Korea and Iran.President Bush made the program a top priority soon after taking office and cleared the way for antimissile deployments by withdrawing from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia.Nine interceptors have already been installed at Fort Greely, Alaska, and two at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California as part of a broader, multilayered system planned by the Pentagon. An interceptor consists of a rocket that carries a 155-pound ""kill vehicle,"" which is designed to seek out and collide with an enemy missile warhead. While the program is still being tested, the Pentagon says that the interceptors could be pressed into service in a crisis.The program's numerous critics say it is behind schedule and not up to even this challenge. ""It has been doing very poorly,"" said Philip Coyle, the former head of the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation in the Pentagon. ""They have not had a successful flight intercept test for four years.""Lieut. Gen. Henry A. Obering III, chief of the Missile Defense Agency at the Pentagon, said none of the technical problems have been show-stoppers. Several tests in which a target is to be intercepted are scheduled for this year and early next year.The Pentagon is seeking $9.3 billion for its missile defense work for the 2007 fiscal year. About $2.4 billion is to go for fielding new systems and maintaining existing ones. The remainder is for additional development and testing.Given the many technical challenges, the House Armed Services Committee has refused to approve the $56 million for the initial engineering work for the new antimissile field. The Senate Armed Services Committee, however, has supported the initiative, and the Pentagon is pressing Congress to approve the funds to install in Europe the same type of interceptors that are at Fort Greely.As the debate continues over the technical capabilities of the system, the Pentagon has pushed to expand it. The Fort Greely and Vandenberg sites are primarily oriented against potential missile threats from North Korea.""We have a limited capacity today, and it is certainly focused against the North Koreans initially,"" General Obering said in an interview. ""We are worried about what is happening in the Middle East. We want to make sure that we have coverage from those approaches.""To improve the coverage against a potential Iranian threat, the Pentagon is upgrading a radar complex at Fylingdales, a British air base, and plans to begin similar work at the American Thule Air Base in Greenland. By building an antimissile base in Europe, the Pentagon is seeking to position the interceptors close to the projected flight path of Iranian missiles that would be aimed toward Europe or continue on a polar route to the United States.General Obering said the system would complement any NATO efforts to develop an antimissile defense.Iran does not have intercontinental-range missiles and has yet to conduct a flight test of a multistage rocket. There has been concern that Iran might develop the technology it needs to build such a weapon in the guise of a civilian space program. But some experts say it is a long way from developing such a system.""As far as we can tell, Iran is many years away from having the capability to deliver a military strike against the U.S.,"" said Gary Samore, vice president of the MacArthur Foundation and a former aide at the National Security Council. ""If they made a political decision to seriously pursue a space launch vehicle it would take them a decade or more to develop the capability to launch against the U.S.""Still, Iran has long seen ballistic missiles as an important weapon. Iran fired Scud missiles at Baghdad and Kirkuk during its war with Iraq and later embarked on an effort to secure additional missiles and missile technology from foreign suppliers, including North Korea. The Iranian Shahab-3, a liquid-fueled missile that is based on North Korea's No-dong missile, has the range to strike Israel, Turkey and other countries in the region.Defense Department officials argue that Iran could collaborate with North Korea to speed up the development of long-range systems. Given the time it would take the United States to install an antimissile site in Europe, some officials said it was not too soon to begin work.""Iran understands the use of ballistic missiles to change strategic geography,"" said a senior American Defense official who asked not to be identified because he did not want to be drawn into the public debate. ""This is a long lead-time item. We would much rather be a couple of years early than a couple of years late.""In the meantime, the Bush administration has resumed its efforts to sound out support abroad. In early April, Pentagon and State Department officials visited Warsaw to renew discussions about the project, which has been talked about for years. American officials said the Polish government has been receptive.""They asked us officially if we were still interested in discussing the issue,"" Poland's deputy foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, said last month. ""Of course we said yes and we are awaiting details."" Poland's defense minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, said recently that he has submitted questions for the Pentagon to answer before formal talks could be convened. Mr. Sikorski, who declined to be interviewed for this article, met in Washington with Mr. Rumsfeld last week to discuss an array of security issues.In an effort to build support for the potential project, American diplomats in Warsaw have been meeting with opposition parties to keep them informed on the process of picking a site. According to a Polish press report, the Boeing Company, the prime contractor for the program, has made it clear that it would use Polish subcontractors. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the report.The Czech Republic has sought to avoid public discussion of the project, fearing that it could become an issue in June parliamentary elections. As a result, American officials have refrained from talking openly about a potential site on Czech territory. But it remains an option that both sides intend to discuss privately, said an American official, who was granted anonymity because of the confidentiality of the discussions.The United States already has a very close military relationship with Eastern European nations. The United States Army rehearsed helicopter attacks in Poland before the invasion of Iraq, and Poland later sent troops to Iraq. Exiled Iraqi fighters opposed to Saddam Hussein were trained in Hungary. Poland and the Czech Republic, along with eight other East European nations, are NATO members.With the political fortunes of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain in decline and controversy at home over his decision to join the American invasion of Iraq, there is no serious discussion about installing antimissile interceptors in Britain, the American official said.The installation of 10 interceptors in Eastern Europe would have no significant ability to defend against Russia's sizable nuclear arsenal. American officials say that the Bush administration sought to assure the Russians that the system is not aimed at Moscow by keeping it informed about the recent visit by American officials to Warsaw. But the Russians are unhappy with the idea and have portrayed it as a step that would jeopardize cooperation between NATO and Russia, including on antimissile systems.The development of an antimissile site in Poland would have a ""negative impact on the whole Euro-Atlantic security system,"" Sergei Ivanov, the Russian defense minister, told a Belarus newspaper. ""The choice of location for the deployment of those systems is dubious, to put it mildly.""'"
"'06-05-22,'0','BATON ROUGE, La., May 21 — A man opened fire inside the Ministry of Jesus Christ Church here during a Sunday morning service, killing four in-laws and wounding another before kidnapping his wife and killing her, law enforcement officials said.The man, identified by the police as Anthony Bell of Baton Rouge, also abducted three of his children, including an infant, as the service was nearing its end, the police said. The children were later found unharmed.Mr. Bell, 25, was charged with five counts of first-degree homicide and one count each of attempted first-degree murder and second-degree kidnapping.Resting his hands on his knees and shaking his head outside the church, a small metal-frame structure attached to a guitar shop, Chief Jeff Leduff of the Baton Rouge Police said: ""When you start stacking up human life like this, it's sad. It's a sad day for the whole city.""Chief Leduff refused to release the names of the dead.But Jeffery Howard, 47, of Baton Rouge, a church member, said his parents, Gloria and Leonard Howard, were among the dead.Mr. Howard identified the suspect's slain wife as Erica Bell and said he was her godfather.

Then a specialist told Cole he did not like the way the injury was healing and that he would need an operation. After seeking a second opinion, Cole decided against the surgery and was put into a cervical brace that stretched down his torso.""But that brace was better than getting put in a halo for six months,"" Cole said.When he was finally allowed to shed the brace earlier this month, Cole tied the contraption to the back of Carolina center Kevyn Adams's Audi and they dragged it from the RBC Center to a nearby gas station and back.When they returned, they left the brace in the parking lot, where Cole and his teammates ran over it with their cars. Only then did Cole retrieve the crumpled brace and deposit it in the trash.But Cole has yet to exorcise his lingering bad feelings toward Orpik.""I've never talked to him,"" Cole said. ""Honestly, I probably wouldn't even speak to him.""He said Orpik waited nearly a month, then attempted to contact him through the veteran right wing Mark Recchi, who was traded to Carolina from Pittsburgh at the March 9 trade deadline.When asked why he would not accept an apology if Orpik offered one, Cole asked, ""Why should I?""He said he was angry about comments by Orpik that were published two days after the hit. To Cole, Orpik seemed to absolve himself of responsibility.""He was driving wide, and I thought he was going to keep going wide,"" Orpik was quoted as saying March 6 in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""He looked over his left shoulder, and saw me coming. It wasn't like he had his back to me and I knew he was in a vulnerable position.""I've watched the video a dozen times or so, in slow-motion and real time, and I'm committed to going at him. He sees me coming, and he kind of turns — kind of ducks, too — at the last second. I talked to some other guys who said he does that a lot, because he's such a big, strong guy that he does that, then tries to spin off of you.""Colin Campbell, the N.H.L.'s executive vice president and director of hockey operations, suspended Orpik for three games, a penalty that infuriated the Hurricanes.""I am not looking for any apologies or whatever,"" Cole said. ""I am looking forward to playing him again.""For that, Cole will have to wait until next season. And if he is cleared to play sooner, he has a plan.""I think I will probably go out there and look for a first hit before I let someone come into me,"" Cole said, another smile spreading across his face.'"
"'06-05-22,'0','DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, May 21 — Kuwait's emir dissolved the country's 50-member Parliament on Sunday evening, ending a weeklong battle over a proposed redistricting law that threatened to cause a governmental crisis.The emir, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, called new elections for June 29, almost a year ahead of schedule.Opposition members of Parliament, who support the redistricting, have been pressing to reduce the country's 25 electoral districts to 5, contending that the government is able to use tribal and family loyalties — and downright corruption — to control the outcome in some smaller districts. With larger districts that would include a greater variety of Kuwaitis, the opposition parties expect that they would be able to do better.A ministerial committee recently recommended that the number of districts be reduced to 10, in an apparent compromise. But last week, members loyal to the government pressed to refer the bill to the country's constitutional court, which the opposition saw as a stalling tactic.The move prompted a walkout by 29 members, who came together and formed a new parliamentary bloc, demanding to question the prime minister, Sheik Nasser al-Muhammad al-Sabah. Such an appearance before Parliament by the prime minister, a member of the royal family, would have been an unprecedented development in Kuwaiti politics.'"
"'06-05-22,'0','Many essential details have already been hammered out, a person familiar with the negotiations said. Jan-Michiel Hessels, the chairman of Euronext's supervisory board, would be chairman of the new company, and John A. Thain, chief executive of the NYSE Group, would be chief executive. Jean-François Théodore, the Euronext chief executive, would have a senior management role that was still to be determined.Finance has long been globalized, with money, deals and labor seeking opportunities around the globe. A combination of the NYSE Group and Euronext would catapult stock exchanges from national or continental entities to trans-Atlantic behemoths with diversified businesses and tremendous pricing power.If consummated, the deal would alter the architecture of global stock trading, combining two major cash trading businesses and opening up new pools of investors to companies, which could be listed in two major market centers. It is also expected to speed the modernization of the Big Board and signal more aggressive growth for Euronext.A deal would combine the N.Y.S.E.'s traditional floor-based stock exchange and Archipelago's electronic stock and options businesses with Euronext's all-electronic trading platform, which encompasses the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Portugal, as well as the London derivatives exchange.For years, Mr. Thain has expressed an interest in expanding the Big Board's business to include derivatives, building on its options business and taking a lead in the global consolidation of the trading of all types of financial products.A NYSE Group spokesman declined to comment on the plans.The scramble to find a partner comes amid a broader dance of global exchanges. In March, Nasdaq made an informal, $4.1 billion bid for the London Stock Exchange. After the offer was rebuffed, Nasdaq built up a 25.1 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange, paving the way to either own it or protect against someone else owning it. And in the last few years, the London Stock Exchange has been courted with little success by Deutsche Börse, Macquarie Bank and Euronext.A Euronext-NYSE deal could foreshadow an interesting potential outcome for the European stock markets, exporting the NYSE and Nasdaq rivalry abroad while transforming every exchange's businesses in significant ways.If Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange ultimately paired up, it would create a powerful European listings business as well as an all-electronic stock-trading business. The combined entity, however, would have no exposure to options or derivatives trading — two high-margin, fast-growing businesses — and Nasdaq's debt has already been downgraded to junk by the major credit rating agencies as the result of its purchase of a quarter-stake in the London exchange.A NYSE Group and Euronext matchup would create a formidable competitor, bolstered by the Big Board's global branding power and the backbone of many of Europe's exchanges. It would leave Deutsche Börse, operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange, without a partner but in control of its profitable clearing and settlement business.Both potential cross-border pairings could meet political resistance as nationalistic sentiments on both side of the Atlantic weigh the reality of creating, maintaining and regulating a global exchange. The deal will pose significant technological challenges, in particular because New York operates a floor-based trading system and Euronext does not.A NYSE-Euronext combination would represent another major upheaval for the NYSE Group. In the last year alone, Mr. Thain has overseen the purchase of Archipelago Holdings, an all-electronic exchange, which he used as a vehicle to transform the Big Board from a member-owned, nonprofit utility to a for-profit, publicly traded company.The acquisition gave the NYSE Group an electronic trading engine to trade stocks listed over the counter, as well as an option business housed in the Pacific Stock Exchange. At the same time, Mr. Thain has introduced a hybrid trading system intended to give customers more choices in how to trade stocks via specialists or electronically.It is unclear how the proposed merger would affect that hybrid system, if at all.NYSE Group's offer comes days after Deutsche Börse outlined why it believed it should be the exchange to do a deal with Euronext. Its plan was not well received, according to one person familiar with Euronext's plans, paving the way for the NYSE Group to make a move.The New York Stock Exchange will probably move to build on Euronext's listing platform. The listings business in the United States has suffered as companies have responded to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the intense regulatory scrutiny here by opting for other exchanges, like London and Shanghai. The combined entity could offer companies the ability to list in the United States on the Big Board, as well as Euronext. Regulators in each country would regulate its country's trading, a potential challenge as platforms are combined.In 2005, Euronext earned revenues of 961.9 million euros. Derivatives trading constituted 331.9 million euros of the total revenues, while cash trading provided 215.7 million euros. Sales of software were the third-largest category of revenue, with 195.2 million euros. It earned 241.1 million euros in 2005, or 2.18 euros a share.In 2005, the New York Stock Exchange had 2,672 companies worth $21.2 trillion. On average, it traded 1.6 billion shares a day, with two days in which more than 3 billion shares were traded. Euronext has 1,225 listed companies worth 2.6 trillion euros. In 2005, it traded 347 million derivatives contracts, up 11 percent from the year before.'"
"'06-05-22,'0','""Cambodian Stories: An Offering of Painting and Dance,"" performed at the Asia Society on Saturday night, more than stands on its own as haunting theater and dance filled with suggestions about great human themes. But its story is as fascinating as the piece itself, which came about after the duo Eiko and Koma were invited in 2001 to work with students at the Reyum Institute of Arts and Culture in Phnom Penh.Founded eight years ago, the school, a nongovernmental organization, offers young people substantial free training in traditional and contemporary painting and drawing. Eiko and Koma, New York-based choreographers and dancers, taught their Delicious Movement workshop at the Cambodian school and were impressed with the students' openness to dance. Last year the two returned to create ""Cambodian Stories"" with a cast of volunteer students, followed by this national tour in the United States.Eight young men and one teenage girl, ranging in ages from 16 to 22, are the chief performers. Eiko and Koma glide like gentle presiding ghosts through the ritual story, which unfolds on a stage covered with sand and framed by hanging painted panels of stylized female dancers.By the end of the 80-minute piece a young man, played by the 17-year-old Setpheap (Peace) Sorn, has fallen in love with 16-year-old Chakreya So, who dies and is commemorated in a huge backdrop portrait filled with wild beauty, painted on the stage by the men.""Cambodian Stories,"" which is set to Cambodian popular songs and instrumental music chosen by the Cambodian-American musician Sam-Ang Sam, is about love and also about painting, which the men do as they climb across wooden structures, bending to wield their brushes and paint. It is about transforming traditional dance styles into a new vocabulary of stiff sideways motion for eerily slender young bodies, limbs akimbo, that also suggests the discomfort of youth.""Cambodian Stories"" is also about decay, as pieces by Eiko and Koma often are. The front curtain, battered panels and backdrop all fall and crumple eventually. But the backdrop rises, like the lovers, at the end, still wet, its lines and colors blotting to add to the imagery. New beauty comes of old, as it does at the school this piece celebrates.'"
"'06-05-22,'0','MySpace.com, which began as an online community for user-generated content like music and videos and quickly developed into a launching pad for new bands (among other things), has struck a deal for exclusive access to the next issue of the magazine Nylon.Nylon, which covers music and fashion, will release a free digital version of its June-July music issue with MySpace on Wednesday. The digital issue, which will be available for downloading at the magazine's Web site (www.nylonmag.com/digital), will be identical to the print version, which will not reach newsstands until May 31.Both versions include links to the MySpace pages of bands, artists and designers mentioned in the magazine, allowing readers to listen to featured music.For MySpace, which the News Corporation bought last year for $580 million, the collaboration is another step in its continuing engagement with commercial outlets. The site is best known as a social networking hub, but it has other aims as well.The idea for the collaboration with Nylon originated with Marvin Scott Jarrett, the magazine's editor in chief, who founded it with Helena Christensen, the model. In the print issue, the partnership will be reflected in text and graphics that direct the reader to pages on MySpace.""The idea was to have everything in the issue tagged back to a MySpace account,"" Mr. Jarrett said.

"'06-05-23,'0','On Friday night, my wife and I had a date night in New York City. But as our taxi headed down Fifth Avenue, we saw the mobs standing in line for the grand opening of Apple's new flagship store.Now, I knew all about the store; I'd been to the press preview there just the day before. I'd entered the huge glass cube in front of the General Motors building, which serves as the entryway to the huge underground Apple store. I'd watched cylindrical glass elevator rise up into the cube without any means of visible support. (It's supported from beneath by a 60-foot steel post.) I'd heard how this store will be open 24 hours, 365 days a year; that its Genius Bar alone had more employees than the entire staff of Apple's other Manhattan store; that securing this site for a store involved a delicate negotiation with the City of New York, since the plaza is technically a public space. (Hint to laptop lovers: free public Wi-Fi forever was part of the deal.)But I completely forgotten that I'd be in town only an hour before the grand opening (6:00 p.m. Friday).So we jumped out of the cab. I didn't have my camera or camcorder with me; in fact, all I had was a new, black MacBook laptop that Apple has loaned me for review. But it has a built-in video camera--and so, anticipating the opportunity to get some great footage of the true blue Mac faithful to use in one of my Times Web videos, I hit Record and walked the line of over 1,000 people that stretched completely around the bock and returned to the front of the building again.My wife and I met the guys at the front of the line, who'd been standing there since noon the day before. (That entailed, incidentally, sleeping--or, rather, not sleeping--through the Thursday night downpour. They offered us the chance to feel their soaked parkas as proof.)Steve Jobs emerged from the great glass elevator and acknowledged the roar of the crowd. (The crowd in front, anyway; those in line on the other three sides of the block had no idea anything was going on.)'"

"'06-05-23,'0','Mr. Tierney has been involved in Republican politics, served as a corporate spokesman and represented Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Archdiocese. He has said he would sever his political ties if his group's bid were successful. The city is heavily Democratic; the suburbs are historically Republican but have increasingly voted Democratic over the last 15 years.The other investors also include ""civic, labor and corporate leaders, entrepreneurs and private investors,"" the parties to the sale said in a joint statement.John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst, said that having local business people own a newspaper created the potential for conflicts of interest.Walter Annenberg, for example, a wealthy business tycoon whose family owned The Inquirer from the 1940's until the late 1960's, ""treated The Inquirer as an arm of his own will,"" Mr. Morton said.""That's the danger,"" he said. ""And that danger may be aggravated by the fact that these new owners don't come out of a newspaper culture and might not be sensitive to the damage to a newspaper's journalism and to its future by using it for some kind of personal agenda.""However, at a news conference this afternoon at the building that houses both The Inquirer and The Daily News, Mr. Tierney said that all the investors had signed a pledge that they would not attempt to influence or interfere with the editorial policies of the papers. ""We won't be involved in terms of the editorial side,"" he said. It was the first moment in his speech that employees of the papers, who were in the audience, applauded.The new owners in Philadelphia, under the name Philadelphia Media Holdings, have agreed to leave much of the current newsroom management in place and have indicated a willingness to work with the papers' labor unions. They have also said they wanted to market and sell ads for the newspapers more aggressively and upgrade their joint Web site, www.philly.com.Today's sale ends one chapter of uncertainty and turmoil at both papers. But it could open another as the new owners get to know the newspaper business, which is still profitable although advertising is in a slump, classified ads are migrating to free online sites, readers are decamping for the Internet and newspapers have yet to figure out how to make money from their increasingly popular Web sites. Philadelphia is further hobbled by a lagging economy, and the papers are saddled with expensive union contracts.Knight Ridder, which owns 32 dailies, including The Inquirer and Daily News, was sold under pressure from unhappy shareholders to McClatchy in March for $4.5 billion. McClatchy immediately announced it was selling 12 of those papers, including The Inquirer and the Daily News, because their markets were not considered growth markets.Knight Ridder's profit margin in 2004 was 19.3 percent, about average for the industry. Morgan Stanley, which examined the company before its sale, said the profit margin in Philadelphia was 9 percent, while company executives said it was somewhat higher, even with severance payments last year as the papers trimmed their staffs.Both papers have been losing circulation at rates that exceed the industry average.Circulation at The Inquirer, once the crown jewel of the Knight Ridder chain in terms of circulation and Pulitzer Prizes, fell to 350,457, a drop of 5 percent, for the six-month period ending March 31, compared with the same period the year before.Circulation at the Daily News dropped to 116,590, or 9.4 percent.The average circulation loss for the industry was 2.5 percent.The sale of the Philadelphia papers moves McClatchy another step toward its goal of unloading the 12 Knight Ridder dailies by July 1. It sold four other papers — the San Jose Mercury News, Contra Costa Times and Monterey Herald, all in California, and the Pioneer Press in St. Paul — last month to William Dean Singleton's MediaNews and the Hearst Corporation for $1 billion.When he was buying those papers, Mr. Singleton also made a bid for The Inquirer and Daily News but he did not renew the bid in the final round last week.At least four other parties were interested in buying the Philadelphia papers: Mortimer Zuckerman's Daily News L.P., the publisher of The Daily News in New York; the Yucaipa Companies, joined by the Newspaper Guild; the Onex Corporation, based in Toronto; and Avista Capital Partners, which was working in conjunction with Christopher Harte, a former Knight Ridder executive.'"
"'06-05-23,'0','Fiterman Hall didn't exactly overshadow the official opening of 7 World Trade Center today (the sun was in the wrong position for that) but the ragged remnant of 9/11 offered a silent reminder of how much more work there is to do.With its shattered walls and missing windows, its emptied floors behind shroudlike nets, the 15-story Fiterman Hall played silent counterpoint — like the unwanted party guest that everyone notices but no one acknowledges — to the candied-apple exuberance of a plump Jeff Koons sculpture that was unveiled by Larry A. Silverstein, the developer of 7 World Trade Center, outside the building's front door on Greenwich Street.The nine-foot-high, multilobed, stainless steel sculpture, ""Balloon Flower (Red),"" sits in a circular fountain in a new triangular park, about one-third of an acre, designed by Ken Smith Landscape Architect. It is framed by planters filled with azaleas and boxwood and by small groves of sweet gum trees.Sweet gums are also intended for the World Trade Center memorial plaza but Mr. Smith did not know this until today, so the choice was coincidental. ""They have a fabulous fall color,"" he explained.""Balloon Flower (Red)"" mimics on a colossal scale the twisted balloon creations that are a staple of children's parties. It is meant as a bit of fun in an otherwise somber setting. ""We thought everybody would walk by it and smile,"" said David M.

""In the past year, some of the world's most powerful governments have received an uncomfortable wake-up call about the dangers of undervaluing the human rights dimension of their actions at home and abroad.""But, in a statement as she unveiled the annual report, Ms. Khan said: ""Governments collectively and individually paralyzed international institutions and squandered public resources in pursuit of narrow security interests, sacrificed principles in the name of the 'war on terror' and turned a blind eye to massive human rights violations.""""As a result, the world has paid a heavy price, in terms of erosion of fundamental principles and in the enormous damage done to the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people.""The war on terrorism, she said, ""is failing and will continue to fail until human rights and human security are given precedence over narrow national security interests.""In the United States, Mr. Cox took issue principally with ""the U.S. government's outsourcing of military detention, security and intelligence operations, which may be fueling serious human rights abuses. And most of those who commit these abuses seem to be getting away with it.""Of the estimated 25,000 military contractors working in Iraq, he said some ""stand accused of engaging in or supporting human rights violations such as sexual abuse and torture. Some have been implicated in the Abu Ghraib scandal, and numerous news reports highlight how contractors have fired at civilians in Iraq with devastating consequences."" There had been no prosecutions of contractors, he said.""Illegal behavior of contractors and of those who designed and carried out U.S. torture policies and the reluctance of the government to bring perpetrators to justice are tarnishing the reputation of the United States, hurting the image of American troops and contributing to anti-American sentiment,"" Mr. Cox said.'"
"'06-05-23,'0','A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.Russia's stock exchange plunged nine percent on Monday in panic selling that affected developing markets around the world, raising concerns about Russia's economy and speculation about the exact causes. With Monday's losses, estimated by The Moscow Times at $62.6 billion, Russia's stock market has dropped 25 percent in the last two weeks. The decline has mirrored those in other countries, including India and Korea. Several newspapers cited analysts and economists expressing worries about Russia's ability to attract foreign investments. Echoing a sense of shock expressed by most newspapers, Gazeta said that economists expected a drop but that no one thought ""it would be so profound and so painful."" In its headline, the newspaper called the drop ""Almost a Black Monday."" The exchange actually halted work for an hour, in what Kommersant called ""headspinning news."" The newspaper said that the exchange's recovery ""could last for several months.""Kommersant cited unnamed analysts linking the exchange's sharp drop to the upcoming initial public offering of the Russian oil giant Rosneft, which is expected to be the biggest in history, though details remain unclear. They told Kommersant that many major foreign investors had sold their stock in Gazprom, Russia's state energy monopoly, and plan to reinvest their capital in Rosneft. Ruslan Byslov of Alfabank echoed the analysts' claims that investors are controlling the tide of the market. ""They themselves initiate these fluctuations and they themselves decide when movement will resume,"" he told Kommersant. Newspapers reported that the Kremlin might postpone Rosfneft's offering to stabilize the market.BOOK ABOUT YELTSIN ERA: In advance of the 10-year anniversary of the election that kept President Boris N. Yeltsin in power, Izvestia published an excerpt of a new book about Mr. Yeltsin by Anatoly B. Chubais.

Yushchenko. According to news accounts, Andrei Yushchenko was involved in an incident with a regional prosecutor, during which rubber bullets were fired. According to Izvestia, Mr. Yushchenko ordered journalists not to write about the incident.

"'06-05-23,'0','But there are substantial obstacles remaining to the proposed deal, notably the need to gain shareholder approval amid competing inducements and the requirement for regulatory approval in some countries.Nonetheless, Michael Pagano, an associate professor of finance at Villanova University, remarked: ""It's the first true cross-Atlantic, international alliance or merger of securities exchanges. It has the opportunity to provide institutional and retail investors the ability to trade in a global framework — to trade U.S. stocks, European stocks in one seamless environment.""A combination of the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext would create the world's largest equities market, with a total value for its listed companies of $26.9 trillion — more than the next four markets.It would have 22 hours of trading on seven markets in six countries. In addition to share trading in the United States and Europe, the New York Exchange would add an arm that traded derivatives in Europe — the Liffe market in London — to complement the options-trading business that it obtained as part of the recent acquisition of Archipelago, an all-electronic electronic market.Trading derivatives, complex contracts whose value depends on an underlying security, has been a booming business and is more profitable to exchanges than the plain-vanilla business of dealing in shares.Exchanges make money three ways: from the fees they charge companies to list their stocks, from the fees they charge for the trades and for the data they produce from all the trading, which can be packaged and sold to businesses like newspapers and brokerage firms.Among the obstacles to the deal outlined yesterday is intra-European competition. Euronext management has said it welcomes the offer, but the company's shareholders will vote today on an alternative proposal from Deutsche Börse, the operator of the Frankfurt exchange.Many Deutsche Börse shareholders have expressed strong interest in pairing with Euronext to create a ""European champion."" The proposal is nonbinding, but Euronext's management would be under challenge by a vote in favor of the German exchange.Any deal with New York or Frankfurt would have to be approved by regulators. A deal between Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange would have little impact on brokerage firms who already trade billions of dollars a day globally.""Technology already exists to access global exchanges,"" said Jamie Selway, president of White Cap Trading, an institutional brokerage firm.It would probably not affect investors who buy shares in their national markets through brokers or electronic trading operations. But it could help small and midsize companies attract new global investors as foreign stocks become available in local currencies, enabling more trading in them, producing benefits for the companies.""When more institutions can trade more shares more quickly and efficiently,"" Mr. Pagano of Villanova said, ""the bottom line is these institutional investors can generate greater net returns for their investors, the retail investors.""There is fear, though, that the deal would allow companies to shop for the least strict regulatory environment to list a stock. A major attraction for United States markets that are shopping for European counterparts is the ability to attract companies who choose not to list in the United States because of the greater regulatory scrutiny and cost that have come as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The law, passed in the wake of corporate scandals, requires executives to certify the quality of their companies' financial controls.Seth Merrin, founder of LiquidNet, which electronically and anonymously trades big blocks of stock, said, ""The only benefit I can see from N.Y.S.E. perspective is the benefit from regulatory arbitrage, all the listings moving to Europe from New York.""Many of the world's exchanges were once sleepy, not-for-profit utilities of a sort, operations that garnered little interest beyond their own hectic floors, where traders ran around in search of buyers and sellers. But in the last few years, many such exchanges have transformed themselves into largely electronic for-profit miniature monopolies. As their share prices soared, a race developed to use those rich prices to conclude deals.""Historically, exchanges were always a source of national pride,"" and deals between countries were off-limits, said Tom Kirchmaier, a corporate governance specialist at the London School of Economics. Euronext was one of the first successful transnational combinations of exchanges.The NYSE Group is still in the throes of its own reinvention. It used its merger with Archipelago to change from a not-for-profit operation to a publicly traded company, and is in the process of rolling out a new system, called hybrid, that incorporates elements of electronic trading in the traditional floor trading.The board started looking at the other exchanges ""the day after the Archipelago deal closed,"" a person close to the negotiations said. Discussions were suspended while the NYSE Group completed a follow-on stock offering, and in recent weeks, negotiations heated up.While the world of exchanges may seem relatively dull to some, negotiations to achieve a deal had been so secret that the two chief executives had to keep their dining top secret from New York to Paris.When Jean-François Théodore, Euronext's chief executive, met Mr. Thain for dinner in New York, they picked the skybox at Daniel, a premier Manhattan restaurant. In Paris, they dined quietly at the Ritz.As the two negotiated, the N.Y.S.E.'s traditional rival, Nasdaq, was building a stake in the London Stock Exchange, with an eye to owning it or seeking to prevent someone else from owning it through its stake. While many expected the NYSE Group to make a bid for London, those who listened to Mr. Thain knew that his interest was in building the business to include global stock, futures and derivatives trading.His deal for Euronext will face its greatest obstacle today when Euronext shareholders are to vote at their annual meeting on whether or not the company should, in principle, merge with Deutsche Börse.The vote was put on the agenda earlier this year by a group of hedge fund investors, said to be led by the Children's Investment Fund, who have been pushing for a deal.On Friday, Deutsche Börse outlined its merger proposal for Euronext, but it was not greeted with enthusiasm because much of the management of the combined company would remain in Germany.In contrast, under the New York offer, Jan Michiel Hessels, the chairman of Euronext's supervisory board, would be chairman of the new company, and Mr. Thain would be chief executive. Mr. Théodore, the Euronext chief, would be deputy chief executive and would run the European business.Under the terms of the deal, the NYSE Group will pay $10.2 billion and will continue to have oversight of the United States stock business. The new company would be listed in both New York and Paris, with ownership split 50-50 between investors from each exchange. With the New York offer on the table, a shareholder vote to combine with Deutsche Börse is unlikely to pass, analysts said.Ultimately, financial markets may be moving to a point where there will be a limited number of global competitors, not unlike the situation in the car industry, Mr. Kirchmaier of the London School of Economics said. Both businesses are capital-intensive, and are consolidating. A result, at least so far in the auto industry, he said, had been more choice for customers.'"
"'06-05-23,'0','New Jersey residents who commute to Manhattan by ferry will have a gleaming new terminal to use in Weehawken, N.J., starting today — just in time to ease the pain of an increase in fares.The terminal, which cost $44 million in public money to build, will be the home base of New York Waterway, a private company that runs ferries between several docks in New Jersey, Midtown and Lower Manhattan. Next week, Waterway plans to raise its fares to and from the new terminal to as much as $9 each way.New Jersey Transit, which operates trains and buses throughout the state, owns the terminal but will not run it or set fares, said Kris Kolluri, the state's commissioner of transportation and the chairman of the transit agency.""I see this as a public-private partnership where a private company is willing to provide the type of transportation services that the public is looking for,"" Mr. Kolluri said.A company affiliated with Waterway, which is controlled by the family of Arthur Imperatore, has a 32-year lease to operate the new terminal. Last fall, New York City's Economic Development Corporation opened a $56 million terminal on the West Side of Midtown, which is also operated by Waterway. The combined $100 million in spending on ferry docks was a response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when tens of thousands of panicked people evacuated Manhattan by boat.'"
"'06-05-23,'0','School officials across New York have significantly underreported cases of violent and disruptive behavior to the state, the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, found in an audit released yesterday, in what he said was an effort to make their schools appear safer than they were.Mr. Hevesi faulted the State Education Department as well as the schools, saying the department ""ignored the problem"" until the audit began, kept sloppy records and allowed schools to revise their data to avoid sanctions.The department is required by a 2000 law to collect information on cases, ranging from homicides to bullying, from school districts across the state, and to use it to compile a list of ""persistently dangerous schools."" Parents are allowed by law to transfer their children out of such schools — but there are currently only five schools on the list.The audit covered September 2002 until February 2006, and examined 17 high schools in 15 urban, rural and suburban districts, but none in New York City, where the Police Department tracks violent behavior in schools. Among the schools examined were two in Westchester County — Ardsley High School, which in 2003-4 reported only 6 of the 106 cases documented in school records, and White Plains High School, which reported only 22 of 311 cases documented in that school year.At a news conference, Mr. Hevesi said the ""stunning failure"" of schools to accurately report their safety data pointed to a ""real indication of widespread cover-up of these incidents by school officials."" In interviews with school district officials throughout the state, he said, ""Some were honest enough to admit that they believed that their neighboring districts were cheating and they didn't want to be humiliated by the contrast.""'"
"'06-05-23,'0','""At the end, I felt like I knew him for many years,"" Mr. Khaddam said of Mr. Bayanouni, who concurred.Mr. Khaddam spoke on condition that his present whereabouts not be disclosed because of security concerns and growing sensitivity by some European governments over his political work.For years the Syrian opposition was made up of a ragtag band of leftists, Arab nationalists and Islamists with competing interests and divergent strategies. With the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, in February 2005, opposition figures came into the spotlight as fingers pointed at the Syrian government and international pressure grew. (A preliminary report by United Nations investigators found a state role in the killing, but President Bashar al-Assad has strongly denied the allegations.)Mr. Bayanouni and Mr. Khaddam are cagey about exactly what their alliance is doing other than lobbying, largely because they are concerned over security. They have planned a general meeting in early June to gather opposition figures and outline their charter.They spend much of their time on the telephone, seeking to lure others, even as Syria has begun a crackdown on opposition figures, especially those who have been suspected of meeting with either of the two men. Some critics say Mr. Khaddam became allied with Mr. Bayanouni more for his own future than for Syria's.""It is a marriage of convenience,"" said Ammar Qurabi, a spokesman for Syria's National Organization for Human Rights. ""Khaddam needs a party to have credit inside Syria and get himself back into political life. The Muslim brothers are also in need of a strong person with important files inside the regime.""But in any case, Mr. Khaddam promises to bring the opposition a new degree of clout. With a war in Iraq, and fear of Islamists growing throughout the region, Syria's neighbors and other nations have been loath to support the Muslim Brotherhood.By joining politically with the Brotherhood, Mr. Khaddam ostensibly sends a reassuring message that other members of the government would not face retribution if it fell, and that a stable government would be built soon after.""What happened in Iraq will never happen in Syria,"" he insisted. ""We will protect the army and maintain the institutions of government.""Such comments are a measure of how far each man has come.After the current president's father, Hafez al-Assad, took control in a coup in 1970, the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood — the Islamist group founded in Egypt — became one of several parties pushed underground.The group and numerous splinter elements violently resisted the rule of Mr. Assad and the Baath Party in the mid-1970's.When the Brotherhood rose up in the town of Hama in 1982, Mr. Assad sought to crush it for good, sending in the army and virtually razing the city, killing thousands of the group's members and jailing many others.For many Syrians, the Brotherhood became synonymous with Muslim extremism; for the group's members, Hama is a permanent reminder of the brutality of the Assad era.Mr. Bayanouni, who says he had no role in any violence during the turbulent 70's and 80's, fled to exile in Jordan. In 2000, the Jordanian government asked him to leave under Syrian pressure, he said. He was granted asylum by Britain, and has continued to lead the Syrian branch of the Brotherhood from London.Mr. Khaddam, on the other hand, was a rising star in Syrian politics in the 1960's, ever at the side of Hafez al-Assad, serving in various government positions before becoming foreign minister, and later vice president.But when the elder Mr. Assad died in 2000, and his son succeeded him, Mr. Khaddam was gradually forced out of his areas of influence.Mr. Khaddam says he began reaching out to the opposition years ago — even as vice president — initially to include opposition members and help strengthen the government, later to bring it down.In late 2003, he secretly sent an emissary to London to meet Mr. Bayanouni and tell him of his intention to break with Mr. Assad.""The messenger told me that Khaddam would be going against the regime, but that it is going to take some time,"" Mr. Bayanouni said. ""I sent word back that it should happen soon.""Last summer Mr. Khaddam resigned in a speech before a conference of the Baath Party, warning his comrades of the threat to the state caused by growing corruption, he said. He quickly left for exile in Paris, where he has lived in an opulent house.In late December he gave a hint of his ambitions by accusing Mr. Assad and other Syrian officials of having a hand in Mr. Hariri's assassination, setting off an international firestorm in the process. The stern vice president became the most senior member of the Syrian inner circle to publicly break ranks with Mr. Assad.Months later Mr. Khaddam sent another messenger to Mr. Bayanouni in London, suggesting that they combine forces, setting off a deep debate among the upper ranks of the Brotherhood leadership.It proved to be an excruciating moment for the Muslim Brotherhood, but also a chance to heal old wounds and enter a world that it never could before.""It was a difficult decision to make,"" Mr. Bayanouni said. ""We knew he was a partner to everything that has happened in Syria.""But Mr. Bayanouni and other Brotherhood leaders agreed that Mr. Khaddam had little role in the internal politics of the country, and had no actual blood on his hands, Mr. Bayanouni said.So they arrived at a compromise: Mr. Khaddam had to apologize.""Today his stance is one of regret, and he is very serious about democracy in Syria,"" Mr. Bayanouni said. ""There is a death sentence against him. He is being chased now like they chased us. He does have some responsibility for what has happened in the past, but it is clear he has changed.""Syria recently asked Interpol, the international police organization, to arrest Mr. Khaddam and turn him over to Syria.He faces charges of sedition and has been expelled from the Baath Party. Many of his children's assets have been seized.The government has also begun a wave of arrests of major opposition figures in Syria.Still, Mr. Bayanouni emphasizes that not all is forgotten. When a new government is in place, he said, a court will be able to decide whether Mr. Khaddam was guilty of anything. But in the meantime, he said, Mr. Khaddam will be a critical piece of the opposition.'"
"'06-05-23,'0','In a vote of confidence from Wall Street, one of the three major bond-rating agencies upgraded its rating of New York City's debt yesterday, citing surging tax revenues, a commitment from Albany to finance school construction projects and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's decision to create a $2 billion trust fund to pay for the health care expenses of retired city workers.The upgrade, to AA- from A+, gives the city's general obligation debt, which is about $34.2 billion, its highest credit rating ever by the agency, Standard & Poor's.Of the two other major credit-rating agencies, Fitch Ratings gives the city an A+ and Moody's Investors Service gives it an A1, the equivalent of A+.Dall W. Forsythe, an expert on public finance at Baruch College, said the upgrade was an important step in the city's decades-long journey from the fiscal abyss of the mid-1970's. ""It means the city can borrow a little more cheaply and does not have to pay quite as high interest rates,"" he said. ""It means that a slightly larger group of investors will be willing to buy the city's bonds.""Yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg emphasized fiscal restraint when he addressed the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed policy organization, for the first time since December 2002. The group has expressed alarm about the rising costs of debt service, Medicaid and the pensions and health care benefits of city workers.'"
"'06-05-23,'0','The investigation into executive stock option grants widened, as Juniper Networks, F5 Networks, Brooks Automation and Openwave Systems said they had been contacted by prosecutors or regulators.Juniper, the maker of equipment to direct Internet traffic, said the United States attorney in Brooklyn requested information on its stock option grants. F5 Networks, another Internet-traffic equipment company, and Brooks Automation, a maker of software and machines used in computer-chip production, also got subpoenas from the prosecutor.Openwave, a supplier of mobile-phone software, said it received a letter of inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The S.E.C. requested information on F5's stock option grants on Thursday. Brooks Automation got a similar S.E.C. request May 12.The Semtech Corporation, a maker of chips for cellphones, also received a letter from the S.E.C. on Thursday, asking it to provide information regarding stock options granted since Jan. 1, 1997. The company will comply with the inquiry, according to a statement yesterday.They bring to at least 15 the companies under investigation by the Justice Department, the S.E.C. or both.

"'06-05-23,'0','The Campbell Soup Company posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings yesterday on strong soup sales, and raised its forecast for the year.The company increased prices on soups and other products earlier this year and those increases appeared to be working, analysts said.New products like premium soups in cartons and microwaveable versions of older varieties also helped soup sales, the company said.Earnings rose to $166 million, or 40 cents a share, from $146 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. The profit exceeded the 35 cents a share expected by analysts. Shares of Campbell's rose $1.10, to $33.75.Sales in the period, which ended April 30 and was the third quarter of Campbell's fiscal year, rose 6 percent, to $1.84 billion, a figure that was also better than analysts had expected.'"
"'06-05-23,'0','""Some price gouging by individual retailers did occur to a limited extent,"" the report said. ""Local or regional market trends, however, seemed to explain the price increases in all but one case. Exceptionally high prices on the part of individual retailers generally were very short-lived."" The report did not identify the retailer involved in the one case.While the agency had been expected to reach the conclusions that it formally announced on Monday, senior commission officials said they expected the agency would come under criticism when the five commissioners appear before the Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday.""This investigation, like so many others conducted at the federal and state level, appears to vindicate the refining industry's actions post-Katrina, as well in the other areas that were the subject of the study,"" said Bob Slaughter, president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association. ""We hope that Congress and the public will take full notice of its findings.""But Democrats in Congress, who have been the biggest critics of the commission for the way it monitors the industry, challenged the report's conclusions.""The F.T.C. white paper on gas price gouging is a whitewash,"" said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. ""They find substantial numbers of refiners engaged in anticompetitive practices. They don't like the remedy Congress is proposing, namely a law on price gouging. But they just walk away from responsibility and don't propose a remedy themselves.""Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, also criticized the commission.""It just defies belief that they didn't find price gouging because there is simply no price competition,"" he said. Mr. Schumer said that the Senate ""could do a lot if it had the backbone.""""We could issue subpoenas, we could call in the executives, we could get to the bottom of this,"" he said. ""The problem is that the Senate leadership believes, as the president does, that what's good for big oil is good for America.""The report, which in recent weeks has been cited by President Bush in response to questions about high gas prices, had been widely expected to exonerate oil producers, in part because it is difficult to define market manipulation and price gouging. One commissioner, Jon Leibowitz, observed in a concurring opinion that price gouging ""is the obscenity of antitrust law: difficult to define in theory but easily recognized at the pump.""Moreover, the industry suffered substantial damage last summer that proved to be highly disruptive, and previous reports by the agency over the years about the pricing habits of the oil industry had reached similar conclusions.The hurricanes knocked out about a third of the nation's crude oil production, and in the days after Katrina alone, gas prices jumped an average of about 50 cents a gallon in some cities. Just as the prices began to drop, a second hurricane, Rita, caused further significant damage to the region, and in its aftermath, prices increased by another 35 cents a gallon.""In light of the amount of crude oil production and refining capacity knocked out by Katrina and Rita, the sizes of the posthurricane price increases were approximately what would be predicted by the standard supply and demand paradigm that presumes a market is performing competitively,"" the report said. ""Evidence gathered during our investigation indicated that the conduct of firms in response to the supply shocks caused by the hurricanes was consistent with competition.""Still, as lawmakers come under increasing pressure from voters, senior officials at the commission said in recent days that they were bracing for criticism. Congress has been considering legislation to ease the burden on consumers or lower the profits of the oil industry.Last week, the House of Representatives approved a measure to renegotiate more than 1,000 leases for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in an attempt to revoke billions of dollars in government incentives to oil and gas producers. Lawmakers say they will consider energy legislation after they return from the Memorial Day recess in June.Gas prices have declined slightly in the last week, by 2 cents, to an average of $2.93, and could continue to drop in coming weeks, said Trilby Lundberg, an analyst who conducts surveys of gas stations around the nation.'"

"'06-05-23,'0','Re ""In the Garden, Graduates Boo McCain.

I also fear that it could reflect negatively on employment opportunities for the school's graduates.I am sure that the founders of the New School, themselves the victims of intolerance, would strongly disapprove of these tactics.Senator John McCain's comments about the New School student protests were just as canned as his commencement speech: ""I feel sorry for people living in a dull world where they can't listen to the views of others.""'"
"'06-05-23,'0','Instead, Cesar Millan is the brand.""This is not a flash-in-the-pan sort of thing,"" said Jim Milio, one of the three founders of MPH Entertainment, which produces Mr. Millan's show along with Emery/Sumner Productions, and who has helped to guide Mr. Millan's efforts to build an ambitious business enterprise. ""This is not one year and he's gone. We're making him into a long-lasting brand,"" with more books and videos and dog-training aids and, well, who knows?It was thanks to the efforts of his producers, for example, that Mr. Millan kept all the home video and foreign syndication rights to his television show. That has allowed him to create, in addition to the 10-hour complete collections, which retails for nearly $50, several shorter collections that will be widely available for less than $10 each. Wal-Mart and Sam's Club are expected to feature them at the front of their stores.Mr. Millan's fame has grown to the point where he was recently parodied on an episode of ""South Park,"" the Comedy Central staple.To hear Mr. Millan tell it, he planned it all exactly this way. Even as he evaded border patrols while following a paid guide from Tijuana into Southern California, he said recently, ""my goal was just to become the best dog trainer in the world."" Now a legal immigrant, he is married to an American citizen and planning to apply for citizenship himself.""And my goal was always Hollywood,"" he added. ""Where I'm from, the only thing you hear is Hollywood and Disneyland. You don't hear Texas, you don't hear Ohio, you don't even hear New York. My target was Hollywood because that was the only thing I knew.""Mr. Millan, 36, started by working in the early 1990's in a San Diego dog-grooming studio, where he gained a reputation for working well with the hard-to-handle cases. He asked neighbors to let him walk their dogs. People noticed how he could calm even the fiercest creatures, and word of mouth, the most effective form of advertising and promotion, followed him north to Los Angeles.Working with Americans and their dogs, he said, ""I was surprised and a little confused by what I saw."" Where he grew up, in Culiacan, Sinaloa, in Northwest Mexico, ""everybody walks dogs,"" Mr. Millan said during a recent visit to New York. ""But where I am from, the dog is always behind. Here the dog is always in front. I thought maybe you guys were doing it right and we were doing it wrong. Because to me America is the country where everybody is always doing it right. I thought you knew and we were wrong.""He quickly discovered: no. Americans were letting the dogs, rather than the humans, be the pack leaders, in almost every respect. ""Americans work against Mother Nature, and that's why dogs don't listen to the general population of America,"" he said. ""Why are dogs growing up on a farm much happier than a dog living in the city? Because on a farm, it gets to be a dog. And in the city they become a child, they become a husband, they become a soul mate. They become something the human wants before they are willing to do what is best for them.""That, in turn, translates to dogs behaving badly. At Mr. Millan's Dog Psychology Center in Los Angeles, he works with dozens of dogs at a time. He first drew attention for his walks through Los Angeles with his packs — he on in-line skates, the dogs on leashes — or his runs along the beach or through the Santa Monica Mountains with them. Always, Mr. Millan is at the head of the pack.""It's like cowboys,"" he said. ""They grow up around the horse and the cow; they are not afraid of them. You can be a huge dog lover, you can have a passion for it, but that doesn't mean you can develop the strong assertive state of mind that is required to be around hard-core cases. These cases I work with, they are coming after me. But I don't develop fear. Like the people who work around cobras — they don't have fear in their mind. What makes you become a pack leader is being in a calm, assertive state 100 percent of the time.""Whether he can remain calm and assertive in the wake of his fame and growing fortune will be interesting to watch; in addition to those, Mr. Millan is starting to draw the scrutiny that in America inevitably follows — that is, lawsuits. Earlier this year, Flody Suarez, a television producer and former NBC executive, filed suit in state court charging that his dog, Gator, was severely injured and abused at the Dog Psychology Center. A former publicist for Mr. Millan, Makeda Smith, and a partner also sued Mr. Millan and the National Geographic Channel, contending that they helped to create the idea for a ""Dog Whisperer"" television series.Mr. Millan would not comment on the lawsuits. In a statement, a spokesman for the National Geographic Channel also declined to comment on the litigation, adding that the Suarez dog's injuries were not related to the production of the show and that Mr. Millan was not at the center when the dog was there.Still, Mr. Millan is hard to ruffle, something he says is essential to his training methods.""It's a ripple effect,"" he said. ""I believe in the golden rule — do good things and good things will happen to you. I know I help dogs all the time. And because you help Mother Nature, Mother Nature is going to help you back. There's no other way around. It's the law of the universe.""'"
"'06-05-23,'0','When the Production Code finally succeeded in removing much of the sex and violence from DeMille's work, he began his slow decline into the sententiousness that culminated in his final, and probably least satisfying, film, the 1956 version of ""The Ten Commandments."" The Universal box stops well before that point, with ""The Crusades"" (1935) and the western ""Union Pacific"" (1939): entertaining, well-told stories, though the snap and humor is missing.

Tora! Tora!"" (1970). Together, they made up a respectable tribute to Fleischer, who died on March 25 at 89 without receiving the industry honors that were his due. (He won his only Oscar as one of the three directors of the 1947 documentary feature ""Design for Death."")A true-crime thriller, a psychological western and a war epic — these films don't have much in common apart from Fleischer's clean, almost clinical style. An early master of widescreen composition, Fleischer typically moves his camera from one stark, balanced composition to another, a technique both fluid and precise. A fictionalized version of the Leopold and Loeb murder case, ""Compulsion"" moves with invisible elegance through three distinct points of view: that of the troubled boy genius Judd Steiner (Dean Stockwell, in a great performance); Harold Horn (E. G. Marshall), the district attorney who tracks down Judd and his partner, Artie (Bradford Dillman); and the defense lawyer Jonathan Wilk (modeled on Clarence Darrow and played, to the hilt and beyond, by Orson Welles). Three heroes, three moral perspectives — smoothly linked by Fleischer into a subversive whole.""These Thousand Hills"" is a well-made western, of the late-50's empire-building genre — here, Don Murray builds a ranch out of an investment from a prostitute (Lee Remick) — without being much more. ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is something else. A concentrated retelling of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the film began as a collaboration between Fox and the leading Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, but after three years of preparation and a few days of shooting, Kurosawa pulled out of the project and Fox turned it over to Fleischer for the American scenes and Kinji Fukasaku (who has since gone on to international cult status for his anarchic yakuza films, and who died in 2003) and Toshio Masuda for the Japanese sequences. Not much, if any, of Fukasaku's agitated style is evident in the finished film, which more closely reflects Fleischer's detachment and balance.Made during the Vietnam War, this is a strangely masochistic, even defeatist interpretation of the events of Dec. 7, 1941, contrasting the discipline and dedication of the Japanese forces with the feckless bumbling of the Americans. Fleischer's structuring device is the grim comedy of a warning sent from Washington (by an intelligence group that has broken the Japanese diplomatic code) that eventually arrives in Pearl Harbor, via bicycle telegraph messenger, hours after the attack has begun. Where Michael Bay's 2001 ""Pearl Harbor"" looked instantly dated, with its ridiculous romantic subplot, the Fleischer film now seems strikingly modern and mature.""Tora! Tora!

His subject, 20th-century Swiss music, let him do what he said he would when he began his ""Dialogues and Extensions"" series: explore worthy music that isn't heard as frequently as it should or that at least deserves a second look.Mr. Botstein set his sights on three composers, Frank Martin, Arthur Honegger and Othmar Schoeck. The first two are better known, for good reason. But the Schoeck score Mr. Botstein offered, ""Nachhall"" (""Reverberation""), a 1955 song cycle, is an oddly compelling if flawed work by a lesser light. Its texts, mostly by Nikolaus Lenau, are generally pastoral but are tinged with a dark, bitter quality and a sense of weariness. The music follows suit: most of the settings are slow, melancholy and eerily chromatic. Yet there are attractions in Schoeck's graceful orchestration, and John Hancock, the baritone, put them across with an admirable emotional clarity.The Martin work that Mr. Botstein chose was the Cello Concerto (1966), a rarity that cellists hoping to play something other than the Dvorak Concerto or Tchaikovsky's ""Rococo Variations"" could profitably investigate. The cello writing, played with a soulful warmth here by Christian Poltéra, is shapely and often surprising. A lovely introductory solo and a third-movement cadenza give the cello its brightest spotlight, but the work also offers consistently engaging interplay between the cello line and the gently chromatic orchestral score.The American Symphony musicians gave solid, precise readings of these works. In Honegger's mechanistic showpiece, ""Pacific 231,"" the orchestra's performance was oddly stolid. But Mr. Botstein drew his richest performance of the afternoon just before that, in Honegger's Fifth Symphony, a deeply pessimistic but powerful work that had a brief revival when Charles Dutoit championed it in the 1980's. Mr. Botstein and his players gave a full account of this symphony's searing textures and made its finale sizzle with crisp, slashing string articulation and well-focused brass playing.'"
"'06-05-23,'0','THE FACTS In the 1980's, scientists who study heart disease discovered something that seemed like a small breakthrough.The countries that had the highest rates of the disease, they noticed, also tended to be deficient in selenium, which is a trace element with antioxidant properties.The news led to widespread claims that taking selenium supplements might ward off heart disease, or perhaps treat it.It even prompted one country, Finland, to pass a law requiring that selenium be added to soil and crops.But now, two decades later, it appears that selenium's power may have been overstated. Various studies in recent years have chipped away at the notion that it has any ability to fight heart disease, and a large study published last month in The American Journal of Epidemiology may have been the final blow.The study followed more than 1,000 American adults for seven and a half years. Some took 200 micrograms of selenium daily, and others were assigned placebos. The subjects provided blood samples twice a year and had their medical records studied closely.'"

"'06-05-24,'1','That's not to say that there are no differences at all. Take, for example:* Size. The new laptops have 13.3-inch screens, so they're more compact than the Pro models (which come in 15 or 17 inches).Sadly, they're nowhere near as small as the deliciously small 12-inch PowerBook that they replace. In fact, the MacBook is two full inches wider, despite adding only one inch to the diagonal screen size.In fact, the MacBook is only about an inch narrower than the 15-inch MacBook Pro. What's up with that?* Case. MacBooks come in matte black or iBook white. The material is polycarbonate, a.k.a. bulletproof plastic (vs. the unpainted aluminum cases of the Pro models). As a result, MacBooks's Wi-Fi antennas get much better wireless reception than the Pro models--fantastic reception, in fact.The black model--the BlackBook--is unbelievably cool-looking. Every element, from the tiny screws to the fuzzy lining of the slot-loading DVD burner, is jet black. On the other hand, all the accessories are white (power adapter, external modem, and so on), which looks a little odd. The BlackBook's trackpad gets greasy and fingerprinty after very little time. Finally, this is expensive paint indeed; you'll pay $150 more for the black model than for an identically configured white one.* Price. The white MacBook starts at $1,100 (512 megs of memory, 1.83 gigahertz processor, CD burner-DVD player); $200 more gets you a slightly faster chip and a DVD burner. If you order from the Apple Web site, you can (and should) pay $100 more to double the memory.So what's the difference between the MacBook and the Pro version, which costs at least $900 more?Not much, really; it's mostly about the screen size. The Pro models also have dedicated memory for graphics, which Apple says makes them much faster on high-end games (Doom 3) and high-end pro apps like Aperture, Final Cut and Motion. And the Pro models have a card slot (ExpressCard), although there's not much you can put into it yet.* Screen coating. The MacBook has a glossy screen surface, also popular on Windows laptops, that makes blacks blacker and colors richer. There's been much hue and cry online about the potential for reflections and glare, but in practice, it's really not much of a problem.* Keyboard. The MacBook has a new keyboard design. Instead of cutting a hole in the top ""deck"" of the laptop and lowering a full modular keyboard into it, only the stalks of the keys protrude through individual holes in the deck. Apple says that the keys are therefore less likely to pop off, and my guess is that gook and gunk is less likely to get inside. The completely flat, non-sculpted key tops take some time to get used to, however.* Trackpad. All Apple laptops let you scroll (a Web page, for example) just by dragging two fingers, not one, across the trackpad. It's a trick that quickly becomes second nature.The MacBook adds something new: if you touch the pad with two fingers and then click the clicker, you produce what, on a Windows machine, would be a right-click of the mouse. Cool.* Latch. Speaking of little details that make a difference: there's no lid latch, no button to press. Instead, a strong magnet holds the clamshell shut. A gentle push of your thumb opens the lid. It works great.So how does the new MacBook stack up? Depends on where you're coming from. If you're a longtime Mac fan, you'll like the thin design, superbright screen, the convenient built-in camera and the speed. But you may be acutely aware of all you're giving up: a built-in modem, for example, and the easy one-handability of the old 12-inch model.If you're coming from the Windows world, or if you've never owned a laptop, the MacBook is a different story; you'll probably be bowled over by its beauty and power. (Why is it that the underside of Windows laptops are patchworks of stickers, logos, raised bumps and ugly panels, rather than the sleek and unbroken surface of Mac laptops? As an Apple executive puts it, ""The bottoms of our laptops are better-looking than the TOPS of Windows notebooks!"")You'll also enjoy the way a Mac laptop is instantly powered up and ready to go when you open its lid--no 40-second wake-up sequence is required. And, of course, there's the freedom from the constant worry about viruses and spyware, not to mention the nagginess of Windows itself.And so, as always, Apple giveth, and Apple taketh away. On balance, though, the MacBook is a very sweet laptop that's gained more than it's lost.P.S.—Get psyched! My weekly Times column is now available as a free MP3 podcast.

"'06-05-24,'1','Emmanuel Carrère's psychological mystery, ""La Moustache,"" begins innocently enough, with a scene of domestic chatter that prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that is a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt.Either its protagonist, Marc Thiriez (Vincent Lindon), a successful, happily married architect, is dangerously delusional, or he is the victim of an elaborate conspiracy to undermine his sanity. At one point you even wonder if ""La Moustache"" might be science fiction located in the kind of time warp that was a favorite destination of ""The Twilight Zone.""But the film is neither a paranoid fantasy nor a futuristic fable. Reminiscent of a John Cheever story like ""The Swimmer,"" it is a surreal reflection on perception, reality and memory, whose focus shifts as the film burrows ever more deeply into subterranean territory. No matter how serious it becomes, however, ""La Moustache"" never forsakes an underlying attitude of high-style playfulness that recalls Hitchcock's cat-and-mouse romantic thrillers. This screen adaptation of a novel by Mr. Carrère, a popular French author making his directorial debut, never lets you forget your manipulation by a storyteller with the mind of a trickster.It all begins when Marc and his wife, Agnès (Emmanuelle Devos), are preparing to visit friends for dinner, and he casually asks her what she would think if he shaved off his mustache. When she replies that she likes it and can't imagine him without it, he goes ahead anyway and removes it. Shorn of facial hair, Marc is taken aback when Agnès seems not to notice the change, but he stays silent and waits for her to comment.At dinner their hosts, Agnès's ex-boyfriend Serge (Mathieu Amalric) and his Russian wife, Nadia (Macha Polikarpova), also appear oblivious to the change. Serge shares a disturbing memory of Agnès's bad behavior years earlier during a weekend in the country. She denied that behavior then and even now brusquely refuses to admit what she did.'"

"'06-05-24,'1','Fiterman Hall did not exactly overshadow the official opening of 7 World Trade Center yesterday (the sun was in the wrong position for that), but the ragged remnant of Sept. 11 offered a reminder of how much more work there is to do.With its shattered walls and missing windows, its emptied floors behind shroudlike nets, the 15-story Fiterman Hall played silent counterpoint — like the unwanted party guest that everyone notices but no one acknowledges — to the candy-apple exuberance of a plump Jeff Koons sculpture that was unveiled by Larry A. Silverstein, the developer of 7 World Trade Center, outside the building's front door on Greenwich Street.The nine-foot-high, multi-lobed, stainless-steel sculpture, ""Balloon Flower (Red),"" sits in a circular fountain in a new triangular park, about half an acre, designed by Ken Smith Landscape Architect. It is framed by planters filled with azaleas and boxwood and by small groves of sweet gum trees.Sweet gums are also intended for the World Trade Center memorial plaza, but Mr. Smith did not know this until yesterday so the choice was coincidental. ""They have a fabulous fall color,"" he explained.""Balloon Flower (Red)"" mimics on a colossal scale the twisted balloon creations that are a staple of children's parties.

"'06-05-24,'1','The move is a sign that the company is willing to experiment to reinvigorate its slowing PC sales. In the first three months of the year, Dell lost market share in the United States to companies that sell in stores.Gartner, the market research firm, said that was the first time Dell had lost market share since Gartner began tracking PC data in 1989. Dell has also been cutting prices of its PC's to increase sales.Dell's shares closed yesterday at $24.09, down 29 cents, and near the 52-week low recorded last week.Dell's direct model does have limitations. As it sells more products like big-screen TV's and notebook computers, the company is finding that customers prefer to see or handle those products before buying.Dell has felt this most acutely with notebooks; notebook sales at Hewlett-Packard, Dell's chief rival, are growing more rapidly than at Dell. Hewlett, which sells computers directly as well as through retailers, has long argued that its mixed sales channel holds an advantage because it gives its customers a chance to test products.Dell said it would open two stores this summer, the first in NorthPark Center in Dallas and the other in Palisades Center in West Nyack, N.Y. It plans to display about 36 products, including big-screen TV's and printers as well as desktop PC's and notebook computers, in about 3,000 square feet of floor space.The stores will have ordering stations, but will carry no inventory. By sticking to the build-to-order model, the company avoids the risk of stocking too much of a particular product at the stores.But the selling through the stores will be less efficient than selling online because Dell will have to pay for store staff. The company would not say how many people will be employed at each store. ""It is not clear to us how cost-effective Dell's stores might be for build-to-order,"" Ms. Shaw said in a research report issued yesterday.Dell has experimented with retail before, but has always avoided having to hire sales representatives. In the early 1990's, it sold through a number of mass merchants like Best Buy, Costco and Sam's Club, but it ended that practice in 1994, citing low profit margins on the business.Later that year, the company began opening the free-standing booths in malls. Those kiosks, which are now about 120 square feet in size, display about a dozen products. Customers place an order directly with Dell through a computer in the booth. The kiosks have been successful enough that Dell now has 160 kiosks in malls.'"
"'06-05-24,'1','The Democrats who voted against the nomination were Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Evan Bayh of Indiana. Each cited concerns about General Hayden's role in a controversial domestic surveillance program he ran while head of the National Security Agency.""I am not convinced that the nominee respects the rule of law and Congress's oversight responsibilities,"" Mr. Feingold said.During his confirmation hearings last week, General Hayden drew sharp questions from several Democrats who raised concerns about the legality of the N.S.A. program. Under the program, the agency monitors, without court warrants, the international telephone and e-mail communications of terror suspects in the United States.Committee members from both parties had also questioned whether General Hayden, as a career military officer, might be beholden to the Pentagon at a time when the Defense Department was playing a greater role in intelligence gathering overseas.Yet statements by committee members after the vote on Tuesday indicated that General Hayden had dispelled this concern.""He has shown some independence and some backbone and a willingness to say no to power,"" said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan. ""You've got to have someone in this position who speaks truth to power.""The departure of Mr. Goss, whom the White House had pressured to resign amid turf battles with John D. Negroponte, the director of national intelligence, is expected to be accompanied by considerable turnover throughout the agency's senior ranks.Mr. Goss's circle of advisers, many of whom the former Republican congressman brought with him from Capitol Hill, are expected to leave the agency. In addition, the agency's deputy director, Vice Adm. Albert M. Calland III of the Navy, is expected to take a new military assignment.Kyle Foggo, until recently the C.I.A.'s third-ranking official, has resigned as executive director amid accusations that he was involved in a government corruption scandal.Federal officials raided Mr. Foggo's home and office at the C.I.A. this month looking for evidence of ties to Brent Wilkes, a San Diego military contractor who is named as a co-conspirator in the recent indictment of former Representative Randy Cunningham, Republican of California.Another top official, the head of the National Clandestine Service, an undercover officer who formerly headed C.I.A. operations for Latin America and directed the agency's Counterterrorism Center, plans to retire this summer.Intelligence officials said that other senior members of Mr. Goss's team, including the heads of the Directorate of Intelligence and the Directorate of Science and Technology, had no immediate plans to leave the C.I.A. but that General Hayden could decide to appoint a new team upon taking over.'"
"'06-05-24,'1','The shifting lineups and the proliferation of endorsements by the top players lead some marketing experts to question the value of this kind of advertising, which does not come cheap, given the cost of signing a star as a spokesman.""There is a danger that the ads all look alike,"" said Rino Ferrari, president of Rino Publicidade, an independent ad agency in São Paulo. ""When you throw a bunch of money into something, this is always the easiest way to do it, but it's not always the best.""With its huge global audience and generous budgets, the World Cup seems like the right opportunity to showcase the world's best advertising — a sort of international version of the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl's commercials have featured memorable spots like Apple Computer's ""1984,"" in which a woman chased by guards destroyed an image of Big Brother as a way of introducing the company's Macintosh machines.But for several reasons, the World Cup tends to feature less creatively varied or daring ""event"" ads than the Super Bowl.For starters, the tournament lasts a month and includes 64 games, making a high-profile one-time spot less useful. Also, the marketing buildup typically starts as much as a year before the World Cup games kick off, so a soccer theme is needed to link a global campaign to the event.Many of the official sponsors of the World Cup — 15 brands paid up to $50 million each for the privilege — are eager to trumpet their involvement; the easiest way to do so is with soccer-related advertising, rather than an off-the-wall approach. Meanwhile, so-called ambush marketers, those that did not pony up but want to piggyback on the event, also use soccer-theme ads to do so.""It can become a bit of a parody, everybody doing the same thing,"" said Andy Fackrell, creative director at the ad agency 180 in Amsterdam, whose clients include Adidas.Still, there are ways for World Cup-related advertisers to distinguish themselves. Adidas, for instance, decided that even though it is an official sponsor, its main campaign would not mention the fact. The effect, Mr. Fackrell said, is a sort of reverse ambush, with Adidas displaying its soccer bona fides in other ways.While Pepsi's campaign features a star-studded lineup, it has also tried to mix things up. For some markets, the ad with the Bavarian dancers was digitally edited by Pepsi's ad agency, BBDO, to include local players, like Hernán Crespo in Argentina, alongside the international stars. As with much of the World Cup-related ad activity, Pepsi's campaign will not appear in the United States.Among the prominent World Cup sponsors, Coca-Cola is conspicuous by its conservative use of stars as spokesmen. While soccer players like Wayne Rooney are featured in some of its local work, the company's main World Cup campaign, developed by Wieden & Kennedy in Amsterdam with McCann Erickson and other agencies, focuses on the fans.One spot, for instance, features animated characters like a lumberjack and a cook, whose mundane tasks are enlivened by soccer broadcasts. The spot is customized for local markets via the soundtrack, with recordings of excited television commentary from memorable goals scored by the home team during previous World Cups. The lumberjack throws down his ax and hugs the tree he has been chopping; the chicken in the chef's pot comes back to life.""We all speak football,"" the spot concludes. In advertising, for the next couple of months, at least, that certainly seems to be the case.'"
"'06-05-24,'1','In the latest salvo in the clash between Brooklyn College graduate students and city officials over what art is appropriate for a public exhibition, the students plan to reopen their show tonight in a privately owned space.The relocated show will contain many of the disputed works of art, which were part of students' master's theses and originally exhibited at the Brooklyn War Memorial in Cadman Plaza. It will also include, organizers say, new works made in response to the shuttering of the original show.The show, titled Plan B, has been moved about a third of a mile from city property to 70 Washington Street, in a vacant retail space near the Manhattan Bridge, where it will remain through June 16. The artists have opened a Web site at http://planbprevails.com.The students said they planned to file a lawsuit against the city's action, which they say violates the First Amendment.Marni Kotak, one of the artists, said in an interview that several of the works were damaged during the move. ""Some of the artists,"" she said, ""are choosing to show them in the state in which they have found them.""On May 4, a day after the show opened, the Brooklyn parks commissioner, Julius Spiegel, ordered it closed because he found some of the art, which included a sculpture of a hand holding a penis, inappropriate for families. At that time, he said the show violated an agreement he said his department had reached six years ago with Brooklyn College on the use of the space.A parks department spokesman said yesterday that Mr. Spiegel was not available for comment.The new site for the exhibition has 6,000 square feet of unoccupied retail space on the ground floor of a 12-story condominium building.

"'06-05-24,'1','Jan-Michiel Hessels, the chairman of Euronext's supervisory board who would be the chairman of a combined New York Exchange and Euronext, conceded that ""the possibility of a knockout bid is one of the scenarios that we are thinking of.""Euronext, which runs the Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon exchanges, is the latest focus of consolidation after the Nasdaq — a rival of the NYSE Group — acquired 25 percent of the London Stock Exchange.On Monday, the NYSE Group made an offer that Euronext executives said was 73 to 74 euros a share, or as much as 8.3 billion euros ($10.2 billion).On Tuesday, Deutsche Börse put numbers behind its bid, which was made Friday. Deutsche Börse would pay 76.60 euros a share, or about 8.6 billion euros, according to reports.Serge Harry, the chief financial officer of Euronext, called the numbers ""misleading"" because they were based on Monday's closing prices — which are probably higher than the three-month average on which the German offer is actually based.Using prices from the most recent three-month period, Euronext officers said that the true value of the Deutsche Börse bid was closer to 70.45 euros a share — lower than the American offer.A Deutsche Börse spokesman, Walter Allwicher, said that the three-month average would be dated from the moment when both sides agree.In resisting the German offer, Mr. Théodore must tread a fine line because the two exchanges have some big shareholders in common, including the Children's Investment Fund, which owns 10 percent of Euronext and favors a merger with Deutsche Börse. The fund reiterated that position on Tuesday.Stock in the NYSE Group is currently highly valued relative to its earnings, making its shares a particularly valuable currency in any bidding war.But the German exchange might have an advantage in its ability to raise enough additional cash to convince Euronext shareholders that an all-European deal is the better move.The German exchange ""could offer more cash without harming itself, especially since it has no debt right now,"" said Robert Mazzuoli, an analyst with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz.Raising its bid might be the best way for Deutsche Börse to avoid standing on the sidelines during rapid global consolidation.""It makes no sense to overpay for a company like Euronext, but without this merger the vision for Deutsche Börse's future is gone,"" said Ulrich Hocker, president of DSW, the German association of small shareholders.In coming weeks, Mr. Théodore may succeed in bulking up Euronext by striking a deal to buy the Milan-based exchange, Borsa Italiana. He told shareholders Tuesday that he hoped to have a preliminary agreement with Borsa Italiana by the end of June.Deutsche Börse has continued efforts to make its overture more palatable, offering the chief executive's slot to Mr. Théodore until 2008.Euronext, however, is unlikely to favor even that arrangement, which would still probably put the majority of executives in Frankfurt.Deutsche Börse said Tuesday that it would sound out its own shareholders about additional moves at its annual meeting Wednesday in Frankfurt, and it stressed its continuing interest in a deal.""We continue to believe in the strong substance and value, as well as the earnings accretion of a combination of Deutsche Börse and Euronext to both shareholder groups under our proposal,"" the Deutsche Börse chief executive, Reto Francioni, said in a statement.'"
"'06-05-24,'1','LONDON, May 23 — Amnesty International on Tuesday assailed the use of military contractors by the United States to detain prisoners, provide security and gather intelligence in Iraq as ""war outsourcing,"" and said the behavior of some contractors had diminished America's moral standing.""War outsourcing is creating the corporate equivalent of Guantánamo Bay — a virtual rules-free zone in which perpetrators are not likely to be held accountable for breaking the law,"" Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in Washington after the group presented its annual report in London.In both cities, senior figures of Amnesty International — a private human rights group that has commonly focused on false imprisonment and torture — used the annual report to highlight what they called pressing concerns about the campaign against terrorism.""It is difficult to believe,"" Mr. Cox said, ""that the United States government, which once considered itself as an exemplar of human rights, has sacrificed its most fundamental principle by abusing prisoners as a matter of policy, by 'disappearing' detainees into a network of secret prisons, and by abducting and sending people for interrogation to countries that practice torture, such as Egypt, Syria and Morocco.""Responding to the report, Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman, told reporters in Washington: ""When we do return people to their home countries, we always go through a very, very careful and detailed process. And they have to be able to assure American officials and policy makers that they believe that these individuals will not be maltreated, will not be tortured.""'"

But one analyst said a relatively narrow section of Nike consumers would be interested in the running products.Using a Nike+iPod Sports Kit, expected to retail for about $29, consumers will get information on time, distance, pace and calories burned through the earphones of an iPod Nano via a sensor in the insole of special shoes that communicate with the digital music player.Nike also introduced a line of performance clothing, including jackets and shorts, that holds iPods and keeps wires untangled and out of sight.""We share the same types of consumers,"" said Trevor Edwards, Nike's vice president for global brand management. ""We know that these two brands work really well together.""John Shanley, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, said the Nike+iPod introduction was innovative but would not appeal to the company's core base of teenage boys.'"

"'06-05-24,'1','BANGALORE, India, May 23 — The world's largest chip maker, Intel, said Tuesday that it would introduce a low-cost computer in India, one of the world's fastest-growing technology markets, in an effort to gain greater market share.Intel announced the Indian computer project as part of a wider global strategy to promote the use of technology in emerging markets. The computer will have a processor, chip set and software designed by Intel and will be produced by Indian hardware makers.In a statement released during a visit to the country by Intel's chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, the company said that ""systems will be priced 20 percent less than the lowest-priced Intel-based PC's in India with similar configurations.""Mr. Otellini told reporters here that Intel intended to make personal computers more cost-effective.The cheaper PC's will be available in a couple of months and will be sold by Indian computer makers including Wipro, HCL Infosystems and Zenith Computers. Intel has linked with Icici Bank, one of India's largest lenders, to help consumers finance their computers.The cheapest computers in India now cost about 10,000 rupees, or $220. But with many rural Indians living on less than $1 a day, computers are a luxury for great numbers of people. Despite the spread of worldwide technology outsourcing in Indian cities like Bangalore, only 2 percent of people in this country have access to computers.Intel said it would introduce inexpensive notebook computers early in 2007 aimed at students and academic institutions. Mr. Otellini said those would sell for just under $400.Intel, which is under siege by rival chip makers, proposes to bridge the digital divide between the advanced and developing economies by spending $1 billion in developing markets and providing people with high-speed wireless Internet access. Among other advocates of efforts to narrow the digital divide have been Google, the M.I.T. Media Laboratory and the Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen.'"
"'06-05-24,'1','American food shoppers who seek alternatives to agribusiness have never had so much choice about how to spend their food dollars. But they are still adjusting to being pelted with information on how to eat well. In its February issue, Consumer Reports magazine assessed the relative pesticide contents of organically and conventionally grown produce, and found that for many fruits and vegetables, the difference was imperceptible. Is this reason enough to forsake expensive organic bananas and broccoli?And what if your shopping agenda has issues other than health, like saving family farms, sustainability and soil conservation?""For a long time it seemed very simple,"" said Rena Mikulski, a school administrator in Brooklyn, who was shopping for greens at the Union Square Greenmarket last Wednesday. ""Organic was good. Farmers' markets were good. Everything else was not good. Now I don't know how to choose anything. Is it local? Is it sustainable? Is it organic? Which is better? I don't know.""The hand-wringing among organic farmers that greeted Wal-Mart's announcement last week that it would begin stocking large quantities of organic produce reveals the tumultuous state of the alternative agriculture movement. In the 1960's, the movement began with far-out notions such as shortening the food chain between farmers and eaters, and entertaining the possibility that agribusiness might not have consumers' best interests at heart. At that time, both organic labeling and a national network of urban farmers' markets seemed like remote possibilities. Now that both of those have been achieved, consumers, farmers and food policy experts are at a point of soul-searching.""I do believe that the organic movement has been co-opted by big agribusiness,"" said Mike Biltonen, a fruit farmer in the Rondout Valley in New York's Catskill region. Large-scale organic farms equipped to supply huge retail clients like Wal-Mart and Whole Foods, he said, may use approved products for pest and disease control that were not designed for large-scale, continual use.""Even though they are allowed, if you're spraying copper-based fungicides on your plants, you're going to end up with heavy metals saturating your soil,"" he said. ""If you use a lot of sulfur, you're going to quickly upset the soil's ecosystem. That's not what I call sustainable.""Some American farmers, especially those who raise animals for dairy, eggs and meat, have become disenchanted enough with the system that they are choosing not to become certified as organic farmers, even if their methods meet or, often, exceed the organic standards.Warren Weber is a leading organic farmer in Marin County in California and one of the farmers who helped write the state's organic regulations 30 years ago. ""A lot of small farmers here are opting out of organic, which I find amazing,"" he said. ""Consumers fought so hard to get that labeling, and now they're just letting go."" Farmers' claims that they are ""better than organic"" are unverifiable, he said. ""Farmers are only human, and there are a lot of opportunities for shortcuts,"" he added.After the ideological and financial decisions that conscientious farmers make about how to grow crops, raise animals and manage land, come choices about getting the food to market.""Farmers' markets are not for everyone,"" said Gina Walker, a small organic grower of salad and greens in northern Columbia County. Ms. Walker said that for a small farmer, sparing staff and vehicles to send to farmers' markets is impossible. ""And the weekend is the only time I get to see my kids,"" she said. ""There's no way I'm going to leave for the city at 4 a.m. and come back at 8 at night.""Farm-to-market sounds like a beautiful relationship, but the reality includes long days and hard choices. Can a farmer make jam from her neighbor's plums, and sell that? Can she make jam from fruit trucked in from outside the region? (Many markets call this ""the no-marmalade rule."") If two farmers bring lamb shoulders the same day, who sets the price? What about cornhusk dolls and dried flowers?In California and Texas, a statewide farmers' market authority makes such decisions. Elsewhere, markets are run by a hodgepodge of local authorities, professional managers or a combination.Greenmarket, which runs most of New York City's farmers' markets, is the largest farm-to-city system in the country and is run by the nonprofit New York City Council on the Environment. Greenmarket's rules are among the strictest in the country: Farmers or farm staff must attend the market; farm marketing associations, which can be helpful to small farms that share costs, are not allowed to sell.Elsewhere in the country, and the rest of the world, markets usually include independent ""food artisans"" selling scratch products like tomato sauce, fresh pasta, home-cured olives, sausages and butter, but Greenmarket allows only bakers and market farmers to do so. Greenmarket cheeses can be made only by farmers who raise their own dairy animals. Ms. Planck's definition of ""local"" includes the entire Northeast region; Greenmarket farmers, by the rules, must live within 200 miles of the city.Ms. Planck's Real Food markets will include farmer co-ops, local artisans (people who make food from ingredients they've bought) and farmer-purveyors (farmers who sell produce grown by other farmers in the region). Market rules stipulate that if a product can be grown locally, it must be, but avocadoes and lemons, for example, can be bought.Opening June 17 in Petrosino Park (on Lafayette Street between Spring and Kenmare Streets) and at the corner of Downing and Bleecker Streets, the markets will run through Dec. 23. Greenmarket is also planning new markets downtown this summer. ""We're always happy when local farmers have more opportunities to sell what they grow,"" said Gabrielle Langholtz, Greenmarket's publicity manager.Ms. Planck says that there should be room at markets, and at the American dinner table, for any product that supports local agriculture, however indirectly. ""Instead of a food chain, I see a food web, with many points of entry,"" she said. She draws the line, however, at farmers' market crafts. ""Crafts are for tourists,"" she says. ""Markets should be for shoppers.""'"

"'06-05-25,'1','Meg Whitman, eBay's chief executive, said the company was starting to change that policy because ""we have to embrace some of the things that are happing on the Web."" Still, she said, the company will test the impact of the text ads to make sure they do not hurt its revenue.She added that the text ads would be restricted so they did not offer products that directly competed with eBay's sellers. Rather they would be for ""complementary products,"" like accessories, and they would also appear when a user searched for a product that was not available on eBay.At the same time, eBay agreed to have Yahoo sell graphical display advertising on its site, the first time Yahoo has sold graphic ads for another company.""EBay brings the best of quality inventory and a huge community,"" said Terry S. Semel, Yahoo's chief executive. ""It gives us the opportunity to do a big job.""Yahoo and eBay said the revenue from the deal would be small this year and they declined to characterize its financial impact for next year.Google, which is by far the leader in selling text ads for other Web sites, has been moving to sell graphic ads as well, and earlier this week said it would start selling video advertisements for other sites. Google's approach is to create an automated auction in which marketers enter their own advertisements and bid for placement. Yahoo, which uses such an auction for text ads, will sell the graphic ads on eBay through its traditional sales force, which negotiates rates with major marketers.EBay will also offer its customers a new version of its browser toolbar, which will encourage people to use Yahoo search and other services. At the same time, Yahoo agreed to offer eBay's Paypal service as one option for customers choosing to buy services on Yahoo's site.And the companies said they would explore developing features that would allow people to click on advertisements on either of their sites and be connected with the advertiser through either eBay's Skype voice chat service or the voice calling feature of Yahoo Messenger, a direct rival to Skype.Ms. Whitman said this deal will not scale back eBay's huge spending on advertisements on Google. Search and other advertising brings in about 40 percent of eBay's traffic.She added that she did not see the competition from search engines and free classified sites as undercutting eBay's position with consumers.""There is a lot more to running a marketplace than getting a lot of listings,"" Ms. Whitman said. ""There is trust and safety, and payments and reputation. That stands eBay in good stead.""'"
"'06-05-25,'1','Mr. Lay later said, ""I firmly believe I'm innocent of the charges against me.""In televised remarks, he said, ""We believe that God in fact is in control and indeed he does work all things for good for those who love the Lord.""For a company that once seemed so complex that almost no one could understand how it actually made its money, the cases ended up being simpler than most people envisioned. Mr. Lay, 64, and Mr. Skilling, 52, were found guilty of lying — to investors, employees and government regulators — in an effort to disguise the crumbling fortunes of their energy empire.The 12 jurors and three alternates, who all agreed to talk to about 100 reporters at a news conference following the verdict, said they were persuaded — by the volume of evidence the government presented and Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay's own appearances on the stand — that the men had perpetuated a far-reaching fraud by lying to investors and employees about Enron's performance.The panel rejected the former chief executives' insistence that no fraud occurred at Enron other than that committed by a few underlings who stole millions in secret side deals. And the jurors said they did not believe that negative press and failing market confidence combined to sink the company.""The jury has spoken and they have sent an unmistakable message to boardrooms across the country that you can't lie to shareholders, you can't put yourself in front of your employees' interests, and no matter how rich and powerful you are, you have to play by the rules,"" Sean M. Berkowitz, the director of the Justice Department's Enron Task Force, said outside the courthouse.For years, Enron's gravity-defying stock price made it a Wall Street darling and an icon of the ""New Economy"" of the 1990's. But its sudden collapse at the end of 2001 and revelation as little more than a house of cards left Enron and its crooked E as the premier public symbol of corporate ignominy.Enron's fall had a far greater impact than on just the energy industry by heightening nervousness among average investors about the transparency of American companies. ""The Enron case and all the other scandals and cases that trailed after it may have finally punctured that romance with Wall Street that has been true of American culture for awhile now,"" said Steve Fraser, a historian and author of ""Every Man a Speculator: A History of Wall Street in American Life.""At Enron, Mr. Skilling was the visionary from the world of management consulting who spearheaded the company's rapid ascent by fastening on new ways to turn commodities, like natural gas and electricity, into complex, lucrative financial instruments.Mr. Lay, the company's founder, was the public face of Enron. Known for his close ties to President Bush's family, he built Enron into a symbol of civic pride and envy here in its hometown of Houston and throughout the financial world.The verdicts are a long-awaited vindication for federal prosecutors, who had produced mixed results from their four-year investigation of wrongdoing at the company. The investigation resulted in 16 guilty pleas by Enron executives, and four convictions of Merrill Lynch bankers in a case involving the bogus sale of Nigerian barges to the Wall Street firm.Last year, however, the Supreme Court, blaming flawed jury instructions, overturned the obstruction of justice verdict that sounded the death knell for accounting firm Arthur Andersen, Enron's outside auditor.. And a jury either acquitted or failed to agree on charges in the fraud trial of former managers of Enron's failed broadband division.During the 56-day trial, defense lawyers repeatedly criticized prosecutors for bringing criminal charges against Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay, saying the government had set out to punish the company's top officers regardless of what the facts might be. The lawyers said the government was criminalizing normal business practices and accused prosecutors of pressuring key witnesses to plead guilty to crimes they did not commit.The defense lawyers also complained about a lack of access to witnesses who they contended could have corroborated their clients' versions of events. Several jurors said they would have liked to hear from more witnesses, in particular Richard A. Causey, the chief accounting officer whom neither side called in the end. ""To me, he was a missing link,"" said one juror, Douglas Baggett, adminstrative manager for a corporate legal department. ""He would have linked a lot of things together for us had he testified.""The Enron trial, more than any other, punctuates the era of corporate corruption defined by the failure of WorldCom, the telecommunications giant whose bankruptcy following revelations of $11 billion in accounting fraud even exceeded Enron's in size; the prosecution of Frank Quattrone, the technology industry banker; and executive suite scandals at Tyco, Adelphia Communications and HealthSouth.Minutes after the jurors and the judge had cleared out of the courtroom today, Mr. Lay's family members huddled around him. Elizabeth Vittor, Mr. Lay's daughter and a lawyer who had worked on his defense team, sobbed uncontrollably. Two local ministers also leaned in and hugged Mr. Lay, whose family members soon formed a circle in the courtroom, with arms over shoulders, and cried together. ""I know, I know,"" Mr. Lay said in a soothing voice to several of them, as they clutched at his suit coat.Mr. Lay was forced to remain in the courthouse for more than three hours after the verdict was announced for a hearing on securing a $5 million bond, which will come from a mix of financial pledges from his children, and to surrender his passport.Judge Lake will have broad discretion in determining the former executives' sentences. He is not known for his leniency. Two years ago he sentenced Jamie Olis, a former midlevel executive at Dynegy, to 24 years for his role in a scheme to disguise the company's finances. An appeals court last year ordered the judge to revise the sentence. A hearing is set for June 9. The guilty verdicts could have limited impact on a spate of civil cases. ""They are not the ones who are going to pay the billions of dollars in additional recoveries that we hope to obtain on top of the $7.2 billion we already have from banks in our previous settlements,"" said William S. Lerach, the lead lawyer in the largest civil case, set to go to trial in October.From the beginning, the Enron leaders' trial was not what many people expected after revelations of secret off-the-books schemes that earned a small fortune for Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, and his cadre of co-conspirators. Those transactions were used to artificially prop up the company's profits, but prosecutors never seriously attempted to prove that Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling were responsible for them.Rather than delve into whether those intricate accounting structures were legitimate, prosecutors focused almost exclusively on what they cited as the false statements Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay made to employees and outside investors.The ""lies and choices"" theme transformed the case into a test of credibility between the former chief executives and the more than half a dozen witnesses from inside Enron who testified for the government.During the trial, the government called 25 witnesses and the defense called 31, including Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay. Government witnesses, including Enron's former treasurer, Ben F. Glisan Jr., testified that the executives had sanctioned or encouraged manipulative accounting practices and then crossed the line from corporate cheerleading into outright misrepresentations of Enron's financial performance.Mr. Fastow's emotional turn on the stand offered some of the most devastating evidence against Mr. Skilling, and to a lesser extent, Mr. Lay. He said he had struck ""bear hug"" side deals with Mr. Skilling guaranteeing that his off-the-books partnerships, dubbed LJM, would not lose money in their dealings with Enron. Mr. Fastow also described how Mr. Skilling had bought into the idea of using the LJM's to gin up more earnings to meet quarterly targets.But Mr. Fastow's own admitted history of extensive crimes at Enron was brutally dissected by Mr. Petrocelli and jurors said they did not find Mr. Fastow particularly persuasive. ""Fastow was Fastow,"" said one juror, Donald Martin, shaking his head. ""We knew where he was coming from.""The jurors said they were moved, in contrast, by the testimony of Mr. Glisan. ""We kept on going back to that testimony to corroborate things,"" said another juror, Freddy Delgado, an elementary school principal. ""I think that was one of the best witnesses brought forward.""The surprise testimony of David W. Delainey, the former chief executive of a retail energy unit called Energy Services, also helped pave the way for Mr. Skilling's conviction. Mr. Delainey, who pleaded guilty to fraud, said that Mr. Skilling participated in a decision to shift some $200 million in losses from Energy Services to the more profitable wholesale energy division to avoid having to admit to investors that Energy Services was failing.On the stand, Mr. Skilling offered differing and confusing explanations for the shift. He proved evasive and sometimes forgetful, and he revealed an emotional immaturity that led some to question whether he should ever have been leading such a large company.His abrupt resignation in August 2001, after only six months as chief executive, led to a bout of heavy drinking as a depressed Mr. Skilling watched in horror as the company he helped build edged ever closer to the brink.For Mr. Lay, a key turning point came when Sherron S. Watkins, the former Enron vice president, took the stand to describe how she confronted him with concerns about Enron's accounting. Ms. Watkins said the subsequent investigation Mr. Lay ordered, done by Enron's in-house law firm, Vinson & Elkins, was intentionally limited in scope to conclude that there were no problems.Other issues plagued Mr. Lay's defense, most notably his own testiness on the stand and the sudden illness of his lead lawyer, Mr. Ramsey, a well-regarded criminal defense attorney who was forced to miss more than a month of the trial because of coronary disease that required two operations. Mr. Lay, in part because of his own strained finances, decided to carry on without Mr. Ramsey rather than seek to delay the trial and fight another day.'"
"'06-05-25,'1','""Consumers are in control, deciding how, when and where they will receive your messages,"" said Holly Mensch, marketing vice president for the Snapple brand at Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages in Rye Brook, N.Y., a unit of Cadbury Schweppes. ""It's getting harder and harder to reach people through traditional media avenues.""""So if you want to break through,"" Ms. Mensch said, ""you have to connect in a way that fits with their lifestyles, in a way they can't tune you out.""Snapple has long been active in the realm of nontraditional marketing, dating to the days when its employee-cum-spokeswoman, Wendy Kaufman (a k a Wendy the Snapple Lady), became a roving brand ambassador. Recent initiatives include the sponsorship of the Snapple Theater Center in Midtown Manhattan, at 1627 Broadway at 50th Street.Such initiatives offer marketers ""a high level of presence, but also deliver something to the consumer,"" said Jay Coleman, president at EMCI in New York, an agency that works on projects for Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages.""The concept is to weave Snapple through the fabric of WFNX,"" he added, ""in a way that fits the personality of the station and the brand.""The sponsorship was the brainchild of Mr. Coleman, who called it ""brandcasting"" and described it as ""something I've been looking to pull off for a very long time."" His inspiration, Mr. Coleman said, was a New York radio station, WAPP-FM, which introduced a format change by going commercial-free for the summer of 1982.WFNX, owned by the Phoenix Media/Communications Group, was selected for the sponsorship for several reasons, Mr. Coleman said. Its format of so-called alternative rock music is attractive to the youthful Snapple target market, he said, adding that Boston is an important market for Snapple, which already advertises on WFNX.Then, too, a marketer like Snapple with a reputation for cheeky campaigns could hardly resist an offbeat pitch for teas in the city known for the nation's most revolutionary tea party. In fact, one reason the sponsorship is timed for the start of summer is to help promote a new product line called Snapple White Tea.WFNX was also seeking a big idea for summer, said Andy Kingston, general manager at the WFNX Radio Networks division of Phoenix Media/Communications, to help publicize the doubling of the power of the station's signal after the relocation of its broadcast tower to Boston from Medford, Mass.""One of most powerful things a radio station can do is go commercial-free,"" Mr. Kingston said. ""We were approached by Jay, originally with the idea of going commercial-free for a year. Obviously, that was something we couldn't consider. But we ultimately agreed on this approach, which we found very appealing.""Mr. Kingston acknowledged that limiting the station's air time to a sole marketer was a risk because it could alienate other advertisers. ""But we talked to them about it in January, to give them plenty of lead time,"" he said, ""and told them, 'Afterward, you'll be advertising to a much larger audience.' ""Some other WFNX advertisers will take part in the Snapple sponsorship, Mr. Kingston said, like Live Nation, a concert and event promoter, which ""will give us a lot of tickets that we can give away at Snapple events.""Other media properties owned by Phoenix Media/Communications will help promote the sponsorship, he added, including The Boston Phoenix newspaper.In addition to EMCI, two other outside agencies are working on the sponsorship. One is G8wave, a division of Phoenix Media/Communications that specializes in mobile marketing.""Listeners can text-message from and get content downloads to their phones,"" said Brad Mindich, chairman of G8wave and executive vice president at Phoenix Media/Communications (and son of Stephen Mindich, chief executive.) ""It fits in with the demographic for WFNX and Snapple.""The other agency is Rainmaker Media in Westport, Conn., led by Beau Phillips, a radio programming consultant. Mr. Kingston said that Mr. Phillips would work with Max Tolkoff, the operations manager and program director of WFNX, to make sure that the on-air references to Snapple are ""nonintrusive"" and do not sound like commercials.'"
"'06-05-25,'1','Ms. Leung, meanwhile, originally faced espionage-related charges for the unauthorized possession and copying of classified materials — which prosecutors charged she had taken surreptitiously from Mr. Smith's briefcase during their visits together.But a Los Angeles judge threw out the charges last year because of prosecutorial misconduct, and Ms. Leung ultimately agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges of lying to the government and making a false tax return. Like Mr. Smith, she also received probation and a $10,000 fine.Ms. Leung was never convicted of espionage, and her lawyers, Janet I. Levine and John D. Vandevelde, took issue with many of the Justice Department's findings in a statement Wednesday, saying the espionage suspicions were ""unproven and baseless.""But the unclassified summary of the inspector general's investigation, including a review of 300,000 pages of intelligence documents, describes Ms. Leung as a ""double agent."" It found substantial evidence that she had passed sensitive and potentially damaging information to the Chinese and that the F.B.I. had missed ""many red flags.""In the 1987 episode, for instance, the F.B.I. learned Ms. Leung asked a Chinese official in San Francisco to call her from a pay phone, ""implying that she had something to tell him that she did not want others to hear,"" the review found.In 1990, the report said, the F.B.I. received information indicating that Ms. Leung had disclosed to Chinese officials the existence of a classified technical operation. And in 1991, the report said, the F.B.I. learned that Ms. Leung was using an alias to communicate with a Chinese handler.The F.B.I. said in a statement Wednesday that, in response to the Leung case, it had taken numerous steps since 2002 to bolster management of its informants and had made ""significant progress in reforming and strengthening"" the process.But the inspector general's report said the F.B.I. still needed to go further, in part by making greater use of polygraphs and limiting the time a single agent handles an informant.'"
"'06-05-25,'1','Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday named a key operative from his re-election campaign to be commissioner of the Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, a politically prominent office with the task of maintaining positive relations between City Hall and neighborhoods.The operative, Patrick J. Brennan, 30, will replace Jonathan D. Greenspun, 35, who is leaving City Hall to join Mercury Public Affairs, a public relations company with close ties to Republican politicians.Mr. Brennan, now a special assistant to the mayor and chief of staff to Kevin Sheekey, the deputy mayor for government affairs, will be paid $166,884 a year and oversee a staff of 25 and a $1.4 million budget. He now makes $144,000.Before joining Mr. Bloomberg's campaign last year, Mr. Brennan worked for 1199/S.E.I.U.

"'06-05-25,'1','""There has been this sense that it is kids clamoring for media and parents trying to hold back the tidal wave,"" said Vicky Rideout, vice president of the Kaiser Foundation. ""But what came out is that parents themselves are very enthusiastic about using media in their children's lives. Many feel like they can't make it through the day without the assistance it gives.""For most families surveyed, television is not a replacement for other activities, the study found. On a normal day, 83 percent of children read or are read to, the same percentage as those who watch TV or videos. But the increasing availability of programs aimed at young children — like BabyFirst TV, a new satellite and cable channel aimed at the under-3 set — is raising parents' comfort level with electronic media and assuaging guilt over using television as a baby sitter.Kimberly Velasco, 25, mother of three girls, 4, 3 and 18 months, and a participant in the study, has the television in her daughters' shared bedroom programmed to receive only the children's channels from her satellite television service.Ms. Velasco, a dental surgical assistant who lives in Montgomery Village, Md., said she does not let the children watch more than an hour a day. But being able to confine them safely in front of the TV when she gets in from work and is rushing to cook dinner is a huge help.She just added BabyFirst TV to the approved channels so her 18-month-old can have something more her speed. ""They do baby sign language, which is neat, and it is more mellow so she can focus on it easier.""Daniel Anderson, a professor of psychology at University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said pitches for products like BabyFirst TV and the Baby Einstein line of educational videos and DVD's have convinced parents that fixation on television is educational for young children, even though little research has been devoted to television's effect on infants and toddlers.""The notion of sustained attention for many parents is a point of pride,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""Parents absolutely believe the marketing lines for these products, when the fact is that there is no real evidence yet of learning benefits.""Ms. Beck-Wilson, an educational curriculum designer who lives in Fairfax, Va., has kept television out of her children's bedrooms. But she said that she and her husband, Hank, a stay-at-home dad, agree that if they need to do laundry, pack for a trip or tend to their newly walking toddler, their son Jack, 3, is better off watching PBS or one of his many Disney DVD's than running around unattended.""It helps with his vocabulary and with learning about morals,"" she said. ""A part of me thinks I am being lazy, and I shouldn't be doing this, but it's just easier.""Ms. Sharp, a coordinator for Head Start, who lives in Capital Heights Md., believes it is not just children's shows that can promote learning. At 6:30 every evening Taelor-Shanel watches Rachael Ray on the Food Network, often aiding dinner preparation with suggestions like, ""Mommy, use cilantro on the chicken.""When her daughter easily names foods and spices as they wind through aisles at the grocery store, Ms. Sharp said, she feels confident that television, in strictly controlled doses, is doing more help than harm.The study was based on a telephone survey of parents with children 6 months to 6 years old and eight focus groups of mothers in Columbus, Ohio; Irvine, Calif.; Denver; and Washington.Dr. Stanley Greenspan, a child psychiatrist and author of books on child development, said the results of the study are troubling.""We are moving as a society in the wrong direction when it comes to important principles of child direction and development,"" Dr. Greenspan said. ""Parents are being misguided by societal messages, and this study gives us a chance to correct these misperceptions.""Dr. Greenspan and others said that given the trend toward pushing the benefits of educational television and videos for infant and toddler development, more research needs to focus on that area. Studies have proven that educational programs like ""Sesame Street"" can aid learning for older children. But few studies have focused on developmental outcomes for children under 3.For many participants in the study's focus groups, hearing other parents echo their own more accepting views toward electronic media was a welcome respite from expert disapproval. Ms. Sharp said, ""It was good knowing it wasn't just me.""'"
"'06-05-25,'1','She said that at the time of the first of Mr. Safavian's supposedly false statements four years ago, ""nobody knew that Jack Abramoff was a crook.""The federal prosecutor, Peter R. Zeidenberg, charged that Mr. Safavian lied repeatedly to investigators beginning in 2002 when he was questioned about his invitation from Mr. Abramoff to join the golfing expedition to Scotland.The trip took place shortly after Mr. Safavian became chief of staff at the General Services Administration, which serves as the federal government's real estate manager.The prosecutor showed jurors a copy of a July 2002 e-mail message in which Mr. Safavian sought permission to go on the trip, telling an ethics officer that Mr. Abramoff ""has no business before G.S.A.""In fact, Mr. Zeidenberg said, in the weeks before the golf trip, Mr. Abramoff repeatedly pressed Mr. Safavian in e-mail messages for assistance in gathering information to help the lobbyist acquire two large parcels of government real estate, including the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue, close to the White House.""We're going to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt, relying mainly on the defendant's own words,"" Mr. Zeidenberg said. He described Mr. Safavian as a government official who ""worked first and foremost to further the interests of one particular individual — a rich and powerful lobbyist.""Ms. Van Gelder suggested to the jurors that the case would come down to a definition of the word ""business,"" and that Mr. Safavian did not consider Mr. Abramoff to be doing business with the G.S.A. in the summer of 2002, especially since neither of the government properties was on the market then and since no real estate deal with Mr. Abramoff ever took place.""This was not business,"" she said.

"'06-05-25,'1','Some now say that shutting off that deal may have been a mistake. Mr. Hohn's fund and the others ""have painted themselves into a corner,"" a banker who works with hedge funds here said.The London Stock Exchange is now worth about twice Deutsche Börse's offer last year, at £2.57 billion ($4.81 billion), and Nasdaq has purchased enough of a stake in the London market to make it tough for anyone else to take it over. If the German exchange hopes to outdo the NYSE Group's $10.2 billion offer for Euronext, Deutsche Börse will both have to win over Euronext's suspicious investors and management and dig deeper into its pockets.At the Deutsche Börse meeting on Wednesday, many shareholders revisited the recent developments, and by and large their mood was hostile toward groups like TCI and Atticus.""This intervention of these investors in 2004 and 2005 was totally unacceptable,"" said Markus Kienle, a lawyer with SdK, an organization of small shareholders.Klaus Nieding, a lawyer representing another small-shareholder group, DSW, criticized the hedge funds for having demanded a cash disbursement after they derailed the Deutsche Börse attempt to take over the London market.Deutsche Börse agreed to distribute almost $2 billion to stockholders in the forms of dividends and share buybacks. That drew down Deutsche Börse's war chest, reducing its flexibility in bidding for Euronext, Mr. Nieding said.Management ""let themselves be too scared of the hedge funds,"" said Norbert Bussmann, a retired orthodontist who was at the meeting. ""The funds shut the rest of us out.""These funds did not act alone to make changes at Deutsche Börse, of course. Big institutional investors like Fidelity and Merrill Lynch also backed the shake-up, and without their support the hedge funds would not have been able to quash the deal for the London market.If the hedge funds cannot come up with a novel solution for Deutsche Börse, this kind of support may not be as quick to come next time, analysts and academic specialists say.TCI and Atticus did not make any comments at the Deutsche Börse meeting, and some small shareholders criticized that. They also did not respond to requests for comment.The hedge funds may be breeding critics, but there is little doubt that they made money for their shareholders on their foray into Deutsche Börse. Its stock has fallen by about one-fifth in the last two weeks, though it has nearly doubled in the last year.With equity markets over all performing strongly this year until the last couple of weeks, specialists say, hedge fund investors will be picking and choosing their funds carefully.""There is still a sizable demand for hedge funds over the next year or so,"" said Andrew Clare, a finance professor at Cass Business School in London. ""But if they mess up this year, a lot of those institutional and retail investors are going to question what their role is.""'"
"'06-05-25,'1','LONDON, May 24 — A Chinese company is poised to make one of the country's largest foreign purchases, a deal worth approximately $5 billion for Millicom International Cellular, a Luxembourg-based mobile phone company with far-flung operations.The state-controlled China Mobile Communications, already the owner of the world's largest cellphone company by subscribers, is close to concluding an agreement for Millicom, which put itself on the block in January, two people involved in the negotiations said Wednesday.A deal may be announced as soon as Thursday, one of them said. The second cautioned that it might not be announced until next week. Millicom is controlled by Kinnevik Investment of Sweden.If an agreement were reached, the purchase would mark the latest in a series of telecommunications deals structured to provide well-established companies access to fast growth in new markets.Millicom has nine million customers in 16 emerging-market countries of Asia, Latin America and Africa. The combined population in the countries where it has operations is 390 million, of which only a small percentage have cellphones.'"
"'06-05-25,'1','Fox executives, citing sensitivity because of other films they are making with the comedy's principals, would speak only on condition of anonymity about the project, which was poised to be a major bet for Fox in the summer of 2007. Those other films include ""A Night at the Museum,"" with Mr. Stiller, which is just completing production, and ""Borat,"" a comedy produced by Mr. Roach and starring Sacha Baron-Cohen.The studio's caution is symptomatic of the state of comedy in contemporary Hollywood.The rise of a new network of comic stars who write, act in, direct and produce one another's projects — also including Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Steve Carrell, Will Ferrell, Jack Black as well as the directors Tom Shadyac and David Dobkin — has given them a power uncommon in the industry.Many of those stars are represented by the management team of Jimmy Miller and Eric Gold at Mosaic Media, and the agent Nick Stevens at United Talent Agency, who often work together to package movie ideas and shop screenplays for their stable of talent. The three rarely speak to the press.But what a couple of years ago was a workshop turning out low-budget, high-concept comedies that made windfall profits, — like ""Dodgeball,"" which cost $26 million and went on to make $167 million worldwide, or ""Wedding Crashers,"" directed by Mr. Dobkin, which cost about $40 million and took in $285 million worldwide — has become a far pricier business.It's not just that longtime stars like Mr. Carrey who earn $20 million a film are being kept company by Mr. Stiller, or Mr. Vaughn, whose fees now approach that range. The real problem, said executives at Fox and elsewhere, is the percentage of box office revenues that these stars now command.""At an over-$100 million budget, the talent is making $60 million before the studio can recoup its costs,"" said a senior Fox executive. ""The economics on it make no sense.""Mr. Roach and executives on the project noted that, to win the studio's green light, Mr. Roach and the stars of ""Used Guys"" had already sharply cut both their upfront fees and their expected participation in revenue. Even so, executives said, the compromise meant that the three principals would take 27 percent of the studio's gross box-office revenues.The project began with Mr. Birnbaum's screenplay, which was bought by Sony's Columbia Pictures unit in 1999. When Sony declined to make the movie, the project went to DreamWorks, where Mr. Stiller became involved, but ultimately that studio also passed. The project then went to Fox, with Mr. Roach signing on as director, working on the script with Mr. Stiller and others.They saw the movie as a multilayered comment on gender relations, and conceived of a world 150 years hence in which men make themselves obsolete ""through war and Viagra,"" as Mr. Roach put it. In that future, women rule and use cloned men for amusement. Mr. Stiller and Mr. Carrey were to play outdated models of clones, one more thoughtful, the other more exuberant.A Fox executive said the shooting budget was to be $90 million; Mr. Roach and others disputed that, saying the first full budget submitted in November was $106 million.The problems began in earnest about two months ago, when Fox began to question the $106 million budget. Mr. Roach said it was needed to make a satisfying film; one big cost involved designing and making a fleet of futuristic, egg-shaped cars.""I try to put layers of meaning, layers of expression that not everybody would think is necessary for comedy,"" said Mr. Roach, who will now receive no money for what he said was nine months of work on the project. ""Why comedies can't have as big budgets as action films is a long story, but evidently they can't. This is an expensive film by any standards, and I was reminded of that all along.""When various issues — including delays in the shooting of ""A Night at the Museum"" which required Mr. Stiller's presence — pushed the budget higher, to $112 million, Fox pressed for cuts, asking the principals to suspend their take of gross revenues until the studio would recoup its costs. Mr. Roach said he gave up two percentage points of his deal, but he could not reasonably ask the stars for further cuts.""They'd made tremendous discounts on a big-budget movie. This is not some labor-of-love thing,"" he said. ""This film is dead in our center strike zone.""At a meeting on May 8 with Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos, the Fox studio's co-chairmen, Mr. Roach recalled, he pleaded for the movie. ""I said, Please give me a chance. Let me do this, I'm in the business of making money for studios.'""But the studio chiefs were worried that the budget was still not firm, and Mr. Carrey had a looming commitment to another movie, ""Ripley's Believe It or Not."" ""It was a combination of uncertainty, a highly pressured schedule with no flexibility and a tremendous back-end payout,"" said a senior Fox executive, explaining the decision. ""It became a prescription for unhappiness.""'"
"'06-05-25,'1','The Dixie Chicks were once considered too country for country radio. They didn't take off until Ms. Maguire and Ms. Robison, who are sisters, replaced their twangy old singer with Ms. Maines, who has always seemed like a pop star. Two brilliant albums — ""Wide Open Spaces,"" from 1998, and ""Fly,"" from 1999 — made them the era's top-selling country act. When their brash (and sometimes mischievous) songs crossed over to pop radio, many country fans felt proud to see a group of their own doing so well.Country fans are loyal, but they're not low-maintenance. By the time Ms. Maines made her statement in 2003, many were already questioning the trio's commitment: would they leave their old supporters behind?For mistrustful listeners in search of an answer, Ms. Maines's comments provided one. Forget about President Bush: she had used the words ""ashamed"" and ""Texas"" in the same sentence, and she had done it on foreign soil. She meant to insult the president, but some former fans thought they heard her insulting Texans, and therefore Southerners, and therefore nonmetropolitan listeners everywhere.This interpretation may seem specious. And yet Ms. Maines and her band mates seem to be going out of their way to prove their detractors right. Instead of fighting for their old fans, the Dixie Chicks seem to be dismissing them.On ""60 Minutes"" Ms. Maguire told Steve Kroft that their concerts weren't typical country concerts. ""When I looked out in the audience, I didn't see rednecks,"" she said. (Did her lip curl slightly as she pronounced the r-word?) ""I saw a more progressive crowd.""And in a Time magazine cover story she said the group would rather have ""a smaller following of really cool people who get it,"" as opposed to ""people that have us in their five-disc changer with Reba McEntire and Toby Keith."" (It would seem Ms. McEntire got her revenge.) Perhaps there's a difference between this attitude and simple snobbery, but you can't blame country fans if they don't much feel like splitting hairs.The contract between country stars and their fans involves more than a little make-believe. Globe-trotting millionaires often pander to suburban middle-class listeners by evoking a mythical rural life. You can hear a hint of anti-Maines sentiment in ""Boondocks,"" the recent hit by the Chicks-influenced group Little Big Town: ""I feel no shame/I'm proud of where I came from/I was born and raised in the boondocks.""The Nashville establishment is not politically monolithic. The most depressing thing about this whole episode is the way the Dixie Chicks have conflated politics and culture, Bush supporters and ""rednecks."" The unintended implication is that only sophisticated city folk oppose the war in Iraq, and only ""rednecks"" support the president.Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, country music's most popular couple, made headlines — without, it seems, losing fans — when they criticized the government's handling of Hurricane Katrina at a news conference in March. Mr. McGraw blamed ""the leader of the free world"" for not holding people accountable for rebuilding the region.And even as Ms. Maines cites the famously pro-Kerry rock star Bruce Springsteen as a role model, the country channel CMT has been broadcasting an hourlong special on the making of Mr. Springsteen's most recent album, which happens to be full of protest songs. These days Mr. Springsteen might be more visible on CMT than the Dixie Chicks are.The first single from ""Taking the Long Way"" is ""Not Ready to Make Nice,"" a defiant song that hasn't, of course, found a home on country radio or CMT. (The follow-up is a gentler — but still defiant — love song, ""Everybody Knows."") And while the Dixie Chicks would love to position themselves as underdogs, the truth is that they have probably never been more beloved by the mainstream media. It's hard to complain about your musical career when you're plastered on the front of Time.The Dixie Chicks are still a joy to hear, and they'll have plenty of fans no matter what. The Nashville game is hard work; it brings out the best in some singers and frustrates others. If the Dixie Chicks don't want to play that game, that's certainly their prerogative. But they might at least acknowledge that they've been playing it for years, and reaping its rewards. And they shouldn't be too surprised if some fans jeer — angry, but also disappointed — as they walk off the court.'"

Well, duh.The news smacked of public relations spin, but regardless, the promoters of the antiwrinkle toxin Botox may be on to something. People who suffer from emotional distress yet prefer alternative means of therapy to prescription drugs — Tom Cruise, say — might readily endorse unorthodox feel-good treatments.Like fashion. Scientists have long recognized the benefits of retail therapy to one's mental well-being, describing the rush of endorphins that comes from a major purchase at Gucci. Or is that the credit card hawkers who endorse retail therapy?Anyway, some designers are now promoting fashion items with a quasi-scientific ability to brighten one's mood. Oprah Winfrey told her audience last November that she wore a Philip Stein watch that emits a signal to block electromagnetic rays, which she said gives her more energy and relieves stress.And Robert Buck, a Manhattan psychotherapist, has invented a pair of sunglasses that he insists are capable of helping you keep your emotions in check by controlling the amount of light that reaches the retina.The $67.50 glasses, available through Mr. Buck's Web site, neuviewglasses.com, include flip-up panels on the sides that can be adjusted so that more light hits the left or right eye, thus stimulating the corresponding side of the brain.

"'06-05-25,'1','After walking the first three batters, Soler surrendered a run-scoring single to Pat Burrell, but he might have escaped the inning without much more damage if second baseman Chris Woodward had not botched a potential double-play grounder. Soler settled down, allowing only five singles and striking out five through six innings before leaving for a pinch-hitter with the Mets leading, 4-3.""I asked him to have all his butterflies flying in formation,"" Willie Randolph, the Mets' manager, said later, ""but once he settled in, he seemed pretty polished for his first major league game.""Ever since Brian Bannister and John Maine were put on the disabled list and Víctor Zambrano needed surgery for a torn elbow tendon, the Mets have spent nearly three weeks searching for a No. 4 and a No. 5 starter. Lima wasted his three starts. Jeremi González has been underwhelming in two starts, but he will have another opportunity today against the Phillies.Although Randolph wouldn't commit to another start for Soler, the rookie, he seemed to have earned one 30 months after he defected from Cuba.""Alay got to Florida in a boat,"" his agent and interpreter, Joe Rosario, started to say over the telephone from a Midtown hotel yesterday before Soler's voice could be heard in the background. Rosario paused and added, ""but he doesn't want to talk about that.""Soler had a 1-0 record and a 2.75 E.R.A. in three starts for Binghamton of the Class AA Eastern League.At 6 feet 1 inch and 240 pounds, Soler resembles, at least physically, two pitchers he hoped to emulate — Roger Clemens and José Contreras, the Cuban right-hander whose 15-7 record last season helped measure the Chicago White Sox for their World Series rings after he never completely justified his four-year, $32 million contract with the Yankees.""He's built identical to Clemens,"" Rosario said of Soler. ""He's always wanted to pitch like Roger and be like Roger.""Until Contreras defected in Mexico late in 2002, he was Soler's teammate for Pinar del Sol in the Cuban League.""Alay's kept in touch with Contreras,"" Rosario said. ""He spoke with him during the World Series and José told him to be patient, things will work out. He also told him that when he gets to New York, 'to keep your head above water.' ""Over his season and a half with the Yankees, Contreras had a 15-7 record but was often hit hard by the Boston Red Sox. But for much of that time his wife, Miriam Murillo-Flores, and two children couldn't leave Cuba to join him.Soler hasn't had that heartache. His wife, Ana, and their 2-year-old son, Alain, are with him, having ""gotten out of Cuba legally,"" according to Rosario.In Cuba, Soler was a starting pitcher until an arm ailment required surgery during which, Rosario said, a screw was inserted in his elbow. When his arm healed, he pitched out of the bullpen, then resumed starting.""Alay is a big kid,"" Rosario said. ""He's a grown man with a child's heart.""Although Soler signed a reported three-year, $3.8 million contract in time for the 2005 season, what the Mets describe as ""visa problems"" prevented him from pitching for any of their minor league teams last year. Instead, he pitched in the Dominican Republic and in the Puerto Rican Winter League.""His fastball is usually in the 91-92 m.p.h. range, but he's more of a pitcher; he adds and subtracts real well,"" Randolph said before the game, referring to how Soler changed speeds. ""He's got two types of sliders, a slurve and a cutter. When his breaking stuff is on the corners, he can be pretty effective.""But for El Duque, who may start Sunday in Florida, and Alay Soler, it's audition time in the Mets' tryout camp.""Those spots are open,"" Randolph said, referring to the No. 4 and the No. 5 starters.

"'06-05-26,'1','Q. Ken Lay said he was convicted of doing what all corporations do, earnings management. As a stockholder, I am appalled that misleading the public is common practice and legal. Is earnings management to mislead investors common and legal? Is this covered in Sarbanes-Oxley?But it would be a mistake to accept at face value that Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of doing what all corporations do. Enron, and its executives, committed massive fraud that went far beyond minor earnings management. That’s why the company collapsed. For analysis, read Kurt Eichenwald’s story today, “In Enron Case, a Verdict on an Era,” and Joe Nocera’s column, “The Jurors Who Saw Through the Sideshow.”As Kurt points out, Enron unfortunately was endemic of a lot of bad – and illegal, in many cases – corporate behavior in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Too many executives at too many companies got greedy.Sarbanes-Oxley is a major step toward addressing these problems, because it addresses a variety of practices. Top corporate executives have to attest their financial statements, including their earnings, are accurate.Corporate governance and corporate behavior have improved, most experts believe, though they say that there still is a way to go. The government’s aggressive prosecution of executives at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco,Adelphia and other companies has sent a strong signal.But, as sure as I’m writing this, there will be corporate scandals in the future, and we’ll be covering them.Q. It's good to see The Times update the type of stories in the Business section. However, a few recurring features raise a few questions, chiefly""Short Cuts"" and ""Executive Pursuits."" Does a wealthy business executive really need to be told, via ""Short Cuts,"" how to get presumably expensive plantings trimmed, or how to find someone to set mousetraps? Might this column be more appropriate to the Home section? On a grander scale (""Executive Pursuits""), since when do the rich, apparently your chosen target audience, need advice on how to spend their money? How hard is it to get your face shaved or your feet pampered? Again, Thursday Styles would seem a better home.Also, in the case of Mr. Hurt's musings on the pricey, and theoretically good, life, one would assume he is paid for his columns. In his pieces about the flight school, did he pay for the sessions himself? That would make the column the equivalent of a schoolboy's ""How I spent my weekend"" essay. Or did the paper itself pay the $2950 fee? If so, how does that jibe with the announcements of staffing cuts to save money? How much reporting gets short-changed to pay for an afternoon's worth of playing pilot? The third possibility seems to be that the flight school comped him the fee, which amounts to the school writing off three grand in return for two half pages of national advertising, cheap at ten times the price. The current mantra of business reporting seems to be transparency in corporate dealings. It would be interesting to see how that applies to how stories are produced.A. Executives are people, too, and they have lives outside of work. Well, some of them do, on the weekends, anyway.That’s why we added some features that speak to business people about the way they spend their money and their leisure time. It’s also why Business Day includes stories about gadgets and personal technology on our Circuits pages on Thursdays, and why we write about the joys and travails of corporate road warriors on our Itineraries pages on Tuesdays. We think these stories often appeal to readers who aren’t executives, too.My feeling is that a good business section -- like a good business magazine -- should have a mix of stories. Judging by the positive response we have had, many of our readers agree.Harry Hurt’s column has been especially popular. When you’re sitting in an office most of the week, tethered to your desk, you can daydream about all the things you’d love to do, but don’t necessarily have time to check out yourself. Harry does it for you.As with all stories we do, we pay the expenses. No other reporting gets short-changed. We’re still sending reporters to OPEC conferences and Congressional hearings in Washington and, well, lots of places around the U.S. and the globe to cover important business issues and news.Q. Too often I read a story where the reporter has little knowledge of companies past, which can put an industry's challenges and successes into greater perspective. In the airline industry, for example, it seems that Times (and other media, too) airline reporters actually believe low cost carriers started with JetBlue. You can go back to People Express, Kiwi (both were based in Newark, so NY-area people know these carriers), Reno Air, etc. as early examples of low cost carriers. Yes, they failed, but the reasons for their failure provided the knowledge base so the JetBlues and AirTrans of the world could survive today.Is this due to reporters’ age, where they just don't know anything about past companies and therefore can't put their failures or limited successes into a context that reflects where an industry is today?A. And then there was Sir Freddie Laker, the British entrepreneur who pioneered low-cost trans-Atlantic air travel on Laker Airways in the 1970s.I couldn’t agree more that adding historical context can give readers greater understanding of what’s going on today in business. Many of our reporters are experts on the things they cover. John Markoff has been writing about technology for more than two decades, and probably has forgotten more about tech than I know. (He even has written a history of the early PC business, "" What The Dormouse Said."")Not all my reporters have been covering their beats as long as John, of course, but they are quite knowledgeable and frequently do put business news in historical perspective.Last fall, for example, as the problems of automakers deepened, Eduardo Porter reported that it isn’t the first old-line, labor-intensive industry to face hard times; his story ""Reinventing the Mill"" examined how the U.S. steel industry survived – albeit after shrinking – and what that might say about the future facing American auto companies. Micheline Maynard’s profile of General Motors’s current chief executive, “At G.M.'s Helm Or Going Under? Critics Zero In on Rick Wagoner,"" compared the company’s latest financial crisis to one in the early 1990s and reminded readers that Mr. Wagoner back then was a rising star who fashioned the strategy that helped save the company.So, we often do look to the past to add texture to today’s major business stories, though we probably should do it more often.Having said that, I’m sure you’ll agree that we don’t want to bog down every story about JetBlue with the saga of People Express and Laker, or every story about computers with the saga of the early room-sized, expensive Univac computers that would be less powerful than today’s cheapest PCs.We should inject history when it makes sense, and not when it doesn’t.Q. I enjoy using the Times Online's portfolio pages to track news on stocks I hold, and those I'm watching.Would the Times consider adding analysis/opinion of this sort to its company news feeds? Sure beats press releases. Thanks for a great product.A. Hooray! I’m glad that you’re finding the investor tools so useful and will pass on to our Webmeisters your idea on how to improve the portfolio pages.We do need to be careful when linking to “analysis” by people who may, or may not, have a hidden agenda -- like pumping up or knocking down a stock depending on what their financial interest is.But we will keep looking for ways to make the site better and more helpful.Q. How would you rate the job your paper and other media outlets have done in covering the recent spate of scandals? Is there anything you wish the media had done differently?A. The Times has a tradition of watchdog journalism that extends to our business coverage. It’s one of many things that our reporters do, but it’s an important thing.I’m probably biased, but I think The Times has done quite a good job covering corporate corruption. But of course we can always do better.In some cases we do an exceptional job, like our coverage of the accounting scandal at CA Inc., formerly named Computer Associates, the big software company on Long Island. Times business reporter Alex Berenson gets credit for initially putting the spotlight on the problem, in a story that ran way back on April 29, 2001, ""A Software Company Runs Out of Tricks; The Past May Haunt Computer Associates.""That richly detailed story noted that much of the company’s growth ""was a mirage"" because the company ""has used accounting tricks to systematically overstate its revenue and growth for years,"" according to former employees. That story led to a four-year investigation that has resulted in resulted in guilty pleas by many former executives – including the former CEO Sanjay Kumar last month; federal prosecutors actually have credited The Times story.Gretchen Morgenson was at the forefront of covering questionable practices on Wall Street during the bubble years, and won a Pulitzer Prize for beat reporting in 2002 for exposing many of the conflicts the enriched brokers and their firms while impoverishing individual investors.These are just a couple of many examples of our coverage of corporate scandals.What about Enron? Well, we all could have done better. Yes, there were some stories raising questions about its growth and its black-box accounting before the energy company began to collapse in the fall of 2001, but we wish we would have understood the depth of the problems before then. Ditto with WorldCom and Tyco, among others. But, especially from 2002 on, covering corporate corruption has been a top priority for The Times and many other publications.Of course, it’s important to note that business does lots of good in this country, making our economy one of the strongest and most innovative in the world. Still, there never seems to be a shortage of corporate scandals to cover – and you can be assured that we will keep covering them.Q. I sorely miss the daily reporting of mutual fund performance. Rather than encouraging him to jump from fund to fund, it allows the investor to gauge how different funds respond under various market conditions. This encourages investment in the best performing funds for the long term.By keeping us well informed, the paper encourages a style of investing that will build wealth for your readers over time. This is one story that no reader of the business page can resist.A. Since you sent this by e-mail, I'm figuring you have access to the Internet. And I want to make you an offer you can’t refuse: enhanced online mutual fund and stock quotes that we’ll send to you electronically.All you have to do is go to nytimes.com (hey, you’re already here!), and set up the portfolio of mutual funds and stocks you want to follow. We’ll zap the closing prices and net asset values to you by e-mail every evening. If you want, we’ll also send you midday alerts of major price moves or business news.With our online investor tools, you can also sift through stocks and mutual funds with whatever parameters you like: highest dividend yields, biggest gainers and losers, etc. There’s an easy how-to guide for first-timers and computer klutzes (like me).If you have not tapped into this yet, I really encourage trying it.So, why did we drop the daily stock and mutual fund listings, anyway? Bill Keller, the executive editor (and my boss), already answered a similar question. But as the change has made some readers – a tiny minority – quite unhappy, I’ll tackle it again.The decision was made with great difficulty, I can assure you.We realize that some people still read printed tables. But by the time you read a stock listing in a newspaper, it’s already dated, while up-to-the-minute quotes are available online at any time of day (or night, if you can’t fall asleep counting sheep).In addition to expanding our online quotes and investor tools, we designed innovative market pages in the daily paper providing loads of information. Many of you have found them useful. Finally, we still publish full financial tables on Sunday.The bottom line: In an era of tight resources, we need to focus on what most matters to most of our readers – smart, analytical stories you can’t get elsewhere (I know this is sounding like a mantra) rather than things like stock quotes that you can get anywhere.Q. Back in 2004, Mary Williams Walsh did two first-rate articles on pension funds, including a United Mine Workers fund, and a State of Maine fund, that invested in bonds with maturities matched to when the funds would need the money to pay benefits to retirees. This strategy seemed to have considerable advantages for retirees and for employers. However, the NYT does not seem to have pursued this reporting any further. My question is simple; why not?Thanks in advance for your attention.Mary Williams Walsh has done some groundbreaking work writing about the weaknesses of pensions in America, public and private. And this indeed is a huge issue of great importance to workers and employers.But Mary would be mortified to hear that anyone thinks that she has stopped writing about this issue. In fact, Mary has followed up with many, many more stories about pensions in America that go far beyond the two stories that you mention.Mary and a colleague here, Milt Freudenheim, are finalists for a Loeb business journalism award in the beat writing category for their series of stories in 2005 on “Dwindling Benefits,” looking at the declining pension and health-care benefits of Americans. Her story headlined ""How Wall Street Wrecked United's Pension"" last July 31 showed that bad investment in stocks in the market bubble years have caused problems for pension funds, whereas investing in bonds would have been less risky. In ""The Next Retirement Time Bomb"" on Dec. 11, Mary and Wilt explained that government bodies that have promised generous medical benefits to retired workers and future retirees have little idea how much this will cost, and as a result these plans are woefully underfunded.You want more? You won’t have to wait long, because she’s reporting other stories as I write.Q. In 1900, when William Randolph Hearst had designs of starting a newspaper in Chicago, so the story goes, his business manager told him ""Chicago's a tough town. We'll have to shoot our way in.""NOTE: Shooting your competition is not an option.A. That’s an easy one. All we have to do is write stories that you can’t get elsewhere. Presto – problem solved.Okay, so that’s not so easy. But I think we actually do quite a good job at that, although like every business faced with change in our competitive landscape, we have to do even better in the future.I keep an eye on cable business news, and scan business and finance Web sites, too. But I don’t see stories like Gretchen Morgenson’s in-depth examination on April 10 of the conflicts posed by consultants who help set helping set ever-higher compensation packages for the executives who pay them. Or the series of stories that Edmund Andrews has done, starting on Jan. 23, about federal legislation that has provided subsidies for energy companies to drill for oil and gas even as energy prices have soared. Or Jeff Bailey’s explanation, last Sunday, of all the reasons why this summer is likely to be a miserable one for airline passengers.None of the new Web sites have Floyd Norris, Joe Nocera, David Carr, Gretchen Morgenson, David Leonhardt and David Pogue, columnists who give fascinating insight each week about the world of business.I could go on, but you get the picture. To keep you coming back, we’ve got to give you a reason. Lots of reasons, actually. And that means telling you much more than you could have learned yesterday by scanning the Internet.We no longer can just do a good job of writing what I call “commodity” news, or news that is available many other places. It doesn’t mean that we don’t cover major breaking news, but it does mean that we have to go beyond the news in writing about it, by spinning it forward to say what it means and why. And it means that we place a higher premium on exclusive stories, like the m&a scoops that Andrew Ross Sorkin frequently reports, such as his Feb. 8 story about Univision Communications, the Spanish-language media company, considering putting itself up for sale.By the way, technology isn’t something we’re afraid of. We’re embracing it. Recently, we introduced a graphic on our new Markets page that maps what stocks are up and down in an industry, with an interactive version online. You can get stock quotes in lots of places, but we help you put them in context.We’re also at the forefront of providing the newspaper in different forms, like the new Times Reader on that we're developing with Microsoft.Oh, and we sell lots of newspapers in Chicago – and San Francisco and Miami and Dallas - and we don’t need to shoot anyone, or even twist their arms.Q.I am a business reporter and I am curious to know what led to the DealBook. What is the strategy, who are you trying to reach and what do you hope to achieve?A. DealBook is the brainchild of Andrew Ross Sorkin, our mergers-and-acquisitions reporter. And it says a lot about how newspapers are evolving, and will continue to evolve.First, it helps to know what DealBook is: Think of it as one-stop shopping. It’s an nytimes.com online collection of all the major news you need to know about important deals on Wall Street – m&a, initial public stock offerings, debt financing, legal strategies, executive job-hopping and the like. A lot of the news is from The Times, but there’s muchmore. DealBook links to interesting news from other many other publications. In some cases, we link to stories from several publications on the same topic, so readers can see everything that is written to help understand more fully what’s going on – or to get different perspectives.DealBook actually was launched way back in 2001 – the Internet’s equivalent of the early Mesozoic Era - as an email newsletter that was sent out once a day, every morning, to nytimes.com subscribers who signed up tohave it sent to them. You can still get it as a once-a-day newsletter, but a few months ago we expanded it to a blog that is now updated throughout the day with news and commentary. 24-7! A small staff works with Sorkinto produce DealBook and make it a must-read for Wall Streeters.In our business, it’s called “smart aggregation” – with the emphasis on smart – because reporters and editors at The Times who specialize in these topics are sifting through all the major news and picking out what really matters. That’s so you don’t have to, thus saving you loads of time. And as we know, time is money (make that lots of money for people in the world of finance).Blogs will become increasingly important because they enable newspapers – which generally have had mass readership – to also reach specialized audiences. That’s because many readers want 1) more depth, and more space,than we can devote to any single topic in the paper; and 2) to know more than what any one publication is reporting, because they may have a voracious appetite about everything important written on a specific subject.If we don’t do “smart aggregation” blogs, someone else will. And who better to do them than The Times, with its many expert reporters and editors in so many fields? This is an important way we can continue serving our readers, and remain a vital source of information in theInternet age.Comparing The Times to The Wall Street JournalQ. Business Day has made great strides in the past few years. I enjoy the columnists and find the global coverage useful as both an investor and a businessperson. From time to time, however, I find myself sneaking back to The Wall Street Journal. It continues to trump The Times in breaking business stories and consistently delivers reporting written with an MBA-educated audience in mind. I find that the writing in The Times is approaching this standard but is still not quite there.What is your vision for Business Day? How do you see it competing with The Wall Street Journal in terms of coverage and audience reach?A. The Wall Street Journal? I’m not sure that I’ve ever heard of it.Ahem. I know it well, of course. I worked there for quite a while before becoming business editor here at The Times a couple of years ago. And I can tell you from personal knowledge that Journal editors often found The Times very competitive on major business stories – and still do.The Journal is a fine newspaper with many good journalists. (As the saying goes, some of my best friends are Journal editors and reporters.) Actually, I’m pleased that you confess to only “sneaking back” to the Journal from time to time, because that tells me that you find much of the business coverage in The Times essential. Indeed, I think that we give them a run for their money, and then some, getting our share of big scoops in a variety of areas – mergers & acquisitions, the drug industry, autos, tax policy, media, entertainment, technology, Wall Street, to name just a few.Our mission is simple: to make sure our readers get the major business news of the day, plus – and this is really important – smart analysis and insight about what the news means, and how it affects them as executives, employees, consumers and citizens. We want to provide agenda-setting coverage that spotlights major issues, like executive compensation, the rising cost of health care, the impact of the changing social contract on worker benefits like pensions, the competitive threat posed by China and India, the effect of high energy prices on the economy, how the Internet is changing the businesses of media and entertainment companies. We want to give you stories and a perspective that you don’t always get elsewhere, whether it's in the Journal or our many other competitors. And we want to do this in a way that readers can easily grasp, rather than with a lot of jargon.We don’t write a lot of stories about incremental developments of interest to narrow slices of readers. And we don’t write – and don’t want to write – just for an MBA-educated audience, preferring instead to write for our sophisticated, broad audience. That includes corporate executives and managers, but also government policy makers in Washington and around the world, educators, union leaders, individual investors and consumers.As the French say, “Vive la difference.”And, in the end, it’s great to have a strong competitor like the Journal. That’s what makes for better products, whether you’re talking about PCs or digital cameras or airlines or Internet search engines or newspapers.'"

"'06-05-26,'1','A representative for Mr. Simons declined to comment. Calls to Mr. Pickens's company were not returned.The magic behind the money is the compensation structure of a hedge fund. Hedge funds, lightly regulated private investment pools for institutions and wealthy individuals, typically charge investors 2 percent of the money under management and a performance fee that generally starts at 20 percent of gains.The stars often make a lot more than this ""2 and 20"" compensation setup. According to Alpha's list, Mr. Simons charges a 5 percent management fee and takes 44 percent of gains; Steven A. Cohen, of SAC Capital Advisors, charges a management fee of 1 to 3 percent and 44 percent of gains; and Paul Tudor Jones II, whose Tudor Investment Corporation has never had a down year since its founding in 1980, charges 4 percent of assets under management and a 23 percent fee.They may charge such amounts because they can. ""In the end, what people want is the risk-adjusted performance,"" said Gordon C. Haave, director of the investing and consulting group at Asset Services Company, a $4 billion institutional advisory business. ""As long as the performance is up there, in the end the investors do not care about the high fees.""If there is a downside to being so rich, it is that the money is flooding in at a time when hedge fund performance, even for some of the greats, has been less than stellar over all. Six managers made the top 25 even while posting returns in the single digits.""You would think someone would be a little embarrassed taking all that money for humdrum returns,"" said John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group. ""I guess people don't get embarrassed when it comes to money.""Many of the funds have gotten so big that the management fees alone are the source of much wealth, perhaps leaving some managers without the fire to try to outdo the broad market. Institutions like pension funds and endowments, whose money is fueling a significant part of the hedge fund boom, continue to flock to these managers for their track records and name recognition.Bruce Kovner's Caxton Global Offshore fund returned 8 percent last year while his Gamut Investments, an offshore fund he runs for GAM Fund Management, returned 6.4 percent. The survey said 2005 was the third year that he had posted single-digit returns. Still, Mr. Kovner took home $400 million, according to the list. He did not return calls to his office.The average take-home pay for the 26 managers in 2005 was $363 million, a 45 percent increase over the top 25 the previous year. Median earnings surged by a third, to $205 million last year, from $153 million in 2004.Included on the list were both familiar names and new stars. Mr. Cohen of SAC Capital, who while shunning publicity has become known as an avid art collector, landed in fourth place in 2005, taking home $550 million. For the year, his various funds were up 18 percent on average. A spokesman for Mr. Cohen declined to comment.New to the list are two managers from Atticus Capital, a fund that was among the investor activists that opposed Deutsche Börse's attempted takeover of the London Stock Exchange for $2.5 billion. That campaign led to the ouster last year of the Deutsche Börse chief executive. Atticus is also a major participant in the battle for Euronext, the pan-European stock and derivatives exchange, which is being courted by the New York Stock Exchange and by Deutsche Börse.Making his debut at 14th place, Timothy Barakett made $200 million in 2005. His Atticus Global Fund was up 22 percent net of fees, while the European Fund, managed by 33-year old David Slager (No. 20 on the list with $150 million), soared 62 percent. Atticus officials did not respond to requests for comment.A fellow investor activist, Daniel Loeb of Third Point, made $150 million in 2005. According to Alpha, only 10 percent of the firm's $3.8 billion is dedicated to activism, an unexpectedly small slice considering his reputation as management's worst nightmare.A value- and event-driven manager, Mr. Loeb posted returns of 18 percent, largely from bets in energy, including a 140 percent gain on McDermott International. Mr. Loeb's spokesman declined to comment.Another debut on the list was by William F. Browder, founder and chief of Hermitage Capital Management and the largest foreign investor in the Russian stock market. He tied for 25th place by taking home $130 million.Mr. Browder, 42, grandson of Earl Browder, onetime leader of the Communist Party of the United States, has been barred from returning to post-Communist Russia since November, when immigration officials revoked his visa. The fund had $4.3 billion under management and in 2005, his flagship Hermitage Fund was up 81.5 percent.A shareholder activist, he has challenged management at Russian state giants including Gazprom and Lukoil. Mr. Browder could not be reached for comment.'"

"'06-05-26,'1','ALBANY, May 25 — In running for office, politicians routinely spend thousands of dollars on campaign mailings, yard signs and phone banks. But in New York State they can also spend campaign money on their cellphones, cars and meals.That is because New York has some of the weakest campaign finance laws in the country, according to a study released on Thursday by several watchdog groups.Thirty states have more restrictive campaign contribution laws than New York does, according to the study. With 10 days left in the legislative session, the groups are pressing lawmakers in Albany to close several loopholes in campaign finance and lobbying rules this year.While campaigns are required to file reports detailing how they spend contributions, candidates in New York typically classify the vast majority of expenses as ""other.""""Campaign finance disclosure in this state is horrible,"" said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. ""You have this money that gets spent on this nebulous category known as other. What it's really doing is subsidizing the lifestyle of elected officials who use it for luxury cars, fancy meals and trips.""'"
"'06-05-26,'1','""By adopting these new standards, all coal-fired power plants in the state would be required to use pollution-control technologies to significantly reduce their mercury emissions,"" Mr. Pataki said in a statement released by his office yesterday.But forcing eight of the state's coal-burning power plants — many of them in the western part of the state — to install effective pollution control technologies will push up the already high cost of energy in New York. (Four other coal-fired plants currently have some of these technologies.) Mr. Pataki's office estimates that installing the scrubbers, particle filters and other equipment necessary for the plants to meet the new standards would add less than a dollar a month to an average residential electricity bill.Representatives of the power industry in the state said, however, that those calculations are inaccurate and the true cost to residential and industrial consumers is likely to be far higher than a dollar a month, though they did not give their own estimate.Gavin J. Donohue, president and chief executive of the Independent Power Producers of New York said the draft mercury rules could drive energy prices up so high that New York's efforts to attract and retain industry would be hampered.He criticized the governor's proposal for not allowing the trading of pollution credits, and he said the schedule for reductions is so aggressive that it could force power companies to simply shut down a coal-fired plant rather than pay to upgrade it.""If you just go ahead and close a plant, what does this do to the grid from a reliability standpoint?"" Mr. Donohue said.Environmentalists, even those who had criticized Mr. Pataki for his reluctance to include mercury controls in a package of power plant rules adopted in 2003, welcomed yesterday's announcement.""This is the proper mechanism to regulate a neurotoxin such as mercury,"" said Jason K. Babbie, an environmental analyst with the New York Public Interest Research Group. He supports the proposed rules, but said the timetable for reductions should be accelerated and brought more in line with other states.Katherine Kennedy, director of the Northeast Energy Project for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that eight other states — including Connecticut and New Jersey — have already moved to adopt mercury controls, and several of them cut deeper and move more quickly than the rules proposed by New York. But she said attempts to control mercury emissions by even a single state are important because mercury, unlike other air pollutants, tends to settle fairly quickly, and can be most dangerous in areas not far from the power plants that release them.Mercury is contained naturally in coal, and is released into the atmosphere when the coal is burned. Some forms of mercury then fall from the sky relatively quickly and settle on water and land. Microrganisms in the water convert it to a toxin called methylmercury that is harmful to humans.Once in the water, the mercury is absorbed by small organisms and worms. It builds up as the worms are eaten by small fish, which are then eaten by larger fish, in a process known as bio-magnification. Because fish from polluted lakes can contain harmful levels of mercury, restrictions have been imposed on eating fish from most New York lakes.Supporters of the national plan for trading pollution credits believe it is an effective but less costly approach than outright limits. But Ms. Kennedy said such an approach can create hot spots that pose a grave danger to local residents.'"
"'06-05-26,'1','Buffalo is the smallest of the 24 American N.H.L. markets. Raleigh, N.C., home of the Hurricanes, is the second smallest. Edmonton, Alberta, one of six Canadian N.H.L. markets, is the smallest in the league.The playoff survival of their teams represents a be-careful-what-you-wish-for conundrum for the N.H.L. A year ago, after an entire season was wiped out by a lockout, the league faced two tasks: immediately rebuild its business model to make small-market teams more viable and competitive, while trying to generate widespread buzz and capture those loitering on fandom's fringes.It seems that the first objective was met. It might have come at the expense of the other. But N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman chooses a long-term view, believing that last year's advent of the salary cap and revenue sharing will soon blur the lines between small-market and big-market teams, as they have in the National Football League, whose all-for-one, one-for-all business model the N.H.L. tried to copy.""I think the market size is irrelevant,"" Bettman said before Buffalo beat Carolina in Game 3 Wednesday. ""The most important thing for people who have any interest in hockey is how compelling the product is on the ice, and the games have been spectacular.""The pressing issue, though, is not about engaging those who have an interest in hockey. It is engaging those who do not.""People will care,"" said Carolina General Manager Jim Rutherford, who was asked if the league could draw fans to, say, a Sabres-Oilers final series, but not dismissing his own team's chances. ""Everybody in upstate New York will care, everybody in Alberta will care. Everybody in Canada will care because it's a Canadian team. The fact of the matter is, if it's not the 'marquee teams' "" — his fingers pantomimed quotation marks — ""it doesn't mean that it's not a good series.""The follow-up question is whether the size of the audience for what little remains of the playoffs truly matters. If it does, it would seem to matter this year more than most.Once a new collective-bargaining agreement was reached last summer, the league reintroduced itself with rule changes designed to add goals and subtract whistles. It worked; goals increased by one a game, to an average of 6.1, and the faster-paced game helped produce per-game and season-long attendance records for the league. Any initial debate about the worthiness of the on-ice changes quickly melted.Some of the league's glossier teams, forced to shed payroll and talent, missed the playoffs. Most of the rest — the Rangers, Detroit Red Wings, Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars, Philadelphia Flyers and Montreal Canadiens among them — were dismissed in the first round. After the second round, all the franchises that had won the previous 14 Stanley Cups had been eliminated.The final four teams feature similar mixes of youth and speed, moxie and hot goaltending — but no transcendental stars. Carolina center Eric Staal, an emerging talent but not a household name, was the only player in the conference finals among the league's top 12 point scorers in the regular season.Three of the final four teams — Buffalo, Carolina and Anaheim — have never won a Stanley Cup and started goalies who had never played in an N.H.L. postseason until this season. Like the Oilers, they had long struggled to retain core players, who gradually became too good to be afforded in a league where, until last summer, some teams had a payroll triple that of others.""While the playing field is not level, it's an awful lot better than what the conditions were that we were under before,"" Sabres General Manager Darcy Regier said.The conference finals have provided quick proof that the N.H.L.'s best intentions have been realized. It is a victory for parity, a loss for name recognition. A good sign for the future, if not a good time for the present.""It's working as intended,"" said Jason Kay, the editor of The Hockey News, a publication based in Toronto that is regarded as a must-read for the hockey obsessed. He mulled a question about whether proof of the small-market boost outweighed the flash of, say, a Red Wings-Maple Leafs Stanley Cup finals.""I have mixed emotions; there are plusses and minuses,"" he said. ""But I think it's good for the game.""That is Bettman's belief, too, and he seems relatively unconcerned about this year's low television ratings. Playoff games have been outdrawn by poker, women's college gymnastics and the Arena Football League. Among nonsports cable shows, N.H.L. games are being crushed by ""SpongeBob SquarePants.""Hockey's ratings have been slipping for years, and have fallen harder this season, the first with NBC and OLN as broadcast partners. NBC's regular-season and postseason audiences are about half the size of those that Fox attracted 10 years ago, according to data from Nielsen Media Research. OLN, which succeeded ESPN as the league's primary United States cable partner, is a growing network.""When it comes to dealing with the structure and stability of our business, we've shown patience, and we did that so we can achieve the right result,"" Bettman said. ""And on TV I think patience is also required. But, finally, we're headed down the road in the right direction.""With mostly small, concentrated fan bases surrounding each N.H.L. team, few matchups in the final round likely would substantially lift the sport's buzz quotient.""I know I'm not supposed to say this, because from a league point of view it doesn't sound right, but the fact of the matter is, when you get to June, most of the interest is driven by your own markets,"" Rutherford said. ""That's just it. Unless Detroit or the New York Rangers get in, or maybe Colorado, and then a Canadian team, any Canadian team, that's just the way it is.""In Detroit, which markets itself as Hockeytown, the Red Wings had the N.H.L.'s best regular-season record, but were bumped in the postseason's first round. Any lingering hockey buzz there has been smothered by the postseason success of the N.B.A.'s Pistons and the surprisingly quick start of baseball's Tigers, said Gene Myers, the sports editor of The Detroit Free Press.""This is Hockeytown, but in some ways that's a misnomer,"" Myers said. ""This is really Red Wings-town.""He said that articles about the Stanley Cup finals, especially with little-known teams, might not routinely make it to the front page of the sports section of Hockeytown's largest newspaper.With financial security, the N.H.L. is back to where it has been for years, if not decades — trying to create excitement in all corners of the North American sports landscape. It will not happen in the coming weeks. If it comes at all, it will take years, and it will start at places like HSBC Arena, in cities like Buffalo.Before Game 3, outside the arena near a stable of satellite trucks, a rock band on a stage finished its set with ""I've Got Friends in Low Places,"" then the ""Cheers"" theme song, ""Where Everybody Knows Your Name."" A mob of fans in full Sabres regalia sang along. A few sucked beer through tubes attached to a fake Stanley Cup-cum-beer bong. Inside the arena's foyer, a ""Let's Go, Buffalo"" chant built to a crescendo.The party is here. Can you feel it?'"
"'06-05-26,'1','LONDON, May 25 (AP) — Raiders from Sudan have killed 118 villagers in Chad, Human Rights Watch reported Thursday, and the group expressed concern that the violence in Darfur was spreading.Survivors told Human Rights Watch, a New York-based advocacy group, that the massacre was carried out last month by the janjaweed, an Arab militia that Sudan has been accused of unleashing on African villages where Darfur rebels might find support.The Sudanese government denies backing the janjaweed but agreed to rein them in under a May 5 peace agreement. Violence, though, has increased since the government and the main rebel movement signed the accord. More than 180,000 people have died in Darfur, in western Sudan, since 2003.""Sudanese militiamen are moving further and further into Chad, and are looting and killing Chadian villagers,"" Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.The Darfur war has destabilized the region where Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic meet. Some 200,000 Darfur refugees have sought shelter in Chad.'"

"'06-05-26,'1','Or will it?So far this month, emerging markets and commodities have taken a drubbing. As it turns out, many emerging-market, commodity, small- and mid-cap and currency funds are also taking a beating. According to an HSBC Private Bank fund report for this week, many managers who reported returns for the week (and many chose not to) disclosed May returns strangely similar to the markets themselves.The Moore Emerging Markets Fund fell 5.92 percent in May through the 17th and up 8.41 percent for the year.Where are the ""alpha"" generators, those that are supposed to create performance above the market? (Market returns are called beta.) From May 1 through May 19, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.9 percent. The Chilton Opportunity International Fund, a mid-small-cap equity long-short fund, fell 4.73 percent through May 19 and 1.35 percent for the year. The Zweig-Dimenna International fund, also a long-short fund, lost 4.45 percent for the month through May 19, totaling a 4.06 percent gain for the year. The GLG European Long-Short fund fell 5.13 percent through May 19, posting a 13.70 percent gain for the year.Some hedge fund stars got hit, too: Viking Global Equities III was down 2.06 percent for the month through May 19 and Maverick Fund Ltd. Class A, run by Lee Ainslie III, was down 2.31 percent for the month through May 19.To be fair, one month of data is not an indication of how closely a fund is tied to a particular market or how that fund will perform for the year. Any number of things can happen to turn around the performance. But the question that many investors should be asking is: Am I getting alpha or beta? And if the answer is beta, why the high fees?Simply put, hedge funds that claim they are not correlated to the markets should not be correlated to the market. In bull markets, investors do not question correlation.""Long-short equity funds, in the aggregate (plenty of individual exceptions where this does not apply) are consistently long more then they are short, and get longer after the market has been going up (and vice versa),"" Clifford S. Asness, founder of AQR Capital Management, wrote in an e-mail message. ""This protects capital well in long-slow declines, but not in crashes (it's kind of like the old portfolio insurance strategy).""Some managers will shine. The business was born of investors who make big bets in turbulent times and end up making a killing. Take Paul Tudor Jones II. Since opening Tudor Investment in 1980, he has never had a down year, according to Institutional Investor's Top 25 best-paid managers list.It is stars like Mr. Jones, as well as robust markets, cheap debt and an asset management bubble, that have led thousands to follow in his wake and set up funds. A great deal of exceptional talent has gravitated to hedge funds, in search of freedom and of course, riches. But not everyone is a genius and not everyone is truly hedged.Hedge fund managers often refer to their business as the most Darwinian of industries: good returns inspire more investors and money floods in; bad returns send investors fleeing for the exits. Just don't stand too close to the tuba players.'"
"'06-05-26,'1','The rapid growth has also taken a toll on Emirati culture, seen most clearly in the numbers of Emiratis marrying outside their nationality and their borders. Divorce rates, too, have skyrocketed, to an estimated 46 percent in one study.Native Emiratis ""are 10 percent of the people here in the country,"" said Obaid Rashid al-Zahmi, director general of the Emirates' Marriage Fund, which organizes mass weddings. ""If we don't encourage these people to get married and to have children, we will disappear.""But traditional marriages here can be prohibitively expensive: $20,000 to $50,000 for a representative affair, many grooms said, what with guest lists that typically run from 1,000 to 2,000. And that does not even include a dowry and furnishing a house. (The house itself is provided by the government.) Men often end up taking out loans to cover the expenses, putting themselves in debt for years.For middle- and lower-middle-class men like Mr. Kabali, 27, who earns about $2,000 a month as a policeman, the costs of marrying a local woman can be prohibitive. To avoid the expense, many Emirati men have chosen to marry foreigners, or to postpone marriage.In response, the government some years ago introduced the all-male mass wedding, a variation on the traditional Arab custom of segregating men and women in separate rooms during a wedding. In addition, it established the Marriage Fund, which now throws in as much as $20,000 to help defray costs for men who marry Emirati women. It also capped dowries at $5,400 and offered free counseling and therapy to help couples through those difficult first years.Those who marry non-Emiratis do not qualify, nor do men who have been divorced. The grant is paid in two installments, half before the wedding and half several months later, provided the couple are still together. Since the program was started in 1992, mass weddings have proved popular, with the number of applicants increasing to 4,862 in 2004 from 3,547 in 1993. The government budgets $70 million a year for the Marriage Fund. There have been more than 70 mass weddings to date, ranging in size from 4 to 300 grooms.Yet some academic experts here, pointing to other social shifts that are undermining marriage between citizens, doubt that the mass weddings will reverse the erosion of traditional Emirati marriages.""The increasing intermarriage between national men and nonnationals is more related to the society opening up, getting more modern and more exposed,"" said Rima Sabban, a sociologist at United Arab Emirates University in Al Ain.Emirati men who travel or study abroad, for example, often marry women they meet overseas. Men have more freedom to marry outside the society, and they are discovering dating, too. And as women earn advanced degrees and enter the work force, their aspirations are shifting, and they are delaying marriage.""When women seek to get educated, they don't think of their marriage prospects and take years to study and miss on the chances of getting married,"" Ms. Sabban said. ""Usually, males in a traditional, male-dominated society prefer not to marry women who are more educated or paid more than them."" For grooms like Bader Muhammad, Hair Abdullah and Saif Muhammad, all childhood friends, the mass wedding proved a catalyst to marry. When the men saw announcements for the wedding months ago, they and three other friends collectively decided to marry, Bader Muhammad said. Their families found them brides, they completed the religious wedding ceremonies and they attended the event ready to show off to the community.""When we heard about this, we decided to take part in it together,"" Bader Muhammad said. ""All six of us grew up together and we wanted to do this together."" The men said they planned to go to Malaysia on their honeymoons — but separately, they emphasized.'"
"'06-05-26,'1','LOS ANGELES, May 25 (AP) — Ian Copeland, a rock music agent and entrepreneur who represented the Police, R.E.M., Adam Ant, the Go-Go's and other new wave acts that emerged in the 1970's and 1980's, died here on Tuesday. He was 57.The cause was melanoma, said Amy Grey, a family spokeswoman.Mr. Copeland was one of three brothers who became prominent in music. His younger brother, Stewart, was the drummer for the Police, and his older brother, Miles, founded the record label International Records Syndicate.Mr. Copeland was born in Damascus, Syria. His father, Miles Copeland Jr., was a jazz trumpeter turned Central Intelligence Agency officer.The young Mr. Copeland spent much of his childhood traveling around the Middle East. In 1967 he joined the Army and was sent to fight in Vietnam, where he earned several commendations, including a Bronze Star. He then moved to London, where his brother Miles helped him get a job as a booking agent.In the mid-1970's he moved to Macon, Ga., where he worked for an agency booking tours for several Southern rock groups, including the Charlie Daniels Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers Band.Excited by the emerging punk-rock scene, he and his brother arranged for the band Squeeze to tour small clubs in the United States to drum up support. They used the same strategy to promote many more bands, including the Police and the B-52's.'"
"'06-05-26,'1','During the Books' set at the World Financial Center Gallery on Wednesday, Paul de Jong announced that there would be one minute of meditation. The word Meditation appeared on a screen overhead, and as a recorded voice repeated the word in various inflections, anagrams flashed above: ""Time in a dot,"" ""Do it, inmate,"" ""I tamed Toni.""It was clever and well planned, a joke that didn't overplay itself. It also summed up the Books' sound-collector mentality, their fascination with repetition and permutations and their quizzical take on spirituality.The Books wrap their music around found audio and video. Mr. de Jong on cello and Nick Zammuto on guitar lean toward a pastoral minimalism, creating gently motoric patterns over a handful of chords. Although their percussion is computer-generated, and their sounds are elaborately looped and layered, onstage the core of the music was revealed as counterpoint of fingerpicked guitar and cello melody. The underlying sound was close to that of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra or, in more intricate pieces, Steve Reich.Amid the instruments the Books add sampled speech: bits of television or movie dialogue, or part of a lecture by the exuberant Zen Buddhist teacher Alan Watts.When the Books got started in 2000, they made sound and video collages; more recently, as on their album ""Lost and Safe"" (Tomlab), they have turned toward song forms with their own lyrics. Mr. Zammuto sings quiet, philosophical ruminations about how ""my mind has a mind of its own,"" or ""Most of all the world is a place where parts of wholes are described/within an overarching paradigm of clarity and accuracy.""Onstage the next layer was videos: home movies, exercise videos, travelogues, old photographs, pictures of planets. Most of the images were cozy or amusing; they revealed sources for the music's sound bites or were edited into mild slapstick. At times the videos presented a disorderly world that the steady rhythm of the music would align. More often, however, the video made the songs less enigmatic than they are through headphones, in which the Books' meditative patterns and whispered conundrums stay open-ended, drawing a listener in.'"
"'06-05-26,'1','That policy attracts an audience more random and robust than the musicians might otherwise hope to reach, especially in Manhattan. This winter the alto saxophonist Andrew D'Angelo played one show to more than 100 people, a large crowd for an avant-garde jazz show. Some of the listeners paid a suggested donation; others merely paid attention. Oren Arnon, who books the room, recently pegged its vibe: ""a combination of quality jazz and something social, which doesn't happen often enough in this city.""A similar ethos prevails at Barbès, universally acknowledged as the vanguard (Village Vanguard, even) of the new Brooklyn jazz scene. ""We tried to build a no-pressure environment for audiences and musicians,"" said Olivier Conan, who owns the bar with a fellow French expatriate and musician, Vincent Douglas. The club's success confirms the wisdom of that premise.Barbès may be the place most responsible for the perception of a Brooklyn jazz renaissance. Its cozy dimensions suit small audiences and rapt attention. And its booking describes a rough bouquet of sounds: from French musette to Brazilian forró, as well as multiple strains of jazz, from Gypsy swing to collective free improvisation.Long-term residencies, hardly a staple in Manhattan, are a prominent feature of the programming at Barbès. The violinist Jenny Scheinman usually plays on Tuesday nights, seasoning her music with flecks of jazz, classical and rustic folk. Wednesdays are devoted to an avant-garde series organized by the saxophonist Michaël Attias. (He isn't the only musician maintaining a series in the area; six blocks south, the keyboardist James Carney books Sunday nights at Bar 4, a red-lighted dive.)Last month the clarinetist and saxophonist Chris Speed started Skirl, an independent record label with the express purpose of documenting some of the experimental artists in the regular Barbès orbit. The label's next release party is scheduled for Thursday at the club.Experimentation and eclecticism are hardly limited to Park Slope. In Williamsburg they converge at Rose Live Music, a stylish lounge on Grand Street that opened just a few months ago. They come together even more explicitly during the Williamsburg Jazz Festival, which will have its fourth season in September.But nothing beats the neighborhood's leading spot, Zebulon Café Concert, which combines the flea-market chic of Barbès (the owners, Guillaume Blestel and Jef and Jocelyn Soubiran, are French) with the no-cover rule of Tea Lounge (but with one significant distinction: every artist receives a guarantee). Zebulon's programming has lately leaned markedly toward world music, but the free-jazz violinist Billy Bang has made notable appearances, as has the composer and conductor Butch Morris.Mr. Morris also helped inaugurate a more extreme outpost, the nonprofit Issue Project Room, when it relocated last June from the East Village into a silo on the Gowanus Canal. ""The industrial environment tends to inspire a rugged sort of experimentation,"" said Suzanne Fiol, the organization's director, hours before a recent premiere by the Japanese composer Shoko Nagai.Rugged experimentation of a different sort was one hallmark of the jazz scene in Brooklyn during its original heyday, from the late 1950's through the 60's. Throughout those years a cluster of African-American establishments thrived around Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue.One of them, the Blue Coronet, served as a laboratory for youngbloods like the tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter and the trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. Another was immortalized by Mr. Hubbard with a 1965 Blue Note album called ""The Night of the Cookers: Live at Club La Marchal,"" on which he locked horns with Lee Morgan in a casual but heated exchange.""Going back to 1960, there was something loosely called a Brooklyn sound,"" said Robert Myers, referring in part to that album. ""And it started with the venues, which gave the musicians license to explore new avenues onstage and not be confined by management."" Until the close of 2004 Mr. Myers operated Up Over Jazz Café, a bar on Flatbush Avenue that fulfilled a similar function for the latest generation of post-bop strivers, like the tenor saxophonist Marcus Strickland and the pianist Robert Glasper.Mr. Glasper provides an illustrative example of the current Brooklyn-Manhattan jazz symbiosis. He arrived in the city at the tail end of the 1990's, settling in Brooklyn but matriculating at the New School University in Manhattan. He quickly plugged into a circuit of jam sessions stretching from Freddy's Backroom, on Dean Street in Park Slope, to Smalls, a crucible of young talent in Greenwich Village.At Up Over Jazz he found steady work and a space to hone his craft. But after he earned the imprimatur of a Blue Note Records contract, his next career move was clear: a week at the Village Vanguard. (He concludes his second engagement there this weekend with his trio.)Mr. Glasper's example also illustrates the existence of a parallel Brooklyn jazz movement among African-Americans in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill. Self-consciously styled as a revival of Brooklyn's golden era, this scene includes institutions like Jazz 966, a series held for the last 16 years at the Fort Greene Senior Citizens Council; 651 Arts, a nonprofit concert presenting organization; and the Concord Baptist Church, which holds occasional jazz services. In April a consortium of these and other groups mounted the seventh annual Central Brooklyn Jazz Festival, with ""Jazz: A Music of the Spirit"" as its theme.The author of that theme, the trumpeter Ahmed Abdullah, was a visible presence during the festival, especially at Sista's Place, a communally owned coffeehouse and salon in Bedford-Stuyvesant. ""African-Americans have rarely owned the music's means of production,"" he said in a phone conversation. ""The music has to be in our community if it's going to grow. We've got to have an alternative to mainstream institutions.""The crowd that packed Sista's Place one rainy Saturday for a festival performance by the trumpeter Charles Tolliver made it look as if Mr. Abdullah's objective was being fulfilled. Less expectedly, his words seemed nearly as pertinent to a performance held on the same night at the Center for Improvisational Music, or CIM, a nonprofit educational effort run by the trumpeter Ralph Alessi near the northern stretch of the Gowanus Canal.It featured the alto saxophonist Tim Berne, one of the early homesteaders of the newly ascendant Brooklyn jazz community. Mr. Berne long ago claimed ownership of his music's means of production with a self-sustaining record label based in a brownstone near Flatbush Avenue. And he has spent most of his career on the alternative fringe of jazz culture, though his audience at CIM included a couple of industry veterans like Jeff Levenson, who has a working affiliation with the Blue Note, one of New York's most obvious mainstream jazz institutions.""Brooklyn is essentially an incubator, where a lot of things get messed with and hybridized,"" Mr. Levenson said later, speaking as an almost 30-year resident of the borough. ""I think an audience approaches that experience differently than the audience that comes to the Blue Note. There's a different agenda, a different motivation. We're talking works in progress, which moderates the expectation levels.""A good many Brooklyn musicians would agree with that characterization, which casts the borough's jazz scene almost in the role of a loose-and-limber Triple-A baseball team. (Higher in the pecking order than the Class A Brooklyn Cyclones, anyway.) But the idea probably wouldn't sit well with Mr. Abdullah, who sees community-based creative action as a goal in itself.Nor for different reasons would it agree with the percussionist Matt Moran, who leads Slavic Soul Party, an improviser-stocked Balkan brass band that performs on Tuesdays at Barbès, after Ms. Scheinman. ""Maybe this started out as a place where people workshop things,"" Mr. Moran said outside the club recently, between sets. ""But it's on the radar now, and you need to step up and present your work in the best possible light.""""It has really arrived as a scene,"" he continued, gathering steam. ""People are saying, 'I'm not going to step into the shininess of Manhattan, I'm going to do it in my own earthy way.' And rather than struggling in obscurity, they're finding that now it's a celebrated thing.""'"
"'06-05-26,'1','“Obviously, I’m disappointed,” Mr. Skilling said as he left the courthouse, “but that’s the way the system works.”Once jurors and the judge cleared out of the courtroom, Mr. Lay’s family members huddled around him. Elizabeth Vittor, Mr. Lay’s daughter and a lawyer who had worked on his defense team, sobbed uncontrollably. Two local ministers also leaned in and hugged Mr. Lay, whose family members soon formed a circle in the courtroom, with arms over shoulders, and cried together. “I know, I know,” Mr. Lay said in a soothing voice to several of them, as they clutched at his suit coat.After he emerged from court, Mr. Lay said, “I firmly believe I’m innocent of the charges against me.”In televised remarks he said, “We believe that God in fact is in control and indeed he does work all things for good for those who love the Lord.”For a company that once seemed so complex that almost no one could understand how it actually made its money, the cases ended up being simpler than most people envisioned. Mr. Lay, 64, and Mr. Skilling, 52, were found guilty of lying — to investors, employees and regulators — in an effort to disguise the crumbling fortunes of their energy empire.The 12 jurors and 3 alternates, who all agreed to talk to about 100 reporters at a news conference after the verdict, said they were persuaded — by the volume of evidence the government presented and by Mr. Skilling’s and Mr. Lay’s own appearances on the stand — that the men had perpetuated a far-reaching fraud by lying to investors and employees about Enron’s performance.The panel rejected the former chief executives’ insistence that no fraud occurred at Enron other than that committed by a few underlings who stole millions in secret side deals. And the jurors said they did not believe that negative press and failing market confidence combined to sink the company.For years, Enron’s gravity-defying stock price made it a Wall Street darling and an icon of the “New Economy” of the 1990’s. But its sudden collapse at the end of 2001 and revelation as little more than a house of cards left Enron, with its crooked E logo, the premier public symbol of corporate ignominy. Investors and employees lost billions when Enron shares became worthless.Enron’s fall had a far greater impact than on just the energy industry by heightening nervousness among average investors about the transparency of American companies. “The Enron case and all the other scandals and cases that trailed after it may have finally punctured that romance with Wall Street that has been true of American culture for a while now,” said Steve Fraser, a historian and author of “Every Man a Speculator: A History of Wall Street in American Life.”At Enron, Mr. Skilling was the visionary from the world of management consulting who spearheaded the company’s rapid ascent by fastening on new ways to turn commodities, like natural gas and electricity, into lucrative financial instruments.Mr. Lay, the company’s founder, was the public face of Enron. Known for his close ties to President Bush’s family, he built Enron into a symbol of civic pride and envy here in its hometown of Houston and throughout the financial world.The verdicts are a vindication for federal prosecutors, who had produced mixed results from their four-year investigation of wrongdoing at the company. The investigation resulted in 16 guilty pleas by Enron executives, and four convictions of Merrill Lynch bankers in a case involving the bogus sale of Nigerian barges to the Wall Street firm.Last year, however, the Supreme Court, blaming flawed jury instructions, overturned the obstruction-of-justice verdict that sounded the death knell for the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, Enron’s outside auditor. And a jury either acquitted or failed to agree on charges in the fraud trial of former managers of Enron’s failed broadband division.In the 56-day trial, defense lawyers repeatedly criticized prosecutors for bringing criminal charges against Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay, saying the government had set out to punish the company’s top officers regardless of what the facts might be. The lawyers said the government was criminalizing normal business practices and accused prosecutors of pressuring critical witnesses to plead guilty to crimes they did not commit.The defense lawyers also complained about a lack of access to witnesses who they contended could have corroborated their clients’ versions of events. Several jurors said they would have liked to hear from more witnesses, in particular Richard A. Causey, the chief accounting officer, whom neither side called. “To me, he was a missing link,” said a juror, Douglas Baggett, an administrative manager for a corporate legal department at Shell.The Enron trial, more than any other, punctuates the era of corporate corruption defined by the failure of WorldCom, the telecommunications giant whose bankruptcy following revelations of $11 billion in accounting fraud exceeded even Enron’s in size; the prosecution of Frank P. Quattrone, the technology industry banker; and scandals at Tyco, Adelphia and HealthSouth.Mr. Lay was forced to remain in the courthouse for more than three hours after the verdict was announced for a hearing on securing a $5 million bond, which will come from a mix of financial pledges from his children, and to surrender his passport.Judge Lake will have broad discretion in determining the former executives’ sentences.He is not known for his leniency. Two years ago he sentenced Jamie Olis, a former midlevel executive at Dynegy, an Enron competitor, to 24 years for his role in a scheme to disguise the company’s finances. An appeals court last year ordered the judge to revise the sentence. A hearing is set for June 9. The guilty verdicts could have limited impact on a spate of civil cases. “They are not the ones who are going to pay the billions of dollars in additional recoveries that we hope to obtain on top of the $7.2 billion we already have from banks in our previous settlements,” said William S. Lerach, the lead lawyer in the largest civil case, set to go to trial in October.From the beginning, the Enron leaders’ trial was not what many people expected after revelations of secret off-the-books schemes that earned a small fortune for Andrew S. Fastow, Enron’s former chief financial officer, and his cadre of co-conspirators. Some of those transactions were used by Mr. Fastow without approval by anyone to enrich himself at Enron’s expense; others were used to manipulate Enron’s financial reports with what Mr. Fastow testified was the full knowledge of his bosses.Rather than delve into those intricate structures, prosecutors focused on what they cited as the false statements Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay made to employees and outside investors.The “lies and choices” theme transformed the case into a test of credibility between the former chief executives and the more than half a dozen witnesses from inside Enron who testified for the government.During the trial, the government called 25 witnesses and the defense called 31, including Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay. Government witnesses, including the former Enron treasurer, Ben F. Glisan Jr., testified that the executives had sanctioned or encouraged manipulative accounting practices and then crossed the line from cheerleading into outright misrepresentations of financial performance.Mr. Fastow’s emotional turn on the stand offered some of the most devastating evidence against Mr. Skilling, and to a lesser extent, Mr. Lay. He said he had struck “bear hug” side deals with Mr. Skilling guaranteeing that his off-the-books partnerships, called LJM, would not lose money in their dealings with Enron. Mr. Fastow also described how Mr. Skilling had bought into using the LJM’s to bolster earnings.But Mr. Fastow’s own admitted history of extensive crimes at Enron was dissected by Mr. Petrocelli, and jurors said they did not find Mr. Fastow particularly persuasive. “Fastow was Fastow,” said a juror, Donald Martin, shaking his head. “We knew where he was coming from.”The jurors said they were moved, in contrast, by the testimony of Mr. Glisan. “We kept on going back to that testimony to corroborate things,” said one juror, Freddy Delgado, a school principal.The surprise testimony of David W. Delainey, the former chief of a retail unit called Energy Services, also helped pave the way for Mr. Skilling’s conviction. Mr. Delainey, who pleaded guilty to fraud, said that Mr. Skilling took part in a decision to shift some $200 million in losses from Energy Services to the more profitable wholesale energy division to avoid having to admit to investors that Energy Services was failing.On the stand, Mr. Skilling offered differing and confusing explanations for the shift. He proved evasive and sometimes forgetful, and he revealed a highly emotional demeanor rarely seen among the stoic class of chief executives.His resignation in August 2001, after only six months as chief executive, led to a bout of heavy drinking as a depressed Mr. Skilling watched in horror as the company he helped build edged closer to the brink.For Mr. Lay, a turning point came when Sherron S. Watkins, the former Enron vice president, took the stand to describe how she confronted him with concerns about Enron’s accounting. Ms. Watkins suggested that the subsequent investigation Mr. Lay ordered was intentionally limited in scope to conclude that there were no problems.Other issues plagued Mr. Lay’s defense, most notably his own testiness on the stand and the sudden illness of his lead lawyer, Michael W. Ramsey, a well-regarded criminal defense lawyer who was forced to miss more than a month of the trial because of coronary disease that required two operations. Mr. Lay, in part because of his own strained finances, decided to carry on without Mr. Ramsey rather than seek to delay the trial and fight another day.'"

"'06-05-27,'0','WASHINGTON, May 26 (AP) — In June 1972, when Henry Kissinger was secretary of state, he told Prime Minister Zhou Enlai of China that the United States, mired in Vietnam, probably could live with a Communist government in South Vietnam as long as it evolved peacefully, according to foreign policy papers released Friday.The discussion is included in some 28,000 pages of Kissinger-era papers published online by George Washington University at http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/. The National Security Archive released the collection, drawn from the National Archives and obtained through Freedom of Information requests.""If we can live with a Communist government in China, we ought to be able to accept it in Indochina,"" Mr. Kissinger said.He also hinted that the United States, newly courting China, would consider a nuclear response if the Soviet Union were to overrun Asia with conventional forces. At the time, the United States was playing the Communist states against each other while seeking detente with Moscow.The papers also indicate that the United States reached out to hostile Arabs three decades ago with an offer to work toward making Israel a ""small friendly country"" and with an assurance to Iraq that Washington had stopped backing Kurdish rebels.'"
"'06-05-27,'0','The torrent of negative publicity has not shown up at the box office. A record crowd is expected at Lincoln Financial Field this weekend; nearly 44,000 tickets have already been sold. That pace of ticket sales puts it more than 6,000 ahead of last year, said Lee Stevens, the tournament director. With a walk-up crowd similar to last year's, Stevens said, he expected a crowd of more than 50,000.The fans will see second-seeded Maryland play unseeded Massachusetts in the first semifinal Saturday, followed by fifth-seeded Syracuse and top-seeded Virginia. The winners will play in Monday's national title game. (Cortland State and Salisbury play in the Division III final Sunday, followed by Le Moyne and Dowling in the Division II title game.)""This weekend is very well-timed,"" Princeton Coach Bill Tierney said. ""The game has had a great, great year on the field.""The N.C.A.A. is doing all it can to ensure that the Duke story does not overtake this weekend's events on the field. On a conference call with the teams coming to Philadelphia this week, university officials were told to tell their athletes and coaches not to discuss the Duke situation. An N.C.A.A. moderator made a request along those lines to members of the news media before Friday's news conferences.The Duke men's team's season was canceled in March in the wake of the allegations, and the program's future remains uncertain. Even with the focus turning for the moment to the field, the specter surrounding the Duke program will linger here.The suspension of Duke's season cost Virginia two games on its schedule. The Blue Devils, who lost by a goal to Johns Hopkins in last season's championship game, were the top-ranked team in the preseason.But Starsia said the Duke situation helped his team keep its perspective.""I don't think anyone really noticed we were undefeated because of all the stuff happening at Duke,"" Starsia said. ""We're a small community, lacrosse. We didn't feel any pressure because if we lost a game, we realized there's a lot worse things that could happen to us.""Starsia said he had not given thought to whether, if his team won the national title, its season would have an asterisk because of the canceled games that might have given the Cavaliers their toughest competition. While Starsia took a more reserved approach to the question, Massachusetts Coach Greg Cannella was more direct about whether the Minutemen's first Final Four deserved an asterisk because the Blue Devils were not in the field.""Are you kidding?"" he said. ""No. No. No.""The Minutemen (12-4) are one of the weekend's compelling storylines, having reached the Final Four for the first time in 17 postseason appearances. Syracuse (10-4) has won nine straight after starting the year 1-4. The Orange have returned to the Final Four after missing it last year, snapping a 22-year streak of Final Four appearances. Maryland is in its 18th Final Four, but has not won a title since 1975.And, for a weekend at least, those around the sport say they hope such on-field successes will be the prominent lacrosse stories in the news.""I think everyone is really looking forward to getting back to the sport and away from the sensationalist cable news image of the sport,"" said Bob Carpenter, publisher of the magazine Inside Lacrosse. ""People want to see the goals and fast breaks and be out in the sun having a good time.""'"
"'06-05-27,'0','""I find it painful to pay for gasoline, as I am sure everyone else does, but gas prices didn't occur to me as I was planning a road trip for the weekend,"" said Whitney Radia, 28, an advertising account executive in West Hollywood, Calif. ""It concerns me but it hasn't changed my lifestyle that much.""Of course, the difference with previous years is the higher price drivers are paying for gasoline. It now averages $2.88 a gallon nationwide, a 75-cent jump from last year, according to the Energy Department. Despite the extra cost, Americans are expected to make only minor changes in their driving habits this summer.But those changes moderate the growth in demand and may help prevent gasoline prices from rising more than they normally do in the summer.""So far, $3 a gallon is old hat,"" said Jan Stuart, an energy economist at UBS in New York. ""The question is, What kind of price levels do you need for people to stay at home?""This is not to say that Americans are immune to changes in energy prices, whose effects are slowly spreading through the economy. Lower-income households, which devote a higher share of domestic spending to energy, are feeling the pain, certainly, much more than higher-income families.Higher energy prices have eaten into incomes, wiping out almost a third of last year's total wage increases, according to a new report by the United States Conference of Mayors and Global Insights. In 2005, energy expenditures accounted for 5.9 percent of consumer spending — up 20 percent from 2004, the report said. Households spent $287 billion for gasoline and $225 billion on other energy expenses, or 9 percent of all wages and salaries.The Energy Information Administration of the Energy Department, in a recent report, said a lasting increase of 10 percent in the price of crude oil would lead to a 0.4 percent drop in domestic petroleum consumption over two years. While that may not seem like much for a nation that consumes more than 20.5 million barrels of oil a day, it can add up.""The high-price environment of the last few years had caused some analysts to conclude that high energy prices are an intractable fixture and that energy demand is somehow immune to the impacts of higher prices,"" Adam E. Sieminski, the global oil strategist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a recent report.""The E.I.A. simulations suggest this is not the case but also point out, correctly, that time lags can delay the effects of price changes,"" he said.While the number of miles driven each year has grown 2 percent a year over the last five years, the rate of growth has been just 1 percent in the first quarter this year, according to the agency. ""We expect the lower growth to continue with the higher prices,"" said Tancred Lidderdale, a senior economist at the Energy Information Administration.Gasoline prices rose to record highs this spring on the back of a big increase in oil prices. After reaching a high of $75.17 a barrel in April, crude oil remains around $70 a barrel because of concerns over the security of supplies around the world.Gas prices are directly affected by oil's movements. A general rule is that a $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil adds nearly 25 cents to the price of gas at the pump.""Prices are too high; it's taking a chunk out of my budget,"" said Jerry Davis, a 30-year-old product engineer from Chicago. He has decided for the second consecutive year not to drive on the holiday because of gasoline prices.""Any little blip sends oil futures though the roof; any storm scares the market,"" Mr. Davis said. ""If something happens in Africa or the Middle East, it seems like immediately prices jump. It's ridiculous, don't you think? I'd hate to be somewhere this weekend and something like this happens.""The Energy Department anticipates that gasoline will fall somewhat from its current highs, although the average price is expected to remain above $2.65 a gallon nationwide through the summer.Some energy analysts are not so sure. They warn that the average price of gasoline may rise above $3 a gallon again if there is a supply disruption like Hurricane Katrina last year or this year's unrest in Nigeria.A third of all leisure travel takes place in the summer. This season, Americans will take 326 million trips, according to the Travel Industry Association, essentially the same as last year. The trade group expects Americans to spend $1,000 on each trip, but travelers are expected to save money on hotels, food and dining to make up for the higher gasoline expense.For an 800-mile round trip, the average during the summer, the extra cost of paying a dollar more a gallon at the pump adds up to $40 for a vehicle that gets 20 miles a gallon.""People are not going to cancel their trips, but what they might do is modify them,"" said Cathy Keefe, a spokeswoman for the Travel Industry Association. ""Instead of taking three or four trips over the summer, people will look for ways to save money, such as staying closer to home.""Some towns are trying to lure travelers with special discounts. For example, Costa Mesa, Calif., 40 miles south of Los Angeles in Orange County, is promising a $30 check to help pay for gas and an additional $30 a day in rebates for visitors who spend a minimum of two nights in town.""We're facing a new threshold and that's $4 a gallon,"" said Mr. Reed of Edmunds.com. ""It's going to be interesting to see at what point will people start making substantial changes.""'"
"'06-05-27,'0','But others who know her well say she is resisting on the ground that signaling a willingness to talk would show weakness and disrupt the delicate negotiations with Europe. Ms. Rice is also said to fear that the administration might end up making too many concessions to Iran.Administration officials said President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld have opposed direct talks, even through informal back channels. As a result, many European officials say they doubt that a decision to talk is likely soon.The prospect of direct talks between the United States and Iran is so politically delicate within the Bush administration that the officials who described the emerging debate would discuss it only after being granted anonymity.Those officials included representatives of several European countries, as well as Americans who said they had discussed the issue recently with people inside the Bush administration. Some of the officials made clear that they favored direct talks between the United States and Iran.State Department officials refused to talk about the issue, even anonymously. But over the last week, administration spokesmen have been careful not to rule out talks.Discussion about possible American contacts with Iran has been fueled not simply by the Europeans, but by a growing chorus of outsiders with ties to the administration who have spoken out in favor of talks.Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in a recent column in The Washington Post, raised the possibility that the recent rambling letter from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to President Bush — dismissed by Ms. Rice as an offensive tirade— could be seen as an opportunity to open contacts.Both Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former top aide to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, and Richard L. Armitage, the former deputy secretary of state under Mr. Powell, have also advocated talks with Iran.""Diplomacy is much more than just talking to your friends,"" Mr. Armitage said in a telephone interview. ""You've got to talk to people who aren't our friends, and even people you dislike. Some people in the administration think that diplomacy is a sign of weakness. In fact, it can show that you're strong.""Mr. Armitage held the last high-level discussions with Iran, after the Bam earthquake. In November 2004, Mr. Powell sat next to the Iranian foreign minister at a dinner during a conference in Egypt on Iraq, but he said they engaged only in small talk.The United States has stayed out of the talks with Iran, which began in late 2004 and got new life last summer when, with American endorsement, the Europeans offered to help Iran integrate politically and economically with the West if it ended its nuclear ambitions.Also on the table were unspecified security guarantees suggesting that Iran would not have to worry about outside efforts to topple the government.The Europeans are now working with the United States, Russia and China on a revised package of economic, political and nuclear energy incentives if Iran ended its nuclear enrichment activities. Also being sought, at least by the Europeans and the United States, is an agreement to take Iran to the United Nations Security Council if it continues to defy the demands for compliance on nuclear issues.European officials say the discussions about possible American-Iranian contacts are not part of these talks, but would be a way to improve the atmosphere with Iran.Among the European diplomats who have urged Ms. Rice to consider direct contacts with Iran are Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, raised the issue with President Bush when she visited Washington earlier this year.""What's interesting about Rice is that she listens when you make your case,"" a European official said.Another European diplomat said, ""It's a European aspiration for talks to happen,"" but added, ""Nothing is likely at the moment."" Still another European diplomat said of the Americans that ""everyone and their brother has been telling them to do it.""One reason senior administration officials do not like the idea of talking with Iran, many of them say, is that they are not certain Iranian leaders would respond positively. A rebuff from Iran, even to a back-channel query, is to be avoided at all costs, various officials agree.The administration, for example, has been embarrassed by the on-again, off-again possibility of talks with Iran on Iraq, which were authorized by Ms. Rice late last year.The concern, some say, is that talking to Iran only about Iraq will anger Sunni dissidents in Iraq, reinforcing the Sunni-led insurgency while enhancing the status of Iraqi Shiites, whose strong ties to Iran make Washington uneasy.On the other hand, the American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, was said to be eager to enlist Iran in helping to deal with Iranian-backed Shiite militias, which are accused of carrying out killings and kidnappings of Sunnis in Iraq.Some Europeans favor American participation in the European-Iranian talks, at least down the road. Others raise the possibility of informal contacts through nongovernmental organizations or policy institutes.Incentives and possible sanctions against Iran are to be the focus of negotiations between the United States and the European nations in coming days and weeks.The United States is resisting the Europeans' desire to increase economic incentives for Iran, because that would involve a lifting of American sanctions on European businesses that helped Iran. At the same time, Russia and China are resisting the idea of seeking a new resolution at the United Nations Security Council that could be seen as clearing the way for sanctions or possible military action against Iran.'"
"'06-05-27,'0','WASHINGTON, May 26 (AP) — Senator Charles E. Schumer, upset with barriers American banks face in China, blocked Senate action on Friday on the nomination of Susan Schwab to be President Bush's top trade negotiator.Mr. Bush nominated Ms. Schwab to succeed Rob Portman as United States trade representative after Mr. Portman was tapped to be the White House budget director.The administration had hoped Ms. Schwab would win confirmation before lawmakers left for a week-long Memorial Day recess.But Senator Schumer, Democrat of New York, blocked that effort.He said he would not allow a vote to occur until he had received answers from Ms. Schwab over how the administration planned to get China to remove barriers that limit the ability of United States and other foreign financial service firms to do business in China.Administration officials said that Ms. Schwab would reply to questions posed by Mr. Schumer and Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, and that it was hoped a vote could be held when the Senate returns the week of June 5.'"
"'06-05-27,'0','Scientists have been hoping to create such vaccines against cancer and AIDS, but without much success.""It's a breakthrough in that it's the first vaccine that is actually designed to keep an infection in check,"" said Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center at Emory University, who has consulted for Merck.Zostavax is also the first vaccine in 30 years that is intended exclusively for older people, and it comes in the midst of a minor surge in nonpediatric vaccines.Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved Menactra, a vaccine to prevent meningococcal meningitis. Menactra is generally given to teenagers. And Merck is expected to gain approval next month for a cervical cancer vaccine that is likely to become popular among teenagers and young adults.The herpes zoster virus normally lives neutered and imprisoned in nerve cells buried near the spine. During a shingles outbreak, the body's prison guards — crucial parts of the immune system called lymphocytes — become weakened and allow the virus to escape. The result is a painful itch that usually starts at the spine and travels across the midsection on one side of the body. This pain is often followed by a belt of blisters.Outbreaks can recur, and the virus can significantly damage nerve cells and lead to pain that can endure for months or years. Zostavax primes again the body's defenses against the virus.There are an estimated one million new cases of shingles in the United States each year, and the risk of contracting the disease ranges from 10 percent to 30 percent over a lifetime. For those over 85, the risk hovers around 50 percent. The incidence of the disease has gradually increased for decades, perhaps because of longer lives.About half of all cases occur in those over 60, but younger people with immune problems, AIDS or cancer also have a higher risk.To prove Zostavax effective, Merck sponsored a trial in 38,546 people over 60 who had never had shingles. Half got the vaccine, and half received a placebo. After three years, those who did not receive Zostavax suffered twice as many shingles cases as those who did.Perhaps just as important, those who received the vaccine and then developed shingles generally experienced less pain than those who received placebos.""The best way to treat chronic pain is to prevent it,"" said Dr. Anne Louise Oaklander, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, who described the vaccine as a landmark. ""Shingles is the most common neurological disease in the country.""Merck will charge $152.50 for the vaccine, which is administered with a single injection. Doctors will probably charge more.Merck expects to begin shipping the vaccine ""soon,"" the company said in a news release. But its adoption may be slow, because doctors must store the vaccine in freezers, and many geriatricians do not have freezers in their offices.Catherine Arnold, a senior research analyst at Credit Suisse, an investment bank, estimated that Zostavax would generate $1 billion in sales for Merck by 2010.""But I could be biased,"" said Ms. Arnold, who suffered a painful case of shingles that began in September 2004 and has only recently subsided. The pain was so intense that she underwent a spinal injection of steroids and ended up taking a collection of other drugs orally.""It was my constant foe for almost two years,"" she said. ""I can imagine being over 60, and being in less-good health, and being really miserable.""Since Zostavax uses the same medicine as the pediatric chickenpox vaccine, it is expected to be extremely safe, Dr. Oaklander said. In tests, the vaccine caused some tenderness at the injection site and a slight increase in headaches. It is not expected to be of use in treating a shingles attack.'"
"'06-05-27,'0','James B. McClatchy, the patriarch of a prominent newspaper family, died yesterday at his home in Carmichael, Calif.The McClatchy Company, which was founded by his great-grandfather, said the cause was complications from an infection after a recent operation. He was 85.A lifelong resident of Central Valley in California, Mr. McClatchy grew up in Fresno and started working as a copy boy at age 19 for The Fresno Bee, which was started by his father.In 1947, at age 27, Mr. McClatchy became a general assignment and education reporter at The Sacramento Bee, which was founded by his great-grandfather. At The Bee, his byline was found on articles about the oppressive working conditions for migrant farmers in the valley, military operations in the Pacific in the late 1940's, and on a series explaining the initiative to make Hawaii a state.Mr. McClatchy eventually moved to the business side, at one point owning and operating several small newspapers in California that were not part of the McClatchy Company. In 1980, he returned to the family business and became chairman. In 1987, he was appointed publisher of McClatchy Newspapers, overseeing corporate planning and acquisitions.'"
"'06-05-27,'0','WASHINGTON, May 26 — The Senate confirmed R. David Paulison on Friday as director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a day after he assured lawmakers that tax-return errors found during the confirmation process would be quickly remedied.The confirmation, by unanimous consent, came on a day when the Senate, in advance of a weeklong recess, moved to fill a number of other positions as well, including those of interior secretary, federal appeals court judge and director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.Mr. Paulison, 59, a former chief of the Miami-Dade Fire and Rescue Department who heads the United States Fire Administration, has been serving as acting FEMA director since replacing Michael D. Brown in September.While his nomination was under review, Senate staff members found that in recent years he had taken improper tax deductions concerning travel between Florida and Washington.In a letter Thursday to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Paulison said that the ""previous advice I have received on state filing requirements and eligible federal deductions was in error"" and that he would promptly pay any related delinquent taxes, penalties and interest. An official of the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA's parent, said the federal taxes amounted to less than $10,000.'"
"'06-05-27,'0','The French move not only makes commercial sense. It makes linguistic sense. The French were already calling their tournament ""la quinzaine,"" a French expression that has come to mean two weeks. The trouble is, it translates as ""15 days."" Now, Roland Garros is a true quinzaine, one that will stage the first round over three days instead of two.That will mean an extra bit of rest during the tournament for some of the top players, who are often in need of repose as the most physically demanding major reaches a climax. Yet despite the change in the schedule and the change in Friday's draw, which was electronic instead of manual this year, it is unclear how much will change on the crushed red brick.On current form, it would be no surprise to see last year's singles champions Rafael Nadal and Justine Henin-Hardenne turn into this year's singles champions.Nadal, who turns 20 next Saturday, will set an Open-era record if he wins his 54th consecutive clay-court match by beating the unseeded Swede Robin Soderling in his first round.""I'm going to try my best,"" Nadal said. ""Not for the record. For Roland Garros.""Other seeded men have tougher opening hurdles: none tougher than No. 9 Fernando Gonzalez, the huge-hitting Chilean who faces the struggling but still dangerous Marat Safin. No. 3 David Nalbandian plays the promising Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka, and No. 5 Andy Roddick, the American who is uncertain to play after spraining two ligaments in his left ankle in Dusseldorf, is to face another tough clay-courter, Alberto Martin of Spain.No. 8 James Blake has a high-profile opponent in Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand, but Srichaphan, like many an American these days, has traditionally struggled on clay. No. 17 Robby Ginepri, who has struggled on all surfaces this year, faces Alberto Montanes of Spain.Although Henin-Hardenne is seeded just fifth, she remains the most accomplished woman in the world on clay, a surface on which she moves beautifully and which allows her the split-second extra to bring her wide variety of shots into play.Yet she is hardly an overwhelming favorite. She remains injury prone, and though she sagely limited her play this spring to conserve her resources, she was beaten twice: first by the streaky Swiss left-hander Patty Schnyder in the semifinals in Charleston, S.C., and then by Nadia Petrova in a fine three-set final in Berlin.Henin-Hardenne had already beaten Petrova in three sets on clay in the quarterfinals of the Fed Cup in Belgium. If there is a rematch here, it will also come in the quarterfinals.Petrova, seeded third, has been the surprise of the season. Clearly talented but mentally fragile, the square-shouldered Russian has consistently failed to seize opportunities in major tournaments, but she has won four Sony Ericsson WTA Tour events this year, three of them on clay. Now comes Roland Garros, where she reached the semifinals in 2003 and 2005.""I think it's clear that Nadia and Justine are a bit in front of everyone else on clay,"" said Amelie Mauresmo, the No. 1 seed from France. ""But after that, it's very open.""It could have become even more open if Mauresmo had injured herself on Friday when her chair collapsed as she sat down for her news conference.But she recovered her balance beautifully and also laughed hysterically — maybe she is looser this year — and the only French star who had to withdraw turned out to be last year's finalist Mary Pierce.Pierce, so resurgent in 2005, has not played a tournament since February because of a chronic foot injury, and though she came to Paris feeling optimistic, her foot and an inflamed groin muscle forced her to extend her long layoff.Her withdrawal allowed Svetlana Kuznetsova, another Russian in dangerous form, to move into the top eight seeds. She is now in Mauresmo's half of the draw along with Maria Sharapova, Venus Williams, Francesca Schiavone, Nicole Vaidisova and Dinara Safina, who is Safin's younger sister and made an unexpected run to the final in Rome.Williams, seeded 11th, has shown signs of vitality this spring and has an accommodating early draw, which could eventually lead to a fourth-round match with Mauresmo. Martina Hingis, the comeback artist who won in Rome, is in the other half of the draw with Henin-Hardenne, Petrova, Kim Clijsters, Elena Dementieva and former French Open champion Anastasia Myskina, who has fallen out of the top 10.The 12th-seed Hingis, who faces the American veteran Lisa Raymond in the first round, appears to have a relatively smooth path to the round of 16, where, if seedings hold, she would face Dementieva.""I always thought she was an extraordinary player, and I think she's proved it one more time,"" Dementieva said. ""She came back with such a great performance, especially winning in Rome. I think that was really unbelievable.""It is also remains difficult to believe that this is the only Grand Slam tournament Hingis has not won in light of the fact that clay is the surface best suited to her tactical gifts. It remains to be seen whether her three-year break has changed her luck as much as the years have changed Roland Garros.'"
"'06-05-27,'0','They also said many residents of buildings have been able to remain in their buildings without paying high rents. Buildings built before 1974 fall under the rent stabilization system, and tenants in other buildings get federal Section 8 vouchers, which cover the gap between the rent they can afford and the market rate.""That's not to say this is not an issue, that we shouldn't do more,"" Shaun Donovan, commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said of the reports. ""But I think they're overstating what the impact is.""According to city figures, there are about 250,000 units of government-assisted housing in the city, developed through low-income housing tax credits, the Mitchell-Lama program and various federal subsidy programs. Under Mitchell-Lama and similar programs, in return for the government aid, building owners were required to keep rents affordable to low- and moderate-income people for a time, often 20 years, before they could leave the programs.In recent years, more buildings have become eligible to withdraw. The strength of the real estate market has created new incentives to pull out. The Bloomberg administration, with some success, has developed programs to encourage owners to stay, but attrition has continued.""Since 2004, the number has skyrocketed,"" said William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller, citing his office's study of losses of units from the Mitchell-Lama program and the similar Limited Dividend housing program. ""In 2004, what we had talked about was an impending crisis in affordable housing. Today, that crisis is here.""The Community Service Society study looked at losses not only from the Mitchell-Lama program, but also from two federal mortgage-interest subsidy programs and the project-based Section 8 rent subsidy program. The study found that 23 percent of 120,917 apartments were lost from 1990 to 2005, including 5,518 in 2005 alone. Another 13 percent are imminently at risk, it said.Attrition has been heaviest among Mitchell-Lama apartments, Mr. Waters said. Just 1,111 Mitchell-Lama apartments with a federal subsidy had been lost through 2002; by early this year, that number had risen to 9,528. Among those without a federal subsidy, 12,755, or 53 percent of all units, were lost from 1990 to 2005.The number lost from the project-based Section 8 program rose to 5,478 in late 2005 from 3,363 in 2002.The comptroller's office found that 28 Mitchell-Lama developments and one Limited Dividend development, totaling 13,000 units, have begun withdrawing. It predicted that if they withdraw, the city will have lost 49,000 units, or 33 percent of all units built under those two programs.The comptroller's office calculated that the city had financed the creation of 12,229 low and moderate-income units in the period since 2002, a period in which the study said 12,943 Mitchell-Lama units were lost. But city officials said they have financed the preservation and creation of over 56,000 low- and middle-income units since 2002.Mr. Waters said he did not think that the losses have outweighed the gains in lower-priced housing yet but they could do so in the future. He said that a lot of the new units being created by the city are for middle-income people — out of reach of many in the group that the older subsidized apartments have tended to house.Among other recommendations, the Community Service Society called for federal funding to increase the subsidy for projects in areas in which the real estate market is hot, state help in refinancing mortgages, and improved tenant protections. Both studies urged the State Legislature to pass two pending bills that would place all Mitchell-Lama rental buildings under rent stabilization once they leave the program.Interviews with tenants in several buildings that have left the subsidy programs indicated that change has been gradual in many cases.Jean Green Dorsey, chairwoman of the tenants association in an Upper West Side apartment complex that left the Mitchell-Lama program eight years ago, said more than 80 percent of tenants have stayed and are paying rents at the stabilized rate. Mrs. Dorsey, who said that she and her husband pay $600 for their two-bedroom apartment with a terrace, said that rents for vacant apartments have tripled.Edward Clarke, president of the tenants association at Boulevard Towers I in Soundview in the Bronx, which also left Mitchell-Lama, said tenants who stayed are paying rents similar to what they paid before. But, he said, evictions have gone up. And, in 10 years, he predicts, the residents will be a different crowd.""Quite frankly, a lot of people I know are moving out of the city altogether,"" said Mr. Clarke, 36, an operations analyst with Mellon Investor Services. ""Because of how much of your income you spend just renting an apartment, you can't really live a decent life or really enjoy all the offers and benefits the city has.""'"

Plans for the parade, which would have been the city's first, provoked a storm of condemnation in Russia, where homosexuality has gained little acceptance since it a criminal ban on it was lifted in 1993. In remarks yesterday, Mr. Luzhkov called homosexuality ""a deviation"" and declared that a parade was ""absolutely unacceptable for Moscow, for Russia."" A parade organizer, Nikolai Alekseyev, said a decision would be made today whether to defy the ban, and, if so, where to hold the march.'"

"'06-05-27,'0','NEARLY a decade ago, when technology stocks were hot and developing countries were not, a money manager calculated that Intel was worth as much as all the publicly traded companies in India. He thought that a little ridiculous.In recent years, as any investor in either India or Intel knows, tables have turned. Since the end of 2003, Intel investors have lost about 40 percent of their money, while those in India are up around 80 percent.As capital has flowed in, there have been periodic warnings that speculation might be getting a little out of hand, but those who paid attention to such warnings have always lost out.At least until this month.From May 10, when the Bombay Stock Exchange 100 index peaked at 6,554.71, through Monday, the index plunged almost 18 percent, to 5,382.22. It then bounced back a bit, reassuring those who recall that the last such rapid sell-off, almost exactly two years ago, was in reaction to a surprising election result: the Congress Party, in coalition with leftist parties, took over the government.Since then, that government has won the hearts of foreign investors, and growth has been rapid. Along with China, India has been the most exciting country for foreign investors. And its stock market, unlike that of China, has been viewed as a reasonable place where quality companies can be bought and sold. China's market, which has burned investors too many times and does not even list the country's best companies, has done poorly.'"

"'06-05-28,'0','After Sept. 11, intelligence and law enforcement agencies were criticized for failing to recruit Muslims who could move within circles where they could gather information to learn about terrorist threats. ""Now it's five years after 9/11, and nothing has blown up, and people are saying 'Why do they have the gall to attempt to penetrate?' "" said one law enforcement official who has worked closely with the department and the F.B.I.The outcome of the terror trial in United States District Court in Brooklyn, the first since 2001 that was based on an investigation by the Police Intelligence Division rather than by the F.B.I., has been hailed by police officials as a victory and a vindication. The defendant, Shahawar Matin Siraj, 24, was convicted on Wednesday of conspiring to bomb the subway station. Some of his conversations leading up to the plot occurred in the Islamic bookstore where Mr. Siraj had worked, next door to the Bay Ridge mosque.Two witnesses at the trial — a 50-year-old paid police informer code-named Woody and a young undercover officer — were in the mosque that December day. At that point, the bombing plot had not been hatched, and Mr. Siraj was not yet under investigation. The two men, and another informer who was in the mosque that day for unknown reasons and who played no role in the trial, were not even aware of one another at the time.Details of the clandestine programs have emerged in large measure through their accounts, in their testimony in recent weeks and to a lesser degree in the police reports.One section of the Intelligence Division, the Terrorist Interdiction Unit, is devoted to using informers as ""listening posts"" in Muslim communities. The detectives in the unit cultivate the informers, place them in various communities, oversee their work and collect and compile the information that they generate.Despite the Police Department's broad publicity campaign to highlight its counterterrorism efforts since 9/11, the unit has seldom if ever been mentioned in news accounts.The police would provide no details about the unit and how it operates beyond what came out at the trial. So its scope, the guidelines under which it works and its successes and failures, beyond Mr. Siraj's conviction, could not be immediately determined.But one paid informer alone — the man who testified against Mr. Siraj — attended 575 prayer services at the Bay Ridge mosque and another mosque in Staten Island over 13 months. He provided information almost daily, sometimes twice a day, to his detective handler, who prepared more than 350 reports based largely on the visits to the mosques and the Islamic bookstore.Documents referring to numbered cases — M3 and M24 — that appear to be focused on mosques suggest that there could be as many as two dozen such investigations, but it could not be learned whether any others bore fruit.Another section, the Special Services Unit, oversaw the undercover Muslim detective, who moved into the Bay Ridge neighborhood in late 2002 to investigate terrorism and other crimes.The detective was one of the three men at the mosque on that day in December 2003. He testified that while he occasionally saw one of the other men, the paid informer, Osama Eldawoody, in the area around the mosque and the bookstore and greeted him with a handshake, he never knew that Mr. Eldawoody was working for the police until after Mr. Siraj's arrest on Aug. 27, 2004.The detective came from Bangladesh when he was 7 and was recruited from the Police Academy to work undercover among Muslims when he was 23. He testified under a pseudonym because prosecutors said he was still involved in other undercover investigations.He testified that his instructions were ""to be a member of the community,"" hang out with the young men there, and collect information. He was to focus, he said, partly on the Bay Ridge mosque, which he visited on his first day. He spent time in the bookstore, and with Mr. Siraj, after the young man made violent statements about suicide bombings in Israel and praised Osama bin Laden.At the trial, Mr. Siraj's lawyers said he was entrapped by Mr. Eldawoody, contending that the older man cajoled and inflamed him to lure him into the conspiracy. They argued that because the informer told Mr. Siraj that he was part of a terrorist group that did not exist and that it would supply the explosives, no real danger existed.Moreover, they suggested throughout the trial that the department's tactics were improper — in particular, sending informers and the undercover detective into mosques to cast a wide net in search of radical Islamists. But jurors later said they examined and rejected the entrapment defense. Mr. Siraj now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.On Friday, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that the verdict ""validates so much of what we've done to protect the city.""Some critics, however, suggest that by sending people undercover into mosques and neighborhoods with a broad mandate to collect intelligence, the police are sweeping up information that has nothing to do with terrorism or crime.""The Police Department's indiscriminate monitoring of Muslim communities assures that most of its surveillance will be of lawful activity,"" said Christopher Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. ""This contrasts sharply with traditional law enforcement work, which typically and rightly focuses on unlawful activity. You don't see the F.B.I. hanging out in churches and bookstores in Little Italy hoping to run into the mob, yet that's what the N.Y.P.D. is doing in Muslim communities in its search for Muslim extremists.""Mr. Siraj's lawyer, Martin R. Stolar, who had said that he intended to put the department's tactics on trial, made much the same argument in defense of his client — an argument, police officials noted, that carried little weight with the jury. He contended that the department had ""presumptively violated"" the 1985 consent decree governing the Intelligence Division. Mr. Stolar was one of the lawyers who brought the civil lawsuit in 1971 that led to the decree limiting the department's investigations of political and religious activity. But the judge at this trial, Nina Gershon, waved off his arguments.Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the department, said it employed the informer and the undercover officer to follow up on leads of suspected terrorist activities, as it does when it deploys undercover narcotics detectives. ""In both instances, placement is dictated by the reported activity, not the community, ethnicity or religion,"" he said.One counterterrorism official said the Intelligence Division operated under the close supervision of two lawyers, both former federal prosecutors, who work to ensure that everything is done according to the most stringent interpretations of the decree. During much of the Herald Square investigation, one was assigned to the city's Law Department and the other to the police deputy commissioner for legal matters, S. Andrew Schaffer, who himself attended much of the trial.Mr. Stolar also sought to highlight what he suggested were lapses in police procedure.For example, during Mr. Stolar's cross-examination of Mr. Eldawoody's handler, Detective Stephen Andrews of the Terrorist Interdiction Unit, he asked about problems the informer had using a small digital device to secretly record conversations with Mr. Siraj. Detective Andrews acknowledged that he was unable to instruct Mr. Eldawoody because he himself had not been trained to use the device. As a result, for six weeks, the informer was unable to make any recordings.Mr. Browne dismissed the criticism as uninformed, saying the department had thwarted a bombing plot. ""That's the reality, despite the defense's understandable but ultimately failed attempt to identify purported weaknesses in police methods and procedures,"" he said.During the trial, a senior police official acknowledged that mosques had at one time been a focus of the department's efforts, but he said that investigators had significantly broadened their scope since then.""We don't investigate mosques, we investigate people,"" the official said. ""We're not in every mosque — that's not where we need to be. That's Intel 101. We're in the graduate program. The bad guys aren't hanging around the water cooler after Friday prayers anymore.""'"
"'06-05-28,'0','KABUL, Afghanistan, May 27 — Afghanistan's Parliament on Saturday rejected the president's nominee for chief of the Supreme Court, Fazel Hadi Shinwari, a conservative cleric and close ally of President Hamid Karzai.Lawmakers voted 117 to 77 against Mr. Shinwari, who has held the post of chief justice since shortly after the Taliban leadership collapsed in 2001 and has been widely criticized for an inefficient and corrupt judicial system.The rejection of Mr. Shinwari will be a blow to Mr. Karzai, who had hoped to retain the cleric for his unimpeachable religious standing while appointing new, better qualified judges under him to ensure improvement.""He was acceptable to different sections of our community, and even to the Taliban, so he was good for defending the Afghan government against Taliban claims that it is an infidel government and one based on Western democracy,"" said Malalai Shinwary, a member of Parliament from Kabul, who comes from the same tribe as Mr. Shinwari.Three more of Mr. Karzai's nominees for the nine-member Supreme Court have also been rejected along with Mr. Shinwari, and only two have been confirmed, in a clear message of Parliament's dissatisfaction with the state of the judiciary. Another three nominees, who hold degrees from Western universities, were also rejected because they hold dual citizenship, though some legislators called Saturday for their nominations to be reconsidered.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','Then he washes them. Penske cannot say for sure that being fastidious off the racetrack results in being fast on it. What he can say, though, is that he has created a culture that has fostered loyalty. And loyal employees produce results.""We all have the feeling that we want to do the right thing by Roger, because he does the right thing by us,"" said Sam Hornish Jr., one of Penske's drivers.Hornish and his teammate, the two-time Indy 500 champion Hélio Castroneves, have dominated practice sessions for this year's race. Hornish was fastest in Friday's final practice before Castroneves's crew won the annual pit-stop competition.Hornish will start from the pole position Sunday; Castroneves is second in the 33-car field. Their cars were so well prepared that they were usually the first on the track for practice. Castroneves's car was the first at full speed Friday.""When you beat him, you feel as if you've beaten the best, and that's what I like about Roger,"" said the car owner Michael Andretti, who will end a three-year retirement Sunday to drive in the race.Penske, 69, raced sports cars before he started a team. He first put a car into the Indianapolis 500 in 1969 and had his first victory by 1972, when Mark Donohue won. Penske cars won the race seven times from 1984 to 1994.""He is the one car owner of all the car owners I drove for who truly understands what a driver is going through out there,"" Al Unser Jr., who won the 1994 Indy 500 for Penske, said this week.Penske announced late last year that he was closing his IndyCar team shop in Reading, Pa.; the shop has been open since 1973. His IndyCar, Nascar and sports-car operations will be run out of one place — Mooresville, N.C.But he also said that the shop would not close for a year and that his employees had been encouraged to move with the company.""I could look them in the eye and say there were no secrets,"" he said Friday.Team Penske's employees sometimes take their dedication to an extreme. Tim Cindric, the 38-year-old president of Penske's racing operations, had hip surgery about a month ago. He needed a comfortable place to watch his team from the pits, so his employees built him an adjustable seat that can slide from one side of the pit stand to the other.Cindric said he would have been happy if he had simply been provided with a place to sit.""Some people would look at it as overkill,"" Cindric said. ""But I think it's more a reflection on the mentality we have.""Three Penske engineers won an award at the speedway May 19 for designing a tool that can quickly adjust the rear-wing angle during a pit stop. The Indy 500 is the only Indy Racing League event in which such adjustments can be made.""It's something we thought was strategically important,"" Tom German, one of the engineers, said Friday. ""We felt like we didn't want to give up anything in the pits.""The tool, which resembles a stainless-steel cordless screwdriver, can be set before a pit stop. The original design included a trigger, but to shave split seconds, the tool is activated when it is pushed into the rear wing.If the setups for Hornish and Castroneves are right Sunday, Team Penske may not use the tool, which has been made available to other I.R.L. teams.""We spent some time on it, and we spent some money on it and we may never need it,"" German said. ""But the day we do need it, we can pull it out and have it there.""Three Team Penske employees were sent to Indianapolis a week before the track was opened for practice. Their job was to build a garage within a garage.The garages have smooth concrete walls and floors. One of Penske's sponsors, Gladiator Garage Works, supplied materials so that walls could be erected inside the existing walls. Tile floors and carpet were laid over the concrete floors.""We try to create a home away from home for them,"" said Jerry Breon, who has worked for Penske for 33 years and was the coordinator of the garage project.Castroneves said there was a larger point to keeping a garage floor swept clean than simply making it homey — or impressing Penske's corporate clients. If a gearbox is broken and leaking fluid, he said, it is easier to spot on a clean floor than on a dirty one.That is one reason Penske employees polish the undersides of their cars every day.""They're constantly touching the cars, feeling them,"" said Tom Wurtz, the team manager. ""It's like your car. If you're proud of your car, you're keeping it clean. And if you keep rubbing on it, you can see if it has a chip from the road.""Penske seems to run all of his businesses, which include car dealerships and a truck-leasing business, that way. Penske will pull one of his rental trucks off the road if he sees that it is dirty. ""Customer satisfaction is the DNA of our company,"" he said.Hornish and Cindric remember accompanying Penske to the opening of his Ferrari-Maserati dealership in Las Vegas. Trenches were to be built in the garage floor to hide extension cords and air hoses. But the covers for the trenches were not finished.Penske immediately ordered an employee to go to Home Depot to buy wood for temporary trench covers and to paint the covers so that they matched the color of the garage floor.""He's probably the most demanding individual I've ever worked for,"" Cindric said. ""He demands results and he demands improvements. At the same time, it's one of the most rewarding environments I've ever been in.""Asked if Penske had lost any of his fire, Cindric laughed softly and said: ""No, if anything, I see it increasing. He'll say that he has less and less birthdays coming up, so this means more and more.""Castroneves won the Indy 500 for Penske in 2001 and 2002, and Gil de Ferran won the race in 2003 before he retired. Penske's Toyota-powered cars were unable to match the horsepower that Honda engines generated in the last two Indy 500's.But now all I.R.L. cars have Honda engines. ""The great thing is that we're on a level playing field,"" Penske said.Now Penske is trying to tilt it back in his direction.""Some people like to play golf and tennis on the weekends,"" Castroneves said. ""He likes to race.""'"
"'06-05-28,'0','LONDON, May 27 — Two days before British academics were to vote on a possible boycott of their Israeli colleagues, the lines sharpened on Saturday as 600 university teachers from Britain, Canada, the United States and Israel came out in opposition to the move while Palestinian and other academics supported it.The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, Britain's biggest union of college teachers, is to vote Monday on a resolution asking its 67,000 members to boycott Israeli colleagues who do not distance themselves from what it calls Israel's ""apartheid policies.""The ballot, at the union's annual conference in Blackpool, follows a similar move last year by the smaller Association of University Teachers, with 40,000 members, which first supported a boycott of two Israeli universities, then overturned it. The two unions are set to merge on June 1, but the vote on Monday will determine whether the newly merged union will come into being under the shadow of a dispute over the proposed boycott.Supporters of the resolution predict it will be approved, but Jon Pike, a philosophy lecturer at the Open University and one of the 600 opponents of the move, said: ""I think it's up in the air. I'm not completely pessimistic.""Nonetheless, he said in a telephone interview that if it were approved, opponents would ask the new union ""to repudiate this as soon as the new union meets.""'"
"'06-05-28,'0','YANGON, Myanmar, May 27 (AP) — The pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will remain under house arrest for another year, a government official in Myanmar said Saturday.The extension of a six-month detention order by the nation's junta, not yet officially announced, occurred despite international pressure and kept Myanmar at odds with the United States and most of the West. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 60, has spent about 10 of the past 17 years in detention. In 1991, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. She was most recently taken into custody on May 30, 2003, after her motorcade was attacked by a pro-junta mob as she toured northern Myanmar. Saturday was the last day of the latest order that has kept her in her home in Yangon, formerly Rangoon. She is forbidden visitors and telephone contact with the outside.The government's rationale for detaining her was that she could threaten public order.In Thailand, Foreign Minister Kantathi Suphamongkhon said, ""I was hoping the release should come today."" He added, ""We would like to see Myanmar back in the realm of the international community, so progress in national reconciliation is something of importance.""The West has isolated Myanmar, also known as Burma, since the National League for Democracy won an election in 1990 but was barred by the military from taking power.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','When President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain talked about progress in Iraq at a joint news conference last week, one thing was evident. The two world leaders who plotted the original invasion have, at least, come a long way in realizing how many things have gone wrong. Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair, who have always been the cheerleaders for the Iraq initiative, seemed positively downbeat, even as they insisted that democratization would make everything right in the end.Iraq now does have a constitutional government, elected by the Iraqis themselves. But that will make no difference at all unless that government can provide all its citizens with basic order and security.Right now armed gangs of thugs, many of them wearing government uniforms, are spreading terror throughout the country. Some were trained by American forces to work for the Interior Ministry, but actually do the bidding of Shiite political and religious leaders. They harass, kidnap and murder people who follow different religious practices or support competing politicians, often with the help of weapons and equipment provided by an American government that had very different objectives in mind. The Times reported last week that Sunni forces working for the Ministry of Defense who were supposed to be guarding Iraq's oil pipeline were instead freelancing as death squads, assassinating people who cooperated with the same government that paid the gunmen's salaries.Of all of George Bush's many arguments for the invasion, the only one that has survived exposure to reality is that Iraqis deserve something better than a brutal dictatorship. But right now the country appears on the way to a civil war among the armed groups competing to impose order on their own terms. To avoid repeating a very bad history, the nation's security forces must be brought under control by people who have both the will and the capacity to truly unite the nation.The fact that the current government avoided naming any officials to the posts that control the military and internal security forces when it announced its first cabinet was a clear sign of how difficult that task would be. And coming up with acceptable nominees is just the first and easiest step. The current military and civilian police forces must be purged of their brutal and lawless elements, and the numerous private militias must be made to stand down and disarm.American forces can never be a substitute for Iraqi soldiers and police officers who take seriously their duty to protect all the people, regardless of religion or ethnicity. Mr. Bush's premise that American troops should simply stay on the ground until Iraq gets things right and defeats all insurgent forces and terrorist groups, however long it takes, is flat wrong. The United States presence is dangerous — to the soldiers themselves, to American standing in the world, and most tellingly to large numbers of innocent Iraqis.The currently emerging story about what happened last November in Haditha, where at least two dozen Iraqi men, women and children were apparently shot by a small group of American marines, is only the latest indication of what terrible things can happen when soldiers are required to occupy hostile civilian territory in the midst of an armed insurrection and looming civil war. A military investigation is currently deciding whether any of the marines should be charged with murder, and whether a cover-up took place. All these questions have awful resonance for those who remember Vietnam, and what that prolonged and ultimately pointless war did to both the Vietnamese and the American social fabric.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','Like the tight circuit through Monaco, the old-fashioned systems present special challenges to driver and crew and leave ample room for human error.The lollipop is a round sign at the end of a pole that a crew member holds over the nose of the car during a pit stop. When it goes up, it is safe for the driver to leave the pit.At the San Marino Grand Prix last month, the lollipop was raised too early during a pit stop by Jenson Button, an English driver for Honda. Button pulled away, scattering crew members. He was forced to stop and lost a chance for a top-three finish.""This is a typical example of man and machine at the limit,"" de Ferran said of the incident. ""This is what motor racing is. Everything and everyone pushed to the very limit of stress, of torments, of everything.""Button's lollipop man was Alistair Gibson, the team's chief mechanic. Gibson knew that the stop, the second in a three-stop strategy, would have to be a short one, requiring tighter than usual choreography between the wheel change and refueling. But Gibson found it difficult to determine when every task had been completed and he sent the car off before the refueling was done.""He was ahead of himself,"" de Ferran said.Nick Heidfeld, a German driver for BMW-Sauber who finished second at Monaco last year, said that it was also dangerous for a driver when the lollipop man moved around, even a little bit, as some do.""It needs to be either down or up,"" Heidfeld said. ""You want to go as soon as you see a little movement and there are people who are moving a bit, and that's a disaster. Very dangerous.""Other racing series have opted for more advanced technological systems. Cars, for example, are jacked up automatically and sensors signal when the four wheels have been changed. Formula One has resisted.""We have thought about lots of other things,"" de Ferran said. ""Sensors for the refueling, brake sensors, sensors here, sensors there, safety scenarios where you turn the engine off when something is wrong. But the problem is that all of the ones that we can think have probably more potential for failure than the human side.""The pit board system is the epitome of the human side. It is a hand-held board shown to a driver to indicate his position in the race, what lap he is on, how far ahead or behind he is and when to return to the pit.The pit board itself, if not the system, has changed somewhat since the early days of racing. Then it was a small blackboard with the information written in chalk. Today it is made of carbon fiber and has holes to make it easier to hold on a windy day. The large letters and numbers are made of plastic.Johnny Herbert, a former Formula One racer, a winner of Le Mans, and now a team director for Midland F1 Racing, said that the pit board was the ideal way to convey certain information to the driver.""With the dashboard you have in the car, there is only so much information that you can have,"" he said, ""and it's more distracting to have that there.""But not all drivers are comfortable with the pit board. Scott Speed, a driver at the Toro Rosso team, said he looked at the pit board only every three laps or so because ""the vision's horrible inside the car — far less than 20/20 because of the vibration.""Not looking at the pit board for long stretches can be unwise. At the Australian Grand Prix in 1997, Jean Alesi and his Benetton team lost radio contact without knowing it. After Alesi failed to return to the pit for refueling when the team asked him to do so on the radio, the team put out the pit board to tell him to refuel. But Alesi did not look at it. On the next lap, the pit board went out bearing the letters ""F-U-E-L.""Again Alesi failed to see it, and he ran out of fuel and quit the race.Not even the colored signal flags that warn drivers of accidents and other information have been replaced, although a system was tested a few years ago with electronic lights on car dashboards.Lights are used to start the race and control the pit lane exit. But during qualifying at the European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring in Germany earlier this month, a bad electrical connection set off the red lights that announce an aborted session — usually for an accident — and several drivers left the track and lost a good qualifying position. Those who saw no red flags kept going and placed well.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','The stock market rebounded last week, and all three major Wall Street indexes advanced after two weeks of losses.The gains were part of a global rally in stocks, which recovered after a steep sell-off that began on May 17 with a report suggesting that inflation was on the rise in the United States. The data set off speculation that the Federal Reserve might continue its long-running campaign to raise short-term interest rates.On Thursday and Friday last week, though, stocks rose with the release of fresh numbers indicating that American consumer spending remained strong while inflation held at expected levels. On Friday a report on personal consumption, excluding food and energy, showed an annual increase of 2.1 percent in April.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 134.55 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 11,278.61. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.1 points, or 1 percent, to close at 1,280.16.

"'06-05-28,'0','The problem is that there is no precise way to determine your ability to stomach short-term market losses without actually experiencing them.You can visit any number of Web sites run by online brokers or mutual fund companies where you will find an investor survey intended to help gauge your risk tolerance. That information, along with your investment goals and time horizon, may help determine how much of your portfolio belongs in stocks as opposed to less volatile, but lower-returning, assets like bonds or cash.But there are problems with relying on these cookie-cutter questionnaires. The fact is, ""when the market goes up, risk tolerance is infinite,"" said Harold R. Evensky, chairman of Evensky & Katz, a wealth management firm based in Coral Gables, Fla. ""But when it goes down, risk tolerance often shrinks to zero.""Many risk-tolerance questionnaires ask investors how they might react to theoretical market declines. The mutual fund giant Vanguard, for example, asks investors what they would do if stocks fell by more than 25 percent in seven months.But basing your decisions on a hypothetical loss measured in percentage terms is too abstract. ""It's when you put an actual dollar amount to it — that's when you get the real gut check,"" said Christine Fahlund, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.The good news is that there are now online tools that can help measure how much money you might lose in dollar terms — based on your asset allocation and actual holdings — in the event of a typical correction or a major market meltdown.For example, E*Trade Financial, the online brokerage firm, has a new risk-analysis service for its clients. To be officially announced this week, this free tool, called the risk analyzer, projects how much your portfolio might lose during major crises like those of 9/11, the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000, the Asian currency crisis of 1997 and Black Monday in 1987. The program estimates how assets would hold up under similar stresses today.If you are not an E*Trade customer, you can go directly to www.riskgrades.com, run by RiskMetrics Group, which provides the underlying technology for the risk analyzer. There, you can sign up for a free membership that will give you access to the same information.Riskgrades.com isn't the only site that offers risk guidance to investors. Premium members of Morningstar.com, for example, have access to similar tools for $14.95 a month.Let's say you have concluded that your portfolio is too risky. Making some slight adjustments to your strategy may help you sleep better at night. While investors are often told not to veer from their long-term asset allocation, it's better to tweak your portfolio now rather than ignoring your emotions only to sell in a panic during a real crisis, said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal in the investment counseling and research department at Vanguard.Before you consider dialing down your equity exposure, though, examine exactly why your portfolio may be too risky.For instance, while you may view a portfolio of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds as reasonably safe, ""you could create a 60-40 portfolio that's all tech and biotech and high-yield bonds that's going to have a very different risk profile than you may intend,"" said Jason Mirsky, director of wealth management for RiskMetrics Group.Indeed, according to Morningstar, a portfolio that is 60 percent technology and biotech stocks and 40 percent high-yield bonds would have lost 21.5 percent in the fall of 2000, which would have been the portfolio's worst three-month stretch over the past decade.By comparison, if you put 60 percent of your money into a broadly based index fund based on the Standard & Poor's 500 and 40 percent into a total bond market index portfolio, you would have lost only 9.1 percent during your worst-three month period, in the summer of 2002.ANOTHER option for risk-averse investors is to consider moving out of speculative stocks and into higher-quality blue chips, especially those that pay dividends.According to riskgrades.com, for example, a $5,000 investment in the Vanguard Dividend Growth fund, which invests in blue-chip companies with rising payouts, would have lost around $450 during the initial bear market sell-off from March 24 to April 14, 2000. Had you invested that same $5,000 in the Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index fund, you would have lost more than $1,200 — almost one-quarter of your original amount — over the same period.Dividends may provide investors with some ballast during the current storm. Mr. Ablin pointed out that when the S.& P. 500 is divided into fifths, based on the dividends they pay, only the top fifth has managed positive total returns so far in May.Why not just reduce your stock exposure outright?Well, you may find that to be appropriate. But in addition to considering the short-term risk of losing money in stocks, investors should also be mindful of the long-term risk of falling short of their goals, such as retirement income. And over long stretches of time, you'll need a heavy dose of stocks in your portfolio to ensure asset growth.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','HAPPINESS is a hot topic among social scientists. Economists, psychologists and others are finding joy by investigating what makes the rest of us happy and by poking holes in our assumptions on this topic, which has been in the air partly because of Daniel Gilbert's witty new book, ""Stumbling on Happiness.""On one point, the findings of the research are clear: Whatever happiness is and however it is derived, money can't buy it. Oh, money can help if you're living in a cardboard box, of course, but once your basic needs are met, it won't increase your happiness much — and it may even hurt by keeping you on an earning-and-spending treadmill that diverts time and energy from family, friends and community life.While it's hardly news that money won't buy happiness, the observation should be greeted with suspicion when delivered in a cascade of books by the prosperous and the tenured (none of whom, to my knowledge, have instructed their agents to negotiate smaller book advances). Tuition bills notwithstanding, impressionable young people may be especially prone to regard money as little more than a means to despoil the environment in the name of pointless materialism.It's graduation season, and once again affluent commencement speakers are fanning out across the land in something like an organized smear campaign against the almighty dollar. So I feel that it's my solemn duty to offer a little corrective: Graduates, it's not fashionable to say it, but money will, in fact, buy you a better life, all other things being equal. And if it can't buy happiness outright, it can certainly help you avoid a lot of misery.If you're a man, money will probably play a role in how successful you are with women, as the psychologist David M. Buss makes plain in ""The Evolution of Desire,"" his remarkable survey of human mating strategies. Researchers have confirmed in the laboratory what many single men know from real life. In one experiment, women were shown photographs of the same men, sometimes dressed in fast-food uniforms and at other times in classy business attire. When the men wore clothes that screamed ""money,"" they were rated as more attractive.If you're a woman, money of your own can help you maintain your independence, counterbalance the power of men and, if you do want an affluent, high-status mate, move in the circles where you're most likely to find one. (Women's incomes seem to matter less to men, who are much more concerned with a mate's looks.) For those who plan a family, money will largely determine the quality of education that your children receive, because the priciest communities typically have the best public schools. Private schools will require even more cash.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','But for now, this state is a hard case. The Institute for Justice, which has represented the New London property owners and many others around the country, lists 24 cities and towns in New Jersey where there are ""current controversies"" involving condemnation for redevelopment; by contrast, Pennsylvania has 6, Massachusetts 2 and New York 7. In addition, even though lawmakers seemed sympathetic to Mr. Chen, they have often been seen as part of the problem rather than the problem's solution.More than 70 municipalities have designated ""areas in need of redevelopment"" — which confers the power of eminent domain on local officials — since the state started requiring notice of these declarations in 2003. Others carved out redevelopment zones earlier and could still act on them.Most redevelopment projects proceed uneventfully, and most eminent domain fights, when it comes to that, are about the compensation owed to displaced owners. But to change the rules now would hamper redevelopment planning nearly everywhere in the state.William Potter, a Princeton land-use lawyer who is chairman of the statewide group the New Jersey Coalition Against Eminent Domain Abuse, put it another way. ""I imagine a good bill is going to bring out all the big guns — the consultants, the law firms, the developers — to oppose it,"" he said.The consultants, the law firms and the developers are entrenched for a reason. New Jersey, like most states, acted more than 50 years ago to give local governments the power to condemn blighted property. But a 1992 law invited developers to New Jersey's hollowed-out cities by expanding the definition of blight. Growing public subsidies were to follow.""It led to a frenzy of redevelopment efforts,"" said Mr. Potter, who also teaches land use at Princeton and Rutgers. ""It was a long, slow leading edge, but all these developers and cities saw that this was a gravy train and they better get aboard.""Three years ago, the Legislature gave towns the authority to declare an ""area in need of redevelopment"" wherever it is ""consistent with smart-growth planning principles."" It is that criterion — because it applies to suburban as well as urban areas — that could arguably ensnare Mr. Chen's house in Berkeley Heights.In New Jersey, developers and cities relying on the power of eminent domain have remade broad swaths of Atlantic City and New Brunswick. In addition, they plan to displace 1,200 households and small businesses in Camden, demolish blocks of oceanfront houses in Long Branch and a working-class neighborhood in Lawnside, and take industrial land in Pennsauken and North Arlington.All those plans would bring in builders of new, more dense and upscale housing.""It's happening all over the state,"" said Scott Bullock, a lawyer at the Institute for Justice who represented the New London homeowners and is now involved in the Long Branch case. ""It's just a climate, a willingness of government to work with private developers. It's just the climate that says that's acceptable.""There are a lot of other places in the country that are as densely populated as New Jersey and you don't see rampant eminent domain abuses,"" Mr. Bullock said. ""You don't see eminent domain abuse in Chicago or Los Angeles.""Assemblyman Michael Panter, a Democrat from Shrewsbury who is proposing a two-year moratorium on eminent domain, said the Supreme Court decision ""really opened a candy store for the developers"" — especially in New Jersey.While most local officials are honestly trying to improve their towns, Mr. Panter said: ""There's much to cozy a relationship between local officials and wealthy developers. If mayors and council members, some of whom take money from developers, are approached by a wealthy developer who pitches them the idea that they're going to revitalize a neighborhood if the town takes it by eminent domain, that's very troubling.""""You're never going to read about it in the newspaper,"" he said, ""because those discussions take place behind closed doors.""That is the contention of business owners on Porete Avenue in North Arlington, who stand to lose their property along the rim of the Meadowlands to a 1,600-unit condominium development.The plan was negotiated by borough officials and a subsidiary of Cherokee Investment Partners, a company that buys contaminated property, cleans it up and usually sells it to home builders. In the last five years, Cherokee, which is based in North Carolina, has come to dominate the development landscape of New Jersey.Porete Avenue is a small strip on the edge of Cherokee's main project in North Arlington, the site of a former landfill. But Bill Gauger, the president of Cherokee Northeast, the company's development arm, said it needed the profit yield from housing to finance the landfill cleanup. And the company could not put $500,000 condominiums between the golf course and the existing industrial occupants, he said, ""because I can't create a sense of place with the businesses right next door.""Some of the dozen or so owners on the street want to sell, but others are bringing suit to stop the project. Their anger is not directed at Cherokee so much as at their own representatives, and at the way the deal was struck.According to Councilman Peter C. Massa, who voted against the deal and is trying to unseat the mayor, the city attorney and a lawyer for Cherokee negotiated the plan without any citizen participation and then presented it as a fait accompli last March. In October, Mr. Massa said, the council members were given a memorandum of understanding. ""They said: 'This is a great deal for everybody. Sign it and pass it.' ""Then, Mr. Massa said, the council members received the 334-page final agreement on April 18, for a vote scheduled April 19 — a vote that was added to the agenda at the last minute. The resolution was adopted without discussion among the council members.Mayor Russ Pitman says no one was caught by surprise, including the owners, whose property was identified for possible redevelopment more than 15 years ago, or the council members. Mr. Pitman and Cherokee officials noted that the project was under negotiation for three to four years as the mayor and the city attorney insisted on scaling down the original proposal for high rises. Moreover, Mr. Pitman said, the agreement approved in April was substantially the same as the one that all the council members approved in October.The owners respond that earlier proposals would have allowed them to stay, and that it was only after the deal was done that they learned that Cherokee wanted them out.Damon Y. Smith, a professor of property and local government law at Rutgers-Camden, said the complaints in North Arlington echoed those in the Cramer Hill section of Camden, a working-class neighborhood in a city with several abandoned areas — which is also to be acquired by Cherokee — about the steps leading to a decision to use eminent domain. ""The problem as I hear it from people in Camden was not only that these processes were not followed but that the decision was already made and the whole process was a ruse,"" said Professor Smith, who is also a former urban planner.""The fear is that you have very sophisticated private actors who have in mind what they would like to do, and then you have public actors who have certain powers to designate something as blight,"" he said. ""A major concern of critics of eminent domain and its use in the last several decades is that the process has largely been taken over by these private actors.""Underscoring the point, Mr. Chen noted that a local government can choose a developer without any bids and that the current law requires only one public hearing before designating a redevelopment zone. Nor does the law require that the municipality present studies or other evidence.""Sometimes the process is so abbreviated,"" he said, that there really is no record by which a court could tell whether local officials complied with the criteria set out in the law, however loose they are.In addition, studies and projections assessing a proposed development are often financed by the developer, as are other costs. Cherokee, for example, put money into escrow funds that paid part of the salary of the Camden Redevelopment Agency's director and fees to the municipal attorney in Pennsauken, where Cherokee has also won a contract for a huge redevelopment project. While these officials were supposed to be negotiating with Cherokee, state law does not restrict the way developers' fees are spent.In New Brunswick, where a bookstore owner is fighting a plan to raze his block for a 30-story building across from the Rutgers campus, most downtown projects are collaborations among the city, Rutgers and the New Brunswick Development Corporation, known as Devco, a private nonprofit developer created by the city in the 1970's.They made a joint announcement of the new tower in February 2005, several months before the New Brunswick Planning Board was asked to begin the required study to determine whether the area is in need of redevelopment. Bill Bray, a spokesman for Mayor James Cahill, said the redeveloper is ""likely to be Devco,"" as it has been in almost all downtown projects.As a private company, Devco does not have to disclose its finances, or its relationships with local officials. But Mr. Bray said, ""It's easy for some people to criticize Devco today, but there was a time when New Brunswick had to create its own corporation to get something built.""A report written by Mr. Chen's office, in addition to recommending a tighter definition of blight, calls for greater public participation in the eminent domain process, better notice to owners and more opportunity to appeal, and ethics rules to insure that public officials working on a redevelopment project do not benefit personally from it.In the Legislature, about a half-dozen bills, including Mr. Panter's proposed moratorium, have been introduced in the 11 months since the Supreme Court's Kelo decision. The Assembly Commerce and Economic Development Committee has held four hearings, concluding with Mr. Chen's testimony on his report.Still, some who are urging stricter eminent domain laws say the New Jersey Legislature is not the most likely place to find relief. Among New Jersey's 120 legislators are dozens of other mayors and other local officials as well as lawyers, engineers and consultants who work for developers and local governments.For instance, the Democratic chairman of the Assembly Commerce committee, John J. Burzichelli, is also the mayor of Paulsboro, which has five redevelopment zones. The vice chairman, Assemblyman Joseph Vas, is the mayor of Perth Amboy, where a court recently halted the city's designation of a six-acre tract and its small businesses as a redevelopment zone.Mr. Burzichelli, for one, says he fully supports a stricter law and more careful procedures — and that his town had taken ""great pains"" in designating redevelopment areas. ""The more public awareness there is, the more transparency, that can only help,"" he said. ""If you can make your case, it will rise on the merit.""On the Senate side, the chairman of the committee that is handling eminent domain legislation, Ronald L. Rice, is a Newark city council member, while the vice chairman is Senator Sharpe James, who as Newark's mayor has overseen the removal of small businesses for the city's new hockey arena and a proposal for a condominium and retail development that would displace more than 60 property owners. A host of other influential legislators work for towns and developers. Senator Raymond Lesniak of Elizabeth is a lawyer who represents many developers, and the law firm of Senator Wayne R. Bryant of Camden was hired by Cherokee for eminent domain work.""He's on retainer to evict his own constituents,"" Mr. Potter of the Coalition Against Eminent Domain Abuse said. The state's courts could take a stricter approach than the Legislature, since the New Jersey constitution limits the use of eminent domain for redevelopment to ""blighted areas.""The lower courts have used varying degrees of scrutiny in interpreting that provision. Mr. Chen said that while he believes that sections of the 1992 law exceed the constitutional limit, it has not been tested in the State Supreme Court.Mr. Zangari, the Newark lawyer who represents developers, said that even the United States Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision in the Kelo case expressed lingering reservations about redevelopment deals.New Jersey's redevelopment binge may also be slowed by federal investigators.The United States Attorney's office has subpoenaed officials in at least a dozen towns, including New Brunswick, for records relating to projects involving former State Senator John A. Lynch and his partner and clients in a consulting business that worked for developers.While it is not clear what projects or developers are under investigation, many of those towns have redevelopment projects.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','Joe Queenan's astute comparison of Frank Sinatra and Bruce Springsteen ("" 'My Way' or the Highway?,"" May 21) accurately points out the many similarities between these accomplished performers from the Garden State. However, I think he may have sold Springsteen short.Although Sinatra's music ""makes you feel like a million bucks,"" we need to remember that those ""feel-good"" songs were emblematic of the 1950's and early 60's, when, indeed, many Americans were happy just to enjoy the positive side of life and often avoided facing conditions that would later demand answers. Springsteen's darker music reflects the realism that had become necessary by the close of the 20th century, when many of the problems that were ignored in that earlier generation finally demanded our attention.Those who create music (or art) that makes us feel good and happy may often enjoy a more widespread base of support. But artists who can entertain as well as enlighten (and perhaps inspire) us to face critical issues should also stand the test of time.In ""Tug of War Over Commuters"" (May 14), about DeCamp Bus Lines' lawsuit against New Jersey Transit, you report that Gary Pard, vice president and chief operating officer for DeCamp, testified that the company had not conducted surveys to determine why the company was losing riders because, as he put it, ""we know why.""No survey has been conducted because the results would not back the company's allegation.Ridership losses began long before New Jersey Transit began Midtown Direct service, and were largely the result of dissatisfaction with very unreliable service, overcrowded buses, inconsistent schedules, often surly drivers (my apologies to the few who were the exceptions!) and a general lack of consideration for the ridership.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','An entry-level off-the-shelf road bike from a specialty bike shop may cost $600 to $700. But enthusiasts with ample disposable income seek out the latest technology and highest quality — and are willing to pay 10 times as much to get it. A customized bike is the ne plus ultra of the bicycling world.To some, ""custom"" means simply a choice of components or paint color. But to high-end builders and their connoisseur clients, it means a bicycle built from the ground up for a specific person's body, riding style and preferences.A customized bike was once a last resort for people who were too tall or too short for ready-made bikes. Today, small independent bike builders are ""popping up on every street corner,"" said Don Walker, who founded the North American Handmade Bicycle Show two years ago. Mr. Walker estimates that there are at least 125 professional builders in the United States. And larger companies like Serotta and Seven Cycles are building their businesses around customization.""A decade ago, a custom bike was something you waited a year or more for from a one-man shop,"" said Jennifer Miller, one of the founding employees of Seven Cycles, which opened in 1997 and can generally produce a customized bike in six weeks.""People were paying $5,000 or $6,000 for stock bikes,"" Ms. Miller explained. ""The opportunity to provide increased customer value by offering fully customized bikes at essentially the same price was a no-brainer."" Today, she said, the average price for a customized model is about $8,000.""It's the Starbucks phenomenon,"" she said. ""People will pay $3 or $4 for a cup of coffee if they can get it just the way they want it."" Seven Cycles' sales have increased 50 percent in the last five years, she said, though she would not give specific sales numbers.Ben Serotta, founder and chief executive of Serotta, based in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., also sees persistent growth at the upper end of the market. The company says it delivers about 3,000 made-to-order road and mountain bikes a year, with annual revenue growth of 15 to 20 percent in recent years. The company offers an entry-level customized model for about $3,500; its highest-end bike goes for $20,000.Most buyers of high-tech, high-priced bikes are amateur cyclists, not racers. Mr. Serotta sees an increased interest among the ""Type A power set who work hard and play hard.""Mr. Daab described the typical customer at his Seattle shop this way: ""She's 40, well-educated, professional and knows exactly what she wants.""Others in the business say that while sales to women are increasing, their clientele is still predominantly men. For some, a tailor-made bike is a status symbol, like a luxury car or a fine watch. ""It's the best-in-class concept,"" Mr. Daab added. One thing is certain: they all have enough money to foot the bill.In buying a made-to-order bike, a customer first chooses a style based on how and where it will be ridden.Superstrong, ultralight materials like carbon fiber and titanium are used to make frames that might weigh just over two pounds. The frame tubing is selected for the rider's weight and riding style — for example, if the rider climbs hills standing or seated, or pushes on the pedals in a hard gear or spins the pedals in an easier one.The frame is designed to be compatible with the components the customer selects, like aerodynamic handle bars, disk brakes and lightweight wheels. Features like fender mounts or extra water bottle cages can be added, and corporate graphics or personal initials can be applied to the frame.Most of the biggest builders of customized bikes work with retail stores, which fit customers for the right bike. Such builders do not sell directly, online or in catalogs. The philosophy, they say, demands skilled personal attention and a lengthy fitting process. At the initial interview, the sales worker takes measurements — not only for things like shoe size and shoulder width but also for hamstring and hip flexibility — and asks questions about the client's occupation, past injuries, riding style and cycling goals.In 1998, Serotta opened its School of Cycling Ergonomics in Saratoga Springs, attracting bike retailers from all corners of the country and as far away as Australia and South Korea. A three-day training program is required before a shop can become a certified Serotta dealer.""The school is not a profit center,"" Mr. Serotta said. ""We are advancing the science of bike fit. What makes the best bike is what makes it perfect for you. How do we get that information?"" Ms. Imperiale-Warner bought her 40th birthday present from Conrad's, a high-end shop in Manhattan. It required an initial fitting, a phone interview, then two more hourlong fittings. ""It was like getting a wedding dress,"" she said. It took six weeks before she picked up her titanium and carbon fiber bike.""I instantaneously fell in love with it,"" she said. ""It's worth every penny.""'"

"'06-05-28,'0','I agree entirely with your editorial supporting the proposal of Nassau County's executive, Tom Suozzi, for building ""next-generation"" housing in Garden City (""The Forbidden Garden,"" May 14), but it is worth noting the irony in this community's opposition to affordable housing: according to Pete Hamill's ""Downtown: My Manhattan,"" Garden City was founded by an Irish immigrant from Belfast, the department store pioneer A.

The Priscilla is currently used by the museum as a teaching tool to foster a greater understanding of the marine environment.The museum is also home to many antique boats both completed and currently undergoing restoration. The main museum building houses many magnificent nautical artifacts and is home to the Elward Smith III nautical research library, which offers one of Long Island's largest collections of maritime historical resources and gives reference to the more than 400 shipwrecks that have occurred in Long Island waters, from the Prins Maurits in 1657 to the Gwendoline Steers in 1962.

"'06-05-28,'0','""There have been some hiccups along the way,"" Mr. Suozzi said. ""But that happens in any legislative process.""For those legislators still pushing for environmental projects that have not been included in the proposed plan, Mr. Suozzi has promised to help them try to find alternative financing.This environmental bond issue is a first for Nassau, which lags far behind Suffolk County in open-space preservation. Suffolk has spent an estimated $500 million since the 1970's to preserve farmland and open space.Similar bond proposals that also were approved in 2004 by voters in Suffolk and in the Towns of Brookhaven and Oyster Bay have progressed much further than Nassau's.Suffolk is in negotiation for the full $75 million that voters approved and has already spent $11.5 million to buy about 24 acres of open space and 196 acres in farm-development rights.Oyster Bay has not made any purchases with its $30 million environmental bond but is negotiating for a property that could cost up to $4.5 million.Richard Amper, the executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, said the 18 months that Nassau has so far taken to evaluate proposals was understandable.""It's new ground for Nassau, and when folks do something for the first time, it takes time to get it right,"" he said. ""But the anxiety a lot of us are feeling now is that political infighting could cause further delay, and there would be absolutely no justification for that.""Lisa Ott, the executive director of the North Shore Land Alliance, estimated that 260 acres of land that was on the original nomination list for preservation had been lost to developers in the last year and a half. ""Clearly the need is great and time is of the essence,"" she said.Nassau County officials had hoped to keep political squabbling to a minimum by deliberately including four categories of environmental projects in the bond act. Mr. Suozzi said the county ""included the other categories to address political concerns"" and to make sure the bond would not be limited to the North Shore.After 77 percent of Nassau's voters approved the bond issue, Mr. Suozzi created a bipartisan advisory committee that spent more than a year evaluating 262 proposals before recommending 57 projects in March, including ones in virtually every corner of the county. Committee members have maintained that although all but a few county legislators can point to recommended projects within their districts, they made their decisions strictly on environmental need.""I think the environmental community did a good job of preventing the bond from turning to pork for the politicians,"" Mr. Amper said. ""They screened using legitimate criteria and they came up with something that would clearly benefit the environment and not merely placate the politics of the place.""The county's Open Space and Parks Advisory Committee and the Planning Commission subsequently reviewed and approved the recommendations, with just a few minor changes. The list now consists of 18 park improvements, 17 storm-water improvement projects, six brownfield cleanup sites and 15 open-space acquisitions.The only project from the original recommendations to be eliminated was the demolition of the Glen Cove incinerator, an item that Mr. Suozzi added after the review process had begun. Some Planning Commission members said they thought that only projects that were fully vetted by the advisory committee should be included.The park, storm-water and brownfield projects add up to $12 million, leaving $38 million for open space.Tom Maher, the county's director of environmental coordination, has winnowed the list of 15 open-space sites to the 6 that are most at risk of being developed; all but one of them are on the North Shore.""They're either currently owned by developers or they're on the market and they will be developed if the county doesn't purchase them,"" he said.Mr. Maher said that the county expected to have willing sellers at all six sites and that the six projects should add up to about $38 million.The six open-space sites considered priority purchases are the Meyers farm in Woodbury, one of the county's five remaining farms; Red Spring Woods, an old-growth forest in Glen Cove; an undeveloped peninsula in Baldwin Harbor on Parkway Drive; the Boegner estate, which borders Old Westbury Gardens; the Northwood estate in Oyster Bay Cove, which is next to the county Tiffany Creek Preserve; and the Pulling estate, another Oyster Bay Cove estate, which sits in a deepwater recharge area.The park projects include geese control in a West Hempstead park, a new playground in Seaford, new landscaping in Great Neck and Locust Valley and new ball fields in Roosevelt.Storm-water projects include treatment devices and catch basins, primarily in communities on the South Shore. And brownfield remediation includes the demolition of an incinerator in Long Beach and cleanup of contaminated land in Westbury, Freeport and Roosevelt.In recent weeks, several legislators have made clear their disappointment, saying their districts have been slighted, and they are still negotiating with county officials to find financing for their projects.Edward P. Mangano, a Republican legislator from Bethpage, wants open space at the former Grumman property in Bethpage preserved. David L. Mejias, a Democrat from North Massapequa, wants the county to help buy a contaminated industrial site in Farmingdale.But the legislator who environmentalists feared might cause the most trouble was David Denenberg, a Democrat from Merrick who is chairman of the Legislature's committee on planning, development and the environment. Mr. Denenberg was concerned because the dredging of the privately owned Merokee Pond, which is in his district, would be only partly paid for under the plan.A few weeks ago, when the plan seemed seriously threatened by the bickering, Mr. Suozzi asked Mr. Denenberg to help him bring the Legislature together. Mr. Denenberg said in an interview that he was still unhappy about Merokee Pond but was nonetheless helping with negotiations.""The truth is the Legislature hasn't held a thing up, because there's no formal plan yet,"" Mr. Denenberg said. ""There's been a lot of pressure for the Legislature to pass the plan as it is, and they're asking us to rubber-stamp something before we've even gotten the envelope.""Ms. Jacobs, the Democratic majority leader, said that legislators were merely advocating for the interests of their districts.""But I think everyone understands that even if there isn't a project in their district, what happens in others will affect their water flow and their environment,"" she said. They also realize, Ms. Jacobs added, ""that if there's any further delay now, it could very well be put on our shoulders, and we're not going to take any chances.""Neal Lewis, the executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network and a member of the Planning Commission, said he believed the review process had so far gone as smoothly as might be expected.""I look at it as the glass being half full,"" he said. ""They could be all going on about what they didn't get. There were several legislators that made proposals that didn't get recommended, but they didn't all jump up and scream.""Final approval of the plan, Mr. Lewis said, will be ""kind of a test of the Legislature to see if they can rise to the occasion to evaluate things on the merits and not be petty.""Environmentalists and county officials agree that the hundreds of proposals that were presented to the advisory committee and all the subsequent wrangling were proof of the county's need to find more ways to preserve open space and the environment.They also agree that Nassau should consider another environmental bond issue. ""But not until we get through this approval process,"" Mr. Suozzi said.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','On Apple's iTunes, which sold a billion tracks in its first three years, classical music reportedly accounts for 12 percent of sales, four times its share of the CD market. Both Sony-BMG and Universal say that as their download sales have increased, CD sales have remained steady, suggesting that downloaders are a new market, not simply the same consumers switching formats.In their first six weeks on iTunes, the New York Philharmonic's download-only Mozart concert sold 2,000 complete copies and about 1,000 individual tracks, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic's two Minimalist concerts, combined, sold 900 copies and about 400 individual tracks. Those numbers, though small by pop standards, exceed what might be expected from sales of orchestral music on standard CD's.Other orchestras are catching on: the Milwaukee Symphony and Philharmonia Baroque in San Francisco offer downloads on their own Web sites. And the major labels are planning to sell downloads of archival recordings that will not be reissued on CD.In concert halls, season subscriptions have plummeted in favor of last-minute ticket sales. That doesn't mean the business is tanking, however, just that audiences have shifted their habits. As two-income families have grown busier, potential ticket buyers are less inclined to commit to performances months in advance (or as ticket prices climb, to accept predetermined concert packages). But as much as orchestras and concert presenters would prefer to sell their tickets before the season starts, the seats are hardly empty.Neither are the stages. The American Symphony Orchestra League puts the number of orchestras in the United States at 1,800 (350 of them professional). The 1,800 ensembles give about 36,000 concerts a year, 30 percent more than in 1994. And in the most recent season for which the league has published figures, 2003-4, orchestras reported an 8 percent increase in operating revenues against a 7 percent increase in expenses, with deficits dropping to 1.1 percent from 2.7 percent of their annual budgets from the previous season.Meanwhile corners of the field generally ignored in discussions of classical music's mortality — most notably, early music and new music — are true growth industries. When Lincoln Center presented a 10-concert celebration of the composer Osvaldo Golijov this season, there wasn't a spare ticket to be found. The Miller Theater's Gyorgy Ligeti series packed them in as well. And though the Los Angeles Philharmonic's Minimalist Jukebox festival sold slightly fewer tickets than its regular programming, it drew a younger crowd: 25 percent of the audience was said to be under 45 (compared with 15 percent normally), and 10 percent was 25 to 34 (compared with 2 percent).By relying heavily on contemporary programs and concerts of Renaissance and Baroque works, Miller has achieved an 84 percent increase in ticket sales since 2002, and this season's box office receipts have exceeded last season's by $100,000.Zankel Hall, the newly built, high-tech, adventurously programmed addition to Carnegie Hall, has produced a steady increase in sold-out houses, from 57 percent of its concerts in 2003-4 (its first season) to 63 percent in the first third of the current season. At Carnegie's main hall and its smaller Weill Recital Hall, ticket sales have been fairly steady since 1982, with 565,000 tickets sold in a slow year and 635,000 in an exceptional one (most recently 2003).The classical music world has even found a silver lining in the reports about its imminent death. Fund-raising letters now allude to classical music's parlous state as a way of shaking larger donations from supporters. And when EMI needed a marketing hook for Plácido Domingo's ""Tristan und Isolde,"" it jumped on predictions that it would be the last studio recording of an opera.Finally, concert halls are sprouting like mushrooms. New symphony halls are about to open in Miami, Nashville and Costa Mesa, Calif. (not far from the newly opened Disney Hall in Los Angeles), and Toronto is opening a new opera house in September. Clearly, someone sees a future for this music.UNDERLYING many of the jeremiads is what might be called golden ageism: the belief, bordering on an article of faith, that everything was better, both artistically and commercially, in the relatively recent past.To a degree, the golden ageists have a point. From the 1920's through the 70's, classical music was plentiful on the radio and on nascent television. Variety shows like ""The Bell Telephone Hour"" and ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" presented both top names and newcomers, and networks offered symphony concerts, opera and seductive introductory shows like Leonard Bernstein's ""Young People's Concerts"" in prime time.There was a vogue for films built around classical music and musicians as well: ""100 Men and a Girl,"" with Leopold Stokowski (1937), and ""They Shall Have Music,"" with Jascha Heifetz (1939); ""Humoresque,"" with Isaac Stern on its soundtrack (1946); biographical films like ""Rhapsody in Blue"" (1945); and extravaganzas like ""Fantasia"" (1940).All this made classical music's reigning stars — from Toscanini to Bernstein, from Heifetz to Stern, from Horowitz to Van Cliburn — household names in a way that only Luciano Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo and Yo-Yo Ma are now.But the disappearance of this exposure is hardly a lethal wound. Though classical radio stations have become scarce in most cities, the Internet offers a global radio dial. The Internet radio audience is said to be small at the moment, but people who want it will find it. When the BBC offered a Beethoven symphony cycle as a free download last year, 1.4 million people took up the offer. And if classical music is now scarce on television, with even PBS cutting back, DVD labels are pouring out everything from long-forgotten TV performances to newly produced symphonic, chamber and recital discs.The golden age of concertgoing, meanwhile, is at least partly a matter of idealized memory. Organizations did not collect demographic information then, but musicians and critics who attended concerts during those years remember the audience as always middle-aged (and concert videos bear out those memories). And despite the music's greater visibility in daily life, it was a niche market even then. The pianist Gary Graffman said recently that when he began attending New York Philharmonic concerts at Carnegie Hall in the 1940's and 50's empty seats were plentiful. And among the great soloists, he added, only Heifetz, Rubinstein and Horowitz could expect to sell out Carnegie Hall.At the time Carnegie was undisputedly the city's premier hall, with Town Hall, Hunter College and the Metropolitan Museum of Art as the principal chamber music and recital halls. Carnegie Recital Hall (now Weill) and the Frick Collection offered chamber concerts as well, and McMillin (now Miller) Theater at Columbia University was a hot spot for new music. When Lincoln Center was planned in the late 1950's, Carnegie Hall narrowly escaped the wrecker's ball. It was thought, however briefly, that two large halls were an extravagance New York didn't need and couldn't sustain.Consider how things have changed since Philharmonic (now Avery Fisher) Hall opened in 1962. Carnegie, until then a rental hall, began doing its own presentations, and it now offers about 200 concerts a year. Lincoln Center — with its two opera houses, Avery Fisher Hall for orchestras and star-turn recitals and Alice Tully Hall (opened in 1969) for chamber music — quickly undertook its own presentations as well: some 400 annually now, extending to halls and churches beyond its campus.The 92nd Street Y revived its long-dormant concert series in 1974, and Merkin Concert Hall went up in 1978. Carnegie added Zankel Hall in 2003, and Lincoln Center opened the Rose Theater and the Allen Room — intended mostly for jazz but sometimes used for new-music concerts — in 2004.Meanwhile the Metropolitan Museum and the Frick Collection remained committed to classical concerts. Small- to medium-size halls at the French Institute/Alliance Française, Scandinavia House and the Austrian Cultural Forum have opened since the late 1980's. And the Morgan Library and Museum opened a new chamber music hall this month.That's in Manhattan. Just across the rivers, the same period brought a revival of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the construction of the Tilles Center on Long Island and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark and the advent of small but successful enterprises like Bargemusic.In the deficit column? Town Hall and Hunter College have largely abandoned classical music, although each offers a handful of concerts. But apart from the old Metropolitan Opera House, demolished when the Met moved to Lincoln Center, no halls have closed in New York since Lincoln Center opened.The concert world has expanded in other ways too. Through the 1950's the music season ran less than 30 weeks. But in 1964 the New York Philharmonic negotiated a 52-week contract with its players. Other orchestras quickly followed suit, and the season grew longer. The Mostly Mozart Festival cropped up in 1966 and spawned similar series around the country. And in 1967 the Ford Foundation began giving orchestras grants for even greater expansion, in most cases, more concerts each week.The nightly offerings in classical music are immensely more plentiful and varied now than during the supposed golden age. The wonder isn't that audiences fluctuate from night to night or that empty seats can be spotted. It's that so much competition can be sustained in a field usually portrayed as moribund.One way to keep the gloomy reports in perspective is to understand that the rumored death of classical music has been with us for a very long time.The Metropolitan Opera was in almost constant financial peril between 1929 and 1944, and there were dicey moments in the 70's. The orchestra world's 1960's expansion caused anxiety as well. In an essay in The New York Times on Sept. 3, 1967, ""Do We Have Too Much Music in America?,"" John O. Crosby, the founder of the Santa Fe Opera, worried that the audience was insufficient to support the blossoming 52-week orchestra contracts.Those worries were soon born out. In ""Dip in Concert Audiences Troubles Impresarios"" (Dec. 21, 1968), The Times reported that classical music ticket sales had dropped as much as 40 percent. The reasons included everything from the distractions of television and recordings to street crime, parking difficulties and high ticket prices, meaning a $15 top at the Met and ""as much as $8.80"" for ""other prestige events."" Young people reading these reports would have had little reason to expect the classical music world to exist in 2006. But now that those same people have begun ""graying,"" are they joining it? Demographic information over the couple of decades institutions have been collecting it suggests that they are. For whatever reasons — changes in taste, a desire to expand their musical experiences, a lack of interest in current pop — middle-aged listeners continue to join the audience. And the generational shift is coloring both programming and performance.Listeners now in their 50's — the core classical audience — were the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960's and 70's. For those already interested in classical music during their student years, Shostakovich, Ives and Mahler were musical obsessions, and the early-music boom was a campus phenomenon. All that music, marginal in the 70's, joined the mainstream as those listeners became performers and ticket buyers.Classically inclined boomers were also new-music agnostics, at home with the rigorous atonality of the previous generation but also open to a trippy avant-garde scene that ran from Cage to the Minimalists. That has had a telling effect too: witness the standing ovations Elliott Carter's music now gets at symphony concerts and the rock-star popularity of John Adams and Philip Glass.At the same time this generation's fascination with pop has influenced its composers (and younger ones), who draw on the energy of rock. They have also left behind their elders' bias against amplification and sound processing, which they use not simply to increase the volume but also to expand their palettes of timbre. A fascination with world music, which also has roots in the 1960's, has stretched those palettes further.All this is changing the classical repertory, and to judge from the comparatively young audiences to be seen at concerts by daring groups like the Kronos Quartet and Alarm Will Sound, it is more likely to rejuvenate classical music than kill it.Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"" observation about relationships and sharks — that both must either move forward or die — also works for culture. In classical music, lots of people really just want the dead shark. They pine for the days when Bernstein, Reiner, Szell and Toscanini stood on the podium, with Heifetz fiddling, Horowitz at the piano and Callas and Tebaldi locked in a perpetual diva war. Most of all they want their repertory dials set between 1785 and 1920.You can send those people your condolences.For the rest of us, the shark is still moving. We're getting our revivals of Machaut and Rameau along with vigorous reconsiderations of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and Mahler and a varied gallery of contemporary composers. We may be hearing much of this in small, high-tech halls instead of cavernous temples of the arts or finding it online instead of in shops or on the radio. But it's all there, constantly renewing itself. You just have to grab onto the dorsal fin.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','Advertising was called the ""folklore of industrial society"" as early as the 1950's, when Marshall McLuhan used that phrase. Back then, though, the tools required to fashion and disseminate the images and stories of industrial products to the masses were available only to industry (or rather to the advertising agencies hired by industry). Today the folk — or at least much of the middle class — have those tools, too, and in recent years have shown a surprising willingness to use them on behalf of brands. Converse has solicited consumer-made commercials for a couple of years and has received more than a thousand; lately General Motors, MasterCard and others have asked for, and received, contributions to their marketing efforts from the grass roots. Perhaps the most famous consumer-created ad — a computer animation of flying iPods made by a California teacher — was made and distributed without any input from the makers of the product.It makes sense that Firefox, the Web browser distributed by the Mozilla Corporation, would try this approach: the software, which claims more than 50 million active users, is an ""open source"" project, meaning that something like 1,000 people made contributions to its underlying code. Since the folk helped build the product, the folk may as well help spread its lore. Late last year, the ""Firefox Flicks"" ad contest was announced: competitors were asked to submit a ""broadcast quality"" 30-second spot, to be judged by a panel of pros from the film, television and advertising businesses. There were 280 submissions ""from Firefox enthusiasts around the world,"" according to the company. The winner was titled ""Daredevil,"" in which a teenage girl, who says ""I love things fast,"" talks about surfing (the tag is ""My other browser is a surfboard""). The second-place spot — in which representations of rival browsers acted flashy and stupid (Internet Explorer kept chanting, ""Wheee!"" like an idiot) while Firefox quietly did its job — came out on top in a sort of people's-choice parallel contest, getting an average five-star rating from 29,000 voters. It received an additional 23,000 or so views on the Web site YouTube, where it also inspired at least one parody.The rise of consumer-generated advertising can be viewed as either a boon to brands (outsourcing marketing to loyal customers) or a threat (handing marketing over to a bunch of uncontrollable amateurs). When G.M. solicited consumer input in online ad-making for its Chevy Tahoe, many people responded with anti-S.U.V. messages. Grant McCracken, an author, anthropologist and consultant, takes a broader view, describing consumer involvement as a kind of branding Reformation: marketing professionals used to be the high-priest gatekeepers, but now we can all have a direct relationship with the Almighty Brand. He refers to this as brand ""co-creation"" (a term he credits to C.K. Prahalad, a business professor at the University of Michigan), and sees it as both inevitable and smart, even in the case of the Tahoe controversy. ""The era of the brand that's blandly constructed and hopes not to offend anyone — to be pleasant — that notion is really dead,"" McCracken says.But why do consumers want to get involved in this co-creation? ""They want to because they can,"" McCracken says, meaning that both the technological tools and a deeply ingrained knowledge of advertising grammar are now widely dispersed. ""And some of them can do it really, really well."" What is probably most surprising about the Firefox ads is how much they resemble the traditional work of the ad world's high priests. Firefox is considering buying air time for some spots. Interestingly, the open-source company still believes in some old-school strategies; it once even collected donations from its fans to buy, of all things, an ad in The New York Times.Or maybe the professional polish of the grass roots isn't surprising. As it happens, Pete Macomber, the creator of the winning ""Daredevil"" spot, is — aside from being a Firefox user — an aspiring director. The maker of ""Wheee!"" Jeff Gill, is a Savannah College of Art and Design junior who is studying animation and calls himself ""a huge contest guy."" So as much as their ads may be examples of ""co-creation,"" they also may be examples of ""co-promotion."" This makes a certain kind of sense, given what has and hasn't changed in the half-century since McLuhan's assertion about the folklore of an industrial society: promotion, marketing, persuasion — these things may not add up to folklore, but perhaps they are the common language of a consumer society.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','No. I don't think he is going to give us more information. I think he is a little smoother and slicker and he is trying to master how to give you a karate chop and still smile.You yourself favor the blunt-instrument approach and were known to have asked McClellan, on an almost daily basis, why the administration persisted in bombing ""innocent Iraqis.""I am sure I irritated him. But at the same time, we were still on speaking terms when he left. I wrote him a note wishing him great success in his future. We were friends, in a superficial way.It sounds as if you basically liked him as a human being.I would call that dodging the question.No, I do like all human beings, but it's what they make of themselves that really hurts sometimes.How did you feel when President Bush, or rather his aides, banished you from your longtime front-row perch at White House press conferences?That was on March 6, 2003. I didn't want to be in the back row, and more than that, I would have liked to be called on. I would have asked the president, ""Why are we going to war?"" This is the most secretive administration I have ever covered.Have you ever requested a sit-down interview with President Bush?No. I didn't think it was possible, and I don't like to be ignored or turned down.Are you concerned that the members of the Bush administration seem to give most of their interviews to Fox News?,No. It's always good to hear whatever anyone in power has to say, and if Fox has the access, good. If they can produce the news, that's what we want. We want the people to be informed.In your new book, your criticism extends to Democrats as well, including L.B.J., who demonized reporters as ""spies.""L.B.J. was actually talkative, and we got a lot of insight into his emotional roller coaster during Vietnam. He was secretive and paranoid in some ways, but it was interesting; you always kind of knew what was going on. He would tell you something and then say, ""That's all off the record,"" at the same time that you knew he wanted you to write it.He kept secrets, but I didn't have this sense of ""Darkness at Noon.""At 85, do you ever take vacations?Not in a long time. My vacation is to go to my apartment horizontal.How would you define the difference between a probing question and a rude one?I don't think there are any rude questions. I don't even like reporters to say thank you.But you're the one who officially said, ""Thank you, Mr. President,"" at the close of every press conference until 2003, when the practice was abruptly discontinued.""Thank you"" is fine at the end of a press conference. But I don't think you thank the president every time he answers a question. That's his job.In which case, I won't thank you for granting this interview, lest you judge me too deferential.Oh, no. Listen. I love it when people thank me.'"
"'06-05-28,'0','""One of my favorite Disney cartoons is 'Susie, the Little Blue Coupe,' "" he added. But nostalgia of another sort played a part too. ""I was at exactly the right age when Hot Wheels came out,"" explained Mr. Lasseter, 49, speaking of Mattel's toy cars. ""I remember buying my first two Hot Wheels cars with my allowance, and I was hooked from then on.""""Cars"" tells the story of Lightning McQueen (voice by Owen Wilson), an ambitious, arrogant young racing car out to win his first Piston Cup Championship, and the fame and endorsements that go with it. When he's accidentally stranded in the tiny town of Radiator Springs, he learns the importance of love, friendship and discipline from its eccentric inhabitants. His misfit teachers include Sally, a perky Porsche (Bonnie Hunt); Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet whose gruff demeanor conceals a surprising past (Paul Newman); and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a ramshackle old tow truck who's clearly not the shiniest vehicle on the lot.To make ""Cars,"" Mr. Lasseter used a combination of design and motion to turn full-size automobiles into characters with recognizable personalities but that still feel like heavy steel-and-glass machines. Traditional squash-and-stretch animation of the characters' faces and bodies made the autos look too rubbery, and the usual way of putting a face on a machine proved equally unsatisfactory.""The natural eyes of a car are the headlights,"" he explained. ""Moving the eyes to the windshield separates them from the front of the face; the hood becomes the nose and the mouth is down by the grille. Now the body of the car becomes the head of the character, and you can gesture with the front tires when he talks. That design gave the animators more opportunities for acting, because the movement of the chassis over the tires feels almost like a head moving in relation to the shoulders. But to make it really believable, we had to move the cars in ways that maintained their integrity. I kept telling the animators, they're going to look like real cars, so let's move them like they weigh 3,000 pounds.""Moving the car characters and adding realistic reflections and other details posed formidable problems. "" 'Cars' was a really difficult film technically,"" said Ms. Anderson, the producer. ""It's the most complex film we've ever made."" Even with a network of processors that ran four times faster than the ones on ""The Incredibles,"" each frame of ""Cars"" took an average of 17 hours to render.As for the town of Radiator Springs, the quirky desert hamlet on Route 66, it provides a reminder of the less homogenized America Mr. Lasseter saw as a boy.""For a lot of our vacations, my brother and sister and I would pile into the station wagon, and our parents would drive Route 66 from L.A.,"" he recalled. ""When they started building the Interstate, my dad would drive it for parts of our journeys and say, 'Now we can really make time.' But the Interstate was so smooth, you'd lose track of where you were. When you drove Route 66, you really felt the land. You knew where it was hilly and where it was flat. On the Interstate it was all flat.""The melancholy images of the forgotten town balance the fast-paced racing scenes and broad comic sequences. Mr. Lasseter says his use of these moments was inspired by the films of Hayao Miyazaki, the Japanese animation director.""In every one,"" he said, ""there are beautiful quiet scenes. The drive in our early films was to trim out all the 'dead spots,' because the executives were always saying: 'I'm going for popcorn.' 'You're losing me.' After a while I realized I wasn't going to lose the audience. The executives were used to seeing the movie, but the audience wouldn't be. They'd be with us in those moments.""An early graduate of the character animation program at the California Institute of the Arts, Mr. Lasseter was trained at the Disney studio by members some of the legendary Nine Old Men, Walt Disney's celebrated cadre of animators. In addition to Mr. Miyazaki, Mr. Lasseter cites lessons he learned from his mentors Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston and from the films they made for Disney, who maintained that a laugh should be balanced with a tear. Disney also believed that for an audience to be touched, the emotions had to be genuine, arising from the characters and their situations.""Frank and Ollie always said the thing to strive to get into a film is heart, or pathos,"" Mr. Lasseter said. ""To really get the audience to feel that heart, they have to discover the emotion for themselves. You can't tell them to feel sad.""Last August the cast and crew of ""Cars"" got their own dose of pathos when Joe Ranft, the film's co-director, was killed in a car accident. He provided the voices for Heimlich the caterpillar in ""A Bug's Life"" and Red the firetruck in ""Cars,"" and was widely respected within the animation industry as one of the best story men of his generation. ""Cars"" is dedicated to Mr. Ranft's memory, and Mr. Lasseter's usually ebullient voice softens when he talks about his friend and collaborator. He sometimes still speaks of him in the present tense:""Joe has been by my side on every movie I've made from the very beginning. He was such a big, lovable guy that no matter what mood I was in, he could make me laugh immediately. Joe's personal humor didn't come from funny lines or quips, but the characters he would become. The brilliance of his story work in each of our films lies in the strength and individuality of the characters he developed. His heart runs all the way through this picture.""Disney's $7.4 billion acquisition of Pixar was announced just as Mr. Lasseter was finishing ""Cars,"" triggering widespread speculation, both inside and outside the animation world, about how he will juggle his life as a director while continuing to oversee Pixar and revitalizing Disney's feature animation studio.""I've always worn two hats at Pixar: I'm the creative head of the studio and I'm a film director,"" he said. ""I directed the first three movies at the studio, but it was important to build Pixar into a place where other directors could make their movies and I would help them.""After 'Monsters,' 'Nemo' and 'Incredibles,' it was my turn again. Andrew Stanton, who's vice president of creative, oversaw the other projects while I was on 'Cars.' His next movie is kicking in now, so it's time for me to take the executive role. I'll be overseeing two studios — for a while anyway. But I love directing, and hope to direct again.""Dick Cook, the chairman of Walt Disney Pictures, offered a reassuring message about Mr. Lasseter's future prospects as a filmmaker.""I think initially John is going to have his hands full, but it's certainly our hope that once he has things going and feels comfortable, he'll direct a movie,"" Mr. Cook said. ""John's got too many great stories to tell not to direct again. When he feels the time is right, and he has the right project, he'll step back in. It's too much a part of him not to. And I think it's to everyone's advantage for him to do so.""'"

"'06-05-29,'0','But the plan has run into resistance from lawmakers who are concerned that it may increase the risk of an accidental nuclear confrontation. The Trident II missile that would be used for the attacks is a system that has long been equipped with a nuclear payload. Indeed, both nonnuclear and nuclear-tipped variants of the Trident II missile would be loaded on the same submarines under the Pentagon plan.""There is great concern this could be destabilizing in terms of deterrence and nuclear policy,"" said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""It would be hard to determine if a missile coming out a Trident submarine is conventional or nuclear.""Reflecting the worry that Russia and other nations might misinterpret the launch of a nonnuclear Trident as the opening salvo in a nuclear barrage, lawmakers have insisted that the Bush administration present a plan to minimize that risk before the new weapon is manufactured and deployed.The program to develop a conventional version of the Trident II missile was foreshadowed in the Nuclear Posture Review, a classified study the Pentagon carried out in 2001. The study urged that nonnuclear systems be added to the existing triad of long-range nuclear air, land and sea forces — a concept that the military nicknamed ""Global Strike.""The Strategic Command, which oversees the long-range nuclear weapons in the United States arsenal, was given the responsibility to figure out a way to develop such a capability. In 2004, General Cartwright, a Marine officer, was appointed to head the command.In looking for a new weapon, General Cartwright said, his goal was a nonnuclear system that could respond to a threat in no more than an hour, including the time that would be needed to secure the president's authorization to attack.""We have laid out in the construct the idea of an hour,"" General Cartwright said in an interview.Neither bombers nor cruise missiles met General Cartwright's requirement because he reasoned that the threat might emerge in a region where the United States lacked bases or had few or no forces. It can take days for the United States to move aircraft and ships into a crisis zone and position them to strike. Bombers can attack remote targets from the United States or bases abroad, but it takes many hours to conduct such a mission.So the Strategic Command developed a plan to fit conventional warheads on existing Trident II ballistic missiles. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has wholeheartedly supported the idea, and the Pentagon wants to field the system in two years.In justifying the program to lawmakers, General Cartwright outlined a number of potential situations. ""The argument for doing it is that there are instances, fairly rare, when time is so critical that if you can't strike in an hour or so you are going to miss that opportunity,"" said Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett, the Maryland Republican who is chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Projection Forces and who is still weighing whether to support the plan.One possible situation, Mr. Bartlett said, would be ""people putting together some terrorist weapon, and while they are putting it together we can take it out, and if we miss that opportunity it may show up on the streets of New York City or Washington, D.C.""Still another might involve the need to destroy an enemy missile equipped with a chemical, biological or nuclear warhead before an adversary can launch it at the United States or its allies. Another would be fresh intelligence about a meeting of terrorists.Given the considerable American military presence in Iraq, Afghanistan and South Korea, some critics say the circumstances in which a target may be beyond the reach of American warplanes or armed Predator drones are few indeed. Acquiring the sort of precise intelligence that would give the president enough confidence to order the launch of a ballistic missile within an hour might also be a daunting proposition.General Cartwright said that the weapon would give the president an option to respond quickly to the sort of immediate dangers that are most likely to become more common in the 21st century without taking the drastic step of resorting to a nuclear-armed ballistic missile.A major issue, however, is whether the Pentagon will prepare for new threats at the risk of aggravating old nuclear risks. Under the Pentagon plan, each Trident submarine would carry two of the nonnuclear Trident II missiles along with 22 nuclear-armed Trident missiles. Each of the nonnuclear missiles would carry four nonexplosive warheads. Two types of warheads would be developed. One type would be a metal slug that would land with such tremendous force it could smash a building. The other type of warhead would be a flechette bomb, which would disperse tungsten rods to destroy vehicles and less well-protected targets over a broader area.As currently configured, the weapon would not have the capability to destroy facilities that are buried deeply underground. The system would use satellite tracking to improve its accuracy. General Cartwright asserted that a test demonstrated that a nonnuclear version of the missile could fly thousands of miles and deliver its payload just five yards away from its target.Two former defense secretaries, James R. Schlesinger and Howard Brown, weighed in with an op-ed article last week in The Washington Post, urging the Congress to support the system.The worry about Russia centers on whether that country could distinguish the launch of a Trident II from a nuclear strike, especially since its early warning network has deteriorated since the collapse of the Soviet Union. There is also some concern about China, which has a meager capability to detect incoming ballistic missiles.""For nations like China that have a developing capability and are not totally blind but can see just a little, what would you see?"" Mr. Bartlett asked. ""We need to be cognizant of the potential for people to misunderstand what they would see.""The Senate Armed Services Committee has insisted that the administration report on how it would mitigate such risks before money can be spent to manufacture or deploy the missiles.In a parallel move, the House Armed Services Committee has asked Mr. Rumsfeld to report on discussions that have been held with other nations on this issue and to provide a detailed explanation of how the weapons would be used. The House committee also sought to slow the program by cutting most of the funds sought for the research and development of the new warhead.General Cartwright said a number of measures could be taken to reduce the risk of miscalculation. One step would be to notify Russia and other nations when the United States launched a conventional Trident II missile. Another, he said, would be allowing foreign nations to monitor tests of the system.""We are going to put a target area in the ocean so people can actually see what it looks like when it hits the earth and don't confuse this with a mushroom cloud,"" he said.General Cartwright said the United States was examining whether the missile could be launched from parts of the ocean that would not put the missile on a trajectory toward Russian territory. The United States has also pushed for an American-Russian center where early warning data could be shared. But the talks over that proposal are bogged down.Arms control experts are divided over the wisdom of the plan. Steve Andreasen, a former defense specialist for the National Security Council, said the program would undermine American security by eliminating the taboo about the use of long-range missiles and diverting funds from other pressing defense needs.""Long-range ballistic missiles have never been used in combat in 50 years,"" Mr. Andreasen said. ""Once the U.S. starts signaling that it views these missiles as no different than any other weapon, other nations will adopt the same logic.""Bruce Blair, the president of the World Security Institute and a former Minuteman missile launch control officer, said the weapon would continue a welcome trend toward substituting conventional weapons for nuclear systems, assuming that adequate safeguards can be worked out to avoid the risk of inadvertent nuclear confrontation.""They make a lot more sense than 14 subs loaded to the gills with nuclear-armed Trident missiles in this day and age,"" Mr. Blair said.The Russians, for their part, seem to have little interest in facilitating Congressional approval of a new American weapons system. During his recent trip to Russia, General Cartwright sought to explain the rationale for program to Gen. Yuri Baluyevski, the chief of the Russian General Staff.""The things that I tried to talk to him about were the common issues that we face — the fact that terrorists and organizations are getting capabilities that are significant and are likely to stay on a trend that could be associated with weapons of mass destruction,"" General Cartwright said.After that discussion, General Baluyevski continued to stir up opposition to the plan. ""As our American colleagues often tell us, these missiles could be used to kill bin Laden,"" he told reporters earlier this month. ""This could be a costly move which not only won't guarantee his destruction but could provoke an irreversible response from a nuclear-armed state which can't determine what warhead is fitted on the missile.""'"
"'06-05-29,'0','""If she had reinjured her ankle before the schedule was made, we would absolutely have tried to respect that,"" said Stephane Simian, the tournament's sports director. ""We try to protect the players as much as possible.""Simian said he had not received a request to delay Sharapova's start before the draw. ""There was no request to the WTA; no request to me,"" he said. ""Then she hurt it again after we released the schedule. There was nothing we could do about it.""Sharapova said that it was ""a very difficult decision"" to play and that she made it only after being reassured by the results of a magnetic resonance imaging scan on Friday night. Once on the court — in cool, late-afternoon conditions — she swept through the first set in 29 minutes.But Washington, who said she came into the match with a sore neck, began to loosen up and play some remarkable shots from difficult angles.Washington, the 29-year-old sister of the former Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington, could also draw strength from having beaten Sharapova in the second round of the 2004 Pilot Pen tournament in New Haven.It was soon one set apiece, and Sharapova called for a trainer to rewrap her ankle. But the momentum did not shift again until Washington was ahead by 5-2. At that stage, a less intense competitor might have taken the hint and started preparing for Wimbledon, the only Grand Slam tournament the 19-year-old Sharapova has won.Instead, Sharapova dug in her heels and started playing and moving better. She saved the first match point at 30-40 in the eighth game with a wide, kicking first serve and a forehand winner. When the next match point came on Washington's serve at 5-3, two pigeons landed on Sharapova's side of the court, delaying Washington's delivery. Washington ended up losing the point with a backhand unforced error.It looked like an omen, unless you talked to Washington. ""What pigeons?"" she said.Sharapova said, ""They're my best friends.""A return in the net gave Washington one more match point, but this time Sharapova ripped a short forehand winner. ""You never have the match until they say, 'Game, set and match,' "" Washington said. ""So I didn't think I had it won at that point.""Sharapova completed her great escape by reeling off the next five games, with Washington double-faulting to lose her serve at 5-5.""I was calling 1-800-British Airways in the third set,"" Sharapova said.Federer had a few surprises of his own against Hartfield, a 25-year-old Argentine qualifier who was playing in his first tour-level match.After less than half an hour against Federer, Hartfield was up two breaks of serve, leading by 3-0 and 40-15 on his own serve. He later served for the opening set at 5-4 and eventually pushed Federer to a second-set tie breaker by playing aggressive, opportunistic tennis and using his good two-handed backhand.Knowledge is power in tennis, and Hartfield had seen a whole lot more of Federer's game — albeit on television — than Federer had seen of Hartfield's.""I never heard his name,"" Federer said. ""First time I saw him was five minutes before the match.""Even for a tennis savant, it takes time to figure out tendencies, and what might have made it tougher was Federer's lack of enthusiasm for playing on the first Sunday.The decision to open the tournament on Sunday was made despite initial resistance from the men's and women's tours in the hope of increasing ticket revenue and global exposure.""There were a lot of families today,"" Simian said of the crowd of 27,923.""There was a great atmosphere, great matches. It's exactly what tennis needs, to have more exposure for players and its top events. The entertainment environment is very competitive.""It was not a full-blown opening day. Only six men's matches and six women's matches were scheduled — all in the top halves of the singles draws — and only the three stadium courts were used.Federer said he had no problem with the motive behind the decision to extend the tournament to 15 days. He did have a problem with a two-day break between his first- and second-round matches.""I didn't want to be the guy who starts the tournament,"" Federer said.""I was never happy about that idea. I told everybody that I didn't want to play Sunday.""Nonetheless, he will now have one more day of rest than his next opponent: Justin Gimelstob or Alejandro Falla of Colombia, who were not scheduled to play until Monday.Simian said the decision was made to open with the top half of the draw because Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick, each in the bottom half, are trying to recover from recent injuries. Simian also said that the tournament directors decided that the top men's and women's player in each half selected should be showcased on Sunday.That meant Federer and, in the women's draw, No. 1-seeded Amélie Mauresmo of France.Mauresmo advanced with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Meghann Shaughnessy. But even after playing one of her more convincing French Open matches, Mauresmo was not ready to give a wholehearted thumbs up to her home Grand Slam event's new schedule.""We were not really in favor,"" she said of the women's tour. ""Now it's there, so we adapt.""'"
"'06-05-29,'0','PARIS, May 28 (AP) — Andy Roddick got through a second practice session at Roland Garros on his injured left ankle with no apparent problems Sunday, and his coach said Roddick would probably play at the French Open.""It looks that way right now,"" said John Roddick, Andy's older brother and coach. ""The progress has been faster than we expected, and with the Tuesday start, it looks good.""The French Open, a clay-court Grand Slam tournament, started Sunday — a day earlier than normal — and the first round is being stretched over three days. Roddick's portion of the draw is in action Tuesday; he is scheduled to face Alberto Martin of Spain.The fifth-seeded Roddick moved around more during Sunday's training session on Court 18 at the far end of Roland Garros than he did Saturday. He did not appear to be having trouble with the ankle, although he did complain that his shoes were not giving him much stability on the red clay.Roddick, the 2003 United States Open champion and former top-ranked player, sprained ligaments in the ankle Wednesday at the World Team Cup in Düsseldorf, Germany.'"
"'06-05-29,'0','CANNES, France, May 28 — ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley,"" a film about the Irish rebellion against British rule and the country's subsequent civil war, won the top prize at the 59th Cannes Film Festival on Sunday. This was the 13th time Ken Loach, at 69 the oldest director in competition this year, had brought a film to Cannes. He has won several prizes, but never before the Palme d'Or. This year he got lucky.Speaking in French and English, Mr. Loach, with his customary quiet directness, said he hoped his movie — one of several war films shown during the festival — might represent ""a little step in the British confronting their imperial history.""""Maybe if we tell the truth about the past, we can tell the truth about the present,"" he added.An unspecified modern war, albeit one with obvious allusions to Afghanistan and Iraq, is at the center of Bruno Dumont's ""Flandres,"" the runner-up, taking the Grand Prize. This is the second time Mr. Dumont, one of the most controversial of contemporary French directors, has won that honor. When his ""Humanité"" won in 1999, it caused a minor scandal, an event not repeated this year, although many festivalgoers were nonetheless surprised — some unpleasantly, given Mr. Dumont's brutal, dehumanizing world view — by the award.In a striking departure from tradition, the competition jury, headed by the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai, spread the wealth this year by dividing the prizes for best actor and actress among a total of 10 actors and actresses: the ""family"" of women in Pedro Almodóvar's ""Volver"" and the ""brotherhood"" in Rachid Bouchareb's ""Indigènes"" (""Days of Glory""). Perhaps the presence of so many actors on the jury — five of the nine members, among them the Italian bombshell Monica Bellucci, the lovely Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang and Samuel L. Jackson, perennially one of the coolest men in Hollywood — inspired this generosity.Mr. Almodóvar sat alone, clapping, as five of his actresses, including Penélope Cruz and Carmen Maura, accepted their collective prize for what many considered the finest film in competition. It was a bittersweet moment as the cast members, obviously overcome with emotion, thanked their director while blowing him kisses from the stage. ""I think this award really belongs to Pedro,"" Ms. Cruz said. ""You are the greatest, the greatest. Thank you so much for what you do for women."" Mr. Almodóvar later took the stage to accept the award for best screenplay, a consolation prize that seemed a disappointment, not only to him.Mr. Bouchareb, in contrast, was as elated as his cast, who summoned him to join them onstage. After several effusive (and lengthy) speeches, they all burst into a rousing rendition of a battle hymn that is sung in the film. ""Indigènes"" follows a small of North African soldiers fighting to liberate France from the Nazis during Word War II. Recalling classic Hollywood World War II combat films, it features strong performances, stirring speeches and gripping combat sequences. Like ""Flandres"" and ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley,"" Mr. Bouchareb's movie has clear contemporary resonance.'"
"'06-05-29,'0','LONDON, May 28 — The investment bank Goldman Sachs is trying to organize Arcelor shareholders to block the steel company's controversial plans to sell off a major stake to Severstal, a Russian company.Arcelor's management signed a deal with Severstal late last week as a last-ditch attempt to fend off a hostile 26 billion euro ($33 billion) takeover by Mittal Steel, the world's largest steel company. Arcelor has objected to Mittal's offer since it was first made on friendly terms in January. Arcelor said on Friday that it would make a deal worth 13 billion euros ($16.5 billion) with Severstal, selling off a third of the company to Severstal's chief executive, Alexei Mordashov, in exchange for his stake in Severstal and other assets.Under the proposed deal, Mr. Mordashov would personally hold a one-third stake in the merged company.Goldman Sachs is circulating a letter to Arcelor shareholders, hoping to get support for an emergency general meeting that would call for the Severstal deal to be put to a vote, according to Mittal executives.Twenty percent of shareholders need to call for an emergency general meeting for it to be held. At issue is the way that investors can weigh in on the Severstal deal. As it is structured now, the deal will go through, unless more than 50 percent of outstanding shareholders vote to prevent it. That situation is unlikely because it is difficult to get that percentage of shareholders to vote on any company issue.Critics are calling for a more traditional voting structure — asking two-thirds of shareholders present at a general meeting to approve the deal before it can go through, for example. Under local shareholder rights law, Arcelor does not have to put the Severstal deal to a shareholder vote. But Arcelor management is under pressure to prove that it is showing exemplary corporate governance, after criticizing Mittal's corporate governance and refusing to consider the company's offer.Investors could try to use an emergency general meeting to demand that the company change the way the deal is approved. Mittal is, naturally, supportive of any efforts to strike down the Severstal deal.'"
"'06-05-29,'0','LONDON, May 28 — Just about a year ago, the French investor Vincent Bolloré grabbed a microphone at the annual meeting of the advertising company Havas and declared that he was not Darth Vader.But Mr. Bolloré then brandished his verbal light saber, maneuvered four representatives onto the Havas board and eventually took over as chairman of the company.Now he hopes to star in a sequel.Whether Mr. Bolloré is playing the part of a ""Star Wars"" villain or more closely resembles Luke Skywalker depends on whether you sympathize with managers of the new object of his attention, the London-based advertising firm Aegis, or favor Mr. Bolloré's preferred plan.After installing himself at Havas, Mr. Bolloré started accumulating a stake in Aegis, which owns Carat, the largest buyer of media space and time in Europe. This month, he proposed that two handpicked nominees be added to the Aegis board, the next step in an effort to exert more control over the company's management and, perhaps eventually, to push for some combination of Aegis and Havas.Aegis rejected Mr. Bolloré's request and on Friday its chairman, Colin Sharman, urged shareholders to vote against the nominations at the annual meeting on June 14.'"

Javits Convention Center that would ""enliven"" 11th Avenue, you believe that the new center ""turns its back"" on the Hudson River.In fact, the architect Richard Rogers's vision of a tree-lined open space along the southern Javits Center, together with a new park-filled development directly facing it, will create a wonderful new ""Gateway to the Hudson"" on 34th Street from Moynihan Station to the river.Another corridor on the north side of the center on 40th Street, the same street where the commuter ferry exits, will end with a Gramercy Park-sized open space that will gracefully transition into Midtown.Most important, the best thing we can do to improve water access is to take the diesel-belching trucks that now encircle Javits during show loading and unloading off the streets. The new marshaling, screening and parking system proposed for north of the center is an environmentally responsible approach to giving the streets surrounding Javits back to residents and visitors.All of the new construction work on the site must allow the existing Javits Convention Center to continue to function normally.

"'06-05-30,'0','In a day of generally downbeat market activity, oil prices rose today and the dollar fell against the euro in its biggest decline in more than a month.Adding to the anxiety on Wall Street today, Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, expressed concerns that inflation was running high. His remarks, broadcast on CNBC during an interview, raised concerns that the central bank could raise interest rates for a 17th straight time when it meets next month.One of the issues distressing investors, analysts say, is that they can no longer predict with any degree of certainty what the Fed will do. ""The bottom line is investors don't like uncertainty,"" said Mike Pond, an interest rate strategist with Barclays Capital. ""You're entering into the first meeting in a year and a half where it's not clear whether the Fed is going to raise interest rates. But the Fed doesn't know what they're going to, and investors should be concerned about that.""Wall Street analysts also pointed out that market downturns are symptomatic of an economy that is cooling. ""Until the stock market can feel comfortable that this is going to be a modest inflation pick up,"" Mr. Harris said, ""investors are going to be worried. So it's understandable that there's some repricing going on.""Just three weeks ago, the Dow Jones industrial average looked like it might break its all-time closing high. Since then, stocks have been moving at a volatile clip, dropping sharply, then rising, but ultimately erasing the gains made earlier this month. The Dow is now down 4.7 percent from its closing high on May 10.The fact that Dow had earlier been approaching a high-water mark may have spooked some investors into cashing out early.William Rhodes, chief investment strategist with Rhodes Analytics, said the recent decline could be chalked up to the market correcting itself. ""It certainly is a correction, and a correction that is timed against reaching that peak,"" Mr. Rhodes said.""It's natural to sit back, be cautionary and say, 'What are the things that can go wrong?' You have to make that count as you're getting ready to purchase that next share of stock.""'"
"'06-05-30,'0','The ruling noted the enormous variety of factual situations involving relationships between public employers and their employees, and it suggested that the particular facts of a case must be closely examined.In this case, the Los Angeles deputy prosecutor, Richard Ceballos, complained to his bosses in early 2000 that after being alerted by a defense lawyer, he had found ""serious misrepresentations"" in an affidavit used to obtain a search warrant.Discussions with his superiors were heated, and a trial court rejected challenges to the warrant. In the aftermath, Mr. Ceballos contended, he was reassigned and denied a promotion. He filed an employee grievance, which was denied based on a finding that he had not suffered any retaliation, despite his claim to the contrary.Mr. Ceballos took his case to federal district court, which threw it out after accepting his employer's argument that the actions Mr. Ceballos complained about were explainable by legitimate staffing needs. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court, concluding that Mr. Ceballos's free-speech rights had indeed been violated.The case, Garcetti v. Ceballos, No. 04-473, was one of a long line of cases addressing the rights of public employees and surely not the last. When it was argued before the justices on Oct. 12, the Bush administration sided with Los Angeles County in arguing that if the Ninth Circuit were upheld, public employees would in effect get constitutional protection for performing their duties ""to the dissatisfaction of the employer.""Employees who think they are unfairly treated should rely on Civil Service laws, Los Angeles County said.Mr. Ceballos's lawyer argued unsuccessfully that the result the government lawyers were seeking would cause an unacceptable chilling of the speech of potential whistle-blowers. Justice Kennedy was skeptical of that position at the time. ""You're saying that the First Amendment has a function within the government office,"" he said. ""The First Amendment isn't about policing the workplace.""In writing the decision that reversed the Ninth Circuit today, Justice Kennedy noted that the Supreme Court has made it clear in previous rulings ""that public employees do not surrender all their First Amendment rights by reason of their employment."" On the other hand, he wrote, ""When a citizen enters government service, the citizen by necessity must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.""The controlling factor in this case, Justice Kennedy wrote, was that Mr. Ceballos was acting purely in an official capacity when he complained internally about the search warrant. ""Ceballos wrote his disposition memo because that is part of what he was employed to do,"" Justice Kennedy wrote. ""He did not act as a citizen by writing it.""To accept Mr. Ceballos's argument, the majority concluded, would be to commit state and federal courts to ""a new, permanent and intrusive role"" overseeing communications among government employees and their superiors.Dissenting in three separate opinions were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.

"'06-05-30,'0','Jeremy Miller, a 33-year-old carpenter from Verona, Wis., and his girlfriend went ahead with a trip this past weekend but pulled into a campsite closer to home to save gas.""Camping's gotten expensive,"" he said. ""After you count food, supplies, getting the site, gas and everything, we've probably spent over $400.""Businesses apparently sense the unease among travelers, and many hotels and tourist attractions have rushed out an array of gas-related rebates and discounts.A trio of historic inns in Rockland, Maine, offer guests a discount on their bills equal to 10 times the number of cylinders in their vehicle's engine, up to $80 for a V-8. ""We don't want people to stay home because of the price of gas,"" said Pam Schultz, manager of the Captain Lindsey House, a 200-year-old Federal-style inn.Economists are still trying to gauge the impact of higher gas prices on consumers, and by extension, the broader economy. One vulnerable area, of course, is discretionary spending on things like travel; tourism pumps roughly half a trillion dollars into the United States economy every year.Paying higher gas and other energy prices wiped out almost a third of the collective raises consumers earned last year, the United States Conference of Mayors reported last Friday. And the impact of higher oil prices is worse this year, with gasoline alone expected to cost consumers $300 billion, more than double the level of five years ago, the mayors group said.That helped send May's consumer confidence rating, as measured by the University of Michigan, to its lowest point since after last summer's hurricanes. In only three months in the last decade has consumer confidence been lower: the two months following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and during the Iraq invasion in March 2003.""They had thought the gas price run-up would be temporary,"" said Richard Curtin, director of the Michigan study. ""They're coming to the conclusion that gas prices will be permanently high."" He called the combined impact on household budgets of higher gas prices and rising interest races ""corrosive.""That is certainly the case in Duarte, Calif., a working-class suburb of Los Angeles, where gas is $3.38 a gallon at some service stations. Inocencia Arteaga, 48, who makes about $85 a week babysitting, was once a road trip junkie, piling her family into her Chevy Astro van and motoring as far as Idaho whenever she could.Over Memorial Day weekend last year, she drove to San Francisco. But this year, she reluctantly stayed home, a family barbecue her entertainment. ""I have no money for gas,"" she said.To save on gas, her husband recently began bicycling the 10 miles to the Pasadena restaurant where he makes about $1,300 a month as a busboy.Even people with relatively high incomes are feeling squeezed. Celia Shane makes $65,000 a year as a legal secretary, and her husband Michael, a cooking instructor, makes $90,000.But they decided to forgo their annual jet-skiing trip to Laughlin, Nev., much to the disappointment of their two children, ages 6 and 12. They are barbecuing instead and saving the $70 per tank it now costs to fill up their minivan.On paper, the jump in gas prices should not have that much of an effect. For an 800-mile round trip, for example, the cost of an additional dollar per gallon adds up to $40 for a vehicle that gets 20 miles a gallon. But because the price is so prominently displayed as people drive, jumps can have a big impact on consumers' emotions.So while Mr. Curtin, who oversees the consumer confidence survey, warns of the corrosive effects of rising gas prices, other economists are more sanguine. ""We start seeing $4 gas, instead of $3, then I worry,"" said Scott Hoyt, director of consumer economics at Moody's Economy.com, who expects that growth in consumer spending will moderate but remain healthy.Likewise, Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers, says he does not believe that consumers yet think that $3-a-gallon gas is permanent. Unless or until they do, there won't be any significant change in overall spending, he said. ""You need the perception among households that this is long-term,"" he said. ""It's getting there, but I don't think we're there yet.""He has not spoken to John Fitzgerald, 38, a plumber in Norwell, Mass., who has cut back on family boating trips and is trying to unload the Ford Expedition that consumes about $100 of gas a week. ""We went to trade it in and they don't want to give us anything,"" Mr. Fitzgerald said.As consumers spend more for gas this year— as well as for air fares, which are expected to be up 8 percent this year on average over last year — economists wonder whether those extra dollars will subtract from other items.""So far, a buck spent on the gas tank is a buck not put in the savings account,"" said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. ""But there's a limit to that, and we may be reaching it.""As that limit is reached, Mr. Wyss added, travelers will stay in cheaper hotels, cook in the rented condo instead of dining out, and plan trips closer to home.Innkeepers and others are trying to take the sting out of high gas prices. The Emerson Inn by the Sea on Cape Ann in Massachusetts offers a $20 gas card for a two-night, midweek stay, and the reward grows by $10 for each additional night to a maximum of $50. The discount represents less than 6 percent of the total bill, but the owners hope it entices travelers fretting about fuel prices.Without such a rebate, said general manager Jennifer Messier, ""We're afraid that maybe they'll stay closer to home.""Booking two nights or more through Hotels.com qualifies consumers for a rebate of up to $30, with a gas receipt. The Six Flags amusement park chain will cut admission by $15 a person in exchange for a gas receipt.And reserving at least four nights at one of 43 hotels in Traverse City, Mich., earns a $25 gas card from the local visitors bureau. That amount is a small fraction of the a hotel bill, but officials attribute a significant number of bookings to the promotion.""That $25 rebate probably gets their gas bill back to last year's prices,"" said Jack Schripsema, the visitors bureau's vice president for sales and marketing.Florida's tourism promotion department has assembled a feature on its Web site, VisitFlorida.com, that shows people where they can travel on a single tank of gas. Florida officials predict that despite high fuel prices, tourism will increase slightly over last year, when, they estimated, a record 85 million people visited the state.""Thirty or 50 dollars will not cause them to cancel their trips, but it will cause them to make choices,"" said Vanessa Welter, a spokeswoman for Visit Florida.A lucky few travelers are relatively immune to gas prices. On the St. Croix River in Hudson, Wis., where the air is full of white puff from the cottonwood trees, Bob Stanislaw readied his boat Friday for a race, with absolutely no plans to change his Memorial Day. His boat has sails.""Wind power is the untapped resource,"" he said. ""It used to cost us $3 a year to run the boat. Now it costs $5.""'"
"'06-05-30,'0','A merger of several anti-Nazi groups, Freedom House operated with a tiny staff, a shoestring budget and scant membership rolls. But its powerful allies, including Eleanor Roosevelt, the stars Helen Hayes, Burgess Meredith and Tallulah Bankhead, and, behind the scenes, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, gave it access to news columns and wide public attention.And as isolationism gave way to a national war effort after Pearl Harbor, Freedom House, with Mr. Field as its workhorse executive secretary, continued to promote democratic, anti-totalitarian themes with rallies, conferences, speeches, awards, pamphlets, advertisements and letters to newspapers.After World War II, it turned its guns on Soviet and Chinese Communism, anti-Semitism and the suppression of human rights in Eastern Europe and Asia. It championed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and similar pacts, was an early proponent of civil rights legislation and condemned the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings and the Communist witch-hunts of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin.With Mr. Field as its administrator, the organization gave annual Freedom Awards, usually at well-attended dinners in Manhattan. Among the recipients were President Harry S. Truman, Mayor Willy Brandt of West Berlin and the columnist Walter Lippman.For many years, Freedom House shared its headquarters at 20 West 40th Street in Manhattan, known as the Wendell Willkie Memorial Building, with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Anti-Defamation League and the Metropolitan Council of B'nai B'rith and other like-minded service organizations.The building was sold in 1985. Freedom House today has offices in Washington, New York and many cities abroad. For decades, the organization has issued annual assessments of freedom around the world, rating every country and citing some nations and regimes for praise or condemnation.Mr. Field retired as executive director of Freedom House in 1967, but served as secretary to the board of trustees until 1970. ""He was the one who made things work,"" said Roscoe Drummond, the columnist, who was chairman of the board. ""If we wanted money or an important 'name' to back up our policy statements, we'd call on George and he'd do it. He was the group's guiding force.""George Field was born in Manhattan on Dec. 20, 1904. At 16, he wrote a letter to Debs, his hero and a five-time Socialist Party presidential candidate. He had been imprisoned for speaking against American involvement in World War I and won nearly a million votes in the 1920 campaign for the White House, which he conducted from his cell at Leavenworth, Kan.""We do not pity you,"" the young Mr. Field wrote. ""We admire you for your sincerity, your loyalty and spirit. You are the inspiration of a great movement, the faith of an intense struggle. You are jailed, Gene, but your spirit is broadcast. We, of the future generation, are educating ourselves and are preparing to continue the good work which you have thus far so nobly accomplished.""Responding to the Lincolnesque prose, Debs called it ""a sweet, touching letter,"" and referred to its author as ""the voice of the future.""Mr. Field nonetheless dropped out of the High School of Commerce and later abandoned socialist ideals. He worked at a variety of jobs in the 1920's and 30's, as an advertising copywriter, as program director for the radio station WEVD (whose call letters were Debs's initials), and as a publicist. He also joined the campaign that carried Fiorello H. La Guardia into City Hall in 1934.Mr. Field married Molly Mass in 1925. He is survived by their son, Paul Field of New Bern, N.C., and daughter, Ellen Balkan of Toronto, and by five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.'"
"'06-05-30,'0','The Business Software Alliance, a software industry lobby group based in Washington, estimates that more than 90 percent of the software used in China is unlicensed.On March 31, Beijing announced that local computer makers must ship all their products with licensed operating systems pre-installed. The government has also started a drive to ensure that all computers in the country's sprawling bureaucracy are loaded with legitimate software.""It is indeed good news, marking a clear step in the right direction to reverse the serious problem of software piracy that frustrates the development in China for both foreign and domestic vendors,"" said Gregory Shea, the Beijing-based president of the United States Industry Technology Office, which represents more than 6,000 technology companies.Senior Chinese officials acknowledge that software piracy is widespread, though they argue that foreign critics, including the Business Software Alliance, vastly exaggerate the scale of the problem.Washington intensified pressure on the Chinese government ahead of President Hu's visit to the United States to protect the property rights of software companies.One of the complaints of the Bush administration is that intellectual property theft contributes to the soaring United States trade deficit with China. On a visit to Beijing in March, the American secretary of commerce, Carlos M. Gutierrez, noted that China ranked second in the world for computer sales but only 25th for software.""We believe that is an indication of the use of pirated software,"" he said.After Beijing's decision to compel computer makers to install licensed operating system software, Microsoft signed licensing deals with the leading Chinese computer manufacturers Lenovo, the TCL Group, Tsinghua Tongfang and the Founder Technology Group.Lenovo, the maker of personal computers, agreed to spend $1.2 billion on Windows software over the next 12 months.Senior Microsoft executives described the licensing deals as a breakthrough in the company's 14-year presence in China, although analysts said it seemed that a significant amount of the licensing revenue would come from computers made for export.In an April 17 statement announcing the agreement with Lenovo, Microsoft said the $1.2 billion in license fees would pay for software loaded in computers the Chinese company shipped to 65 countries and territories.Lenovo made about a third of the almost 20 million personal computers sold in China last year, according to industry estimates. Sales figures compiled by industry research groups suggest it is on track to sell more than twice that amount to foreign customers this year.Some experts doubt that the pre-installation requirement will lead to a sharp increase in legitimate software sales in China, a market where computer sales soared 29 percent in 2005, according to the technology research firm Gartner.Those experts point out that China has made promises in the past to crack down on software piracy without any noticeable effect.""There will still be piracy for a considerable period of time,"" said Michael Chen, the Beijing-based general manager for Red Hat, a leading supplier of open-source software. ""People's buying behavior is slow to change.""Chen and other experts maintain that the relatively high prices charged for licensed software to Chinese customers, who have relatively low incomes by Western standards, are part of the reason for China's high piracy rates.Before the new regulation, most personal computers sold in China were sold without any operating system or loaded with DOS, an early operating system that preceded Windows. Some were sold with versions of Linux open-source software pre-installed. Up to 90 percent of customers then loaded pirated copies of Windows that sell for about 10 yuan, or $1.23, according to computer industry analysts. A legitimate copy of Windows purchased separately costs about 600 yuan.Industry experts estimate that Microsoft sells licensed copies of Windows XP to Chinese computer makers at a heavy discount, which would add up to 300 yuan to the cost of a 6,000-yuan desktop PC sold without an operating system.Some analysts suggest that the new rules will simply swell the number of computers loaded with Linux. The Chinese government has strongly encouraged the use of this open-source software to minimize the country's dependence on expensive software supplied under license from companies like Microsoft.""It could open up a whole new area for companies supporting open-source software to make their technology known,"" Mr. Chen said.Even with a sharp reduction in theft of operating systems, experts say the effect on overall piracy will be limited. They say the illegitimate copying of other software is estimated to account for the majority of piracy in China.The Business Software Alliance, however, calculates that even a relatively small decline in piracy will deliver a windfall for China and the software industry. A joint study between the alliance and IDC, a market intelligence group, published late last year said that a drop of 10 percentage points in software piracy from 90 percent would increase the Chinese economy by $87 billion and lead to an extra 1.8 million jobs in information technology.The study also said that a reduction of piracy on this scale would lift local industry revenue by $67 billion and allow the government to collect an extra $6.5 billion in tax. Some industry experts maintain that legitimate pre-installed software will be attractive to some Chinese computer buyers. Mr. Shea said he had received reports of increased sales from vendors offering computers with licensed operating systems.""If the government is committed to buying legitimate software, it sets the tone for the country,"" said Arthur Kobler, a business consultant based in Hong Kong and a former president of AT&T in China.'"

He recently concluded work on two still-unreleased Eastwood movies, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Red Sun, Black Sand.""He received Oscars for recreating rural Alabama of the 1930's in the 1962 film ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and for his sets of Depression-era Chicago in the 1973 heist comedy ""The Sting."" He was nominated for his work on Mr. Eastwood's 1992 western, ""Unforgiven,"" and the 1958 Hitchcock thriller ""Vertigo."" He received the Art Directors Guild's lifetime achievement award in 1998.Mr. Bumstead worked on four Hitchcock films, beginning with the 1956 thriller ""The Man Who Knew Too Much."" The others were ""Topaz"" (1969) and the director's final movie, ""Family Plot"" (1976).His association with Mr. Eastwood began with the 1972 western ""Joe Kidd,"" which was directed by John Sturges and starred Mr. Eastwood.

"'06-05-30,'0','""These technologies are already in operation on specific missions,"" said Steve Chien, a computer scientist who heads the artificial intelligence group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Scientists discussed some of the recent progress last week at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Baltimore.HAL, the soulful conversationalist at the helm of the spaceship in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" is not on the drawing board. The work so far has been more along the lines of Roomba, the robotic vacuum cleaner, with autonomy to perform certain specific tasks.Dr. Chien's group wrote the software that manages the schedule of Earth Observing-1, a satellite that looks for natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, wildfires and floods.The satellite, known as E.O.-1 for short, takes repeated pictures of the areas it watches, looking for changes that would indicate an eruption or other event. Other satellites or sensors on the ground can also dispatch an alert to E.O.-1, telling it of something it should look at.""Almost immediately, within a matter of hours, the spacecraft is reprogramming itself to image these targets,"" Dr. Chien said, ""and we can get rapid response imagery of breaking science events.""The spacecraft adds the new observation to its schedule and starts rearranging its other tasks. An observation that had been planned may be canceled or moved. All this occurs without a human in the loop. E.O.-1 just drops a note to the operators about what it has done.When E.O.-1 was launched in 2000, people on the ground did the satellite's planning. The planning software was first tried in 2003, and the satellite now uses it full time. That not only sped up its reaction time, but it also cut its operating cost of $3.6 million a year by more than one-quarter.Similar programming can be used for future planetary missions, perhaps for the next visit to Jupiter and its moons, to detect volcanic eruptions on Io or a shift in the fractures on the frozen surface of Europa.NASA's two rovers now on Mars — the Spirit and the Opportunity — also possess a measure of thinking ability. As they drive, the rovers use stereo cameras to judge the distance and size of rocks in their paths in order to figure out how to maneuver around obstacles.""At every step, it looks at dozens of potential choices,"" said Mark W. Maimone, a member of the team working on the rovers' software. ""It picks the safest path that gets it closer to its goal.""A software upgrade to be sent up to the rovers in a month or so will provide even greater autonomy. Mission controllers will then be able to tell the rovers simply, ""Go to that rock and put your instrument arm down on it."" Currently, arm deployment takes an extra day, because controllers must first see the rover's final position before issuing the command to lower the arm.Another part of the upgrade, adapted from the E.O.-1 software, will enable the rovers to perform a first cut of data, determining what is useful. The rovers have been taking photographs to search for clouds and mini-tornadoes known as dust devils. But through much of the Martian year, clouds and dust devils are rare, so most of the photos show nothing, and beaming them all to Earth is a waste of time.""You're restricted in the number of images you can return,"" said Rebecca Castaño of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.With the new software, the rovers will analyze the photos and send back only those that appear to contain what the scientists are looking for. That will allow wider and more frequent searches. Dr. Castaño said tests showed that the software was correct in identifying clouds 93 percent of the time.More important, the software rarely failed at finding a cloud when one was there. Rather, the software sometimes saw a cloud when there was none — a mistake that a scientist on the ground can easily correct.Still, these spacecraft seem far from intelligent. E.O.-1's scheduling programs are not that different from the software that Wal-Mart uses to manage inventory, and the rovers' driving autonomy does not give them the ability to recognize unanticipated traps. In April last year, the Opportunity blithely drove into a sand dune, and took five weeks to back out.""None of the A.I. systems are as smart as a 2-year-old,"" said Cynthia Y. Cheung, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. ""We want this system to be able to learn and react to the environment.""Dr. Cheung is a member of a team led by Steven Curtis designing a more ambitious rover. It does not have wheels. Instead, it looks like a shape-changing jungle gym, with trusses that lengthen and shorten. A simple prototype has been built.Computer animations illustrate its possibilities. Across flat terrain, it would roll like tumbleweed.It could pull itself, almost catlike, onto rocks or flatten itself and slither through holes. (The animation can be viewed at nytimes.com/science.)To achieve those abilities, the machine would need sensors to observe its surroundings and then use the best mode of locomotion. While some safety rules might be explicitly programmed — the equivalent of telling a child, ""Do not cross a busy road"" — the scientists also will put in programming that allows the robot to learn its behavior through trial and error.""You'd essentially set up a playground where the robot can perform these simple behaviors,"" said Michael Rilee, another member of the Goddard team. ""It's a lot like what children do when they're very small, and they're just learning to move around.""Dr. Curtis said he thought the technology could be ready for a rover to explore the rockier regions of the Moon in a few years.How much new technology will be built and used is an unanswered question. ""This is a completely different way of doing business,"" Dr. Chien said. ""People are risk averse, for good reasons.""Interplanetary space probes cost hundreds of millions of dollars each, and a mistake in the programming can lose the craft. An attempt last year to get a small craft named DART, Demonstration of Autonomous Rendezvous Technology, to dock autonomously with another satellite resulted instead in DART's collision with the target.Scientists are also wary about letting a spacecraft throw away information before humans get to sift through it. They often joke about a rover obliviously driving past a dinosaur bone lying on the Martian surface because it had been programmed to recognize only rocks.But autonomy will also allow them to do more at lower cost.For some possible missions, like the Titan blimp, ""This sort of thing is going to be key for making the most of the mission,"" said Ralph D. Lorenz, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona.""In an ideal world,"" he added, ""you'd downlink every picture, and scientists would have all of the time in the world to look over them, but you don't have that luxury.""Because of the limited communications with Earth, Dr. Lorenz said the craft might summarize its findings — that it has been flying over sand dunes, for example — and send back only a few representative photos instead of images of the entire landscape.""To get the best science, you want to send down only the data with the richest science concentration,"" Dr. Lorenz said.And for that, Dr. Lorenz is willing to let the spacecraft do the choosing.'"
"'06-05-30,'0','About 5,000 years ago, cattle herders discovered how to make yogurt. Scientists are now discovering that they also mounted an unplanned experiment in evolution.Certain species of bacteria are responsible for turning milk into yogurt. As the microbes feed on sugar in the milk, they produce acidic wastes that cause the milk to clot. They also make the yogurt uninhabitable for other bacteria, preventing it from spoiling. And by breaking down some milk proteins into smaller pieces, they give yogurt its distinctive flavor.Americans bought 2.7 billion pounds of yogurt in 2004. To better understand the bacteria that drive that business, scientists have begun sequencing their genomes. A team of French scientists published the genome of a common inhabitant of yogurt, Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Their research appears in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The study reveals a microbe in the midst of adapting to a new environment. ""We think it may have originally been bacteria that lived on plants,"" said Maarten van de Guchte of France's National Institute for Agricultural Research, the lead author of the study. Its genome contains a number of genes for breaking down plant sugars.Most of those genes appear to be broken, however. Mutations to the genes prevent the bacteria from reading their codes and making the corresponding proteins. Lactobacillus bulgaricus has 270 such broken genes, known as pseudogenes, in its genome. ""It was surprising to find that many,"" Dr. van de Guchte said. The microbe's genome has only 1,562 working genes. It also shows signs of having lost many other genes altogether.'"
"'06-05-30,'0','The size of the problem is startling in itself. One person in seven over 65 suffers from depression, but 70 to 90 percent, depending on who's counting, receive no treatment for it.A major reason for the huge gap between the numbers of people in need of treatment and the numbers receiving it is the difficulty in diagnosing depression when symptoms are not typical or are easily confused with a physical ailment.Classic signs include persistent sadness, withdrawal from activities once enjoyed, difficulty sleeping and concentrating, and poor appetite.Although some or all of these conditions may also be present in depressed older people, their symptoms may also include signs of dementia like memory problems and confusion, neglect of personal appearance, feelings of irritability or anxiety, pacing and fidgeting, lack of energy and even delusions and hallucinations. And people can be depressed without feeling sad. Rather, their emotional disorder is expressed more in physical terms, like vague complaints of aches and pains or gastrointestinal upset.Many common stressful events can be seen as an explanation for depression: the death of a spouse or close friend; retirement with nothing satisfying to do; having to move from a family home or familiar neighborhood; losses in vision, hearing or mobility; or the developing a chronic or life-threatening illness.Although any of these factors can result in temporary feelings of grief, loss and sadness, when such feelings persist for more than, say, six months, clinical depression is the more likely diagnosis. Clinical depression rarely, if ever, cures itself. It needs to be treated professionally.Clinical depression is all the more likely if the person had previous depressive episodes or if the person's parents, siblings or children experienced depression. Among those with a genetic vulnerability, any major life change can bring on clinical depression.People lacking such vulnerability typically bounce back within weeks or months of an emotionally challenging event and may remain cheerful even when death is imminent.Certain disorders, particularly strokes and ministrokes, can cause depression by injuring the brain. Many medications commonly taken by older people can make the depression worse, among them steroids, anticancer drugs, tranquilizers, anti-anxiety agents and drugs for Parkinson's disease, high blood pressure, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis and pain.But it is also important to realize that depression can take hold of a person without any apparent reason. Clinical depression involves a disruption in brain chemicals that can occur with or without a precipitating event.Older women are nearly twice as likely as older men to become seriously depressed, a fact that some attribute to hormonal or other biological factors. A vitamin B12 deficiency has also been linked to severe depression in older women. People who live alone without supportive social networks also have higher rates of depression.Untreated depression can shorten life and make what time remains not worth living. It is also hard to live with or be around a depressed person, leading to a withdrawal of family and social support, in turn feeding the depression.Depression has been shown to worsen the symptoms of dementia and to make existing physical ailments like heart disease worse, possibly because depressed people are less conscientious about following prescribed remedies.By suppressing the immune system, depression may render people more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Depressed older people may be so despondent that they become incontinent, unable to walk or unable to care for themselves.Depression should be regarded as a chronic disease, no less in need of therapy than heart disease or diabetes. The therapeutic possibilities in the modern medical armamentarium are large, and if one remedy fails, others are available. Experts say that more than 80 percent of older depressed people respond well or completely to one or another therapeutic approach.A recent study indicated that many of them would prefer talk therapy first, resorting to medication only if that is not helpful enough. Most psychiatrists today, however, consider antidepressant medication to be a necessary first step that can make talk therapy more effective.Compared with older antidepressants, the modern S.S.R.I.'s (for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and the N.S.R.I.'s (for norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have fewer side effects and do not interact with as many other medications.Each drug works a little differently from others in its class. If one does not bring noticeable relief in 6 to 12 weeks, another can be tried. If none of the newer drugs help, older ones — MAO (monoamine oxidase) inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants — can be tried. Sometimes combining two drugs works.Medication can be used with psychotherapy or by itself. Psychotherapy can also be used alone, although studies indicate that it is rarely enough to counter severe depression. Psychopharmacologists warn that, to reduce the risk of a relapse, antidepressants should be taken for six months to a year after depression lifts. In some cases, the drugs may needed for life.If both these approaches fail — and especially if a person is at risk of suicide — electroconvulsive therapy is often useful, especially when depression is accompanied by psychosis or delusions. Its beneficial effect is immediate.Also, it uses far less electricity than it once did. Its only known side effect is temporary memory loss, but for some the loss is prolonged.'"

"'06-05-31,'1','In addition, Ms. Rice said again today that while pursuing its diplomatic course, President Bush did not rule out the use of force against Iran if it tries to produce nuclear weapons.It was far from clear whether the American offer would bring Iran around, however. In the past, Iran has signaled a willingness to talk to the United States, but without preconditions. Iranian leaders have long said they regard conditional offers to talk like the one Ms. Rice made today as unacceptable.Iran moved last summer to resume uranium enrichment, saying that this activity was aimed at developing fuel for peaceful purposes only. Iran also maintains that it is entitled to enrich uranium under various non-proliferation treaties. The West maintains that since Iran has concealed many of its activities, it has forfeited that right.Ms. Rice's announcement brought praise from European governments, all of which had been telling the United States in private, and increasingly in public, that American participation in talks with Iran would give a boost to the negotiations.Other European diplomats, speaking anonymously, said they were not especially confident that the American shift would overcome the impasse with Iran, in light of Iran's longstanding refusal to stop enriching nuclear fuel as a sovereign country. They suggested that Iran would be unlikely to back down in light of its pride and self-image.The French foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, hinted also that American participation in the talks might lead others to join the process, though he did not name the countries.""I welcome the willingness of the United States, and possibly other partners, to join in the negotiations instituted by Germany, the United Kingdom and France with Iran,"" Mr. Douste-Blazy said in Paris. ""This strengthens the credibility of the European approach an the proposals that the Europeans want to present to Iran with the international community's support.""Ms. Rice was due to fly to Vienna later today to meet with her counterparts from Russia, China and the leading nations of Europe.Their goal, American officials said, was to complete a package of incentives to be offered to Iran if it suspends uranium enrichment, and a threat of taking the matter to the United Nations Security Council if Iran remains in defiance.Ms. Rice said there was ""substantial agreement"" on a package, but she suggested that some details remained to be worked out. Her aides clearly hoped that the announcement about talking with Iran would improve the atmosphere, possibly bringing the Russians and Chinese along.The United States, Britain and France favor a resolution to be adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations charter. Invoking Chapter VII implies to Council members that sanctions are likely if Iran refuses.Russia and China are opposed to invoking Chapter VII. To get them to go along with a resolution, the United States has agreed to explicit assurances that sanctions would not be adopted without another vote of the Security Council, and that the threat of military force was not part of this process.Russia, fearing a replay of the months leading up to the Iraq war in 2003 and 2004, has insisted on such language because it charges that the United States used resolution on Iraq in that period as a pretext for its going to war to oust Saddam Hussein.Ms. Rice's announcement on Iran was a surprise. As recently as a few days ago, European officials disclosed that they knew that Ms. Rice was pushing for a reconsideration of the Bush administration's longstanding ban on talks with Iran. But they also said they did not expect a decision to come quickly.Ms. Rice was understood to have argued that making the offer to talk conditional, the United States was making an acceptable adjustment of its policy of not recognizing the legitimacy of a regime that the United States has refused to talk to for decades.The tone of the Secretary of State's announcement was anything but friendly toward Iran. She said repeatedly that the United States still objected to many aspects of Iran's behavior, not just its nuclear fuel activities.She cited what she said was Iran's support for violent insurgents in Iraq and its support of other acts of violence against Israeli, American and other civilians in the Middle East.The Bush administration has not entirely frozen Iran out, even since Mr. Bush labeled Iran along with Iraq and North Korea as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his State of the Union message in early 2002.The United States held small contacts with Iranian officials during the war in Afghanistan and the early stages of the war with Iraq. Iraq and Afghanistan are neighbors of Iran, and Iran has long wielded influence over their internal affairs.American talks with Iran were cut off in mid-2003 after the United States charged Iranian involvement in the bombing of civilians in Saudi Arabia. But there were talks at the end of that year and the beginning of 2004 to speed American relief to Iran after the earthquake in Bam.In addition, last year Ms. Rice announced that the American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, would be authorized to talk with Iranian officials about the internal situation in Iraq, including cross-border infiltration of insurgents and aid to Shiite militias in Iraq. But these talks have not taken place.'"
"'06-05-31,'1','But the committee decided that a quarter-point increase was sufficient because of the likelihood that ""core inflation would stay close to levels experienced over the past year,"" the minutes said. ""Given the risks to growth and inflation, Committee members were uncertain about how much, if any, further tightening would be needed.""With the inflation rate now running at the high end of what the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, considers a healthy range, there is some expectation that another increase may yet be in store when the committee meets again at the end of next month. The minutes shed little direct light on what the Fed might do, but many economists read them to indicate that further increases are likely.""The Fed minutes are a bit discouraging to those looking for a June pause,"" said Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ""So a hike is not yet a done deal. But it certainly seems more likely.""The minutes also provide some insight into how carefully committee members weighed the way they phrased their expectations for inflation, with public scrutiny in mind. While concerns about inflation had risen heading into the May 10 meeting, members still felt the issue, ""while worrisome, was relatively small."" Therefore, they decided to use the word ""contained"" in describing the scope of the threat from inflation.On top of price concerns, tensions with Iran have also rattled the markets lately. But today, in remarks that apparently soothed investor concern, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States would be willing to join multinational talks with Iran if it suspends all its nuclear activities. The announcement was a reversal in policy for the United States, which has not had full diplomatic ties with Iran since the 1979 hostage crisis.The market's rebound today also coincided with release of a survey showing that private companies added jobs at a slower rate in May than in April.The prospect of rising inflation and interest rates and a weakening of consumer confidence in the United States helped spark a broad sell-off in Asia's jittery stock markets earlier in the day. Indian shares tumbled and Japanese stocks fell to a three-month low.Although the downbeat consumer confidence figures reported Tuesday had been widely expected, investors in Asia took them as a harbinger of weaker demand for the consumer-goods exports that underpin most Asian economies.Comments from a Federal Reserve official on Tuesday, hinting at another interest rate increase next month, were also taken as a negative omen. And while economic growth in Asia has shown no objective indication of slowing lately, continued high oil prices are being read by some investors as a sign that the growth may not be sustainable.Despite a series of corrections in recent weeks, investors are still sitting on large paper profits accrued during the run-up in prices over the past year. In emerging markets like India, a fear that foreign investors are cashing their winnings can be a powerful incentive to sell.""In an environment combining growth worries and inflation jitters, the instinct is to sell risky assets,"" said Tim Cordon, the chief economist at ING Bank Singapore, referring to emerging markets. ""Are those jitters warranted? In truth, the forward-looking indicators are as high as they've ever been, and do not point to any drop-off in activity.""The selling in Asia today capped the worst month for Asian equities since September 2002. India's Sensex index closed 3.5 percent, after reaching a 6.4 percent fall at one point in the trading day; Australia's markets slid 2 percent, Japanese shares fell 2.5 percent, and Singapore stocks shed 2.4 percent. Markets in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong were closed for holidays.""There's a sense that global growth may slow and liquidity will ebb,"" said William Belchere, chief Asia economist at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong.In Japan, Asia's largest economy, the decline in American consumer confidence hit share prices of major manufacturers like Sony, Toyota and Canon. Stocks have also weakened on fears that Japan's long stock rally could be losing steam, as the economy has appeared to enter a stretch of solid but unspectacular growth.Lacking new reasons to buy, investors appeared content to sit on the sidelines, or to sell and lock in recent gains, analysts said.""The mood has gotten very bearish,"" said Douglas Hayashi, head of research at the Tokyo office of HSBC Securities. ""The market is focusing on all the negatives. Valuations have gone up, and markets need to correct a bit.""Major European stock markets, which finished trading before the release of the Fed committee's minutes, generally posted healthy gains for the day.'"
"'06-05-31,'1','The report, the most comprehensive survey ever compiled from country data, pointed to the 2001 United Nations meeting as a turning point for AIDS financing. In 2005, the United States and the rest of the world spent $8.3 billion on AIDS, compared with $1.6 billion in 2001.""We are seeing the impact,"" Dr. Piot said. ""It's about time."" He cited increased condom use, a rise in the postponement of sexual intercourse and a decrease in the number of sex partners as factors in the slowing of the epidemic.Summarizing the report's findings, Dr. Piot said that ""2005 was the least bad year in the history of the AIDS epidemic,"" first detected 25 years ago.The most promising news, Dr. Piot said, is that the number of new H.I.V. infections has dropped in three African countries — Kenya, Zimbabwe and urban areas of Burkina Faso. Earlier, Uganda reported decreases.Dr. Piot said Cambodia and four states in India (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu) showed a drop in new infections, joining Thailand's earlier success.In the Caribbean, the world's second-most-affected region behind Africa, new infections have declined in urban areas of Haiti and in the Bahamas. AIDS is the region's leading cause of death in people aged 15 to 44.In Haiti, the percentage of pregnant women infected with H.I.V. declined to 3.7 percent in 2003-2004 from 9.4 percent in 1993, Dr. Piot said.Despite the positive trends, Dr. Piot reported grim findings from China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Russia and Vietnam, with signs of outbreaks in Bangladesh and Pakistan.Ending the pandemic will depend largely on changing social norms like empowering women, reducing the stigma of the disease and encouraging a greater reduction in the number of sex partners, the report said. Most countries have strong foundations for building an effective response against AIDS, the report said, but systems to carry out the plans remain inconsistent.The thoroughness of the individual national reports varied, and many countries did not provide data for all categories, so summarizing them was difficult, Dr. Piot said in an interview. Still, the replies identified significant weaknesses, he said:¶Fewer than 50 percent of young people achieved comprehensive knowledge levels about H.I.V., far fewer than the 90 percent goal.¶Only 9 percent of gay men and fewer than 20 percent of intravenous drug users received any kind of H.I.V. prevention help in 2005.¶Services to prevent H.I.V. infections in infants have not scaled up as rapidly as programs to provide antiretroviral therapy. Just 9 percent of pregnant women were covered.The United States, Britain, Canada, France and Germany gave no statistics on surveys about the percentage of young people who correctly identify ways to prevent H.I.V.; who had sex with casual partners in the last year; who had sex before 15; or who used condoms during the most recent sexual intercourse with casual partners.Thoraya Ahmed Obaid, the United Nations Population Fund executive director, said the world needed to increase its prevention efforts.The report shows that the epicenter of the epidemic remains in sub-Saharan Africa. There the epidemic has reached a peak, but incidence remains unacceptably high, Dr. Piot said. Across most of Africa, H.I.V. prevalence among pregnant women attending clinics has remained roughly level for several years.The United Nations disputed contentions by some observers that the leveling off showed a turning point in the AIDS epidemic in Africa. ""Available evidence does not offer grounds for such conclusions,"" Dr. Piot said, in part because ""the actual number of people infected continues to rise because of population growth.""'"
"'06-05-31,'1','But Alcoa is an aluminum company. Shares of a securities firm such as Goldman Sachs, whose trading desks and financial tentacles stretch across the globe, would present a far more obvious conflict with the role of Treasury secretary. ""Considering how every word that man speaks affects financial markets, he can't have control of anything,"" said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan legal watchdog group.Mr. Paulson, no stranger to managing conflicts of interest, is taking steps to sever financial ties before seeking Senate confirmation. ""He is expected to 'ring fence' his assets so that he will have no influence on how they are managed,"" said Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman. ""He is taking independent legal advice but the determination as to what he will do has yet to be made.""Mr. van Praag said that if Mr. Paulson set up a blind trust to shield him from any knowledge about his investments, Goldman Sachs would not be the trustee.Unwinding his personal fortune, however, may not be as difficult as it seems. Mr. Paulson recently set aside $100 million of Goldman stock for a family foundation dedicated to conservation and environmental education, and has said privately that he planned to give away even more of his wealth.Mr. Paulson has about $630 million in Goldman stock and vested options, based on estimates from the latest regulatory filings and yesterday's $149.89 closing price. And thanks to a somewhat unusual clause in the investment bank's equity award program, stock and stock options for employees who resign to join a government agency or self-regulatory organization vest on an accelerated track, instead of being lost. The result is that Mr. Paulson would receive another $70 million in options.""Does that give him a short-term windfall? Yeah,"" said Brian J. Foley, an executive compensation consultant in White Plains. ""But every month he is working as Treasury secretary, he is losing money by not working at Goldman Sachs.""Mr. Paulson is the latest in a long line of Goldman executives to take top jobs in Washington. In 1993, Mr. Rubin gave up his role as chairman of Goldman Sachs, then a private partnership, to join the Clinton administration as a top economic adviser. He was named Treasury secretary two years later.At the time, Mr. Rubin was reported to have an estimated net worth of $50 million to $100 million. In today's dollars, that would be $65 million to $130 million.To avoid potential conflicts, Mr. Rubin cut financial ties with his former firm and set up a blind trust. He then purchased a special insurance policy guaranteeing that the value of his stake would be preserved, should anything happen to Goldman.Other former Goldman partners took similar measures before they began high-profile stints in Washington, including Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey and now that state's governor. Mr. Corzine, whose $400 million Goldman Sachs fortune helped bankroll his 2000 Senate campaign, vowed to sell his remaining Goldman shares after public watchdogs suggested the equity stake conflicted with his role as a member of the Senate Banking Committee. He set up a blind trust, and through it sold all his Goldman shares by September 2005.Some business leaders have taken similar steps, also sometimes under pressure, to avoid conflicts in Washington. Vice President Dick Cheney collected more than $20 million after cashing out options from Halliburton, where he served as chairman and chief executive, once his finances became an issue during the 2000 presidential campaign. John W. Snow, the former CSX chairman and chief executive, agreed to give up corporate directorships and to sell more than $20 million worth of stocks and bonds before succeeding Mr. O'Neill in February 2003.'"
"'06-05-31,'1','The 18-month issue is crucial both for the 20 million Americans who took Vioxx, an arthritis drug and painkiller, and for Merck's future. Merck faces at least 11,500 lawsuits, covering 23,000 people, from patients who say that Vioxx caused their heart attacks and strokes. Merck cited the 18-month theory when it withdrew Vioxx, a painkiller, from the market in September 2004, based on preliminary findings from a clinical trial called Approve.In defending the lawsuits, Merck has consistently taken the position that Vioxx can cause heart problems only if it is used continuously for more than 18 months. But in the five Vioxx court cases in which juries have reached decisions so far, Merck has lost three times — twice in cases in which the heart attack victim had taken the drug for fewer than 18 months.Merck has based the 18-month theory largely on data from the Approve study, in which the company tracked 2,600 patients in a test to see whether Vioxx could prevent colon polyps.In the Approve study, twice as many patients taking Vioxx suffered heart attacks or strokes as those taking a placebo, or sugar pill. But most of the difference appeared to occur after patients had taken Vioxx for 18 months in a row, Merck has said.When it reported the Approve results in The New England Journal of Medicine early last year, Merck said that it had performed a statistical test to examine whether Vioxx's risk changed over time. That test found with almost total certainty that the drug had significantly higher risk than placebo only after the 18-month benchmark — but no extra risk before that time.Yesterday, Merck said it had made a mistake in reporting that result last year.In reality, the test that the company said it had used to check the results shows that there is a 7 percent chance that Vioxx has an equally high risk of causing heart attacks both before and after the 18-month benchmark is reached.That 7 percent figure may seem like a relatively small chance of error, but scientists say it is high enough to mean that Merck has not proved its theory.Critics had recently raised new questions about the Approve trial's results, after the company submitted new data to the Food and Drug Administration as part of a one-year follow-up study of patients in the trial.Some outside scientists said that the new data indicated that Vioxx's dangers became evident after only about four months of use. Merck disputed that interpretation and said yesterday that its newly discovered mistake was unrelated to that new data.Dr. Kim said yesterday that Merck found its mistake only last week and immediately told the F.D.A. and the non-Merck researchers who had taken part in the Approve study, which was published in the March 17, 2005, issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.""We came forth quickly to let the study authors know about the error, let the regulatory agencies know about the error,"" Dr. Kim said.But Dr. Steven E. Nissen, the interim chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, and a frequent critic of Merck, said the mistake the company disclosed yesterday was yet another example of Merck's mishandling data to make Vioxx seem safer.""They're acknowledging that they misrepresented the Approve data, when they reported that there was a statistically significant difference between the first and the second 18 months,"" Dr. Nissen said. ""There is no biologically plausible reason to expect an 18-month delay. I never thought it made any sense.""Dr. John Baron, a professor at the Dartmouth medical school and one of the authors of the original journal article about Approve, said Merck's mistake was relatively minor. In general, trying to calculate whether risks change over time is very difficult, Dr. Baron said.""The assessment of this constancy is something of an art. It's not a 'cut and dry, it's there or it's not' business,"" he said.""The evidence that the Vioxx effect begins immediately or quickly, or however you want to describe it, is far from conclusive. The evidence that it doesn't begin until 18 months is also not something that has been proven.""'"

"'06-05-31,'1','Nicole A. Gordon, the executive director of the New York City Campaign Finance Board since it was created in 1988 in the wake of several political corruption scandals, will resign in September to join a philanthropic foundation, officials said yesterday.Ms. Gordon, a lawyer, has built what is widely regarded as one of the most effective municipal campaign finance systems in the United States.""Nicole has been the most important figure for the implementation and success of the program since its creation,"" the board's chairman, Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., said yesterday. ""To do it for 18 years is an example of the best of government work.""The five-member board has started a search to replace Ms. Gordon.Before 1988, the city had no meaningful disclosure requirements, very high contribution limits and virtually no restrictions on campaign expenditures. Today, the city's campaign finance program has become a model for other cities. It gives matching funds to qualifying candidates, who in exchange submit to strict contribution and spending limits and a full audit of their finances.Even so, the phenomenon of wealthy candidates like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has posed new challenges for the board and its mission. Mr. Bloomberg ran two self-financed campaigns and declined to participate in the program — refusing matching funds and also exempting himself from spending limits. Although the city program provides for matching funds at a higher rate when participants face high-spending opponents, those sums came nowhere near to matching the $84.6 million Mr. Bloomberg spent to win re-election last year. (The Democratic challenger, Fernando Ferrer, spent $9.2 million.)Ms. Gordon, 51, a Manhattan native and a graduate of Barnard College and Columbia Law School, was hired in September 1988 by the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, the founding chairman of the board.'"

"'06-05-31,'1','Marketers have come a long way from the days when a simple product placement was considered unusual. Now, entire storylines — or in Lifetime's case, entire shows — are conceived with an advertiser in mind.""It's much more than having a beer on the counter,"" said Duane Dahl, the chief executive and co-founder of Perfectmatch. ""We really look for seamless integration opportunities.""Whether viewers will consider the Perfectmatch integration seamless remains to be seen. The first show is Monday at 11 p.m., a time slot aimed at young women who are well versed not only in the travails of online dating, but in the ubiquitous product mentions in television programming.Major networks have worked with product integration for years (on the ABC soap opera ""All My Children,"" Revlon was part of a storyline as a rival to a local cosmetics company; NBC's ""Friends"" centered an episode on a character's obsession with Pottery Barn), but cable networks have been slower to the punch.""Lovespring International"" is influenced by a major player on NBC, though. It is produced by Big Cattle, the production company owned by Eric McCormack, the lead actor on NBC's recently ended series ""Will and Grace.""As part of the deal with Lifetime, Perfectmatch bought commercial time during episodes of ""Lovespring International"" and Lifetime will run online ads on Perfectmatch.com. The company spends $10 million a year in TV advertising, Mr. Dahl said, spread out on Lifetime and other cable networks. He declined to say how much of the $10 million was spent on the ""Lovespring"" deal.It is no secret that Mr. Dahl's company is devoted to working its brand name into content on film and television. On Lifetime, Perfectmatch was first integrated into ""Perfect Romance,"" a Lifetime original movie, in 2004. (The plot was classic Lifetime — two people met online and fell in love, but one person fell in love with the other person's mother.)But the integration was considered such a success that Perfectmatch wanted to ""get deeper with us on our scripted programming,"" said Mike Alvarez, the vice president of Lifetime's partnerships group.In the last year alone, Perfectmatch has been mentioned in the films ""Must Love Dogs,"" starring Diane Lane and John Cusack, and ""Failure to Launch,"" starring Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker. In June, the dating site is scheduled to appear in ""The Break-Up,"" with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, and ""Superman Returns,"" which stars Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey.But many writers in Hollywood are fighting back against product integration, arguing that it compromises their integrity and creative freedom. At a news conference sponsored by the Writers Guild of America during the television upfronts in New York on May 17, several writers and producers railed against the practice. They played video clips of recent examples on shows like ""7th Heaven"" to illustrate their point.Lynn Picard, the executive vice president of Lifetime Television, said the Perfectmatch integration would be more natural than some previous situations. ""This is probably one of the best examples of a truly organic integration,"" she said.Still, ""Lovespring International"" is a comedy that mercilessly lampoons dating services and the hapless employees who work there. (One actress on the show is Jennifer Elise Cox, who played Jan Brady in ""The Brady Bunch Movie."")Throughout the episodes filmed so far, Perfectmatch is generally presented as the impeccable rival of Lovespring, but it takes an insult or two — at one point, Perfectmatch is called ""a hack"" by a Lovespring employee.Mr. Alvarez of Lifetime said that was one difficulty with integration. ""We all have to be willing to make fun of this a little bit,"" he said.'"
"'06-05-31,'1','If you've ever found yourself cornered by a talkative narcissist in a bar, ""Ham Lake,"" a seriocomic monologue by Nat Bennett and Sam Rosen, will be distressingly familiar: a young man raking over his childhood and most recent romantic disaster as he nurses a beer.Fortunately, though, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Rosen find a haunting pattern of yearning and denial in the threads of this nameless narrator's 80-minute monologue, tautly performed by Mr. Rosen and imaginatively directed by Ian Morgan (though, given the claustrophobic stage of the SoHo Playhouse's Huron Club, choreographed is more appropriate). The show is produced by the actor Josh Hartnett, Jefferson Bjoraker and Paddy Mulloy.Having been abandoned by his girlfriend in Ham Lake, a small Minnesota town, the 20-something narrator recounts the history of his relationships with Tanya, a single mother who is a waitress at a topless bar; Ed, his older and more mature brother; and his father, divorced from the narrator's mother and addicted to collecting unfunny dirty jokes. As the monologue bounces back and forth in time, the narrator reveals his stunted emotional development, that he is seemingly stuck forever in adolescence.Unable to step into adulthood with his brother, the narrator circles endlessly around his suspicion that he remains a child, unable to take responsibility for his own life or anyone else's. In doing so he proves an amusing raconteur, but by the end of the play he also stands revealed as a coward, flawed but unworthy of pity because of his self-imposed immaturity: Peter Pan's bitter doppelgänger.The gangly Mr. Rosen moves precisely around the small playing space, occasionally stepping toward the audience to deliver an intimate observation, and it is a telling quality of the script and his performance that these moments never seem forced or self-conscious. Unlike most talkative narcissists, Mr. Rosen knows when his listeners will concede intimacy and when they'll withhold it. There are plenty of bars in SoHo and plenty of talkative narcissists, but it's unlikely you'll find in any of them a monologue as evocative as ""Ham Lake.""'"

And Lauren Conrad has landed ""The Hills,"" her very own follow-up series, which starts tonight on MTV.If ""Laguna Beach"" looked perpetually like late afternoon — the mellow light of cocktail hour, the promise of a party — ""The Hills"" looks like a workday.Blue and silver have replaced red-orange in the color mix, and though the virtuoso Hisham Abed is once again doing cinematography, ""The Hills"" also uses fancy color grading and online finishing; the result is a kind of visual flaw-intolerance and a sense not of romance (as in ""Laguna Beach"") but of tension (as in a Michael Mann movie). This works well for Lauren, who is actually not so trifling as the others; she was always much more wary and anxious than a pretty teenager should have any cause to be. Her heavily lined eyes appeared more watchful than bright or twinkly, even in the old golden light; now she has the thriller lighting to match her mood.Lauren's workday, granted, is a charmed one: the series chronicles her experience as an intern at Teen Vogue (which receives heavy promotion here). But sand and surf have given way to steel and glass in her world, and she is earnestly trying to forge a Mary Tyler Moore existence in Los Angeles. (Who knows what Lauren Conrad actually wants? I watch this show as fiction.) She really does have to work, as we see her stamping envelopes and typing on a computer. And put it this way: now she wears a headset when she goes to parties.As on ""Laguna Beach,"" Lauren is unevenly yoked in her social life, this time to her roommate, a hammy deadbeat named Heidi, who seems to be trying her spin on the evilly entitled Nicole Richie shtick from ""The Simple Life."" Heidi has an interview at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, which she brilliantly blows. After telling her interviewer that she spent high school shopping and cutting class, she lays her ambitions on the line: ""I want to be the fun party P.R. girl in L.A.""'"
