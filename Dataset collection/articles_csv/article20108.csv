Fisher built a five-shot lead after opening his third round with four birdies in his first seven holes. But after putting his approach shot into the water the par-4 eighth, Fisher made double bogey and dropped two more shots late in his round to finish at 12 under.That gave renewed hope to his playing partner Francesco Molinari, who at one point was six strokes off the lead. Molinari shot a 69 to finish one behind Fisher.Another stroke back is Spain’s Gonzalo Fernández-Castaño, who shot a three-under 68. Australia’s Richard Green and Ireland’s Padraig Harrington, who both shot 69s, are in fourth place.'"

"'10-08-01,'0','The papers’ punch was in the many inside details they added to the war’s chronicle over four previous administrations and, especially, in their shocking and irrefutable evidence that Nixon’s immediate predecessor, , had systematically lied to the country about his intentions and the war’s progress. Though Nixon was another liar, none of this incriminated him. His anger about the leak would nonetheless drive him to create a clandestine “plumbers” unit whose criminality (including a break-in at the office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist) would lead to Watergate. Had Nixon not so violently overreacted that June — egged on by and fueled by his loathing of The Times and the antiwar movement — the story might have ebbed. Yes, the Pentagon Papers were labeled “top secret” — as opposed to the Afghanistan war logs’ “secret” status — but, as writes in his book “President Nixon,” some 700,000 people in and out of government had clearance to read “top secret” documents. Compelling as the papers were, they were hardly nuclear code.The public’s reaction to the Afghanistan war logs has largely been a shrug — and not just because they shared their Times front page with an article about ’s wedding. is, to put it mildly, no Nixon, and his no-drama reaction to the leaks robbed their publication of the constitutional cliffhanger of their historical antecedent. Another factor in the logs’ shortfall as public spectacle is the fractionalization of the news media, to the point where even a stunt packaged as “news” can trump journalistic enterprise. (Witness how the bogus video upstaged The Washington Post’s blockbuster investigation of the American intelligence bureaucracy two weeks ago.) The logs also suffer stylistically: they’re often impenetrable dispatches from the ground, in contrast to the Pentagon Papers’ anonymously and lucidly team-written epic of policy-making on high.Yet the national yawn that largely greeted the war logs is most of all an indicator of the country’s verdict on the Afghan war itself, now that it’s nine years on and has reached its highest monthly casualty rate for American troops. Many Americans at home have lost faith and checked out. The war places way down the list of pressing issues in every poll. Nearly two-thirds of those asked recently by CBS News think it’s going badly; the latest Post-ABC News survey finds support of Obama’s handling of Afghanistan at a low (45 percent), with only 43 percent deeming the war worth fighting.Perhaps more telling than either these polls or the defection of liberal House Democrats from last week’s war appropriations bill are the signs of wobbling conservative support. The gung-ho neocon axis was predictably belligerent in denouncing WikiLeaks. But the chairman Michael Steele’s recent “gaffe” — his since-retracted observation that “a land war in Afghanistan” is doomed — is no anomaly in a fractured party where the antiwar may have as much currency as the knee-jerk hawk . On the night of the logs’ release, Fox News even refrained from its patented shtick of shouting “Treason!” at the “mainstream media.” Instead, the go-to Times-basher Bernie Goldberg could be found on “The O’Reilly Factor” telling , a guest host, that the war “has not been going well” and is a dubious exercise in “nation-building.”Obama was right to say that the leaked documents “don’t reveal any issues that haven’t already informed our public debate in Afghanistan,” but that doesn’t mean the debate was resolved in favor of his policy. Americans know that our counterinsurgency partner, , is untrustworthy. They know that the terrorists out to attack us are more likely to be found in , and than Afghanistan. And they are starting to focus on the morbid reality, highlighted in the logs, of the de facto money-laundering scheme that siphons American taxpayers’ money through the Pakistan government to the , who then disperse it to kill Americans.Most Americans knew or guessed the crux of the Pentagon Papers, too. A full year earlier the Senate had repealed the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution; no one needed a “top secret” smoking gun by 1971 to know that L.B.J. had lied about the Tonkin incident. The papers didn’t change administration war policy because we were already pulling out of Vietnam, however truculently and lethally (the Christmas 1972 bombing campaign, most notoriously). In 1971, the American troop level was some 213,000, down from a peak of 537,000 in 1968. By 1973 we were essentially done.Unlike Nixon, Obama is still adding troops to his unpopular war. But history is not on his side either in Afghanistan or at home. The latest Gallup poll found that 58 percent of the country favors his announced timeline, with its promise to start withdrawing troops in mid-2011. It’s hard to imagine what could change that equation now.Certainly not Pakistan. As the president conducts his scheduled reappraisal of his war policy this December, a re-examination of 1971 might lead him to question his own certitude of what he is fond of calling “the long view.” The Times won a for its 1971 Pentagon Papers coup. But another of the Pulitzers that year went to the columnist , who also earned Nixon’s ire by mining other leaks to expose the White House’s tilt to Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War. The one thing no one imagined back then was that four decades later it would be South , not Southeast Asia, that would still be beckoning America into a quagmire.'"
"'10-08-01,'0','Economic earthquakes also trigger dangerous aftershocks. Just as 19th-century Japanese geophysicists discovered that aftershocks continue to reverberate well after a first major tremor hits, modern-day stock market seismologists have identified a similar pattern with financial crashes.“If you analyze them, this earthquake law is obeyed perfectly,” notes H. Eugene Stanley, a Boston University physics professor who published a pioneering study of financial markets in the scientific journal Nature. “A big shock causes smaller aftershocks, and then ones smaller and even smaller.”Indeed, financial crises come in clusters. The currency crisis in Thailand during the late 1990s was followed by similar problems in Indonesia and South Korea. After Lehman Brothers faltered, Washington Mutual, the Wachovia Corporation and scores of smaller banks toppled over like dominoes.Some econophysicists, as well as economists and politicians, suggest that the ongoing turmoil in Europe was triggered by the lingering effects of the 2008 panic that started in the United States.Financial earthquakes also radically reshape the environment. The sudden release of energy in the Earth’s crust creates seismic waves that can move mountains; financial crises can lead to the upheaval of regulations in place for years.After the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, the Glass-Steagall Act was enacted to separate commercial banking from investment banking. Now, in the wake of the recent crisis, lawmakers have just completed the biggest overhaul of financial rules since the 1930s.“Great earthquakes shape landscapes,” said Didier Sornette, a geophysics professor who now runs the Financial Crisis Observatory in Zurich. “Great crashes shape regulation, the perception of risk, and the psychology of people.”But as with earthquake science, our understanding of financial crises is primitive.Seismologists, for example, can monitor the Earth’s daily gyrations along the San Andreas Fault and know that the chance of a devastating earthquake — one larger than 6.7 on the Richter scale — over the next 30 years is greater than 99 percent. But they can’t pinpoint exactly when or where one will hit, or how big it will be.Economic earthquakes are even less predictable. One reason is that the real world is a complex system that is constantly adapting. Another reason is that while there are geological limits on the energy an earthquake can unleash, there are no constraints on prices.“The physical world cannot surprise us massively,” said Nassim Taleb, author of “The Black Swan,” a best-selling book about the influence of highly improbable events. “The financial world can.”So if financial crises are hard to predict, can anything be done to prevent the damage they cause? Lessons learned by earthquake scientists are instructive here as well.After the Great Earthquake of 1906, architects and engineers greatly revamped San Francisco’s building codes so the buildings would be able to withstand an even heftier blow. Likewise, the recently enacted regulatory reforms are aimed at strengthening the nation’s financial architecture. The new rules are intended to act like shock absorbers to buttress the market’s wild swings.“We want to fortify structures so they don’t collapse,” said Lawrence H. Summers, the president’s chief economic adviser. Other administration officials suggest that the so-called systemic risk council of regulators can be on the lookout for early tremors in financial markets, just as seismologists do. “If you have better monitoring systems for earthquakes, you can take precautions and evacuate the population if a tsunami is about to occur,” said Alan Krueger, the Treasury Department’s chief economist.Or prepare for the next eruption in the markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently asked a Princeton-trained nuclear physicist to lead its investigation into the causes of a “flash crash” in May, when the stock market plunged and then quickly rebounded, nonetheless stoking investor fears.Still, no panacea for calming the volatile markets is in sight.“We can have sound financial institutions but still have major financial earthquakes if the policies that governments pursue are fundamentally unbalanced,” said Lowell Bryan, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company. “Nobody seems quite interested in going through the pain.”'"
"'10-08-01,'0','The review also offers insight into the way many of the overdoses occurred. While in some cases technicians did not know how to properly administer the test, interviews with hospital officials and a review of public records raise new questions about the role of manufacturers, including how well they design their software and equipment and train those who use them.The Times found the biggest overdoses at Huntsville Hospital — up to 13 times the amount of radiation generally used in the test.Officials there said they intentionally used high levels of radiation to get clearer images, according to an inquiry by the company that supplied the scanners, GE Healthcare.Experts say that is unjustified and potentially dangerous.“It is absolutely shocking and mind-boggling that this facility would say the doses are acceptable,” said Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiology professor who has testified before Congress about the need for more controls over CT scans. Yet because the hospital said no mistakes were made, regulatory agencies did not investigate.The F.D.A. was unaware of the magnitude of those overdoses until The Times brought them to the agency’s attention. Now, the agency is considering extending its investigation, according to Dr. Alberto Gutierrez, an F.D.A. official who oversees diagnostic devices.Patients who received overdoses in Huntsville say that in addition to , they experienced headaches, and confusion. But at such high doses, experts say, patients are also at higher risk of brain damage and cancer.A spokesman for Huntsville Hospital, which now acknowledges that some patients received “elevated” radiation, said officials there would not comment.So far, the number of patients nationwide who got higher-than-expected radiation doses exceeds 400 at eight , six in alone, according to figures supplied by hospitals, regulators and lawyers representing overdosed patients. A health official in California who played a leading role in uncovering the cases predicts that many more will be found as states intensify their search.“I cannot believe that this is not occurring in the rest of the country,” said Kathleen Kaufman, head of radiation management for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. “That’s why we are so keen on the rest of the states to go look at this.”The Food and Drug Administration acknowledges, too, that the number does not capture all the overdoses.The cases come at a time when Americans are receiving more medical radiation than ever before, a result of rapid technological advancements that improve diagnosis but can also do harm when safeguards and oversight fail to keep pace.Even when done properly, CT brain perfusion scans deliver a large dose of radiation — the equivalent of about 200 X-rays of the skull. But there are no hard standards for how much radiation is too much. The overdoses highlight how little some in the medical profession understand about the operation of these scanning devices and the nature of radiation injuries, as well as the loose requirements for reporting accidents when they are detected.For a year or more, doctors and hospitals failed to detect the overdoses even though patients continued to report distinctive patterns of hair loss that matched where they had been radiated. After the Food and Drug Administration issued a nationwide alert asking hospitals to check their radiation output on these tests, a few hospitals continued to overdose patients for weeks and in some cases months afterward, according to records and interviews.Four of the hospitals involved were identified in recent months: the Los Angeles County and Medical Center, where one patient received seven and a half times the amount generally used; Bakersfield Memorial Hospital, where 16 people received up to five and a half times too much; South Lake Hospital in central , where an unknown number of patients received 40 percent more than usual; and an unidentified hospital in , government officials said.None of the overdoses can be attributed to malfunctions of the CT scanners, government officials say.At Glendale Adventist Medical Center, where Mr. Reyes and nine others were overdosed, employees told state investigators that they consulted with GE last year when instituting a new procedure to get quicker images of blood flow, state records show. But employees still made mistakes.As a result, hospital officials said, a feature that technicians thought would lower radiation levels actually raised them. Cedars-Sinai gave a similar explanation.“There was a lot of trust in the manufacturers and trust in the technology that this type of equipment in this day and age would not allow you to get more radiation than was absolutely necessary,” said Robert Marchuck, the Glendale hospital’s vice president of ancillary services.A GE spokesman, Arvind Gopalratnam, said the way scanners were programmed was “determined by the user and not the manufacturer.” GE, he added, has no record of Glendale seeking its help setting up the new procedure in 2009.Most of the known overdoses, including the biggest, occurred on scanners made by GE Healthcare. At two hospitals that use scanners — Los Angeles County-U.S.C. and South Lake in Florida — officials said the manufacturer suggested machine settings that ultimately produced too much radiation. Representatives of Toshiba agreed to be interviewed in their California office but abruptly canceled.A dozen overdose victims in California and Alabama said in interviews that the long delay in uncovering the flawed tests had left them struggling to understand what was happening to their health. One patient suspected that the Rogaine he used to stop hair loss was actually causing it. Another patient received injections to stop the hair loss.Patients said doctors speculated that their temporary hair loss might stem from a variety of causes — stress or a ponytail tied too tight — and that redness and were caused by detergent used to wash bed sheets.“What is amazing and seems painfully obvious is if someone walks in with a band of hair missing around the entire circumference of their head, you would ask the question: Have you had a ?” said Richard A. Patterson, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents some of the patients. “Not ‘What did you eat for breakfast yesterday that would cause your hair to fall out today?’ ”The overdoses did not discriminate. Among the victims: a member of Cedars-Sinai’s own board of governors, Ruthe Feldman. Mrs. Feldman says she left the board after learning about the mistake.The Food and Drug Administration, in trying to assess the scope and cause of the overdoses, has had to rely on state radiation control officials for information. But if Alabama is any indication, the agency is not getting a full picture.A Huntsville Hospital spokesman, Burr Ingram, said that about 65 possible stroke patients there had been overradiated. Lawyers representing patients say the number of overdoses is closer to 100.Nonetheless, Alabama officials say the number is actually zero since the state does not define an acceptable dosing level. “No such thing as an overdose,” said James L. McNees, director of the Alabama Office of Radiation Control.One day last August, the radiation safety officer at Cedars-Sinai, Donna Early, decided she had to act.It was a low moment for such an esteemed institution. Patients were being overradiated during CT brain perfusion scans, hospital officials concluded, and it was Ms. Early’s job to tell county health officials.The genesis of Ms. Early’s alert was an event on the morning of July 4, when a 52-year-old executive producer of films, H. Michael Heuser, arrived in the emergency department with stroke symptoms.A “code brain” was immediately called, signaling a life-or-death situation. A blood clot in the brain can be dissolved with medicine, but doctors must do it within several hours, before brain cells die from a lack of oxygen. So Mr. Heuser was rushed into a room with several CT scanners, where he underwent one brain perfusion study and at least one more later. A CT perfusion scan, which lasts about 45 seconds, can identify a stroke through a series of blood flow images.Mr. Heuser did have a stroke, from which he would recover. But other parts of his body inexplicably began to break down.“I had a full body rash — my whole body, legs, armpits, bottom, my back — with these red ,” Mr. Heuser said.It burned and itched. Then clumps of hair began to fall out. “I went completely bald in a perfectly symmetrical 4-inch-wide band that extended from ear to ear all the way around my head,” he recalled. The hospital, he said, responded by offering him a hairpiece.Finally, a doctor was so struck by the unusual nature of Mr. Heuser’s hair loss that he took a picture. A second patient reported similar hair loss. Eventually, the hospital made the connection, and on Aug. 28, Ms. Early called county health officials, records show. From then on, as the accounting of overdoses at Cedars-Sinai reached 269 over a period of 18 months, Mr. Heuser would be known in government reports simply as “Patient 1.”To this day, no one at Cedars-Sinai knows who programmed the scanners that delivered the overdoses, officials there say. But in written statements to The Times, hospital officials said they had figured out how they might have occurred.Normally, the more radiation a CT scan uses, the better the image. But amid concerns that patients are getting more radiation than necessary, the medical community has embraced the idea of using only enough to obtain an image sufficient for diagnosis.To do that, GE offers a feature on its CT scanner that can automatically adjust the dose according to a patient’s size and body part. It is, a GE manual says, “a technical innovation that significantly reduces radiation dose.”At Cedars-Sinai and Glendale Adventist, technicians used the automatic feature — rather than a fixed, predetermined radiation level — for their brain perfusion scans.But a surprise awaited them: when used with certain machine settings that govern image clarity, the automatic feature did not reduce the dose — it raised it.As a result, patients at Cedars-Sinai received up to eight times as much radiation as necessary, while the 10 overradiated at Glendale received four times as much, state records show.GE says the hospitals should have known how to safely use the automatic feature. Besides, GE said, the feature had “limited utility” for a perfusion scan because the test targets one specific area of the brain, rather than body parts of varying thickness. In addition, experts say high-clarity images are not needed to track blood flow in the brain.GE further faulted hospital technologists for failing to notice dosing levels on their treatment screens.But representatives of both hospitals said GE trainers never fully explained the automatic feature.In a statement, Cedars-Sinai said that during multiple training visits, GE never mentioned the “counterintuitive” nature of a feature that promises to lower radiation but ends up raising it. The hospital also said user manuals never pointed out that the automatic feature was of limited value for perfusion scans.A better-designed CT scanner, safety experts say, might have prevented the overdoses by alerting operators, or simply shutting down, when doses reached dangerous levels.To Mr. Heuser, it is unconscionable that equipment able to deliver such high radiation doses lacks stronger safety features.“When you are in a car and it backs up, it goes beep, beep, beep,” he said. “If you fill the washing machine up too much, it won’t work. There is no red light that says you are overradiating.”Manufacturers say they will address some of these issues in newer models.Huntsville Hospital informed patients that they had been overdosed in a two-page form letter that included no apology. The word radiation was mentioned once — in the ninth sentence.“We have identified a few patients, including you, who received a scan in which the dosage level was elevated,” stated the letter, dated Dec. 11, 2009.The acknowledgment by hospital officials that 65 people were overradiated has come slowly.After the California overdoses became public, Huntsville officials reviewed their testing and determined that their use of higher doses to get clearer images was not a mistake and was, in fact, appropriate, according to the GE inspection report. Therefore, they concluded, they had no overdoses.State and federal officials said they did not investigate Huntsville, because there were no equipment malfunctions or because the dosing decisions were considered part of the practice of medicine. As a result, the only public accounting of the number of overdoses in Huntsville has come from the hospital, not government inspectors.By contrast, California officials conducted investigations, released inspection reports and have cited at least four hospitals for failing to safely irradiate patients.Because Huntsville Hospital officials declined to be interviewed, it is unclear how they determined who had been overradiated, when the overdoses started or why patients with sudden hair loss did not arouse more suspicion.Melissa Faye Adams is one of a number of patients who have yet to be told they were overdosed, even though they have pictures of themselves with the distinctive band of hair loss. More than two years ago, just shy of her 40th birthday, she underwent a stroke test at Huntsville Hospital after developing a . Fifteen days later, her hair began falling out and her life began to lurch about in disquieting ways. She still keeps a plastic bag full of her hair marked with that date, 6/15/08. “I panicked,” she said.It would take another year and a half of worry, of unsatisfying doctor visits, before her hairdresser called one day last December telling her to pick up a copy of the local paper. In the paper, the hairdresser said, was “a picture of a lady who looks just like you.” The woman said she had been overradiated at Huntsville Hospital.Dr. Lon Raby, a Huntsville dermatologist, also noticed the picture. “I recognized the pattern with it,” Dr. Raby said. “I’ve seen six or eight all in the same time frame.”Suzanne Sloan, a popular fifth-grade teacher, was one of his patients. She saw the picture, too. “We were screaming,” Ms. Sloan said. “She had the same identical thing.”Ms. Sloan’s fruitless search for an explanation had taken her to the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, Ochsner Health System in and in . “They had no clue,” she said. “I lost 15 pounds. I couldn’t sleep.”Ms. Sloan had tried to cover her missing hair using bobby pins. But one day at school, a gust of wind blew and children saw her strip of missing hair. One got sick and vomited, she said. As word of her condition spread, former students flocked to her classroom, some crying. “We heard you were dying,” one said. “Is there something we can do?”Another patient, an aerospace engineer who says she had a after her scan, said her dermatologist wrote to Huntsville Hospital out of concern for her and another patient with similar symptoms.“Even after the dermatologist put two and two together and asked Huntsville Hospital to contact me, they never did,” said the engineer, who provided a picture of her hair loss but asked that her name be withheld because of professional reasons.She said she suffered from memory loss and confusion.Huntsville Hospital officials said they did not routinely record radiation dose levels before 2009. Mr. Ingram, the spokesman, said the hospital did keep information needed to calculate the dose, but he declined to say whether officials had gone back to determine doses for all patients who had brain perfusion scans.The form letter Huntsville sent to overdose patients appears to play down the damage that high doses can inflict. The hospital told patients that hair loss and skin redness might occur but would go away. “At this time, we have no recommendations for you to have any follow-up treatment,” the letter said.Health experts elsewhere have warned of possible eye damage, in addition to the higher risk of cancer and brain damage.For Dr. Smith-Bindman, a professor at the , the larger question raised by her review of overdose cases, including one in Huntsville, is whether their symptoms actually required such a powerful test in the first place. She also noted that many of the patients were relatively young.“These tests have really high doses,” she said. “And there’s no system for figuring out who is getting them and why they are getting them.”Reducing mistakes is important, but the bigger challenge, she said, is to eliminate unnecessary testing.“Utilization has increased dramatically, and as a society we have not had the time to respond.”'"
"'10-08-01,'0','Some analysts worry that academics are possibly imperiling or compromising the independence of their universities when they venture onto boards. Others question whether scholars have the time — and financial sophistication — needed to police the country’s biggest corporations while simultaneously juggling the demands of running a large university.“It is prestigious for a company to have a major university president on their board,” says Pablo Eisenberg, senior fellow at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute. “But few college and university C.E.O.’s are even qualified to understand the workings of a major public company.”According to a 2008 survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education, presidents from 19 of the top 40 research universities with the largest operating budgets sat on at least one company board. The trend is more widespread among public universities, but the private ones are catching up: the American Council on Education says that from 2001 to 2006, the proportion of presidents from all doctorate-granting institutions sitting on corporate boards rose to 52.1 percent from 47.8 percent at public institutions, and to 50.9 percent from 40.6 percent at private ones.Some of the more high-profile and ubiquitous academics include the president of Stanford, John L. Hennessy, who sits on three boards, including that of Google. (Google also has the president of Princeton, Shirley M. Tilghman, on its board.) The chancellor of the University of California, San Diego, Marye Anne Fox, is on three boards.And then there is Dr. Jackson of Rensselaer, the highest-paid private college president and one of the most prominent black university leaders. In addition to FedEx, she sits on the boards of four other companies, including I.B.M. and Marathon Oil, and she recently stepped down from the board of NYSE Euronext.THE attractions are clear for the president: lucrative extra pay and useful networking, among other reasons. For a dozen hours or so each month for each board served, in addition to preparation time, and their wise advice, they can receive hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Brown University and the first African-American woman to lead an Ivy League university, sat on the Goldman Sachs board until she stepped down this year. In 2009, she earned $323,539 from her Goldman directorship, including stock grants and options, as calculated by Goldman, and left the board with stock worth at the time around $4.3 million. This is in addition to her salary from Brown, $576,000 this year.Dr. Jackson earned $1.38 million from her directorships, comprising both cash and stock. That’s in addition to $1.6 million from her day job, including bonuses and other benefits.Beyond personal financial benefits, the interchange of ideas between campus and corporation can allow for a fruitful cross-fertilization. For example, Dr. Hennessy sits on the boards of Cisco Systems and Atheros Communications as well as Google. As an electrical engineer and a pioneer in computer architecture, he is well placed to bring industry expertise to the boards he serves.William G. Bowen was president of Princeton University for 16 years and served on two boards, including Merck’s. It was an experience, he says, that was invaluable in helping him build up Princeton’s then-fledgling life sciences activities.“It influenced my understanding of how the field was evolving, where new ideas were most likely to appear, where to look for talent,” he recalls. “It was one long seminar in the sciences and molecular biology.”There are benefits for the company, too.One obvious advantage is having an outsider who thinks about alternative solutions to corporate problems. Another is diversity.Indeed, the path from academia to corporate boards began broadening in the late 1990s when companies sought to break up the traditionally white, male composition of their boards. Academia, and in particular university presidents, were a good source of prominent minority leaders and women who were established in their fields and had experience running big organizations.Phyllis M. Wise, the provost of the University of Washington, is on Nike’s board. Nike said it hired Dr. Wise, an Asian-American, “because of her impressive accomplishments and her record of independent thought, and we believe that through the exchange of ideas, both Nike and the University of Washington will benefit.”But according to James H. Finkelstein, a professor in the George Mason School of Public Policy, probably the biggest reason companies have sought out academics is the prestige they bring. Universities are among the few institutions trusted by the public, he says, and companies believe they can associate themselves with this quality by installing an academic on the board.“Corporations think this is a way of enhancing their prestige and legitimacy, especially in the case of Ivy League presidents,” he says. “I suspect that’s the principal motivation. It’s probably not for their business sense.”John Gillespie, who has written a book on corporate boards, “Money for Nothing,” says academics are often selected for another reason — because they are less likely to rock the boat than directors from the business world.Academics may be trained to ask tough questions in their own fields, but when confronted with tricky business issues far above their level of expertise they “often become as meek as church mice,” he says.MOST corporate governance experts think that a president serving on one board brings benefits to both the company and the university, but the situation becomes problematic as these academics serve on more boards. There may be diminishing returns to the university and less time to be an effective board member.Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, an independent research firm focusing on corporate governance, says Goldman Sachs was hurt having Dr. Simmons as a director because she lacks financial expertise and was focused more than she should have been on other things like the firm’s philanthropy. She was chairwoman of the advisory board for a Goldman initiative, 10,000 Women, that provides women outside the firm with business and management education.“That seat could have been held by someone who understood derivatives,” says Ms. Minow. “What we have learned from the financial crisis is that boards of directors have failed miserably in their No. 1 task of risk management. You don’t go on a board for networking, seeking contributions or working for minorities. You go on a board for one purpose — to manage risk for the long-term benefit of the shareholder.”Samuel Robinson, a Goldman spokesman, said that “Ruth Simmons’s contribution to our board was deep and also wide-ranging.” He added: “Ruth brought invaluable perspective on leadership, people and decision-making, and her direct work with students was of great value to a firm that recruits hundreds of young people every year. Her personal story and perspective on diversity speak for themselves.”Dr. Simmons declined to comment for this article. In an interview early this year after she announced she was retiring from the Goldman board, she said filling boards with specialists was “exactly the wrong direction.”“You need people close to the industry to provide depth of experience, but you also need people with perspective,” she says.In the case of Dr. Jackson and her five board appointments, Ms. Minow says, “it is just physically impossible to do the work necessary to be a good director” on so many boards. The Corporate Library estimates that board members must invest 240 hours a year, including meetings and preparation, to do the work properly. But it can become a full-time job if the company runs into trouble.Charles M. Elson, a corporate governance specialist at the University of Delaware, is highly critical of university presidents who serve on several boards, although he is reluctant to single out particular directors or companies. “If you see a university president on multiple boards, that’s a problem,” he says. “There is no way you can do the job. Someone has got short shrift.”Some of the companies these presidents served make a different assessment, however.Marathon Oil said it was proud to have Dr. Jackson on its board. “She is a valued contributor, with a keen attention to detail and breadth of knowledge that serves Marathon well,” a company spokesman says.FedEx said her broad array of commitments had not interfered with her work on its board and that she had recently been selected to be chairwoman of its nominating and governance committee. “We consider the breadth of her experience — in academia, government service and as a member of other public company boards — to be a tremendous asset to our company,” says a FedEx spokesman.I.B.M. said that Dr. Jackson, who is a member of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and a former chairwoman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, was re-elected to the I.B.M. board this spring by more than 93 percent of shareholder votes cast. “It is clear that the overwhelming majority of I.B.M.’s stockholders appreciate her contributions to the company,” says an I.B.M. spokesman.Dr. Jackson would not comment for this article. A Rensselaer spokesman, William N. Walker, said she regularly worked on her board duties through vacation and on weekends. As proof that she was not being distracted from her Rensselaer duties, he cited the hiring of more than 270 new faculty members, $700 million in construction and renovation including four new centers on campus, and a $360 million anonymous donation in 2001 as part of a $1.4 billion capital campaign. Her networking at I.B.M. paid off by helping to bring a $100 million supercomputer to the campus in partnership with I.B.M. and New York State, he said. In June, Rensselaer’s board of trustees voted to give Dr. Jackson another 10-year term.Dr. Hennessy of Stanford could not be reached to comment for this article. Dr. Sample, who is retiring as president of U.S.C. this month, has worked as a director for about a dozen companies over the last three decades. One of them, Intermec, a manufacturer of supply chain tracking devices, praised his energy and commitment, and said his roles on other boards helped the company because he brought perspectives from other businesses. Dr. Sample declined to comment, as did Dr. Fox.AS academics serve on a greater number of boards, there is also an increased chance of reputational risk if a company runs into difficulties.“Woe to the university president who would sit on BP’s board,” says Richard P. Chait, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.Erroll B. Davis Jr., chancellor of the University System of Georgia, was on the BP board for 12 years, though he stepped down in April, just days before the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded, causing the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. His retirement, however, wasn’t enough to protect him from being named, along with other directors, in a small number of lawsuits filed against BP over the disaster.“There is a big risk to academics when they serve on boards. They especially attract criticism when a company gets into trouble,” said James Kristie, editor of Director & Boards, a trade publication. “They are more harshly criticized because they are supposed to be the smartest guys in the room.”The risk of a damaged reputation seemed to be an issue when Dr. Simmons announced in February that she was stepping down from the Goldman board.At the time, Goldman was being battered by questions about its involvement in the financial crisis and the lucrative pay it doled out to executives and employees even after the firm had received a huge taxpayer bailout. As a director, Dr. Simmons was partly responsible for approving Goldman’s bonuses during the boom years — including the $68 million pay package awarded to its chairman, Lloyd C. Blankfein, in 2007, the largest ever on Wall Street.Early this year Dr. Simmons said the criticism directed at Goldman was not the reason she gave up her position. She would not comment on whether the salaries the board had approved over the past decade were appropriate, except to say, “The environment for salaries on Wall Street has evolved over a period of time, and the environment today is different.”She also said that the job had become harder and more time-consuming. The financial crisis, in particular, added to the burden.Dr. Simmons has cut back on her corporate service, and now sits on the board of only one company, Texas Instruments. In that respect, she is emblematic of a movement to limit the number of boards each president serves. In the University of California system, for example, the Board of Regents voted in January to restrict board membership for its chancellors to three.Raymond D. Cotton, a partner at the Washington law firm Mintz Levin who specializes in presidential contracts and has represented about 250 institutions, says he recommends to universities that they write into contracts that the president can serve on a maximum of two boards.There can be outliers like Dr. Jackson, who seems to have done a “terrific job at R.P.I. especially in fund-raising,” he says. “But in general, at some point in time a university board has to say enough is enough.”A HOST of separate questions come into play when a college or university has some other relationship with the company.At the University of Washington, Dr. Wise’s appointment to the Nike board, where she sits on the social responsibility committee, had become controversial on the campus in Seattle. Some questioned whether she should be drawing $50,000 in cash and $70,000 in stock options from Nike, in addition to a $559,000 salary, for a role she won mainly, they say, as a consequence of her position as head of a public university.In July, however, Dr. Wise announced that she was donating her income from Nike to student scholarships.Others have questioned whether she will be able to do her job properly on the board at the same time Nike has a contract to give $35 million in cash and athletic equipment to the university over 10 years. The apparel company also pays the university around $110,000 a year for the right to sell Washington shirts.As a further sign of how complicated the issue can become, some academics at the University of Washington protested that Dr. Wise’s presence on the board meant they would not be able to criticize Nike over its labor policy, in particular the treatment of workers at factories in the developing world.“She is the chief academic officer of the university, to whom all faculty report, and her affiliation with Nike creates incentives for faculty to be less vocal about Nike’s human rights record,” said Angelina S. Godoy, director of the university’s Center for Human Rights. However, Ms. Godoy said a recent landmark agreement between Nike and unions in Honduras made her less concerned about the university’s relationship with Nike.In an interview before Nike announced the Honduras agreement, Dr. Wise rebutted the idea that her presence on the board would make her colleagues less critical of Nike. She says she can manage any conflicts of interest and will recuse herself from university decisions involving Nike. She says she accepted the seat because it would give her decision-making and commercial know-how to put into practice on campus.“Many years ago, academicians tended to be dreamers,” she says. “We assumed somebody else would figure out where the money was going to come from. That notion is no longer the case.”As for what she brings to Nike, she says, “I know a little bit how students think, what might drive their desire to look into Nike products.”'"
"'10-08-01,'0','The Missouri secretary of state, Robin Carnahan, who is herself expected to coast to the Democratic nomination for United States Senate, predicted that only 24 percent of voters would turn out.Of 20 Missourians interviewed at random in St. Louis last week, only five knew that there was a primary on Tuesday, much less a referendum on the health care law.“Really, there is?” said Jeff R. Swaney, 53, a lawyer from Chesterfield, a St. Louis suburb. “I wasn’t even aware it was on the ballot. I haven’t seen any commercials.”Supporters of Proposition C are hoping for a substantial victory that will convey a message of discontent with expansive federal government and rally other states and candidates to press the issue through the fall campaign.“This is a throw-down by the states, saying, ‘Not in our state, you don’t,’ ” State Senator Jim Lembke, a Republican, said at a rally for the proposition here on Wednesday. “This health care thing is just a vehicle, a vehicle for the debate about what is the role of the federal government and what is the role of the states.”No grass-roots organization has formed to oppose the measure, and the unions and consumer groups that lobbied for the federal health care law have steered clear. Mr. Obama did not take time to denounce Proposition C when he visited Missouri in early June.“The proposition will have no legal standing, so I don’t know why there’d be a reason to focus on it,” said Brian B. Zuzenak, executive director of the Missouri Democratic Party. “From the beginning, we’ve said it’s meaningless and unconstitutional. At best, it’s a ploy by the Republicans to get their base excited.”Comparable measures have already been enacted by legislatures in five states — Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana and Virginia — according to the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group that is pushing the initiatives. Arizona and Oklahoma are scheduled to vote in the November general election on state constitutional amendments to nullify the insurance requirement. A judge in Florida tossed a similar constitutional amendment off that state’s ballot last week, sayings its language was too overtly political.The nullification laws are expected to have little immediate practical impact, because the insurance requirement does not take effect until 2014. And by then, the federal courts are likely to have had much to say about whether the new health care law is constitutional, and thus beyond the reach of state efforts to invalidate it.Elected officials in 22 states, almost all Republicans, have filed lawsuits challenging the so-called individual insurance mandate. Among them, Virginia has made a direct claim that the federal law conflicts with its own 2010 statute, which asserts that residents of the commonwealth cannot be compelled to obtain health insurance.The most recent lawsuit was filed individually by Missouri’s lieutenant governor, Peter D. Kinder, a Republican who acted without the support of Governor Nixon.In the Missouri referendum, voters will be asked whether state law — not the State Constitution — should be amended to “deny the government authority to penalize citizens for refusing to purchase private insurance or infringe upon the right to offer or accept direct payment for lawful health care services.”In May, Republican legislators, who control both houses, cut a deal with Democrats to put the question on the ballot. The Democrats agreed not to filibuster if the referendum was held during the August primary rather than the November general election, said State Senator Jane Cunningham, a Republican who sponsored the bill. With an open seat for the Senate on the line, the Democrats did not want to encourage heavy turnout among conservatives in November.The legislation passed each chamber comfortably, winning a number of Democratic votes. By addressing the issue as a statutory ballot measure, the lawmakers managed to bypass Mr. Nixon, whose signature would otherwise be needed.A spokesman for Mr. Nixon declined to reveal how the governor would vote on the referendum. The governor acknowledges that the health care law is not popular in his state, but has said he will work to maximize its benefits for Missouri. “This isn’t about protest,” he said recently. “It’s about progress.”Support for the proposition is being rallied by Missourians for Health Care Freedom, which formed as an outgrowth of the legislative debate. The group raised $75,000 as of July 24, enough for radio advertising, yard signs and get-out-the-vote telephone banks, but not enough for television commercials.“Do you think Washington knows what’s best for you and your family?” asks the group’s radio ad, which is playing on Christian and conservative talk stations.The referendum is supported by the Missouri State Medical Association. The only organized opposition — beyond a Facebook page — has been mounted by the Missouri Hospital Association, which has spent more than $400,000 to send mailings to hundreds of thousands of homes, according to financial disclosure reports. The brochures warn that approval of Proposition C could burden hospitals, and their insured patients, with the cost of uncompensated care for people without health coverage.“There’s an argument that a vote for Proposition C is a vote in support of freeloaders,” said David M. Dillon, a spokesman for the hospital association.Mr. Dillon said there was no corresponding get-out-the-vote operation.“I don’t even have someone I can direct people to,” he said. “There really isn’t an organized opposition. Frankly, we don’t want it perceived that we’re opposing it. But we certainly want people to understand that their choice has some implications.”'"
"'10-08-01,'0','“He had a daily or weekly habit of walking down to the basement of the Capitol and confiscating piles of coins from the vending machines,” said Kim Long, author of “The Almanac of Political Corruption, Scandals and Dirty Politics.”William Hale Thompson served as mayor of Chicago for all but four years from 1915 through 1931, an era marked by Al Capone and Prohibition. He had been born wealthy, and upon his death in 1944, his lawyer valued the estate at $150,000. But when state agents opened two safe deposit boxes in his name, they found $1.5 million in cash, the equivalent of about $18.6 million today.Of course, no trip through the landscape of public corruption would be complete without a brief stop in New Jersey.Harold G. Hoffman, a former New Jersey governor and congressman who died in 1954, enjoyed a largely unblemished career in politics. But he apparently was riddled with guilt near the end.Mr. Hoffman left his daughter a letter, to be opened upon his death, detailing a lifetime of corruption, including embezzling up to $50,000 a month when he was commissioner of motor vehicles and $300,000 from a bank. He said he had always hoped to pay the money back and asked his daughter “to do what you know must be done.”Among politicians who got caught, some escaped more serious consequences simply by resigning.James John Walker, known as Jimmy, resigned as New York City mayor in 1932 rather than face removal from office and possible indictment on corruption charges.Spiro T. Agnew, the vice president under Richard M. Nixon, resigned in 1973 amid a federal investigation into bribery and extortion. He had pocketed tens of thousands of dollars in kickbacks while governor and a county executive in Maryland. Forced out of office, he was allowed to plead no contest to a single charge of income tax evasion. He was sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation, fined $10,000 and went on to become a successful business consultant.James Williams Tate, a Kentucky state treasurer known as “Honest Dick,” disappeared in 1888, just before it was discovered that he had embezzled $150,000 from state funds. Newspapers followed rumors of his whereabouts abroad, including in China, Japan and Brazil.“He wrote home to his wife for a year and then his letters ceased entirely, and now it is stated by his friends, who should know, that he is dead,” The New York Times reported in 1890.Then there was David Friedland, a state senator from New Jersey, who disappeared after staging a fatal scuba diving accident in 1985 as he was awaiting sentencing for fraud. In 1988, he was caught on the Maldives, a chain of islands in the Indian Ocean, where he had built a successful chain of dive shops, and served about nine years of a 15-year sentence.“He was really too successful,” said one federal investigator. “If he had elected to become low profile, he might still be at large.”Obviously, not every official who gets investigated is charged, and not every official who is charged is guilty. Prosecutors have wide discretion in selecting cases.Michele Hirshman, a former chief of the public corruption unit in the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, said she had focused on cases that uncovered a significant betrayal of the public’s trust.She added that prosecutors faced special challenges in proving such cases, like needing insiders to reveal the motivations of those involved.It turned out that Mr. Powell, the Illinois official who kept his cash in shoe boxes, was not shy about his motivations, though his crimes were not discovered until he was dead.“There’s only one thing worse than a defeated politician,” he once said. “That’s a defeated and broke politician.”'"
"'10-08-01,'0','When working with relatives, Mr. Specht says, you often must manage your career, because there may be no formal process for promotion or development. “Discuss what kinds of hurdles you’ll need to overcome to be a leader there; otherwise you could wind up as more of a hired hand than as someone on a professional path,” he says.You want to know up front what your long-term job prospects are and what could limit you. “If it’s your brother’s business and he’s got three daughters being groomed as successors,” Mr. McCann says. “you’ll probably never make it to the top.”Ask about contingency plans. Mr. Specht says: “If it’s your uncle’s business, what happens if he dies or is disabled? Does the business dissolve? Make sure there is a succession plan in place.”Q. Because you needed a job, a spot was created for you in a relative’s company. Might employees there — especially those who aren’t family — resent that?A. “There could be a lot of friction with nonfamily employees, who are worried about the tough economic times and know the business isn’t hiring,” Mr. Specht says. “They could feel their own jobs are now in jeopardy.”It’s important to view the position as an opportunity and not just as a place to park yourself until the job market improves. Hold yourself to a very high standard, advises Graham Chapman, who took a job with his father’s marketing firm, 919 Marketing Company in Holly Springs, N.C., after graduating from college in 2009.Mr. Chapman — who had few job prospects at the time — started in an entry-level spot but was soon working in a new position developing new business. “I was concerned about being in a situation where others at the firm resented me and thought I was getting favors,” he says. “To avoid that, I knew I would have to work harder than others and have results fairly quickly.”Q. Even though you’re working with family, should you have an employment contract or other written agreements in place beforehand?A. If the business owner is a fairly close relative, a formal employment agreement is probably overkill, but you should have a written description of your role and responsibilities and the organizational structure, says Mark T. Green, a partner in the Family Business Consulting Group who works in Salem, Ore., and a clinical professor of family business at Seattle University. “Work as much out as possible upfront, like expectations about compensation, perks, even what happens if things don’t work out, because if you leave you still have to see these people at family gatherings,” says Mr. Green, whose consulting group is based in Marietta, Ga.Q. Even if it wasn’t your first choice in terms of a career move, what are the benefits of working with family?A. You will likely wind up with exposure to more parts of the business in a shorter time frame than you would in a corporate setting, because of your access to top leaders, Mr. Green says. Many family-run businesses are small, and that will probably give you the opportunity to wear different hats.There is also a feeling of loyalty and a sense of mission when you work with relatives. “You want to win for the family. There’s a feeling of ‘If I do well, you do well’ that gives the job purpose and meaning,” says Larry H. Colin, co-author of “Family, Inc.”Mr. Colin says family members often have a greater tolerance for mistakes and bad decisions than nonfamily members and are generally more willing to accommodate work-life balance.Working with family isn’t always easy, he says: “But when it works — and it works a lot — there’s nothing better.”'"
"'10-08-01,'0','But the “Studio 54” event, sponsored by his real estate agency, Shawn Elliott Luxury Homes and Estates, had two purposes. Besides using the wow of a party to help sell the house, Mr. Petrakis was trying to drum up business for his passion, building nightclubs in homes. A sign indicated that work on the bar had been done by the Karas Contracting Corporation of Amityville. House surveys and brochures were stacked in the dining room.Increasingly, over-the-top open houses are about strategic alliances and collaborations as well as selling the house. In March, for instance, at an open house that drew 500 guests to a $12 million Upper Brookville mansion, Shawn Elliott teamed up with local Ferrari and Rolls-Royce dealers to display cars in the courtyard. Inside, a local billiards dealer had placed several pool tables for guests to play on. (A Rolls-Royce and a Ferrari sold. The house didn’t.)“Luxury feeds luxury,” Mr. Elliott said. “We all have the same customers, and the talent is hooking everybody up with everybody. At the end of the day, everyone benefits.”On Shelter Island last month, Michael Morris and Yoshiko Sato combined a cocktail party and an art show at an open house for their $4.195 million Japanese-inspired six-bedroom contemporary house, with a pool and guesthouse. Twenty-six paintings by the Spanish artist Antonio Murado were hanging on the walls.“This house needs to be shown with art,” Mr. Morris said, pleased with a turnout of more than 50 people. “We had people who had just come to see the art and people who had just come to see the house.” Three paintings sold. Mr. Morris and Mr. Sato, who were also the architects for the house, received “some serious nibbles.”Additionally, Mr. Morris said, the open house was a good opportunity to meet potential clients. He said his houses, built on speculation, were “designed to be calling cards” for the architectural practice. A handful of guests inquired about renovations, teardowns and new construction.Gary DePersia, a broker at the Corcoran Group, sponsored the Morris open house. On July 24, at a $14.95 million 7-bedroom 10-bath house on two acres in Water Mill, he tried a different tack: the unveiling of the new 2010 Rolls-Royce Ghost at a “ride-and-drive brunch.” Those who want to buy this kind of house might also want to buy this kind of car, Mr. DePersia said. Six cars, valued at $300,000 to $400,000 each, were available for test drives, while the house was open for lookers.“Event planners and corporate sponsors are always looking for houses to do their events in,” Mr. DePersia said. Such events would include charity functions that bring in wealthy guests, who might be house-hunting themselves or might mention a certain home to friends. “It works for the event planner and for the corporate sponsor and for the homeowner because it gives exposure to the house,” he said.Perhaps the biggest collaboration when it comes to selling a home is the case of the designer show house. Frank Bodenchak built the 11,200-square-foot postmodern spec house on five acres in Sag Harbor that is being used for this summer’s Hamptons Designer Showhouse. Scheduled through Sept. 5, the event is being sponsored by Traditional Home magazine; this is its 10th year. There is an entry fee of $30; proceeds benefit Southampton Hospital. The house is on the market with Edge Real Estate for $5.25 million.Tony Manning, a spokesman for the annual event, which has in the last few years featured mainly houses built on speculation, said the house “will never look better than it does as a show house.”“It’s a win-win,” Mr. Manning said, pointing out that such events ensure exposure for the builder and the designers, and provide design talent for the magazine, as well as a bounty for the hospital. Based on prior years’ proceeds, he said, the hospital stands to make “at least $100,000.”Mr. Bodenchak said that because of the designers’ involvement he had been able to “substantially upgrade” the house with a 12-seat movie theater with cherry woodwork, a multilevel fire pit with a waterfall running through it, and blue ledge-work retaining walls and landscaping details.The house used for last year’s showcase sold immediately, Mr. Manning said. The event also culminated in sales in other years.Mr. Bodenchak is keeping his fingers crossed. “Our hope,” he said, “is the 7,000 people that come through will form an attractive base among themselves.”'"
"'10-08-01,'0','“It’s to the developer’s benefit to keep the price higher and instead offer concessions and incentives,” said Vickey Barron, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. “There’s nothing worse than for people to purchase and find out their neighbor purchased it for a lot less.”Greystone’s gamble may have paid off. Mr. Steinberg said interest in the East 93rd Street condos soared in May, when the first model unit opened for showings. Almost at once, two condos went into contract at close to the original asking price of $5.4 million, he said.“We hid for about a year and a half, but the minute we had this model apartment we tallied two sales,” said Mr. Steinberg, who added that by paying off a construction loan early on the developer was able to keep prices the same without pressure from the bank.At District NY, a condominium on Fulton Street in Lower Manhattan, sleek European design, a spa and rooftop reflecting pools created enough buzz in the summer of 2007 to lure potential buyers into negotiations for 123 of the 163 units there. But some three-dozen units that went into contract in those halcyon days stubbornly failed to close. As a result, the developer, Wonder Works Construction, dimmed the lights at its sales office until July 2009.Stephen McArdle, a partner at Urban Marketing, the building’s new marketing group, reopened the building’s sales office and hosted parties for friends and family members of existing tenants. More important, common charges were reduced by 6.5 percent.But there wasn’t a reduction in prices, which range from $525,000 for studios to $3.42 million for penthouses. Since last summer, another 65 units went into contract, Mr. McArdle said.“What I think we did very well is reposition the building for all the families coming to the area,” he said. “We got away from the glitz and glamour of the Calvin Klein commercials.”Henry Justin, the developer of a condo conversion at 211 East 51st Street, took a different approach when his project stalled with about 30 percent of 70 units sold. After briefly cutting prices on some units by 5 percent, Mr. Justin chose instead to re-establish initial pricing and dangle an option to customize space, by combining, for example, a two-bedroom unit with a studio to create a smaller three bedroom. “If I was to drop my price by $100 a square foot I’d be taking a loss of about $5 million,” he said, noting that five more units have gone into contract since March.But with the economy still uncertain, at least one developer who had intended to hold the line has flinched.Despite clear views of the High Line, not one unit at +aRt, a condominium in Chelsea at 540 West 28th Street referred to as “Plus Art,” sold in the fall of 2008, said Stephen Kliegerman, the director of development marketing for Halstead Property. By November of that year, 90 unsold condos ranging from $850,000 to $1.4 million were taken off the market.After marketing resumed in May, brokers at a grand reopening gala suggested that prices remained too high. Mr. Kliegerman and others involved with the project agreed to keep some units at 2008 levels while reducing prices by 10 percent for a second group of units. Mr. Kliegerman said several units had since gone into contract. “We really wanted the market to speak to us,” he said. “In retrospect, if we had a crystal ball and we were able to jump back in time, we probably wouldn’t have done anything differently because you never know until you get to the marketplace where those prices are going to be.”'"
"'10-08-01,'0','Ms. Yeo prizes her green wonderland not simply because it provides food, serenity and the intoxicatingly fragrant sachets. Her garden, which she spends at least two hours a day tending, is also her muse. Ms. Yeo became a serious watercolorist in the 1970s, and for nearly three decades, this backyard has provided inspiration. Especially early on, she used to sketch and paint outside, or take blossoms into her basement studio.Inside the house her work is everywhere. Above the living room sofa hangs a large watercolor titled “Fish in Lily Pond No. 2” in which golden koi swim amid a tangle of dying lotus blossoms. On the dining room walls hang images of magenta tulips, captured just as their petals are about to fall, along with violet-blue irises, both inspired by plants from her garden. Elsewhere are impressionistic depictions of orange roses and the passion flowers that grow wild in Singapore. Ms. Yeo remembers eating their little fruits as a child.Ms. Yeo, who had started painting in Thailand, resumed her career when she arrived in Queens. Her work has been exhibited locally and in Singapore; it has even been reproduced on Unicef greeting cards.Although the couple have lived in New York for more than three decades, their roots in Southeast Asia remain strong, and nowhere are the ties more vivid than in the wedding photographs of their respective parents that hang in their living room.When Ms. Yeo’s parents were married, her mother was just 15, and the face that peers out from the picture is that of a solemn child. Both husband and wife were dressed in ceremonial wedding garb, and the embroidered slippers shot with silver thread that they wore that day are framed and hang below their portrait. Mr. Yeo’s parents, more modern, were attired in Western clothing; she in a striped outfit and he in black and white dress shoes.The couple’s ties to Southeast Asia are evident, too, in their collection of pottery, displayed in a pair of cabinets in the living room. The contents include blue and white china acquired from salvaged wrecks of sunken pirate ships, along with dishes bearing hand-painted images of crabs and shrimp, of butterflies and swallows, and of grasshoppers and dragonflies that might have flown in from the garden. There are snuff bottles, nesting bowls, tea caddies, ginger jars. Every piece has a story and many have a past.For many years Mr. Yeo played competitive chess, and his small army of silver trophies occupies an entire shelf in their bedroom. He is also the family’s official photographer, the one who has preserved images of his wife’s creations and who attends to, as he puts it, “all her photographic needs.”On Ms. Yeo’s dresser sit lacquered music boxes that her husband has bought her over the years. Some of them play Japanese music, although the one that opened to reveal a tiny ballerina, now long gone, plays that music-box chestnut, “Around the World in 80 Days.”The couple also collect antique books. When Mr. Yeo was young, one of his favorite poems was Coleridge’s “Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” and he counts himself fortunate to possess a copy of an early American edition of the poem, an oversized volume dating from 1878, complete with original etchings by Gustave Doré.The house retains many of its mid-century architectural elements, among them the vaulted ceiling in the living room and the arched doorways. The spacious finished basement serves as Ms. Yeo’s studio and is also where she teaches students and stores her art books.But without question the outdoor space is the couple’s jewel. Along with all the plants that Ms. Yeo ticked off on her little tour, the garden is planted with phlox, evening primroses, Siberian irises, columbines, gladiolas, hibiscus, anemones — names people remember from the gardens of their childhood, the ones tended by their mothers and grandmothers. Plantings include species with lovely and evocative names like lambs’ ear and hen and chicks. A small cement statue of Hebe, cupbearer to the gods, is among several sculptures that keep watch over the greenery.The garden is also home to trees the couple has grown from seed, among them a lemon, an avocado and a pineapple; all sit in pots for easy transport inside during cold weather. Other foodstuffs are provided via trees bearing nectarines, persimmons and figs, along with blueberry and raspberry bushes and cherry tomato plants. So many delicious things grow here, the couple could practically live off the bounty.Come late summer, orange and black monarchs will swarm the butterfly bush. Come autumn, the pale blossoms of flowering fall clematis will climb the fence that surrounds the property.“Each season will have its own palette,” Ms. Yeo said, “its own colors and fragrances. And because so many of the flowers are perennials, they will return year after year after year.”'"
"'10-08-01,'0','Perhaps the marquee theater attraction at the festival was the laurel-bedecked London import “A Disappearing Number,” an intermissionless journey into the minds of mathematicians both fictional and historical, courtesy of Simon McBurney and the experimental company Complicite. I thoroughly enjoyed the show, but it was definitely thinking-cap theater, involving long monologues about the fascinations of prime numbers, jokey allusions to string theory and more.Consider this dizzying stream, from one of the show’s perky fictional mathematicians: “Let me show you how one can obtain this anomalous result using the Functional Equation of the Riemann Zeta Function. And this is how it goes ... 2 to the power of 1 minus Z, times the cosine of a half pi Z, is equal to pi to the power of Z, times the zeta of 1 minus Z.”Got it? And that’s just the opening scene.Let me interrupt this low-grade temper tantrum to offer the disclaimer that, yes, I do prize smart, inquisitive and idea-rich theater. The Lincoln Center Festival is a valuable summer institution. Important international theater all too rarely makes its way to New York during the regular season — unless it parks at the Brooklyn Academy of Music — and much of what the festival brings to the city has merit.But enough boilerplate. Is it too much to ask for a little Noël Coward when the temperature hovers in the triple digits for weeks on end? Coward didn’t write about the Riemann Zeta Function; he wrote about stylish British swells quipping and bed hopping and drinking Champagne by the bucketful. This sounds quite refreshing right now.Hie thee to the Hamptons, you suggest? Well I did, and instead of frothy diversion I was confronted with Peter Shaffer’s existential-question-pondering “Equus” at the Guild Hall in East Hampton. That’s the one about the youngster who works through his emotional problems by poking out horses’ eyes, and the psychiatrist who secretly envies him his strange erotic rites. True, it starred Alec Baldwin, so delightful on “30 Rock.” But instead of exuding the twinkly self-satisfaction of Jack Donaghy, Mr. Baldwin was required to be broody and British, and wear slouchy suits.Shakespeare in the Park, a welcome summertime rite? Back in the city, on one of my nights off I took in the Public Theater’s hot-ticket offering at the Delacorte Theater. As you’ve no doubt heard, this would be Shakespeare’s least funny “comedy,” “The Merchant of Venice,” starring Al Pacino as the Jewish moneylender Shylock.Daniel Sullivan’s thoughtful production of this ever-troublesome play does not stint on the gloom. It’s set in what appears to be concentric circles of prison cells, and is infused with a haunted sense of a society irrevocably divided, a world where loyal friendship, family feeling and romantic love are but feeble bulwarks against the prevailing antagonisms.Mr. Pacino’s performance also seemed divided against itself: sometimes maddening, sometimes thrilling. In the first act his eccentric, whinnying line readings reminded me of a child pounding randomly on the piano keys, making lots of noise without actually making music. But in the trial scene he was grounded and riveting, as was Lily Rabe’s beautifully unmannered delivery of the “quality of mercy” speech, which has never moved me more, particularly because that quality was in vividly short supply even among some of the more benevolent characters in the world evoked by Mr. Sullivan.Incidentally, it seemed entirely appropriate, given the endurance test my summer has become, that a thunderstorm swept into the city mere minutes into the first act. After huddling under the theater’s narrow awning for a half-hour, as water puddled around us, we trooped back to our wet seats to witness Shylock’s brutal humiliation at the hands of the good Christians. The show ended at midnight.But almost nobody left early. While I may be one of the few to take in most of the summer’s darkest and dreariest shows, it’s pretty clear that New York theater audiences are more than happy to stay in school all year long, absorbing challenging fare. At the Lincoln Center Festival “The Demons” was a tough ticket; “Disappearing Number” packed them into the huge David H. Koch Theater; and even that puppet show about the savage World War II battle sold out.The search for breezy summer fare might naturally lead to the Berkshires and surrounding areas, once staples on the “straw hat” theater circuit. And while there have been some festive offerings — the Williamstown Theater Festival opened its mainstage season with “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum” — I also noticed quite a few darker ones: Samuel Beckett’s “Happy Days” at the Westport Country Playhouse, and at the Berkshire Theater Festival more Beckett (“Endgame”) and Edward Albee’s acid portrait of a family in existential crisis, “A Delicate Balance,” not to mention the cheery “Macbeth” as the season’s Shakespeare selection.Happily, the festival also offered a classic bit of summer-stock fluff, a rare revival of Ferenc Molnar’s comedy “The Guardsman,” an old-fashioned romp about an actor who goes undercover as a Russian imperial guard in order to test his wife’s fidelity. I jumped at the chance to review it, figuring at last here would be a bracing change from my diet of darkness.And charming and diverting it was. But my relief from the onslaught of angst was short-lived. As I was being driven to the train station after catching a Saturday matinee, a deer suddenly leaped in front of the car. Sickening thump. Shuddering screech to a halt. The driver and I were fine, but the car was undrivable. And the deer? Not fine.As we waited for the police and the tow truck, I was sourly reflecting that the fates seemed determined to keep me from achieving anything close to a state of total serenity at the theater this season. But a glance up the road put things back in perspective. That unfortunate deer doubtless had happier summer plans too.'"

"'10-08-02,'1','Re “There’s Only One Way to Stop a Bully,” by Susan Engel and Marlene Sandstrom (Op-Ed, July 23):The importance of creating educational programs that help children feel empathy for others and relate with kindness — life’s most important value — cannot be overstated. The absence of that ethic can be seen everywhere. Children who bully others whom they perceive as less powerful often transfer those needs for power to other areas, like dogfighting and pigeon shoots, where dominance and cruelty toward others bring varied rewards.A child who bullies with impunity experiences a rush of power and control and learns to incorporate that style into all relationships and perceptions as he or she grows up — at home, work, sports, the political arena and choices about what to eat, wear and view for entertainment.Teachers and others who model empathy and kindness and help children internalize those values will affect society at all levels. Every area of life offers an opportunity for choosing kindness and compassion.Susan Engel and Marlene Sandstrom are correct but incomplete in their analysis of how to stop bullying in our schools. The solution ultimately resides in a deep, continuous commitment to safe and civil schools from preschool through high school. A schoolhouse is like a family, and violence and intimidation in any form — by students or by adults — should not be permissible at any grade level.But more than that, students need to stand for positive values and have the skills to enact those values. “Not bullying” is necessary but not sufficient. Schools must be respectful and supportive places where students’ creativity and intellectual curiosity can flourish, and learning can reach its true potential in all areas, not just those for which testing takes place.The writer is director of clinical training in the psychology department at Rutgers University.'"
"'10-08-02,'1','Iraq now has elections, a functioning, if imperfect, army and an industry on the cusp of a potential boom. Yet Baghdad, the capital, had five hours of electricity a day in July.The chronic power shortages are the result of myriad factors, including war, drought and corruption, but ultimately they reflect a dysfunctional government that remains deadlocked and unresponsive to popular will. That has generated disillusionment and dissent, including protests this summer that, while violent in two cases, were a different measure of Iraq’s new freedoms.“Democracy didn’t bring us anything,” Mr. Farhan said in his newly darkened shop. Then he corrected himself. “Democracy brought us a can of Coke and a beer.”The overall legacy of the American invasion today, like that of the war itself, remains a matter of dispute, colored by ideology, politics and faith in democracy’s ultimate ability to take root in the heart of the Arab world.Even Iraqis suspicious of American motives hoped that the overthrow of would bring modern, competent governance. Still, the streets are littered with trash, drinking water is polluted, are bleak and often unsafe, and buildings bombed by the Americans in 2003 or by insurgents since remain ruined shells.What is clear is that Iraqis’ expectations of a reliable supply of electricity and other services, like their expectations of democracy itself, have exceeded what either Americans or the country’s quarrelling politicians have so far been able to meet.“Iraqi politicians are killing our optimism,” Hassan Shihab said, complaining about blackouts after Friday Prayer at a mosque in Baquba, northwest of Baghdad. Dictatorship, he added, “was more merciful.”Iraq’s electricity problem is, of course, older than its still-uncertain embrace of a new form of government. Before Mr. Hussein’s invasion of 20 years ago this month, Iraq had the capacity to produce 9,295 megawatts of power. By 2003, after American bombings and years of international sanctions, it was half that.The shortages since have hobbled economic development and disrupted almost every aspect of daily life. They have transformed cities. Rumbling generators outside homes and other buildings — previously nonexistent — and thickets of wires as dense as a jungle canopy have become as much a part of Iraq’s cityscapes as blast walls and checkpoints.Most of the generators are privately operated, and the cost — roughly $7 per ampere — has for ordinary Iraqis become too exorbitant to power anything more than a light and a television.“I’ve never seen good electricity from the day I was born,” said Abbas Riyadh, 22, a barber in , the impoverished Shiite neighborhood in Baghdad. As he spoke, as if on cue, the lights went out.The United States has spent $5 billion on electrical projects alone, nearly 10 percent of the $53 billion it has devoted to rebuilding Iraq, second only to what it has spent on rebuilding Iraq’s security forces. It has had some effect, but there have also been inefficiency and corruption, as there have been in projects to rebuild schools, water and sewerage systems, roads and ports.The special inspector general for Iraqi reconstruction, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., said that one quarter of 54 projects his office had investigated — including those providing electricity and other basic services — had not been completed or carried on by the Iraqis they were built for.The United States is now winding such projects down, leaving some unfinished and others, already in disrepair, in the hands of national and provincial governments that so far seem unwilling or unable to maintain and operate them adequately.“We brought the framework of electoral democracy,” Mr. Bowen said, “but its future efficacy is very much in doubt.”Iraq does generate more electricity than it did in 2003, but nowhere near enough to match rising demand, driven higher by the proliferation of consumer goods, especially air-conditioners. Democracy, the easing of the country’s isolation and improving security have, paradoxically, created new conditions and demands that the government of Prime Minister has been unable to address.Iraq’s electrical grid remains a patchwork of old power plants and new, supplemented with makeshift and inadequate solutions. Iraq now imports 700 megawatts from . When temperatures soared this summer, it paid for two electricity-generating ships from to dock near Basra, one of the most badly affected cities, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars.The country’s transmission and distribution networks are aging and mismanaged by a bureaucracy as sclerotic as it was in Mr. Hussein’s era.The entire system is hampered by poor planning and by interagency rivalries that, for example, delay fuel to power plants; by a lack of conservation; by continuing terrorist attacks on electrical towers, including four in the last half of July in Baghdad, Anbar and Diyala Provinces.Corruption — which the special inspector general’s office called “Iraq’s ‘second insurgency’ ” in a report released on Friday — is pervasive. Mr. Farhan, the shop owner, said his landlord had bribed Ministry of Electricity workers to install the pirated cables three years ago. “He couldn’t just connect the cables himself,” he noted.The government campaign against pilfering — which officials said resulted in hundreds of miles of cables removed, with barely discernible effect — followed the public protests, including one in Basra in June that ended with the police opening fire, killing two.At first Mr. Maliki denounced the protests as the work of foreign agents, an ominous echo of the conspiracy-minded remarks of Saddam Hussein, while the Interior Ministry announced strict limits on public protests.Then Mr. Maliki, fighting for a second term as prime minister, moved to quell the populist outrage. He fired his electricity minister and ordered cuts in power to the privileged enclaves of ministers and politicians, a practice that began under Mr. Hussein and continues. Few Iraqis believe those cuts have been meaningful or will be lasting.In Mosul, the troubled northern city, the consequence of the campaign against piracy turned violent in June. When government workers cut an illegal connection from the Nineveh Textile Factory to a restive neighborhood called Mahmoun, insurgents retaliated by shelling the plant.“I knew it was not safe for me, but I did it anyway,” said a ministry engineer, referring to ordering the cutting of the cables.“After that, the electricity went back to normal, as it was before, but the reply came quickly when the factory was targeted with mortars. There were many victims of the success,” said the engineer, who would give his name only as Abdullah, Father of Mohammed. Twelve people at the factory were wounded.Mr. Maliki and his ministers have pleaded for patience, which is clearly running out, especially as the newly elected Parliament remains deadlocked over choosing a new prime minister and government nearly five months after the election.The new acting electricity minister, Hussain al-Shahristani, said at an conference in July that Iraq would add 5,000 megawatts by 2012 but acknowledged that that would not keep up with demand.“The problem will persist because there is no magic wand or miracle that can solve it,” he said.He then urged Iraqis to turn off all but one air-conditioner in their homes — and presumably to huddle with their families in that room.The government’s inaction compounds the problem. In 2008, Mr. Maliki announced a deal to buy 56 gas turbine generators from and 16 from for a total cost of $5 billion. More than two years later the purchase remains stalled because of political quarrels over financing and delays in negotiating contracts to install them.These types of generators have their own problems. At Baghdad South, a complex of three power plants, two General Electric generators installed in 2005 by the operate at about half their 125-megawatt capacity.The plant director, Abdul Karim Mohammed, said the generators were designed to operate at an optimal efficiency using natural gas, not the that the Iraqis use, and when the temperature is 60 degrees. It was 120 the day he spoke.Already he has been ordered to defer recommended maintenance to keep the machines running at full tilt, with the consequence of wearing them out faster. Needed parts are prohibited by Iraq’s customs rules. Mr. Mohammed has spent a year trying to break through the bureaucracy. “It’s not a technical issue,” he said. “It’s a political issue.”American diplomats and military commanders respond defensively when pressed on why, after all the American investments and expertise, Iraq still struggles to provide electricity.They cite challenges that would overwhelm any government trying to fix a country emerging from dictatorship and war: violence, climate, aging infrastructure and soaring demand, which they call a sign of a burgeoning consumer society.“Are people frustrated by this?” the American ambassador, , asked. “Yes, I think they are.”He added: “I think that the frustrations were evident on the street, but the solutions are ones that involve timely decision-making. I’m not going to criticize the government on whether it moved fast enough to build more power stations, but I think Iraqi voters are going to look at that.”The question today is whether voters can force their leaders to act — and whether only moderately functional services will get worse as America continues to disengage. Not all Iraqis are persuaded. Even some senior officials express doubts about the country’s governance, about Iraq’s readiness to function: either on practical matters like electricity or more abstract ones like democracy.“This is the fault of the Americans,” the deputy minister of electricity, Ra’ad al-Haras, said. “They put in place a big, wide-open democracy after the regime. They went from zero democracy to 100 percent. Democracy has to be step by step. You see the result.”'"
"'10-08-02,'1','Appleby’s round, which included nine birdies and an eagle, came less than a month after Paul Goydos shot a 59 at the John Deere Classic. The others to shoot 59 were Al Geiberger at the 1977 Memphis Classic, Chip Beck at the 1991 Las Vegas Invitational and David Duval at the 1999 Bob Hope Classic.Appleby’s achievement was the first 59 on a par-70 course. Goydos’s came on a par 71 and the others on par 72s. Appleby understands there might be some debate as to whether his achievement is right up there with the others.“I agree,” he said. “I can see both sides of the fence. It is a number. I shot that number. But who says par is supposed to be 72? There’s a lot of great courses that aren’t 72.”Appleby trailed Overton by seven strokes to start his round, shot six-under 28 on the front nine and eagled the par-5 12th before settling for three straight pars. He got his momentum going again just in time with birdies of 15, 10 and 11 feet on the final three holes.Overton had 34 putts in the final round, three-putting three times.“I got beat by a 59,” said Overton, who had his third runner-up finish of the year and remains winless in five years on the tour. “What can you say? I played great, hit a lot of great shots. You can’t win golf tournaments when you putt it that bad.”Brendon de Jonge (65) finished third at 17 under.TSENG TAKES L.P.G.A. MAJOR Yani Tseng of Taiwan made a 6-foot putt on the 18th hole to win the Women’s British Open by one stroke over Katherine Hull of Australia. It was the 21-year-old Tseng’s third major title and second of the year to go along with the Kraft Nabisco. She has four L.P.G.A. victories over all, having won the 2008 L.P.G.A. Championship and 2009 Corning Classic.Hull came into the round trailing by four strokes but trailed by just one heading to the 18th. But she missed a 20-foot birdie attempt and had to settle for a 70. Tseng made her par putt to shoot 73 and finish at 11-under 277 at Royal Birkdale.“I was nervous and tired with all the pressure and attention out there today,” Tseng said. “Katherine played really well and put me under a lot of pressure. It was the toughest win I’ve had to date. I usually come from behind to win. I’ve never won from the front before.”LANGER TRIUMPHS AGAIN Bernhard Langer shot a final-round three-under 67 and took advantage of Fred Couples’s critical mistake to complete a daunting trans-Atlantic double and win the United States Senior Open championship.Coming off a victory at the Senior British Open last week at Carnoustie, Langer finished at eight under for the tournament in Sammamish, Wash., fighting off jet lag and a partisan hometown crowd hoping Couples could pull out victory just 20 miles east of where he grew up.Tied with Langer starting the day, Couples birdied the opening hole before his undoing on No. 2, a par 5 and the easiest hole on the course. Couples plopped his third shot into the greenside pond, and by the time he walked off with a triple bogey, he was in chase mode.Couples, who was runner-up at the Senior P.G.A. Championship earlier this year, finished three shots back with an even-par 70.ENGLISHMAN WINS IRISH OPEN Ross Fisher of England won the Irish Open by two strokes over Padraig Harrington after shooting a six-under 65 in the final round.Fisher led by one shot going into the round but stretched that advantage to three after sinking a 15-foot eagle putt at the par-5 seventh hole. He totaled an 18-under 266 at Killarney Golf and Fishing Club after he had been briefly joined at the top of the leader board by Harrington (64) on three occasions.'"
"'10-08-02,'1','Goldman intends to substitute the new vessels for the NY Waterway boats that have been plying the short route between its office towers on opposite sides of the river.Mr. Cavanaugh said he hoped that the matter could be resolved without legal action, but he did not rule out the possibility of litigation. The draft letter he sent to the Port Authority said the “Goldman service” had “unreasonably inconvenienced and annoyed” some residents of Battery Park City. It alluded to noise readings taken by the city’s Department of Environmental Protection in April and May that exceeded the city’s legal limit of 10 decibels above the ambient noise level.Mr. Cavanaugh blamed the problem on the use of older, noisier boats since Goldman increased the frequency of ferry runs — to every seven or eight minutes — when its employees began moving into the new tower late last year. The ferries run from 6 a.m. to almost 10 p.m.The terminal is operated for the Port Authority by a ferry company known as BillyBey, which is named after its owner, William Wachtel, a politically active Manhattan lawyer. Goldman Sachs, in turn, pays BillyBey to run boats between the terminal and the Jersey City dock, known as Paulus Hook. The boats, which fly the NY Waterway commuter-service flag, are open to the public for a fare of $5.50 each way. But community leaders in Battery Park City say that, outside of the morning and evening rush hours, the ferries serve primarily as shuttles for Goldman employees.Indeed, they run far more frequently than other commuter ferries do: NY Waterway boats run as infrequently as twice an hour in the middle of the day between the train terminal in Hoboken, N.J., and Battery Park City.Privately, some Goldman officials bridle at the complaints, suggesting that the neighbors were piling criticism on a firm that has already been faulted in the public eye. They declined to discuss the firm’s plan to obtain its own boats.But, in a statement, the firm said it had contracted with BillyBey “to provide the most efficient form of transportation for our employees to shuttle between our two buildings, while also providing a public service.” It added that the firm was “aware there have been some issues raised” and was working with the ferry operator to explore all options to address them.A spokesman for BillyBey said the company had switched to newer, quieter boats after the complaints first arose late last year and had not received any complaints since then. But Mr. Cavanaugh said he had seen the older boats — nicknamed the Italian class because they were named after famous Italian-Americans like Frank Sinatra and Yogi Berra — operating on the route recently and had heard about other sightings by residents of Battery Park City.“I saw those Italian-class boats well after Waterways promised not to use them,” Mr. Cavanaugh said. “That equipment continues to show up.”For his part, Mr. Wachtel, the ferry operator, said, “We’re confident in short order all concerns will, in fact, be allayed.”'"
"'10-08-02,'1','Sales of Corona Light fell 1.6 percent for the same period, according to SymphonyIRI. But Crown Imports says total sales so far this year, which include those at bars and restaurants, have risen nearly 1 percent. Last year, Corona Light weathered the recession well with a 4.8 percent increase in sales to retailers, after a 3.6 percent increase in 2008. Those followed double-digit sales increases in the previous eight years. It is the eighth-largest-selling light-beer brand, according to SymphonyIRI.The only other brands that seem to be hardy are less expensive ones, like Keystone Light from Coors, whose sales rose 16.7 percent in the 12 months through mid-June, according to SymphonyIRI figures. Also, craft brews have attracted some market share, growing by more than 7 percent last year among people who say they want different tastes and flavors, according to the Beer Institute.“Unlike previous recessions when beer was recession-proof, the higher unemployment rate hit blue-collar workers hard this time,” said Benjamin Steinman, editor of Beer Marketer’s Insights, which tracks industry trends. That contributed to the soft overall beer sales and the relative popularity of some less expensive brews, he said.Corona Light is focusing on increasing its brand awareness among active young people, said José Mollá, co-founder and executive creative officer of La Comunidad, the Miami agency that created the brand’s 30-second commercial.“Corona Light is the social brother to Corona Extra,” Mr. Mollá said. “Its image is more active; it’s escaping with your world, not from your world.”Corona Light’s target group would be those who “if they returned from a vacation would say, ‘You can’t believe what we did,’ not where they have gone,” Mr. Mollá said.The digital agency Pereira O’Dell also is developing a campaign that will begin this month with a revamp of Corona Light’s Facebook page to better connect it to fans, Mr. Sabia of Crown Imports said. The digital effort will also include media banners on other Web sites to drive traffic to the Facebook page.Next year, Corona Light plans to add a print component and more kiosk, bus and similar advertising outside the home to raise brand awareness, Mr. Sabia said.The television spot, which will appear on ESPN, NBC, Comedy Central, the sports channel Versus and on Fox Sports during some Major League Baseball games, was filmed in Tayrona Nature Park in Colombia.Corona beer has usually been associated with beaches, which Mr. Mollá described as the brand’s “biggest asset.”The white beaches at Tayrona are next to a tropical forest, both of which are shown in the commercial. After watching the sunset, the partygoers in the commercial unplug the sound system and pack up as if going home. But then they walk through a jungle and come out on another beach where they resume partying in the moonlight.The agency auditioned a group of 40 men and women, then flew them to film the commercial at Tayrona. Mr. Mollá said the agency deliberately included women because “we wanted to be inclusive. Women are a big part of having a great party.”At the site, “we let the group get to know each other over a few days then we filmed them actually partying,” he said.If being flown to a tropical paradise to party sounds too fantastic, Mr. Mollá said that filming conditions were actually less than ideal.“We had some crazy weather, and then we had two alligators and it took hours for the crew to get rid of them.”'"

"'10-08-02,'1','The monitoring of information is a particularly thorny issue for autocratic regimes in the Persian Gulf worried that the Internet might be used for antigovernment purposes — a concern heightened by the passionate online response in to the 2009 presidential election that helped energize the opposition and led to weeks of unrest.The United Arab Emirates, in particular, were alarmed by the killing in January of a operative in a hotel, possibly by a hit team from the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. The episode infuriated the government, which wants to encourage tourism and business, and heightened its desire for increased electronic surveillance and security.“The U.A.E. has never been a place that offered much in the way of electronic privacy,” said Jim Krane, author of a history of Dubai. “The government makes no secret that it monitors electronic communication, including text messages, phone calls and e-mail. The revelation that secure BlackBerry data is frustratingly out of the government’s reach only confirms this.”Other smartphones, like the , are not tied to one e-mail service. In general, that means e-mail to and from the devices mostly travels over the open Internet and can be relatively easily monitored.But the BlackBerry uses highly encrypted data that is received by wireless carriers’ towers and is immediately routed through a closed, global network operated by the company. To enforce the ban, the carriers will stop forwarding that data.Because of this level of security, the government allows many military and law enforcement employees to send confidential messages by BlackBerry, but it also makes surveillance correspondingly difficult.As a result, R.I.M. officials have clashed with officials elsewhere in recent years.In 2008, security agencies in suggested that BlackBerry service might be shut down there unless R.I.M. installed servers in that country to allow them to intercept messages. The company refused, but sent representatives to meet with the Indian government. Indian regulators, while expressing reservations, have said they have no plans to restrict the service.Analysts and telecommunications experts also believe that security concerns delayed the arrival of BlackBerry service in China. It is unclear what actions the company took, if any, to alleviate those worries.There were conflicting reports Sunday about whether Saudi Arabia had also decided to ban the BlackBerry services. Some news agencies cited an interview with a Saudi Telecom official on the television network that confirmed the decision, but in other Al Arabiya news reports company officials denied the service would be blockedThe Saudi authorities released no official statement, and an adviser to the Saudi government, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said no decision had been made as far as he knew. But one prominent Saudi economist, Ihsan Ali Bu-Hulaiga, said “it seems to me a number of other countries in the region will follow the lead of the U.A.E.” for the same security-related reasons.In the emirates, concerns are also fueled by the fact that native Emiratis are a minority there, and the government regards electronic surveillance as an important tool against would-be terrorists, swindlers and other potential troublemakers drawn to the country’s relatively unfettered environment.The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven emirates in the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula bordering Saudi Arabia. Among the seven states are and Dubai, both economic centers that encourage international trade and discourage financing of radical Islamic movements. Because of this, Mr. Krane suggested, the security concerns are not unfounded.“The U.A.E. is an open country, a key travel and business hub, with one of the world’s largest airports and airlines,” he said. “It welcomes just about anyone to visit, and even to settle and work. Nationals of many countries don’t even need entry visas. In this environment, the government probably feels that electronic eavesdropping and surveillance are key to maintaining internal security.”In a statement Sunday, a government body in the Emirates, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, said officials were prepared to block BlackBerry data service beginning Oct. 11 because it was the only service in the Emirates that exported mobile data to servers outside its borders. It will not affect phone service.The agency also said that it had been trying since 2007 to strike a deal under which it would assume authority over BlackBerry services within that country.“In their current form, certain BlackBerry services allow users to act without any legal accountability, causing judicial, social and national security concerns for the U.A.E.,” the agency said.While the company has disclosed little information about the centers that manage BlackBerry services, it is widely believed that data from the is handled by a company operations center in Slough, .There are about 500,000 BlackBerry users in the United Arab Emirates, a large number of them in the business hub of Dubai.“R.I.M. has had three years to address these security concerns,” said a U.A.E. government official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The dispute between the United Arab Emirates and R.I.M. took an unusual turn about a year ago when the company warned users that software described as a BlackBerry upgrade by an Emirates carrier, Etisalat, was actually spyware.“Independent sources have concluded that Etisalat’s ‘Registration’ software application is not actually designed to improve performance of a BlackBerry Handheld, but rather to send received messages back to a central server,” R.I.M. warned customers in an online posting that included directions on removing the software.'"

"'10-08-03,'0','“I think the pieces are a little different,” Manuel said when asked to define the change. “I’d have to say that, and maybe not quite as right as they should be at this point. I think, obviously, they are very, very good players, but right now it’s just not working.”That was perhaps the most frank assessment yet regarding the transformation of the Mets from a compelling, energetic team into what at times looks like a plodding, spiritless bunch.Not all the blame can be focused on Beltran, who drove in the Mets’ only run Monday, and Castillo. But when the Braves scored their first-inning runs, a Castillo miscue at second base proved helpful.With runners at first and second and no outs, Chipper Jones hit a ground ball to third baseman David Wright that should have been a double play.But Castillo bobbled the throw from Wright and dropped the ball. Though he got the forceout, he was unable to convert a double play that might have prevented more damage. Rick Ankiel, making his Turner Field debut for the Braves, later slapped a two-run single up the middle.“That was a key to the game,” Manuel said. “When you’ve got two pitchers like those two guys out there, you’ve got to make sure you execute defensively, first of all. We didn’t execute that play, and they took advantage of it and put a three-spot on us right away.”Castillo, who went 1 for 3 and is hitting .235, agreed, saying he felt bad and needed to perform better. Beltran, despite hitting .316 during the recent homestand, is batting only .228 since returning July 15 after he missed the first half of the season with surgery on his right knee.Manuel was asked about the durability of the Mets’ current swoon, and again attributed it to the return of players struggling to regain their form.“That’s the biggest factor,” Manuel said. “We have some guys coming back, and then we’re not actually swinging the bat that well at some positions we kind of anticipated or expected to get some stuff late. But we’re getting that right now.”After the humiliating 14-1 loss to the Diamondbacks on Sunday, the one thing the Mets felt they could rely on was their ace, Santana, to stop the carnage. Indeed, during their recent 11-game West Coast tour, the only games the Mets won were the two that Santana pitched.Santana, who allowed seven earned runs in his previous outing against St. Louis, pitched well enough to win Monday. He allowed the three runs in the first inning, then a solo home run to Jones in the seventh.“I’m just trying to do my job,” Santana said. “Win or lose, it depends on what the whole team does.”Perhaps it was fitting that Jones, noted throughout his career for success against the Mets, added to the misery. The home run was his 43rd against the Mets, and the 434th of his career, tying for 37th on the career list with Juan Gonzalez.Further, it was the former Mets closer Billy Wagner who finished off the Mets with a perfect ninth inning for his 25th save.The Mets fell seven and a half games behind the Braves in the East, and eight games behind San Francisco in the wild-card standings, making their two possible routes to a playoff berth seem more remote every day.“Where we are now,” Manuel said before the game, “and the way that we’re playing, if we continue to play that way, the standings don’t matter.”Jerry Manuel said Jon Niese would make his next scheduled start, Friday in Philadelphia, while Hisanori Takahashi pitched out of the bullpen. He said that Niese, and perhaps Mike Pelfrey, too, could be skipped the next time there is a day off if they do not show better results.'"

"'10-08-03,'0','BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq’s prime minister said Monday that his critics wanted to install a weak leader who would leave the nation split by sectarian divisions and prey to local warlords.The remarks by the prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, were broadcast late Monday on state television and came on a day when a dozen Iraqis were killed in bombings and drive-by shootings around the country.The violence underscored widespread fears that insurgents were taking advantage of the political impasse caused by Iraq’s inconclusive parliamentary elections in March, which failed to produce a clear winner.Appearing angry at times when lashing out at his critics, Mr. Maliki said he had become a political target for naysayers because he refuses to sugarcoat Iraq’s problems.“I do not sweet-talk,” he said during an hourlong interview, which had been taped. “They say they want a weak prime minister. The country is facing a lot of problems and if the prime minister is not strong, then the country will crumble, and sectarianism and warlords will return.”“I do not understand the theory of a weak prime minister who will be a prisoner in the hands of one group or another,” he said.Mr. Maliki has been struggling to hold on to his job after his political coalition fell short of winning the March 7 election. Attempts to form a governing coalition that would include a conservative Shiite alliance, among other groups, fell apart when some factions made their support conditional on Mr. Maliki not serving a second term.'"

"'10-08-03,'0','The financial review, released last week, was commissioned by a separate industry group, the Cattlemen’s Beef Board, which is appointed by the secretary of agriculture and oversees the federal marketing effort, known as the beef check-off program.The board concluded in an executive summary accompanying the review that the cattlemen’s association had “breached the financial firewall” between marketing and lobbying.In a statement, the board called the audit results “extremely troubling” and said it would proceed with the more comprehensive review.“I’m disappointed that there’s been a difference of perception about the appropriateness of some of the expenditures,” said Dan Dierschke, the chairman of the beef board. He said that for the first time in recent years, the review was done by an outside accounting firm, Clifton Gunderson, rather than the board’s staff.Officials of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association acknowledged that some mistakes had been made, but they also disputed several of the findings. They said guidelines on how the marketing money should be spent were often unclear.In a written response that challenged some of the report’s conclusions, the association said it expected the review would result in less than $20,000 in reimbursements. The report did not give a total dollar amount for its findings, but it listed at least $90,000 in questionable or poorly documented transactions.“We spend an awful lot of time trying to make sure that firewall is maintained,” said Steve Foglesong, an Illinois rancher and feedlot operator who is president of the cattlemen’s association. “As a producer I want my dollars to be spent exactly as they’re supposed to be spent.”The review looked at a sampling of financial records, including expense reports and time sheets, from October 2007 through February 2010. It listed dozens of cases in which auditors determined that expenditures or worker hours were either charged inappropriately to the marketing fund or lacked adequate documentation.The money did not go directly to lobby lawmakers, but in many cases, covered administrative costs of the association’s lobbying division, according to the report.The beef check-off was created by the 1985 Farm Bill. It assesses a mandatory $1-a-head fee on the sale of cattle. The beef board gets about half the money, which it uses to promote beef sales and conduct research into areas like product development and food safety. The board hires groups like the cattlemen’s association to carry out these activities. By law, however, the money cannot be used to influence government policy through lobbying.The most recognizable use of the money is probably the advertising campaign that uses the slogan “Beef. It’s what’s for dinner.” The association manages the campaign.Because the money comes from farmers and ranchers, beef industry leaders are sensitive to charges of abuse.Mr. Roberts and his wife, Janet, were not named in the audit but the association identified him as the senior staff member mentioned in the report as having $3,592 of his family’s travel expenses paid with the ranchers’ money.The association said that it had been using the money to pay the travel expenses of its chief executives’ wives for years.“We always felt it was important for them to bring their wives along,” Mr. Foglesong said.“It’s always good to have your wife along to help you get centered. That’s not anything different than what’s been going on for a long, long time.”The audit report said, however, that federal guidelines bar check-off money from being spent on a spouse’s travel. Mr. Foglesong said that the association would reimburse the money and pay for spouses’ travel using other financing in the future.Mr. Roberts said that ranchers’ money had been used by mistake to pay for his child’s travel expenses and that he had personally paid that back.“I take responsibility and accountability very seriously,” Mr. Roberts said.Mr. Foglesong said it was highly unusual for the audit to be released to the public. In past years, he said, when reviews found discrepancies, the beef board and the association worked out their differences in private.The financial review was released last week just before the beef industry’s annual summer conference in Denver, and it highlighted divisions within the industry.The association’s membership includes many beef industry interests like multinational packers such as Cargill, and small ranchers with a few dozen cattle. But some cattle producers think its views are skewed in favor of the packers and other economically powerful parts of the industry.For instance, the association has raised objections to an agriculture department proposal to strengthen antitrust rules within the livestock industry. The federal proposal is supported by some groups representing small-scale ranchers.Ted Greidanus, a beef board member, said that unease over abuse of check-off money was keenest among such groups.“There is distrust and that distrust has grown greater,” Mr. Greidanus said.The Agriculture Department oversees the beef check-off program. The department said in a written statement that it was reviewing the audit and would determine if additional steps were necessary.'"
"'10-08-03,'0','During the overture, the newlyweds are seen in a loving embrace: the Austrian mezzo-soprano Elisabeth Kulman as Orfeo, with a long ponytail and a handsome dress suit, and the soprano Genia Kühmeier, a Salzburg native, as the smitten Euridice, in a simple red dress. As they embrace, doors open in the back wall, and wedding guests, dressed in stylishly colorful modern outfits (looking rather like a crowd of festivalgoers in Salzburg) gather around the happy couple.But as the overture ends and the first scene begins, Euridice mysteriously dies in Orfeo’s arms and sinks slowly into an opening in the stage floor. Orfeo grabs Euridice’s dress but succeeds only in pulling the dress clear over her head as she continues her descent into the underworld. This stroke of staging poignantly sets up Orfeo’s first aria of despair.The entire production is filled with similarly affecting touches. After Euridice’s demise, the wedding guests don gray mourning frocks and build a makeshift memorial of candles, flowers and photographs on top of Euridice’s clumped red dress, which represents her grave. The gods who hear the grieving Orfeo’s vow to go to the underworld and retrieve his wife are a silent council of wise old men in satin and gold robes. They send the god of love, Amor (the bright-voiced soprano Christiane Karg in a gleaming silver suit), to tell Orfeo that his wish has been granted, on condition that he not look back at his beloved during the return to earth.In the underworld Orfeo’s way is initially blocked by a chorus of furies and shades, depicted as a tangle of writhing bodies dressed in sulfuric yellows and grays. With a wall of jagged mirrors in the background reflecting the scene, there seem to be hundreds of desolate souls in the underworld.In the final scene Mr. Dorn makes mischief, but it works. Pleased to have brought Orfeo and Euridice together again, Amor admits that for every joy he fosters, there are a thousand sufferings. Then, during the scene in which dancers typically spin around in joyful celebration of love, Mr. Dorn illustrates the dismaying odds for romantic contentment. He fills the stage with couples in the midst of romantic spats and all-out fights, including a gay couple. This certainly provides a sadly contrary subtext for Gluck’s charming dance music.Orfeo and Euridice look worried. “Is this what awaits us?” they seem to be asking. Still, for the time being, they are in bliss, though a bit confused.Ms. Kulman is a sensitive and intelligent singer. Her voice has dusky richness and presence, and she made a dashing Orfeo. Yet she seemed self-contained and cautious. Ms. Kühmeier has a rosy, agile voice, and she sang Euridice’s music with sweet lyricism. But she, too, might have been encouraged to take more chances and be more overtly emotional. Was the reticence of these appealing singers the result of Mr. Muti’s magisterial conception of the work?'"

In the worst years, meningitis has killed more than 25,000 people and left thousands more deaf or retarded.The World Health Organization recently gave approval to a new meningitis vaccine that is expected to cost only 50 cents a dose, a price many African governments and donors can afford. It is made by the Serum Institute of India, a major producer of vaccines and antisera, which exports vaccines to 140 countries and claims that half the world’s children have received at least one of its vaccines.The new vaccine works against group A Neisseria meningitidis, the most common epidemic strain. (Every year, a few American college freshmen and military recruits are killed by groups B or C, which often spread among young people living closely together. A new lethal strain, W-135, emerged in Africa 10 years ago, but experts decided that it would take too long and cost too much to add it to the group A vaccine now.)In October, the vaccine will be used in a mass campaign for the first time. The rollout will be in Burkina Faso; how many countries get it will depend on how much money donors raise. The vaccine was developed by the W.H.O. and PATH, a nonprofit medical research group in Seattle.

"'10-08-03,'0','Perhaps you had been lulled into sports coma waiting for Alex Rodriguez to hit his 600th career home run, or by contemplating why baseball’s trading deadline isn’t actually a deadline but more of a suggestion, or maybe your brain just clicks to the “off” position during any sentence that begins with Stuart Appleby. If so, you may have missed the official sign that the PGA Tour has become the modern-day equivalent of putt-putt, minus the windmills and clowns. Unless you count John Daly.Appleby started a lot of sentences on Sunday (“click...”) by shooting a 59 to win something called the Greenbriar Classic. A 59 was once golf’s Holy Grail, a magical unachievable number met with starry-eyed wonder. Now, it’s something pros do on their way to get a manicure. People named J.B. Holmes and D.A. Points just missed matching Appleby’s score at the same tournament. Some kid in Alabama actually shot a 57 at a junior tournament last week. For what seemed like forever, Al Geiberger was the only pro with that score. Now the number’s up to five, with two doing in a span of 24 days. And that’s not counting Ryo Ishikawa’s 58 at a Japanese Tour event this year. Brian Murphy of Yahoo.com tries to unravel the mystery, but clearly club and ball technology have turned the game a bit silly. There has been no confirmation of the rumor that the PGA Tour will now require all golfers play with wooden tennis rackets.If baseball equipment joined that technology race, everybody would be hitting 600 home runs too, and they might beat Rodriguez to the mark because A-Rod is apparently trying to take longer to go from 599 to 600 than Brett Favre takes between retirement decisions. The fact that the payroll-challenged Rays were the latest to frustrate Rodriguez was happy news for Fanhouse.com’s David Whitley, who bemoans baseball’s rich-get-richer system. But hey, he could be cheered by the fact that the Yankees did not swing every trade in the weekend’s flurry of activity. To see where all the pieces did land, and what that means for the rest of the season, you can check out USA Today’s roundup, or read CBSSports.com’s Scott Miller, who writes that the Rangers came out looking the best.Not surprisingly, White Sox Manager Ozzie Guillen opened his mouth and made news, saying he believes Latino players are treated poorly in baseball compared to Asian players. Ray Ratto of CBSSports.com wrote that Guillen’s message will get lost because Guillen pops off more often than golfers shoot 59s these days, but he does make a valid point.N.F.L. training camps opened recently with the express purpose of giving you something to think about other than baseball, but the first few days of preseasonhave been more about who isn’t there (yes, Favre included .... sigh) than who is. The Chargers lead the way with notable holdouts Shawne Merriman, Vincent Jackson and Marcus McNeill, writes Jim Trotter on SI.com, but Darrelle Revis’s absence from Jets camp is getting by far the most attention, thanks to all those HBO cameras. Steve Serby of The Post writes that both sides are being stupid to let this drag on, although Jay Mariotti writes on Fanhouse.com that he can’t decide which preseason saga is dumber, Revis’s or the one in Washington surrounding Albert Haynesworth. Gregg Doyel of CBSSports.com finds nothing funny in Haynesworth’s weight problems, the latest sad chapter in athletes lacking self discipline.Perhaps he’ll just take the weekend off from football altogether and go shoot a 59.'"

"'10-08-04,'1','Is there any outlet on television that comes close to A&E in showing us just what it takes to clean up the broad mess of American life? Whenever current events threaten to sever faith in our institutions, there is A&E reminding us that federal marshals are capturing killers on the lam (“Manhunters: Fugitive Task Force”); that mental-health professionals are rehabilitating drunks, germophobes and hoarders (“Intervention,” “Obsessed,” “Hoarders”); that transit officials are nailing parking rogues (“Parking Wars”); that annihilators are whacking household pests (“Billy the Exterminator”); that the patriarchy is being upheld however unconventionally (“Gene Simmons Family Jewels”).The network’s latest effort at trying to convince us that somewhere, somehow Forces are in Control arrives Thursday night in the form of “The Squad: Prison Police,” a series detailing a team that operates to combat crime within the Tennessee penal system. To call these men and women corrections officers undersells what they do as they are the extreme watchdogs who send ordinary guards to jail and the criminals at hand to solitary confinement and longer sentences. They are dispatched to handle gang warfare, drug dealing and the assaults and murders that often, in prison life, seem to result from schoolgirlish disputes.This is no better exemplified than in an episode in which an inmate close to his parole appears to have lost his life over a stolen pair of shoes. Drugs are the primary cause of all prison violence, according to the series, but it is amazing, as one officer informs us early on, how many stabbings turn out to be the consequence of cellphone robberies. Cellphones are illegal in prison as are, needless to say, the weapons involved in the related attacks, but inmates are skilled at turning any kind of object into something potentially deadly. A cut to a menacing looking toothbrush confirms this.The series is shot at various facilities throughout the Tennessee prison system, which has 20,000 inmates, half of whom are violent offenders. As a window into the factionalism of the locked-up life “The Squad” is not entirely without merit, though it functions more aggressively to upend preconceptions of in-house law enforcers as soulless enemies of all that is human and decent.To that end we see a lot of Special Agent Jason Woodall, in girth and coloring a dead ringer for Mario Batali and a specialist in the softer side of interrogation. Questioning a heavily tattooed inmate about a prison killing, he defuses tension and speaks calmly. “Mr. Shultz I need you to very clearly tell me what happened step by step,” he says. “Take your time.” Despite a low-volume approach that leaves him seeming like a candidate for an on-camera position at “60 Minutes,” Mr. Woodall is amazingly effective at eliciting useful responses.Like some of its sister programming on A&E, “The Squad” celebrates the efforts of people doing jobs — hard jobs requiring a certain muscularity that help to maintain our sense of civic well-being. “The Squad” is so worker friendly, so up with bureaucracy, that it makes A&E seem as though it could have been the preferred basic-cable outlet of the Bolsheviks.

"'10-08-04,'1','“I think we don’t know yet the full impact of this spill on the ecosystem or the people of the gulf,” Dr. Lubchenco said.Among the biggest unanswered questions, she said, is how much damage the oil has done to the eggs and larvae of organisms like fish, crabs and shrimp. That may not become clear for a year or longer, as new generations of those creatures come to maturity.Thousands of and other animals are known to have been damaged or killed by the spill, a relatively modest toll given the scale of some other oil disasters that killed millions of animals. Efforts are still under way in , , and to clean up more than 600 miles of oiled shoreline. The government and BP collected 35,818 tons of oily debris from shorelines through Sunday.It remains to be seen whether subtle, long-lasting environmental damage from the spill will be found, as has been the case after other large oil spills.The report, which is to be unveiled on Wednesday morning, is a result of an extensive effort by federal scientists, with outside help, to add up the total volume of oil released and to figure out where it went.The lead agency behind the report, the oceanic and atmospheric administration, played down the size of the spill in the early days, and the Obama administration was ultimately forced to appoint a scientific panel that came up with far higher estimates of the flow rate from the well. Whether the new report will withstand critical scrutiny is uncertain; advocacy groups and most outside scientists had not learned of it on Tuesday.The government announced early this week that the total oil release, from the time the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 until the well was effectively capped, was 4.9 million barrels, plus or minus 10 percent. That estimate makes the Deepwater Horizon disaster the largest marine spill in history. It is surpassed on land by a 1910 spill in the desert.As the scientists did their calculations, they were able to rely on direct measurements of the fate of some of the oil that spewed from the broken well. For example, BP and its contractors succeeded in capturing about percent of it with various containment mechanisms, the report says.The outcome for much of the oil could not be directly measured, but had to be estimated using protocols that were scrutinized by scientists inside and outside the government, Dr. Lubchenco said.The report calculates, for example, that about 25 percent of the chemicals in the oil evaporated at the surface or dissolved into seawater in the same way that sugar dissolves in tea. (The government appears to have settled on a conservative number for that estimate, with the scientific literature saying that as much as 40 percent of the oil from a spill can disappear in this way.)The aggressive response mounted by BP and the government — the largest in history, ultimately involving more than 5,000 vessels — also played a role in getting rid of the oil, the report says. Fully 5 percent of the oil was burned at the surface, it estimates, while 3 percent was skimmed and 8 percent was broken up into tiny droplets using chemical dispersants. Another 16 percent dispersed naturally as the oil shot out of the well at high speed.All told, the report calculates that about 74 percent of the oil has been effectively dealt with by capture, burning, skimming, evaporation, dissolution or dispersion. Much of the dissolved and dispersed oil can be expected to break down in the environment, though federal scientists are still working to establish the precise rate at which that is happening.“I think we are fortunate in this situation that the rates of degradation in the gulf ecosystem are quite high,” Dr. Lubchenco said.The remaining 26 percent of the oil “is on or just below the surface as light sheen or weathered tar balls, has washed ashore or been collected from the shore, or is buried in sand and sediments,” the report says.Some fishermen in Louisiana are worried about the buried oil, fearing that storms could stir it up and coat vital shrimp or grounds, a possibility the government has not ruled out.Testing of fish has shown little cause for worry so far, and grounds in the gulf are being reopened at a brisk clip. At one point the government had closed 36 percent of federal gulf waters to fishing, but that figure is now down to 24 percent and is expected to drop further in coming weeks.States are also reopening fishing grounds near their coasts. The big economic question now is whether the American public is ready to buy gulf seafood again.The new government report comes as BP engineers began pumping heavy drilling mud into the stricken well on Tuesday, with the hope of achieving a permanent seal or at least revealing critical clues about how to kill the well before the end of the month.Through the afternoon, in what is known as a static kill, engineers pumped mud weighing about 13.2 pounds per gallon at slow speeds from a surface vessel through a pipe into the blowout preventer on top of the well. If all goes well, cement may be applied over the next few days. But officials said they could be confident the well was plugged only when one of two relief wells now being drilled was completed, allowing the well to be completely sealed with cement.“The static kill will increase the probability that the relief well will work,” , the retired Coast Guard admiral who is leading the federal spill response effort, told reporters on Tuesday. “But the whole thing will not be done until the relief well is completed.”The static kill operation could last for close to three days. After it is completed, work can resume on the final 100 feet of the first relief well, which officials say should be completed by Aug. 15 unless bad weather intervenes.'"
"'10-08-04,'1','The Dow Chemical Company posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit Tuesday after idling several plants to retool for higher production rates, and its shares fell nearly 10 percent.The temporary closing of three plants overshadowed higher sales across all businesses and regions, cutting profit by 7 cents a share and revenue by $300 million, the company said.The plants, one in Argentina and two in Texas, had been operating at low levels during the recession and Dow needed extra time to ramp up production, it said.The Argentina factory, Dow’s largest polyethylene plant in Latin America, was closed for 30 days, roughly a third of the quarter. It also had a water supply problem, the chief executive, Andrew N. Liveris, said in a call with investors.Mr. Liveris told investors the plant shutdown did not extend into the third quarter and that there would be no major closings the rest of the year.'"
"'10-08-04,'1','Missouri voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a measure aimed at nullifying the new federal health care law, becoming the first state in the nation where ordinary people made known their dismay over the issue at the ballot box.The measure was intended to invalidate a crucial element of President Obama's health care law — namely, that most people be required to get health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Supporters of the measure said it would send a firm signal to Washington about how this state, often a bellwether in presidential elections, felt about such a law. The referendum drew support from 71 percent of nearly 939,000 voters. ""My constituents told me they felt like their voices had been ignored and they wanted Washington to hear them,"" Jane Cunningham, a state senator and Republican who had pressed for a vote, said Tuesday night. ""It looks to me like they just picked up a megaphone.""The referendum, known as Proposition C, was seen as a first look at efforts by conservatives to gather and rally their forces over the issue. Before the vote, the referendum had not appeared to to capture the general population's attention with any broad, statewide media campaign. Republican primary voters (who had the most competitive races on Tuesday) appeared to play a key role in the vote's fate; far more voters (577,612) cast ballots in the state's Republican primary for an open United States Senate seat as cast ballots for the Democratic candidates (315,787).Practically speaking, it remains entirely uncertain what effect the vote will have. The insurance requirement of the federal health care law does not come into effect until 2014. By then, experts say, the courts are likely to weigh in on the provision requiring people to buy insurance.""While we're disappointed that Missourians didn't vote against this, we think the courts will ultimately decide it,"" said David M. Dillon, a spokesman for the Missouri Hospital Association.For some, the outcome was not merely about health care, but about the role of states in setting policy.'"
"'10-08-04,'1','The Intel Corporation, the world’s largest maker of computer chips, has agreed to settle its antitrust case with the Federal Trade Commission, the agency said Tuesday.The F.T.C. said details of the settlement would be disclosed at a news conference on Wednesday.The commission sued Intel in December, accusing it of using its dominance for a decade to block customers from buying competitors’ products. The commission said Intel had forced computer makers into exclusive deals and blocked rivals from making their chips work with Intel’s.Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., accounts for more than 80 percent of global sales of computer chips, dwarfing Advanced Micro Devices, its closest competitor. Intel agreed to pay Advanced Micro Devices $1.25 billion in November to settle a lawsuit by the company, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif.In May 2009, the European Union fined Intel 1.06 billion euros, or $1.45 billion at the time. In addition to the penalty, Intel was ordered to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors.'"
"'10-08-04,'1','ATLANTA — The list of reasons that Jeff Francoeur felt Tuesday’s home run was the biggest hit in his brief career as a member of the Mets is not a short one.He was playing in his home state, with friends and family members watching from the stands.He was trying to beat his former team, the one he watched as a boy and then joined as a professional until it unceremoniously traded him to the Mets last year. He had not been playing well in recent weeks, and had been relegated to the bench with the return of Carlos Beltran, but he was given a second chance to play regularly when Jason Bay was placed on the disabled list with a concussion last week.For all those reasons, and one more significant one, Francoeur’s ninth-inning home run off Billy Wagner was a joyous moment for the popular right fielder. It gave the Mets an important 3-2 victory, and gave them a reason to pound on him in celebration in the dugout.“I was floating on air on that one,” he said. “Home runs, I’m not a guy that gets overly excited, but with all my friends and family that were here tonight, and to do it against your old team, and part of that too is because of how bad I’ve been struggling, been working to try and get out of it. To have a night like that where at least for one night you feel excited and feel like you contributed was nice.”Francoeur is one of the players who had been pushed aside with the return of more established veterans from injury. He was forced to the bench when Beltran came back from knee surgery and Angel Pagan was shifted to right field.After the Mets dropped the opener of the series on Monday, Manager Jerry Manuel said the reintroduction of Beltran and Luis Castillo to the lineup following their injuries had changed the dynamic of the team, at least temporarily. But given another opportunity in right field, a position he patrolled for the Braves from 2005 to 2009, Francoeur delivered.'"
"'10-08-04,'1','The Favre Follies are starting to sound familiar.On Tuesday, almost exactly a year after he told the Minnesota Vikings he would not play in 2009, multiple news media outlets reported that Favre had told some Vikings personnel that he would not play in 2010.There was no confirmation from Favre. Vikings Coach Brad Childress offered a vague version of events: he had spoken to Favre in the last 24 hours, but Favre had not told him of a decision. Childress called it “a fluid situation.”That seems an understatement for Favre, the N.F.L.’s Hamlet, who has publicly pondered retirement since at least 2002 and has changed his mind about playing each of the past two seasons — first when the Jets acquired him in 2008 after he tearfully retired from the Green Bay Packers and then changed his mind, and then last year when the Vikings signed him as a free agent right after training camp ended.The 2009 season proved to be one of Favre’s finest. He had career bests in completion percentage, quarterback rating and interceptions, throwing for 4,202 yards, 33 touchdowns and only 7 interceptions. He led the Vikings to the N.F.C. championship game, but that came at the cost of the injury that could now be influencing his thinking. He hurt his left ankle in the loss to the New Orleans Saints and had arthroscopic surgery in May.That fueled speculation that Favre, 40, was all but certain to return — why go through an operation if not to continue playing? — but The Star-Tribune of Minneapolis reported that contributing to Favre’s decision was his unhappiness with how the ankle has responded to the surgery.'"
"'10-08-04,'1','Stoudemire, 27, traveled to Israel with Idan Ravin, an American basketball trainer whose parents grew up in Israel. He said he had wanted to visit the country for five years and hastily arranged this trip after he withdrew from the team of N.B.A. players who will represent the United States at the FIBA World Championships later this month in Turkey.The Knicks requested that Stoudemire not play in the World Championships after failing to insure his new contract, worth almost $100 million, to because of past injuries to his knee and eye.The Knicks’ organization appeared to be taken aback by the trip and uneasy with the publicity it was generating. Nine years ago, the team waded into turbulent social waters when two of its players, Allan Houston and Charlie Ward, made remarks that were deemed anti-Semitic in a New York Times Magazine story that focused on their Christianity. Houston, now an executive with the team, visited Israel with his wife last summer.Early reports that Stoudemire had made the journey to trace Jewish roots in the family of his mother, Carrie, might have made the Knicks fear objections by those suspicious of a marketing ploy for the benefit of the large Jewish fan base in New York.But Len Elmore, the broadcaster and former N.B.A. player who is African-American, married to a Jewish woman and has had two sons bar-mitzvahed, saw no downside. “It’s refreshing that a guy would use his downtime to explore the world and himself,” said Elmore, who is also the chief executive of iHoops, the N.B.A. and N.C.A.A. venture to promote a healthier youth basketball environment.Alan Freedman, the director of the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum at the Suffolk Y Jewish Community Center in Commack, N.Y., said he reacted with disbelief when he received an e-mail from a board member last week, informing him that Stoudemire had revealed his Judaism.Freedman said he wrote back, “Yeah, and I heard Shaquille O’Neal is Orthodox.”In a telephone interview, Freedman said, “I don’t think we’ll be inducting Amar’e Stoudemire into our Hall of Fame any time soon.” But as for the trip, he added: “It’s 100 percent a good thing. I’m all for making people aware and for opening up dialogue.”Stoudemire said he intended to do more than that, affirming he would “absolutely” be practicing the faith — again for cultural and spiritual reasons only. He intends to observe the Sabbath, Passover and the High Holy Days unless they conflict with his Knicks schedule.He said he had been eating kosher in Israel and planned to continue. “When I get back to the States, I’m going to focus more on living the Scripture,” he said. “For me, it’s about learning the total culture.“If you research history, I think we are all Jewish,” he added. “It’s the original culture. This is a personal spiritual quest. So now I feel spiritually Jewish, culturally Jewish.”Would he play with his skullcap on? “Maybe with a string attached,” he said, laughing while motioning the tying of one under his chin. Ravin, the trainer, suggested gluing it to his head.The black skullcap was a gift, but Stoudemire now has a collection, including those with N.B.A. and Knicks logos embroidered.The highlights of his trip, which began in Jerusalem, included visiting significant sites that included the Western Wall, the Mount of Olives and the Old City. Without prompting, he mentioned Jesus being captured by the Romans and said, “I walked the same steps he walked when he carried the cross.”Stoudemire also went to Beersheba, which he called “the land of Abraham.” But the best bit of the trip, he said, was probably his float in the Dead Sea.“I just couldn’t believe it,” he said. “There are so many minerals. Usually when you reach down in the water, you get handfuls of sand or rocks. I was grabbing crystal salt.”Israelis were “very friendly, welcoming and appreciative that I was able to come to an understanding of my true culture.” Asked if he had had contact with Arabs, he said, “I met a few.”Stoudemire also found time on Monday for a morning workout, training in the gym at Tel Aviv’s Nokia Arena. Among those watching him were Shimon Mizrahi, the chairman of Maccabi Electra Tel Aviv. a basketball club, and the former Maccabi star Tal Brody. Both later met Stoudemire at the hotel.In a telephone interview, Brody called Stoudemire “an outstanding individual” and said he and Mizrahi had proposed he play for Maccabi Tel Aviv after finishing his N.B.A. career. “He didn’t say no,” Brody said.One way or another, Stoudemire said: “I’ll be back for sure. I look forward to maybe helping with some programs here.” Brody said they discussed the possibility of a youth program exchange.“It is all about love and peace, coming together and having fun,” Stoudemire said.The game? he was asked.In N.B.A. circles, Stoudemire’s life story is widely known, and he is respected for being a survivor and self-appointed patriarch of a troubled and splintered family. His father, Hazell, died when he was 12. His mother has been in and out of jail for a multitude of offenses from the time he was a child.An older brother, Hazell Jr., was sent to federal prison before Stoudemire jumped to the N.B.A. from high school in 2002. A half-brother, Marwan Williams, was — at 18 — one of five people arrested in 2007 after a shooting left one man dead in what the police said they thought was a drug heist gone bad in Scottsdale, Ariz.Stoudemire has said that the sum of his experiences makes it more imperative for him to feel spiritually connected and whole. Although his Israeli adventure was made without family members, he said his three children — ages 5, 3 and 2, with one woman whom he has not married — will be “introduced to the culture.”During his time in Israel, he has picked up some Hebrew — including local slang. “Levaker be’yisrael ze hahalom sheli,” he said, or “visiting Israel is my dream.” Asked for more, he also said, in Hebrew, “My name is Amar’e. I live in New York. I play basketball for the Knicks.”'"
"'10-08-04,'1','Stefano Ciravegna, the manager of two Grom gelaterias in Manhattan, has many answers to this question. Grom serves what may be America’s most expensive ice cream cone: $5.25, with tax, for a “small."" Grom, which has more than 20 stores in Italy, was founded in 2003 in Turin, the birthplace of the Slow Food movement. Slow Food’s commitment to preserving the pre-industrial ways of making food provided Grom with a mission: to recreate the traditional ice creams of the region, which is known for dairy, nuts and chocolate, and especially for the chocolate-hazelnut combination gianduja.“We do not do crazy funky flavors, but each one is the best,” Mr. Ciravegna said.The company imports flavorings from small farmers around the world — pistachios from Syria, coffee from Guatemala, chocolate from Colombia — and now grows many ingredients on its organic farm outside Turin, where its sole factory is also located. (The mixtures are shipped frozen to Grom outlets all over Italy and in Tokyo and Paris as well as New York, and churned in each store.)But raw materials and shipping have become so expensive, Mr. Ciravegna said, that the company actually loses money on some flavors. “The strawberries for our granita are grown only on 12 hectares in the entire earth,” he said, referring to fragolina di Ribera, a fragile Sicilian varietal that Grom makes into a limited-edition granita each summer.Some makers don’t buy the argument, though, that prices need to be that high. “I just don’t think $5 is a fair price for a scoop of ice cream,” said Patricia Samson, an owner of Delicieuse, a scoop shop in Redondo Beach, Calif., where the flavors include oak sap, beer sorbet and lavender. Ms. Samson makes all of the ice cream served at Delicieuse, starting from raw milk: she pasteurizes, ripens and flavors the ice cream on site. She uses local fruit in season, opens only on weekends to keep wages to a minimum, and still manages to sell her ice cream for the relative bargain price of $2.95 a small. (Grom, it should be noted, will soon open its first United States store outside New York near her.) “Milk and sugar are cheap,” she said.Those who think that the pint of Jeni’s Splendid Ice Cream, an excellent line made in Columbus, Ohio, is a little too pricey at Dean & DeLuca in SoHo, for $11 a pint, probably would hyperventilate at the thought of paying $50 for three pints of MilkMade, which may be the country’s most expensive pint of ice cream. It is available only in Manhattan, via a new home delivery service that has about 150 subscribers, according to Diana Hardeman, one of the company’s owners. For $50, subscribers receive three pints of ice cream over three months, made from fruit and milk with impeccable agricultural credentials, in flavors like Coffee + Donuts (made from fair trade coffee and local doughnuts) and Blackcurrant With Gingersnaps.According to Ms. Hardeman, who graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and has an M.B.A. from New York University, MilkMade will eventually run on the same community-based model that sustains farms through community-supported agriculture programs. For now, the idea is in a laboratory stage, including the ice creams themselves, which are not nearly as accomplished as those of Grom, or indeed of many people with a Cuisinart ice cream machine.The world of high-end ice cream is small, and marbled with squabbles and secrets, making it difficult to pin down exactly what is in the stuff. Those who add milk powder scoff at those who use guar gum (a common stabilizer that is considered “natural” by the F.D.A.). Those who stick to a basic flavor palette dismiss the makers of Whiskey Brickle and Rosemary-Goat’s Milk. The ones who use only fresh ingredients sneer at the pre-mixed crowd.Dairy technology has advanced to a point that consumers often can’t tell the difference. Expensive ice cream is often described as “artisanal” or “housemade,” but neither term has a meaningful definition as relates to ice cream. An “artisanal” gelato shop might only be adding water to a dry mix somewhere on the premises. (If you really want to know, it pays to ask.)The sheer act of making ice cream is expensively complex and time-consuming, artisans say. “You are taking a liquid, raising it up to a high temperature, then whipping it with cold air and turning it into a solid, which you want to serve in a semi-solid state,” said Ms. Samson of Delicieuse. (In California, a license is required for those who handle raw milk, the primary ingredient in Ms. Samson’s super-flavorful ice creams.)In the case of gelato, which in theory contains less air than other types of ice cream, makers often cite the intense flavor and dense texture (both of which result from the way gelato is made) as reasons for a higher price. But the amount of air (called overrun in ice cream circles) and the cost of ingredients are relatively minor factors in price, compared with branding, packaging and distribution.“Sadly, I think the marketing is just as important as the product,” said Benjamin Van Leeuwen, an owner of Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream, a New York company that has expanded its fleet of butter-yellow ice cream trucks to five after just two years in business, and recently opened a scoop shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. (A small serving is $3.60, plus tax.) “The Victorian look of our Web site, the botanical drawings and especially the color of our trucks seemed to make a huge difference,” he said.At Taos Cow, a scoop shop near Taos, N.M., where a small costs $4, the ice cream has been made with hormone-free milk and local pine nuts since 1993. “Back then, everyone thought we were crazy to care about that stuff,” said Jamie Leeson, a founder and owner. On the subject of the more inexpensive ingredients that go into, say, a $1.50 ice cream sandwich, Mr. Leeson is blunt. “Commercial ice cream is the dumping ground of the dairy industry,” he said. The residue at the bottom of the vats after the milk and cream are drained off, he said, is dried and then reconstituted into the components of cheap ice cream: milk fat, whey and dry milk powder. Like all the artisans interviewed, Mr. Leeson said that in the supermarket freezer case, it is virtually impossible for small brands to compete with Häagen-Dazs and Ben & Jerry’s, both of which are backed by the marketing power and distribution systems of global food giants (Nestlé and Unilever, respectively).At one point, popular Taos Cow flavors like Caramel Piñon and Cherry Ristra were distributed in pints to 15 Western states, but the profit margins were too low and eventually Mr. Leeson retreated to a single location. “If I had known you can charge $7 a pint, I might still be in that business,” he said.And the profit on packaged pints is nothing compared with the markup at the scoop shop.“I only make a dollar on each pint I sell at Whole Foods,” Mr. Van Leeuwen said, but a single serving from the truck yields about $2.50 in profit.Whether a particular cup of frozen delight is truly worth the price is, of course, a decision that only the market can make.“The meaning of ‘premium’ now is very different from what it was when Häagen-Dazs came out,” said Robin Davis, food editor of The Columbus Dispatch and the author of a recent history of Graeter’s, a Cincinnati ice cream institution.At the time, she said, all-natural ingredients and high fat content were enough to impart prestige and command a high price.Now, prestige comes from many different sources: an ice cream’s purity and pedigree, its artfulness and innovation.Ice creams that are served with support for farmers and cows are already as routine as rainbow sprinkles. Recently, more complicated ideological notions, which share the high price tags, have been heaped onto sugar cones.A recent special at the Guerrilla Ice Cream cart, a summer-only mobile business in New York started in May by two graduate students, was the Mariposa, a $5 reference to the Dominican Republic’s struggle for democracy. (Its flavor components include guava, espresso, cinnamon and sweet cheese.)Ethan Frisch, an owner of Guerrilla, says the high price is justified by the innovative flavor combinations and the fact that 100 percent of the profits (once the owners are paid and costs recouped) will be donated to social justice organizations.“I am not trying to get rich selling ice cream,” said Mr. Frisch, who will begin studying for a master’s degree in the Violence, Conflict and Development program at the University of London next month. “My goal right now is just to do an Israel-Palestine flavor that won’t get people upset.”'"
"'10-08-04,'1','Russia will delay its deadline for destroying chemical weapons stockpiles by up to three years because of budget and technical problems, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. Under the international Chemical Weapons Convention, Russia was to eliminate all its chemical weapons by 2012. Officials in the United States have also said they are likely to miss the 2012 deadline to eliminate Class I weapons — chemicals that have no use other than in armaments. Russia destroyed 19,151 tons of weapons chemicals, about 48 percent of its stockpile, according to a statement from the government of the Kirov region, where one of the country’s three weapons-destruction centers is located.'"
"'10-08-04,'1','Mr. Deripaska accused Mr. Potanin of allying with management to vote out Aleksandr Voloshin, a former presidential chief of staff, who had been acting as chairman as a compromise figure.“We consider such actions by a public company to be gross violations of corporate governance procedures,” Rusal said in a statement at the time. Rusal said it would sue the Norilsk management.Then, on Monday, Mr. Deripaska and two members of Rusal’s board sent a letter to the board of Norilsk Nickel to point out what they called “improper conduct and self-dealing by Norilsk and certain shareholders.”This escalating fight between two powerful and wealthy businessmen is shaping up as a test for President Dmitri A. Medvedev’s handling of the oligarchy, whose sharp-elbowed infighting has proved a problem for former governments.Through the summer, the usually hands-on Russian government has taken an uncharacteristically back-seat role.But after Mr. Deripaska’s direct accusations in the letter, Mr. Medvedev’s office issued a statement on Tuesday saying it would ask a prosecutor to investigate but would not intervene by taking a direct role in management. That is in keeping with a new policy of the Russian government, less flush with oil revenue than it once was, to take a less prominent role in the economy.“Norilsk Nickel is a private enterprise,” an unidentified Kremlin official said, according to the Interfax news agency. “It should remain so in the future.”The mine, so far in the north of Siberia that its output must be shipped on convoys escorted by nuclear icebreakers, produces 20 percent of the world’s nickel and 49 percent of the world’s palladium, as well as copper, cobalt and other metals. Palladium is used for catalytic converters to meet emissions standards in many countries and has a potential new market in batteries or fuel cells for electric cars.An official at Interros, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the June vote violated no laws or points in a shareholder agreement between Rusal and Interros, struck after Mr. Prokhorov sold his stake.The official said Mr. Deripaska’s need for cash to pay down debt had led to the conflict because he had been pressing for greater dividends than Mr. Potanin thought reasonable.Mr. Deripaska has said that Norilsk could pay higher dividends if it were managed more efficiently and that the company should sell underperforming assets, including the Stillwater mine for platinum group metals in Montana, now owned by the Russians but idled during the automotive slump in the United States.'"
"'10-08-04,'1','The household products maker Procter & Gamble posted lower-than-expected profit on Tuesday as higher spending on marketing more than offset sales growth.Procter said investment in products released this year, including Pampers Dry Max diapers, the Fusion ProGlide razor and Crest 3D White tooth-whitening strips, outpaced a 5 percent growth in net sales.“Next year is another big year of innovation for us, and we’ll be investing behind that,” the chief financial officer, Jon R. Moeller, said in a conference call with reporters.Profit for the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter fell to $2.19 billion, or 71 cents a share, from $2.47 billion, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended June 30, rose 5 percent to $18.93 billion.Net income fell short of the 73 cents a share expected by analysts, and Procter & Gamble shares fell $2.12, or 3.4 percent, to $59.94.The company forecast first-quarter earnings of 97 cents to $1.01 a share and said sales were expected to grow by 3 to 5 percent.

"'10-08-04,'1','The second season of “Glee” will feature one of the most popular singing sensations to emerge from Britain — and the music of Paul McCartney, too. Ryan Murphy, a creator of the Fox musical comedy series, said at the Television Critics Association press tour on Monday that Susan Boyle, below, would appear in a coming episode of “Glee” and that Mr. McCartney’s music would also be featured, Reuters reported. Mr. Murphy said that Ms. Boyle, the best-selling pop singer who was discovered on the reality series “Britain’s Got Talent,” would appear in a Christmas-theme episode of “Glee”; Reuters said she would play the (not-at-all-typecast) role of a high school lunch lady. The episode featuring Mr. McCartney’s songs wasn’t specified, but Mr. Murphy said he had been won over by a set of mix CDs Mr. McCartney sent to him. “It came out of blue in a package, handwritten, and it had two CDs, and it said, ‘Hi Ryan, I hope you will consider some of these songs for “Glee,” ’ Mr. Murphy said, according to Reuters.'"
"'10-08-04,'1','Mr. Bellesiles and his supporters have maintained that the uproar was politically motivated and his mistakes minor. In promotional material for “1877,” Mr. Bellesiles’s current publisher, the nonprofit New Press, described him as returning to writing after becoming “the target of an infamous ‘swiftboating’ campaign by the National Rifle Association.”That characterization of Mr. Bellesiles, who has been teaching history part time at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain while working two other part-time jobs, did precisely what he had hoped to avoid: revive the controversy about “Arming America.” Then, in June, an article he wrote for The Chronicle of Higher Education about teaching students military history during wartime stoked further discussion of Mr. Bellesiles’s credibility. In it he mentioned a student who told him a brother had been killed in Iraq — a claim that turned out to be false. The Chronicle, which investigated the incident after readers raised questions, said the student confessed he had lied to Mr. Bellesiles.“It broke my heart,” Mr. Bellesiles said. “I always trusted my students.”Trim and boyish-looking at 56, with close-cropped hair and wearing a T-shirt, Mr. Bellesiles said in an interview that there was nothing he could do about how his former student’s transgression would affect the reception of his new book.He said he purposely picked a subject that was not controversial, politically or otherwise. Other historians have pinpointed 1877 as a violent turning point, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Robert V. Bruce, for example, published a classic book in 1959 with a similar title, “1877: Year of Violence.”The history profession has shown itself to be both merciless and forgiving toward errant practitioners. Some famous historians, like Doris Kearns Goodwin and Stephen Ambrose, have emerged from plagiarism charges mostly unscathed. Other less well-known scholars have been hounded out of the profession for relatively minor mistakes, as happened in a notorious case from the early 1980s involving a young professor named David Abraham, who wrote about Weimar Germany.When asked about Mr. Bellesiles, many historians said they expected and hoped that his new work would be judged on its merits. Stanley N. Katz, a history professor at Princeton who was a member of the panel that reviewed “Arming America,” said: “Forgiveness is always appropriate. I can’t imagine the attitude that ‘it’s one strike and you’re out.’ ”Other prominent members of the profession, including Anthony T. Grafton, the president-elect of the American Historical Association; David A. Hollinger, the president of the Organization of American Historians; and Alice Kessler-Harris, that organization’s president-elect, all said they expected the book would get a fair — if unusually scrutinized — reading.Nonetheless, resentment lingers. “There’s a lot of honest people who publish books all the time and can’t get any notice,” Professor Hollinger said. “And the idea that this guy can publish another book and get all this attention for it because of his previous confirmed dishonesty will annoy many professional historians.”More troubling to some has been Mr. Bellesiles’s unwillingness to admit serious scholarly lapses, which included citing nonexistent sources and making mistakes in reading documents, all of which favored his thesis.“It would make a lot of people feel better if Bellesiles had been more forthcoming about having transgressed,” Professor Katz said. Professor Grafton, who also happens to be the author of a book on an essential scholarly practice, titled “The Footnote: A Curious History,” agreed. “Unlike other people who have been shown to make serious mistakes, he’s been pretty unrepentant.”Indeed, some took the New Press’s description of what happened to Mr. Bellesiles as provocation. Scott McLemee, an essayist, wrote on Inside Higher Ed, an online publication (found at insiderhighered.com), that the New Press should “make a public apology for violating the trust its readers have in it.”Marc Favreau, Mr. Bellesiles’s editor at the New Press, perhaps chastened after saying too much in the publicity materials, offered only a brief reply when asked about the promotional copy.“The New Press didn’t have a role in ‘Arming America,’ ” he wrote in an e-mail. “We’re thrilled to publish Michael’s extraordinary new book and confident it will be judged on its own considerable merits.” Since the flood of criticism, the press has changed Mr. Bellesiles’s biographical material.Mr. Bellesiles, though, doesn’t accept that his scholarship was significantly faulty. His unwillingness to issue a mea culpa, however, has had the effect of preventing others from forgiving and forgetting.“I still think it was a good book, but it ruined my life,” Mr. Bellesiles said of “Arming America.” “If I had a time machine, I would go back and never write it.”'"
"'10-08-04,'1','In fact, the Orange store would have been built years ago if not for community opposition that led to a series of legal setbacks.Most notably, in 2008 the state Supreme Court overturned the company’s wetlands approval, citing problems with its filings.“What it meant is, we would have had to go back through the permitting processes again, which would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Mr. Leonard said. “When you look at that, and you look at my sisters and brother saying it’s going to cannibalize the other stores, I basically had to put my tail between my legs and say, ‘I lost this battle.’ ”If so, the winner was a group called Save Our Neighborhood, founded by Clem Evangelista, a former mayor of nearby West Haven who lives on a lake in Orange. Mr. Evangelista, a trucking company owner, said he fought Stew Leonard’s because it would have brought too much traffic to the area.“There are places for that kind of store, like the Boston Post Road,” he said, referring to the thoroughfare that offers, among others, a Costco (in nearby Milford) and a Sam’s Club. “He could have gone there anytime he wished.”Mr. Leonard dismissed the traffic concerns, saying the site was right by a Route 95 exit ramp that provided adequate vehicle access. Mr. Evangelista said, “That stretch is always congested. People would have gotten off the highway and taken side streets” to get to the store.Mr. Leonard also said that his store would have contributed significantly to the town’s tax base. But Mr. Evangelista said that this small town, which has a volunteer fire company, would have had to spend more on additional services than it would have gained in taxes.Mr. Leonard said that most residents here were in favor of the store; Mr. Evangelista disagreed, saying that most opposed it and that he once suggested the town hold a referendum.Over the years, Mr. Evangelista said, he raised about $100,000 from 1,500 families and several local businesses to support his efforts to block the store.“There was a rumor I was on the payroll of Stop & Shop,” he said, referring to a rival supermarket chain.In fact, he said, “I would have taken money from them, but they wouldn’t give me any.”Jim Zeoli, Orange’s first selectman (the Connecticut version of a mayor in some towns), said that he once spoke out against the store, thinking it would not be the best tax generator for the site, but that he later tried to broker a deal that would have satisfied Mr. Leonard and town residents.He said that some of those residents were scared off by numbers on the Stew Leonard’s Web site, which said that the Yonkers store attracted about 18,000 customers a day. “Having a Web site like that can work against you,” Mr. Zeoli said. (Vince Summa, Stew Leonard’s chief financial officer, wrote in an e-mail that the company projected about 13,500 visitors a day in Orange and that “since we are a family store,” the number of projected cars was smaller — fewer than 8,000. But the point was already lost.)Mr. Evangelista said the battle often came down to what experts said about environmental impact. Although his group sometimes hired its own experts, he said, he also used numbers provided by Mr. Leonard, who, he said, “did all the research.” He said he sometimes cited numbers the company provided to support his own conclusions.Mr. Zeoli said that the area around the Stew Leonard’s site was booming: United Illuminating, a power company, is building offices on one large parcel, and Yale University is planning a research center for another. “We’ll find the right use for the site,” he said of the Stew Leonard’s property.But the right user will have to meet Mr. Leonard’s $9.5 million asking price, which he admitted might be a little high in this market.“It’s not a good time to sell anything,” Mr. Leonard said. “But we’re just going to sit and wait.”Perhaps the high price reflects a reluctance to part with what he calls “the best piece of property left between New York and Boston.”“It’s been a love affair of mine since we bought it,” Mr. Leonard said. “But now the story’s over.”As for Mr. Evangelista, he is engaged in another fight, this time to prevent Hubbell Inc., an electronics company, from building 225 single-family homes on property it owns here. Of the Stew Leonard’s victory, he said, “This proves you can win if you stay in the battle.”'"
"'10-08-04,'1','The drug maker Pfizer reported a 9 percent increase in second-quarter profit on Tuesday, easily topping Wall Street expectations. The company said its revenue was sharply higher because of its acquisition of a rival drug maker, Wyeth, in October.The company, which makes the cholesterol blockbuster Lipitor and the impotence pill Viagra said net income for the three months ended July 4 rose to $2.48 billion, or 31 cents a share. A year ago, income was $2.26 billion, or 34 cents a share. Pfizer has since sold millions of new shares to help pay for Wyeth.Pfizer reported revenue of $17.33 billion, up from $10.98 billion last year, an increase of nearly 58 percent, mainly because of $5.4 billion from Wyeth products. Sales in the United States jumped 63 percent and foreign sales, 54 percent.Excluding 31 cents in one-time items, income was $4.96 billion, or 62 cents a share. Those items included $1.1 billion before taxes for integrating Wyeth’s systems, employee severance and other restructuring, plus $2.1 billion before taxes for various charges related to buying Wyeth. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected 52 cents a share on revenue of $16.65 billion.Pfizer faces generic competition for Lipitor, the world’s top-selling drug with about $11 billion in 2009 sales, and eight other big-selling, high-margin drugs by 2015. Some of its highly promoted drugs failed in testing recently. It bought Wyeth for $68 billion to bolster revenue, cut costs and diversify, nabbing Wyeth’s vaccine and biologic drugs, consumer health products such as Centrum vitamins and its animal health business.'"

"'10-08-05,'0','Missouri voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a measure intended to nullify the new federal health care law, becoming the first state in the nation where ordinary people made known their dismay over the issue at the ballot box.The measure was meant to invalidate a crucial element of President Obama’s health care law — namely, that most people be required to get health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Supporters of the measure said it would send a firm signal to Washington about how this state, often a bellwether in presidential elections, felt.The referendum drew support from 71 percent of nearly 939,000 voters. “My constituents told me they felt like their voices had been ignored and they wanted Washington to hear them,” said Jane Cunningham, a state senator and Republican. “It looks to me like they just picked up a megaphone.”The referendum, known as Proposition C, was seen as a first look at efforts by conservatives to gather and rally their forces over the issue. Practically speaking, it remains entirely uncertain what effect the vote will have. The insurance requirement of the federal health care law does not come into effect until 2014. By then, experts say, the courts are likely to weigh in on the provision.Primaries around the Midwest set the cast for political battles in November. In Michigan, where Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, is barred by term limits from seeking re-election, Rick Snyder, a businessman who has never held office, defeated four other Republicans, including the state attorney general and a United States representative.Virg Bernero, the mayor of Lansing, won on the Democratic side.In a closely watched Congressional race, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, a seven-term representative, was defeated by Hansen Clarke, a state senator, in a Democratic primary for her seat. Ms. Kilpatrick’s son, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, the disgraced former mayor of Detroit, is in jail on a probation violation and is awaiting trial on federal charges of tax evasion and mail and tax fraud.In Kansas, a bitter, personal Republican primary battle for the United States Senate ended with Representative Jerry Moran beating Representative Todd Tiahrt. Much of the campaign seemed to center on which man — Mr. Tiahrt (who boasted Sarah Palin’s support) or Mr. Moran (who campaigned this week with Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma) — had true rights to the conservative title.'"
"'10-08-05,'0','A previous set of worker-safety reports provided to The Times were specific to the Deepwater Horizon. The new documents draw from analyses of three other rigs in the gulf and attempt to provide an overview for the entire North American division of the Transocean fleet.The safety concerns cited in the company’s assessment of its North American division are supplemented by newly released internal reports concerning the Deepwater Horizon’s equipment. These equipment reports identify dozens of deficiencies, including some relating to the rig’s blowout preventer, and some that are categorized as “critical equipment items that may lead to loss of life, serious injury or environmental damage as a result of inadequate use and/or failure of equipment.”“Without a doubt, previous incidents and near-hits experienced throughout the organization were as a result of multiple causes and many contributory factors,” said the summary report, which gave an overview of the company’s North American Division and draws from investigations of Transocean’s Marianas, Discoverer Clear Leader, GSF Development Driller II and Deepwater Horizon drilling rigs.This is not the first report of the Deepwater Horizon experiencing problems with its ballast system. In May 2008, Transocean was forced to evacuate more than 70 workers after problems with the ballast system flooded part of the rig, causing it to list to its side, federal records show.A lack of hands-on experience for workers and managers has contributed to safety concerns at the company, and a stifling bureaucracy imposed by onshore management has led to widespread resentment among rig workers, the investigators found.Nearly 40 percent of workers interviewed on the four rigs said that past problems were typically investigated by company officials strictly to attribute blame.“It me off when someone fails or has an incident; they focus on the paper rather than the process that was gone through,” said a worker from the Discoverer Clear Leader.Another worker on Transocean’s Marianas rig said that the safety manual seemed to be “written for the courtroom, not the oil field.”The reports are likely to broaden the discussion of blame for the April 20 explosion, which killed 11 workers. BP, which was leasing the Deepwater Horizon from Transocean at the time of the explosion, has been under the harshest glare for its role, but the Justice Department has said that its criminal investigation of the disaster will look at the role of the many companies involved.About 43 percent of workers on the four rigs expressed fears of reprisals for reporting problems, the documents said. About 54 percent of Deepwater Horizon workers cited these fears, while about 61 percent of workers on the Marianas did so.Some workers said the company was systematically deferring maintenance to save money.“This rig is getting $550,000 per day; unless it’s a sink that needs fixing it isn’t getting fixed,” said a worker from the Marianas about the maintenance concerns. “They won’t send the rig to the shipyard for major refurb that is required in certain areas.”The investigators who visited the four rigs in March concluded that many crew members and front-line supervisors were too readily promoted without sufficient on-the-job experience to appreciate the hazards. “Front-line crews are potentially working with a mind-set that they believe they are fully aware of all the hazards when it is highly likely that they are not,” the investigators said, adding that the workload, and thus the risks, on the rigs was increasing.After reviewing the new documents, Senator , Democrat of and the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety, voiced concern.“These documents are more evidence that despite the growing count of worker deaths and safety violations, the oil and gas industry still just doesn’t get it,” she said. “They need to change their worker-safety culture, and I am pretty sure we can’t count on them to do it by themselves.”She added, “The oil and gas industry is not the same as a mom-and-pop grocery, and they can’t be treated the same.”Lou Colasuonno, a spokesman for Transocean, wrote in an e-mail that the company was committed to safety and maintenance and that it proactively commissioned independent employee surveys and rig condition assessments.“Reading the complete reports makes it abundantly clear that that both studies were positive and were designed specifically to identify strengths and weaknesses — a critical step in evaluating performance,” he wrote.“Overall maintenance on the Deepwater Horizon met or exceeded regulatory and industry standards, and the company’s proactive review process helped the Deepwater Horizon log seven consecutive years without a single lost time incident or major environmental event prior to this incident.”He declined to specify the series of “serious accidents and near-hits” that motivated the safety investigations.The safety reports cite a variety of positive findings about Transocean. “Despite several rig management changes on board the rigs visited, rig leadership was generally praised by the work force,” one said.Almost 87 percent of workers said they believed that there was enough time to do their work according to rules and procedures.“Rig management and supervisors were generally seen as approachable, set a good example of the company commitment to safety, and were generally highly visible,” the investigators said.But their praise often came with a certain ambivalence.“Generally, the work force thought there was a sufficient number of staff to manage safety,” one report concluded before adding, “There were, however, some questions surrounding the retention of skilled personnel, competency levels for some personnel, and of processes in place for competency development and assurance.”Although high levels of trust were reported at the rig level, “there was a significant level of mistrust between the rigs and the beach,” the report said, referring to onshore management.Around 46 percent of workers on the four rigs said that some of the work force was uncomfortable with calling a “time out for safety.” Deepwater Horizon workers polled at about the same rate on this issue.Transocean’s equipment documents reveal for the first time the severity of the maintenance issues that plagued the Deepwater Horizon, and they indicate that the company was aware of the consequences of the problems.These new documents refer to at least 36 pieces of equipment in ill repair on the Deepwater Horizon that “may lead to loss of life, serious injury or environmental damage as a result of inadequate use and/or failure of equipment.”The new equipment documents indicate that an inspection of the Deepwater Horizon rig conducted just days before the April 20 accident found various problems with hydraulic relays that controlled the rig’s watertight doors, two of which had to be opened and closed by hand.Of the four rigs investigated, the Development Driller II is now being used by BP to drill one of the two relief wells near the Deepwater Horizon. The Marianas was the original rig that was drilling BP’s Macondo well before being damaged in a hurricane. Despite having been built in 2009, the Discoverer Clear Leader had “a few notable safety related incidents on the rig during its relatively short operational history.” It is now being used by BP for oil containment at the Deepwater Horizon site.It was not clear where the other rigs cited in the safety reports are operating now.'"
"'10-08-05,'0','Since the court decision, involving , in April, the F.C.C. has been trying to find a way to regulate broadband delivery, and that effort has been the subject of a series of private meetings at the agency’s headquarters in recent weeks. At the meetings, officials from the nation’s biggest Internet service and content providers, including Google and Verizon, have tried to reach a consensus on how broadband Internet service should be regulated in light of the decision. Those meetings continued this week, apart from the talks between Google and Verizon.The court decision said the F.C.C. lacked the authority to require that an Internet service provider refrain from blocking or slowing down some content or applications, or giving favor to others. The F.C.C. has since sought another way in which to enforce the concept of net neutrality. But its proposals have been greeted with much objection in Congress and among Internet service providers, cable companies and some Internet content producers.A spokesman for Verizon said that the company was still engaged in the larger talks to reach a consensus at the F.C.C. and declined to comment on other negotiations. A spokeswoman for Google also declined to comment. While a deal between Google and Verizon would affect only those two companies, it could sway the opinions of lawmakers, many of whom have questioned the wisdom of the F.C.C.’s plans to oversee broadband service.At issue for consumers is how the companies that provide the pipeline to the Internet will ultimately direct traffic on their system, and how quickly consumers are able to gain access to certain Web content. Consumers could also see continually rising bills for Internet service, much as they have for cable television.The prospect of a Google-Verizon agreement infuriates many consumer advocates, who feel that it would concentrate in a few corporations control of what to date has been a free and open Internet system in which consumers decide which companies are successful.“The point of a rule is to prevent big companies from dividing the Internet between them,” said Gigi B. Sohn, president and a founder of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group. “The fate of the Internet is too large a matter to be decided by negotiations involving two companies, even companies as big as Verizon and Google.”It is not clear that the Google-Verizon talks will result in a deal, or that any agreement would extend beyond those companies. David M. Fish, a spokesman for Verizon, acknowledged the talks, saying, “We’ve been working with Google for 10 months to reach an agreement on broadband policy.”But, Mr. Fish added, “We are currently engaged in and committed to the negotiation process led by the F.C.C. We are optimistic this process will reach a consensus that can maintain an open Internet, and the and innovation required to sustain it.”The F.C.C. process he referred to is what is jokingly called at the agency headquarters “the secret meeting.” At least nine times in the last seven weeks — including Wednesday, with another meeting scheduled for Thursday — a group that includes Google, Verizon, , , cable system operators and a group called the Open Internet Coalition has met with top F.C.C. officials to discuss net neutrality and the agency’s legal basis for regulating Internet service.Cable and telephone companies want free rein to sell specialized services like “paid prioritization,” which would speed some content to users more quickly for a fee. Wireless companies, meanwhile, want no restrictions on wireless broadband, which they see as a different technology than Internet service over wires.Many content providers — like , and Skype — prefer no favoritism on the Internet or they want to be sure that if a pay system exists, all content providers have the opportunity to pay for faster service.The F.C.C., meanwhile, favors a level playing field, but it cannot impose one as long as its authority over broadband is in legal doubt. It has proposed a solution that would reclassify broadband Internet service under the Communications Act from its current designation as an “information service,” a lightly regulated designation, to a “telecommunications service,” a category that, like telephone service, is subject to stricter regulation.The F.C.C. has said that it does not want to impose strict regulation on Internet service and rates, but seeks only the authority to enforce broadband privacy and guarantee equal access. It also wants to use federal money to subsidize broadband service for rural areas.While the F.C.C. is gathering public comment on its reclassification proposal, it has convened the private talks, which are overseen by Edward Lazarus, the chief of staff to , the F.C.C.’s chairman.The talks have produced some common ground among the participants on smaller matters. But one participant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the group members agreed not to discuss their deliberations publicly, said there had been little movement “on the few big issues that are the most important.”Frustrated with that lack of progress in the last two months, direct talks between Google and Verizon have accelerated, according to people close to the discussions who were not authorized to comment publicly.Google and Verizon have their own interests at stake in negotiating separately. The Android operating system from Google is used on many Verizon phones, including the Droid, a competitor to the from .Consumer groups have objected to the private meetings, saying that too many stakeholders are being left out of discussions over the future of the Internet.Mr. Lazarus said the meetings “are part of our efforts to identify the best way forward in the wake of the Comcast case to preserve the openness and vibrancy of the Internet.”'"
"'10-08-05,'0','A former Deloitte & Touche partner and his son will pay more than $1.1 million to settle claims they illegally traded on inside information about the audit firm’s clients, federal regulators said on Wednesday.The former partner, Thomas P.

Mr. Flanagan also tipped off his son, Patrick T.

They did not admit or deny wrongdoing under the settlement, according to the agency.Thomas Flanagan, 62, served as Deloitte’s advisory partner for Best Buy, Sears and Walgreen, a position that granted him access to income statements and press releases before the documents were made public. In trading on the results, the S.E.C. said he had violated the regulator’s auditor independence rules and Deloitte policies that restricted employees from buying securities linked to clients.Thomas Flanagan worked at Deloitte and its predecessor firm for more than 35 years before leaving the company as a vice chairman in its Chicago office in September 2008. He traded on material nonpublic information at least nine times from 2005 to 2008, reaping more than $430,000 in profits, the S.E.C. said.'"

"'10-08-05,'0','But when it comes to the real economy, business pragmatism is trumping political tensions. “No Israeli companies are leaving Turkey,” said Mr. Carmon, an Israeli entrepreneur who was raised in Istanbul. “It is business as usual and if anything, investment is growing.”In the short term, the flotilla raid has produced some inevitable economic fallout. The widespread cancellations of holiday bookings by Israelis will cost Turkey some $400 million, analysts say. Turkey, meanwhile, said it would scrutinize all military cooperation, potentially depriving Israeli companies of billions of dollars in lucrative contracts.Yet Israeli companies selling everything from computer software to water irrigation systems in Turkey insist that they have not been affected by recent events. In part, that is because they operate mostly in joint ventures with Turkish companies, making their Israeli identities invisible. It is a sign of the times that not a single Israeli company doing business here was willing to be quoted by name for fear that they or their Turkish customers could be hounded.Bilateral trade between the two countries officially amounted to about $3 billion last year. But Israeli and Turkish business leaders say the economic ties are actually much larger.The extensive business connections are largely camouflaged, they say, because many Israeli businesses use their Turkish partner companies to sell to the Arab world while Turkish companies use their Israeli partners as a gateway to American markets.Even on the defense front, Turkish officials say that close cooperation between Israel and a Turkish military at odds with the Islamist government in Ankara is continuing behind the scenes. Israeli officials may be resigned to losing some immediate Turkish government contracts, but they remain confident that pragmatic interests will win out over ideological differences.“While the politicians are trying to profit from the conflict, the army has remained remarkably quiet,” said Mehmet Altan, a leading Turkish columnist. “Both Israel and the Turkish military establishment want a secular Turkey, so they are fighting for the same thing.”Within weeks of the flotilla raid, a Turkish military delegation arrived in Israel to learn how to operate the same pilotless aircraft often used by Israel to hunt Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. The $190 million deal for the drones was not canceled, even as the Israeli instructors in Turkey were called home after the raid.Doron Abrahami, consul for economic affairs at the Israeli Consulate in Istanbul, noted that before the flotilla clash, Israel’s military industry had teamed up with a Turkish partner to help modernize a fleet of 170 Turkish tanks in a project valued at $700 million. He said the Israeli and Turkish partners were now shopping around their expertise to other countries.“Business is business,” he said, showing off an invitation dated July 15, co-signed by economic agencies in Turkey and Israel just weeks after the Israeli raid, inviting Israeli and Turkish companies to bid for a jointly financed research and development project, one of more than 20 such efforts he said were under way.In 1949, Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Israel shortly after the country declared its existence in 1948. The two have forged strong military and trade ties, but diplomatic and political relations have deteriorated in recent years, as alarm has grown in the United States and Europe that Turkey is turning its back on the West and courting Israel’s enemies like Iran.In January 2009, the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, stormed out of the World Economic Forum in Davos, after clashing with the Israeli president, Shimon Peres. In January of this year, Israel apologized after its deputy foreign minister insulted the Turkish ambassador by forcing him to sit on a lowered sofa.Yet for all of the recent episodes of mutual recrimination, Turkish and Israeli business people remain close.Necat Yuksel is export manager at Naksan Plastik, a large Turkish plastic packaging producer in Gaziantep, in Turkey’s southeast, that imported some $40 million worth of plastic chemicals from Israel last year. He said sales from Israel showed no signs of abating, even as the recent clash with Israel had exerted a damaging psychological effect on both countries.His Israeli customers are now wary of travelling to Turkey, he said, and his best Israeli client now refers to him as “Erdogan,” after Turkey’s prime minister. Yet not a single contract had been canceled. Nor has his company shelved its plans to establish a factory in Israel.He proudly cited many advantages to doing business with Israel, including geographic proximity and a shared mentality. “All the problems are between the politicians,” Mr. Yuksel said. “Israelis, hot-tempered and stubborn, are just like us Turks.”Mr. Yuksel, who has been visiting Israel for more than a decade, argued that Israeli executives were far more influenced by recent political events than Turks. “For us it comes down to profits,” he said. “For the Israelis, it’s emotional.”Yet most Turks are adamant that Israel needs Turkey far more than Turkey needs Israel. Sinan Ulgen, a leading economist in Istanbul, argued that Israel had far more to lose than Turkey from severed ties. Sales to Israel made up about 1.5 percent of Turkey’s total exports of $102 billion last year, making it Turkey’s 17th biggest market, according to the State Statistics Agency in Ankara. Israel exported some $1.04 billion to Turkey last year, making Turkey its eighth largest export market.At the political level, Mr. Ulgen noted that when ties were strong, Turkey provided an isolated and tiny Israel with a large Muslim ally in a perilous region.But Rifat Bali, a Turkish Jew who had written widely on Turkish-Israeli relations, countered that bad relations with Israel were riskier for Turkey by undermining its relations with the United States. They also stifled Turkey’s aspirations to be a regional power by depriving Turkey of the ability to play a mediating role. He said Israel was one of the only countries willing to sell arms to Turkey with no strings attached.“Both Turkey and Israel,” Mr. Bali said, “need each other far more than either is willing to admit.”'"

"'10-08-05,'0','Half a century later, at a meeting that his subject might have admired, Mr. Quinn had lunch with Paul J. Browne, the deputy commissioner for public information at the New York Police Department. He told Mr. Browne he was interested in the Crater case and was quickly introduced to the lieutenant who ran the department’s Missing Persons Squad.Shortly after, there was a potboiler-worthy development. The lieutenant, who at first had come up empty-handed looking for old records, discovered the three accordion files. Apparently, they had been left on top of, not inside, a file cabinet. The case, which is officially still open, has been classified inactive.History, of course, is as rife with incompletion as with information, and Mr. Quinn, after poring over the papers, was surprised at just how much of the case remained untold, even in the primary source material.“The more you dip into history,” he said, “the more you realize how much isn’t on the record.” He spent months attempting a factual account of the case before it slowly dawned on him that the story was better suited to the pliant world of fiction.Thus, one encounters Fintan Dunne, ex-cop, ex-spy and current partner in the International Service Corporation, a global conglomerate of private eyes, who, in 1955 — the 25th anniversary of the disappearance — is hired by a Pulitzeresque media tycoon to solve the Crater case. It is through this protagonist, whom the author has used before (skeptical, Irish, reluctantly adulterous) that Mr. Quinn approaches his true subject: not the cloudy facts of an old vanishing act, but rather its tenacious hold on the collective imagination of New York.The city is, itself, a sort of vanishing act — all those Broadway haunts replaced by condominiums — and Judge Crater can, perhaps, be thought of as its human embodiment: influential one day, annihilated the next. His memory lives on, but no more than his memory. Where did he go? Change the “he” to “it” and the question holds true for the Hotel Astor, the old Pennsylvania Station, the Automat.Throw in some timeless specifics — sex, politics, the suggestion of corruption — and the Crater case could, without much effort, be discerned in the headlines of yesterday’s newspaper. Even its milieu — the anxious post-crash days when the severity of the Great Depression had not yet settled in — has relevance today. “When that guy disappeared, a lot went with him,” Mr. Quinn said. “It was the end of the whole 1920s era in New York.”Mr. Quinn, at that moment, was standing on the corner of Broadway and 45th Street, just outside the red-and-white Swatch shop. On the night of the disappearance — Aug. 6, 1930 — the building housed the office of the Arrow Ticket Agency, where Judge Crater arranged a seat for “Dancing Partner” at the Belasco Theater, a show he would never attend.“When I’m walking around down here,” Mr. Quinn said as he crossed Seventh Avenue, “I sometimes think I’m the only one still carrying this stuff in my head.”He then told a story that belied this. Months ago, he visited Crater’s old apartment building at 11th Street and Fifth Avenue. After he had been lurking for several minutes, the superintendent said, “You looking for the judge?” Mr. Quinn was stunned. The super said, “You think you’re the only one?”The tour came to an end at the former Billy Haas’s, once 332 West 45th Street (the address no longer exists). Mr. Quinn leaned into the street and raised his hand.“I think I’ll get a cab from here,” he said. Then something occurred to him; he smiled.“If you never hear from me again,” he added, “I guess you’ve got a really good story.”'"
"'10-08-05,'0','The Chevron Corporation says in federal court filings in Manhattan that footage it was provided from the Joe Berlinger documentary “Crude” demonstrated “pervasive corruption and fraud” by lawyers representing Ecuadorians who are suing the company, an accusation those lawyers vigorously dispute. In July a federal appeals court ruled that Mr. Berlinger had to provide the oil company with some footage from his 2009 film, which chronicles Ecuadorians who say that an oil field established by Texaco (now owned by Chevron) polluted their water. Chevron said in a statement that interactions between lawyers for the Ecuadorian plaintiffs and a court-appointed expert showed the parties “engaged in an illegal scheme to corrupt the proceedings in Ecuador.” Ilann M. Maazel, a lawyer whose firm represents the Ecuadorean plaintiffs, said that neither Chevron nor Mr. Berlinger had provided his team with the film outtakes, and that lawyers for Chevron had similar access to court experts. “They cherrypick a couple of minutes and share it with the court, but they’re not willing to release all the tapes,” Mr. Maazel said in a telephone interview. He said that neither Chevron nor Mr. Berlinger would provide the outtakes to him.'"

"'10-08-05,'0','But the Lilliputian price also explains why Fannie Mae might have buy-and-hold types feeling queasy. A penny or two change in the price translates into a big move in percentage terms. Last week, for instance, Fannie Mae’s shares rose 47 percent one day, only to sink 14 percent the next.Behind all of this commotion are day traders, those creatures of the dot-com era. Mutual funds and other institutions have mostly abandoned Fannie Mae, as well as shares of its cousin Freddie Mac. The big money has ceded the marketplace to individuals who are bold enough, or perhaps foolish enough, to gamble on these stocks for a few hours.Just don’t hold Fannie Mae too long, Mr. George advised. He predicted the stock would eventually fall to zero. It is difficult to know what other analysts think, since Mr. George is just about the only one who still covers Fannie Mae’s stock. His recommendation is an understated “underperform” — Wall Street code for sell.“It’s not really a stock anymore — everyone knows this is going to zero,” he said.Well, not everyone, at least not right away. But the running interest in Fannie Mae’s stock might seem surprising, considering that this company was the Titanic of the mortgage market. During the bubble years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought up so many toxic mortgages that the government was forced to take them over. Their stock prices promptly plunged.The federal government today owns almost 80 percent of Fannie and Freddie, and few people, in Washington or on Wall Street, seem to know what to do with them.Despite the trading frenzy, Fannie and Freddie have become pariahs. Most big investors won’t touch them. As of March 31, Fannie’s shareholders included two big money management companies, the Vanguard Group and BlackRock. But together they owned a mere 1.2 percent of the company, a pittance given the size of those investment companies.Big institutions typically sell if a stock price sinks below $5. Fannie Mae has not traded that high in two years. Last month, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were ignominiously tossed off the New York Stock Exchange because their share prices had languished below $1 for more than 30 days straight.And so the once-mighty Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been banished to OTC Bulletin Board, home to lowly penny stocks and thinly traded “microcap” companies. As the Securities and Exchange Commission says in its guide for investors: “Investors in penny stocks should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment.”The question of what to do with these troubled giants vexes policy makers and bankers alike. Together, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee roughly half of the nation’s $11 trillion home mortgage market. The new overhaul of financial regulation did nothing to address the companies, even though they played a central role in inflating the housing bubble.The Obama administration plans to hold a conference on the future of housing on Aug. 17 to seek advice about reforming the rules governing mortgage finance. The goal is to deliver a proposal to Congress by January.What that proposal will say is anyone’s guess. Fannie and Freddie’s harshest critics want the companies shut down. But even banking executives concede that, for now, the federal government will probably have to play some role in mortgage finance, given the industry’s dependence on Fannie and Freddie.“The fundamental problem with Fannie and Freddie is that no one really knows what to do with them,” said Bert Ely, a financial and monetary policy consultant based in Alexandria, Va., and a longtime critic of the companies. Until Washington comes up with answers, the day traders will no doubt try to ride the swings in Fannie Mae and pocket some more pennies while they still can.'"
"'10-08-05,'0','“We have to appreciate that it’s not a passive age group, sitting in front of the TV with ads blaring at them,” said Deborah Conrad, chief marketing officer at Intel, which started talking to Vice a couple of years ago. “We trust that Vice knows their audience.”So last year Intel decided to put its faith in the idea that Vice could produce events and populate a Web site with material that would appeal to that demographic.Intel is not alone in investing in content. In 2009, companies spent $47.2 billion on custom marketing — from magazines to Web sites — according to a survey conducted by the Custom Content Council, an industry group in New York, and ContentWise, a newsletter.“I think a lot of brands are realizing that they have to create content, and when they do it, it works,” said Gene Liebel, a partner in the Brooklyn agency Huge, which is not working with Vice or the two technology companies, though it has worked with Intel previously.The partnership between Intel and Vice includes the creation of a Web site, thecreatorsproject.com, which began in May. Earlier this year, the partnership also began producing events in five cities around the world — New York, London, São Paulo, Seoul and Beijing — that are one part concert, one part art exhibit, one part conference and many parts party, as the doors open in early afternoon and close after midnight. The Intel and Vice logos are present, but subdued. The drinks are free.Still, it’s the Web site, Ms. Conrad said, that’s really the “nerve center” for the partnership.The site says it is meant to “continually identify and celebrate the work of visionary artists.” Each week, it introduces a new short video — often around six minutes long — presenting a profile of one of those artists.Vice decides which artists to consider visionary, and then produces the video. One of them is the musician Alan Palomo, a composer for Neon Indian, a band that relies heavily on electronic sounds made with synthesizers and other technology and who performed at the New York event in late June.In a video on the Creators Project site, Mr. Palomo describes how video games from the 1980s influenced his music and how the band uses projectors at its concerts. And in an interview, he said that he found the Intel connection at the New York event “refreshing,” because it did not seem that the company was selling any product. “It’s like you’re expecting the usual suspects, like a Converse banner,” he said.The deal with Dell is similar. On motherboard.tv, a site that describes itself as devoted to “sniffing out the smartest, most groundbreaking arbiters and advances of tech-related culture,” Vice oversees the blog posts and videos. Dell’s logo is incorporated into the site’s logo, but the connection is otherwise out of sight.Artists and topics that can connect with a young demographic are valuable assets, said Ian Schafer, chief executive of Deep Focus, an ad agency that has worked with Vice in the past, but is not involved in the Dell or Intel deals. It’s a model, he said, that more media companies may need to consider.“With something as scarce as good and quality content, the price has upward pressure on it,” Mr. Schafer said. “It’s what prevents all of advertising from a race to the bottom.”Neither Vice, Intel nor Dell would discuss the financial terms of their deals.Ms. Conrad and Michael Tatelman, vice president for sales and marketing at Dell, said they knew there was an inherent risk in handing over the content oversight to Vice, whose magazine and Web site have a long history of running occasional nude images.These relationships do not always work out for the best. Last year, Microsoft teamed up with the television show “Family Guy” to promote the Windows 7 operating system. A special commercial-free show was to include references to the Windows 7. But Microsoft executives backed out of the show, reportedly after finding some of the topics distasteful.“We have values and norms that support our brand,” Mr. Tatelman said. “Vice has been great about staying within those brand tenets.”But at the same time, Ms. Conrad and Mr. Tatelman said the value of working with Vice was the ability to capitalize on the media company’s cachet with the chic crowd. They said that the two sides must find a middle ground that did not tarnish either Vice’s brand or theirs. So far, no interventions have been necessary.And walking that fine line has also allowed the companies to touch the trend-setters, a group usually out of their reach.“It’s so cool, when you think about it for us, to see how people are using technology,” Ms. Conrad said. “You can only get so excited about spreadsheets.”'"
"'10-08-05,'0','BERLIN — A German government agency warned citizens on Wednesday about two software vulnerabilities in Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS, which it said could be exploited to infect the company’s best-selling iPhone, iPad and iPod devices.The agency, the German Federal Office for Information Security, said its technical experts had confirmed the vulnerabilities in several versions of iOS, which could be exposed when Apple users visited infected Web sites or opened infected PDF documents. The agency, a branch of the German Interior Ministry, is charged with warning government employees and the public of software threats that could compromise private communications.Apple acknowledged the security flaw and said a fix would be forthcoming.“We are aware of the reported issue,” said Natalie Harrison, a spokeswoman for the company. “We have already developed a fix and it will be available to customers in an upcoming software update.” She declined to say whether the security flaw had been exploited by hackers.Katrin Alberts, a spokeswoman for the German agency, said its technical experts had investigated the security of the iOS system after a computer hacker using the name Comex disclosed the weaknesses over the weekend in several online forums and on Twitter. Comex belongs to a group that is apparently developing ways to open Apple’s proprietary operating system to software that has not been approved by the company.“Our internal experts confirmed these weaknesses,” Ms. Alberts said. “That is why we put out the advisory today.”'"
"'10-08-05,'0','The company accepted all the terms of the settlement without admitting that it had committed any anticompetitive acts.The trade commission brought its suit in December, claiming that Intel, the world’s leading maker of computer chips, had illegally used its dominant market position for at least a decade to stifle competition and strengthen its monopoly.The agency has no legal authority to assess fines, although it can bring a civil suit for violations of its settlement order. The settlement requires Intel to establish a $10 million fund to help business customers reformulate their software products if they were misled by Intel.Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the F.T.C., said that the settlement “provides ‘fencing-in’ protection to ensure that Intel doesn’t come up with new ways to undermine competition.”“Just as important, it provides this relief right away, so it helps consumers now, which is critical in a dynamic industry such as this one,” Mr. Leibowitz said.The commission will seek public comment before the settlement is completed.In a statement, Intel’s general counsel, A. Douglas Melamed, said the settlement allowed the company “to put an end to the expense and distraction of the F.T.C. litigation.”“This agreement provides a framework that will allow us to continue to compete and to provide our customers the best possible products at the best prices,” Mr. Melamed said.The agency brought its claims under Section 5 of the F.T.C. Act, a law that is broader than the antitrust laws and that affords Intel a measure of protection against private lawsuits that could subject it to stiff financial penalties.Unlike an antitrust violation, a violation of Section 5 may not be used to establish liability for plaintiffs to seek triple damages in private litigation against the same defendant.Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main rival, settled its own antitrust complaint against Intel in November with Intel agreeing to pay $1.25 billion.Harry Wolin, general counsel at A.M.D., said the company was pleased with the Intel settlement, which should help to level the playing field. “A.M.D.’s critical remaining concern was Intel’s use of all-or-nothing discounts to deny competitors access to the marketplace,” Mr. Wolin said. “The F.T.C.’s order clearly and firmly prohibits such abuse and guarantees ongoing monitoring of Intel’s conduct.”New York State still has litigation pending against Intel.Intel has spent years squaring off against regulators in Asia, Europe and the United States over charges related to anticompetitive practices. Last May, the European Commission fined Intel a record $1.45 billion, concluding that it had hampered competition in the market for PC and computer server chips.Most of the previous actions against Intel focused on claims that it had used rebates and other payment programs to keep computer makers and retailers from selling products with A.M.D. chips.From about 2003 to 2006, A.M.D. offered a line of chips that analysts and many computer makers hailed as superior to Intel’s products. Executives from A.M.D. contended that Intel blunted the adoption of these chips through its financial arrangements.The F.T.C.’s complaint trod familiar ground but also raised questions about Intel’s behavior in the graphics chip market, which is dominated by Nvidia and A.M.D. Since the agency filed its complaints, Intel has tempered an effort to enter the market for stand-alone graphics chips that go into home and business computers. Instead, Intel has declared its intention to focus on competing against Nvidia and A.M.D. through a niche chip made to handle scientific and industrial applications.The legal actions against Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., have brought to light many unflattering e-mails exchanged between its top executives and customers.In particular, communications between Intel and Dell have shown executives talking about rebates bestowed on Dell for its decision to abstain from using A.M.D. products. In one such exchange, Paul S. Otellini, the chief executive at Intel, described Dell as “the best friend money can buy.”Last month, Dell paid $100 million to settle accounting fraud charges leveled by the Securities and Exchange Commission tied to the rebates it received from Intel.Intel has recovered well from a severe drop in sales during the heart of the recession and has posted record results in recent quarters. A.M.D. has spent the last couple of years trying to restructure its business and improve its financial performance. The company withdrew from the expensive chip manufacturing business and now concentrates on designing chips.'"

"'10-08-06,'0','The Bush administration cut off money, saying the costs were too high. But President Obama included $1 billion in last year’s stimulus bill. Now that there is money in hand, his administration opted to support a more advanced technology that some officials described on Thursday as FutureGen 2.Although the planned retrofit involves an old oil-burning plant, the new approach could be a way of converting dozens of big old coal plants around the country, said Matt Rogers, a senior adviser to the energy secretary, Steven Chu. If successful, Mr. Rogers said, this would allow the coal industry “to remain competitive on a global basis.”With new Environmental Protection Agency rules scheduled to take effect limiting power plants’ emissions of conventional pollutants like nitrogen oxides, mercury and particulates, he said, many older coal plants are candidates for re-powering.Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who has been a strong supporter of the Mattoon project, said in a conference call that the gasification strategy no longer made sense because it was no longer the best or newest option. “That happens when you wait six years,” he said.The largest plant for burning oxygen is 10 megawatts; the plant in Meredosia would be 200 megawatts and the first of a commercial scale, officials involved in the project said.Under the new structure, the original FutureGen coalition would still manage the sequestration portion of the project and would arrange experiments with different types of coals to gain experience that could be useful around the world.The oil-fired plant belongs to Ameren, which is based in St. Louis. It has not run much in recent years and has not generated any power since 2009, said a spokeswoman, Susan Gallagher. The plant operates in the competitive Illinois market, and any profit or loss would fall to Ameren shareholders and not its customers, she said.Some of the oxygen will be supplied by the French energy company Air Liquide, which relies on a conventional technology, chilling the air until the oxygen turns to a liquid at 297 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The energy required to accomplish that has always been considered a drawback to the technology.Mr. Rogers said the project would also test a membrane that could sort oxygen from nitrogen without consuming much energy. And a plant burning oxygen would not need to use much energy to clean up other pollutants, like nitrogen oxides, which cause smog, and mercury, he said.Babcock & Wilcox will do the engineering. The project is expected to capture 90 percent of the carbon dioxide, or 1.3 million tons a year.Two other efforts to capture carbon dioxide from coal burning are under way. Duke Energy is building a coal-fired plant in Edwardsport, Ind., that will cook coal into a gas that is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Tentative plans call for it to be outfitted with equipment that sorts out the carbon dioxide and burns the hydrogen, although there is no firm commitment yet to do that.And American Electric Power is testing a system at its Mountaineer plant, on the Ohio River in New Haven, W.Va., that uses ammonia to scrub the carbon dioxide out of gas in the smokestack.The government recently gave a $417 million tax credit to another coal project in Illinois, the Taylorville Energy Center, in exchange for a promise to capture 65 percent of its carbon. That plant would turn coal to natural gas and then burn the natural gas.Global warming experts say that coal is certain to be burned around the world for decades, and that limiting carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere will depend in part on finding inexpensive ways to capture the emissions from coal-fired plants.Yet the United States has been off to a slow start in the field. An alternative is switching to natural gas, which has about half as much carbon as coal per unit of energy. But that would be inadequate to reach the goal espoused by President Obama, a reduction of 80 percent in emissions by 2050.'"
"'10-08-06,'0','Outside a padlocked warehouse on Airport Boulevard in South San Francisco, a row of parked trucks bearing the slogan “Quong Hop & Co. quality soy foods since 1906” sit idle.The company, which is among the largest tofu makers in California, stopped production last month when inspectors found the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes lurking in the factory and food made there, prompting a recall.“Everything that was at the facility at the time of the investigation is under embargo,” said Patrick Kennelly of the California Department of Public Health.Quong Hop officials did not respond to requests for comment.This is not the first time Quong Hop has faced a recall due to listeria, and its problems with the deadly bacteria are putting the 100-year-old company’s future at risk.Quong Hop was once a family-owned company that helped popularize tofu beyond Asian-American markets, starting in the late 1970s, said William Shurtleff, co-author of “The Book of Tofu.”'"
"'10-08-06,'0','But the search of the high-rise Manhattan apartment of Anna Chapman, the best known of the Russian agents, who gained notoriety as tabloid newspapers chronicled her romantic life and published pictures of her in skimpy attire, revealed nothing obvious of the secret life she led.Of course, the authorities have said that searches of other Russian agents’ homes have turned up computer drives with incriminating evidence, like drafts of electronic messages for the Russian intelligence agency.Ms. Chapman ran an online real estate business from her two-bedroom apartment at 20 Exchange Place in the financial district. In its search, the F.B.I. seized a TI-82 calculator, keys, a credit card, bank statements, thumb drives and laptops. One listing says, “Books — Russian and English.” But of course Ms. Chapman, who used her real name, did not hide the fact that she was Russian.Her lawyer, Robert M. Baum, said Thursday that if the laptops were searched “long enough, you might have some happy F.B.I. agents who find good buys in rental apartments in Manhattan.”The search of the two-story house at 17 Clifton Avenue in Yonkers where Mr. Vasenkov and Ms. Peláez lived offered some tantalizing hints at the lives being led there. There were hundreds of prosaic items listed in the F.B.I. documents: a digital camera, a karaoke system, a portable CD player. The medicine cabinets seem to have been emptied, too, with lists of cold remedies and other drugs, and a package labeled “fat burner pills.”There was also an article on the renegade C.I.A. officer Philip Agee; a transcript of a United States Senate hearing on aid to Russia; a paperback book “with the F.B.I. emblem in a foreign language,” as the document described it. Also listed were articles about United States troops and Guatemala; another on oil and Ecuador; a work by “Juan Lázaro.”John M. Rodriguez, Ms. Peláez’s lawyer, said the search turned up nothing that surprised him. And Robert J.

"'10-08-06,'0','PHOENIX — It was not a needle in a haystack but a toddler in the desert, both of which are extremely challenging to find.When sheriff’s deputies in Arizona’s rugged Yavapai County finally picked up the tiny footprints of 2-year-old Emmett Trapp on Wednesday morning after a 40-hour search, it was too late. The boy had already succumbed to the elements.The search for Emmett had been intensive — using bloodhounds, a helicopter equipped with an infrared sensor and scores of rescue workers from a variety of agencies and organizations on foot, horseback and all-terrain vehicles. Still, some local residents were complaining Thursday that every last volunteer had not been included in the hunt.“They followed the procedures as best they could, but so many people, me included, wanted to put on boots and get out there,” said Len Marinaccio, the mayor of Dewey-Humboldt, who has a son about Emmett’s age. “I could have walked down the center of town and said ‘We’re forming a search party,’ and people would have followed me like the Pied Piper. We would have had hundreds.”Dwight D’Evelyn, a spokesman for the sheriff’s department, said official searchers had undergone training on what to look for and how not to spoil evidence. Allowing untrained citizens to track Emmett would also have exposed the county to legal liability if anyone had been hurt, he said.Wearing a diaper and a dinosaur-print pajama top, Emmett is believed to have trekked more than three miles in his bare feet, the authorities said, before ending up about a mile from the rural home where on Monday night he wandered off from his mother, who was napping, and his three siblings.'"
"'10-08-06,'0','Beazer Homes USA posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday as price cuts pinched profits, sending its shares down 3 percent.Beazer said its loss narrowed slightly, to $27.8 million, or 41 cents a share, from $28.0 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier, when there was less outstanding stock.Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 25 cents a share.Revenue in the period, which ended June 30 and was the third quarter of Beazer’s fiscal year, rose 52 percent, to $339.9 million from $224.1 million, helped by a surge in purchases by first-time home buyers taking advantage of a federal tax credit. Beazer’s results followed the pattern established by other builders: a sales surge followed by a pronounced decline in traffic and orders after the tax credit expired.“The expiration of the federal tax credit, sustained high unemployment levels and the overhang of foreclosures make it very difficult to predict when and to what extent the housing market will recover,” the chief executive, Ian J. McCarthy, said in a conference call with industry analysts.Prices fell 12.3 percent year-over-year, the company said in its conference call.Orders fell 32.5 percent, to 1,037 homes. Orders are a leading indicator for builders, which do not book revenue from a sale until they deliver the home.'"

"'10-08-06,'0','CHICAGO — Speculation over how long it will take jurors to decide the fate of Rod R. Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois, has reached the point where one blogger here wondered publicly what a juror’s new choice of casual attire (khaki shorts) might signal about how much longer they would deliberate.Shorts and all, the private deliberations went on Thursday, as they have every weekday since Mr. Blagojevich’s federal corruption trial ended July 28. The jurors have asked few questions of the judge — they were denied their wish to be given a transcript of the entire trial — and their silence has left people here wondering what it all means. Are they deadlocked?Lawyers seemed less mystified. Lengthy deliberations are common, they said, in complicated cases like this one, which has two defendants (Mr. Blagojevich’s brother is also charged) and 24 criminal counts, including racketeering and attempted extortion. The form jurors are required to fill out when they reach a verdict has more categories than most election ballots.“If they are conscientious about it, it’s time consuming,” said Ronald S. Safer, a former federal prosecutor. “They’re just being thorough.”There is precedent for such a wait around here. In the 2006 trial of George Ryan, the last former governor of Illinois, it took a jury 10 days to convict Mr. Ryan in his corruption case.'"
"'10-08-06,'0','Ryan and Greenberg are expected to be approved by owners next Thursday, the day commitments for their financing are due to expire. They are buying the team from Thomas O. Hicks, whose sports company defaulted on $525 million in debt in March 2009 and who signed a contract earlier this year to sell the Rangers to Ryan and Greenberg.Bob DuPuy, the president and chief operating officer of Major League Baseball, said he had no regrets about staunchly supporting Ryan and Greenberg — even facing down angry lenders who believed that other, higher bids were available.“Tom selected Greenberg and Ryan,” DuPuy said Thursday by telephone, referring to Hicks. He said that Commissioner Bud Selig “has great respect for the job Nolan has done in operating the Rangers, and the commissioner and clubs are very pleased with the investors they have assembled.”Greenberg, as gregarious as Ryan is laconic, is known to owners through his minor league experience and his work in helping to negotiate the hockey star Mario Lemieux’s purchase of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1999.“The sooner we got stable ownership, the better it was for the Rangers,” DuPuy said. Baseball had provided up to $40 million in loans to the team, which has used only a little more than half of it, DuPuy said. “They’re generating some significant revenue,” he added. The Rangers have to repay the loans from M.L.B. with interest.The Rangers filed for Chapter 11 protection on May 24, expecting that it would help speed the sale of the team to Greenberg and Ryan. Instead, it seemed to slow the process and led the judge D. Michael Lynn to order the auction that endangered Greenberg and Ryan’s preferred status if Cuban and Crane had been more aggressive.It also led Greenberg and Ryan to pay more than they had planned; they originally agreed to pay $575 million, which included about $70 million in real estate. That part of the original deal was taken out of the final agreement.DuPuy, who is usually in the middle of nettlesome franchise sales, said: “Do I wish this had been resolved in January? Of course. Did I try to broker a solution and mediate, and do I wish I’d been successful? Obviously.”His next assignment may be dealing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, whose owners, Frank and Jamie McCourt, are in the middle of a fractious divorce. If their divorce trial judge agrees with Jamie McCourt that the heavily leveraged team is marital property, Frank McCourt may have to sell the team to buy out her interest. DuPuy would not comment on the dispute.'"
"'10-08-06,'0','Less well known but also popular are the beautiful red clay courts in Riverside Park at 96th Street. The 10 courts went from 8,000 player signups in 1992 to 30,000 in recent years, said Mark McIntyre, executive director of the tennis association there. Because of the soft crushed-brick surface, scenic views overlooking the Hudson, family atmosphere and Saturday evening concerts, he added, “be prepared to wait your turn.”Instead, the cost-conscious should head downtown. The three individually fenced hard courts in Hudson River Park are flanked by the bustling highway and tranquil river. Players do have to wait on an aluminum bench until a court opens up, but there’s a reason downtown residents flock there, and it’s not just the proximity, river views and lights for matches that can run until midnight.The courts are free. Not parks-permit free — free free.With no tennis association, staff or sign-up sheet, however, players are on their own when it comes to policing the line and the one-hour court time limit. Mylah Barreto, 37, plays there most evenings after work. She admits that she has hit balls onto the highway and into the river, and added, “I’m putting off getting a permit until I really need to.”Another unique option downtown is the Washington Market Park’s single hard court, nestled between Chambers Street and the Borough of Manhattan Community College in TriBeCa. It approaches the intimacy of a backyard court — you never have to fetch balls for strangers. Though permits are required, and time slots fill up fast, this neighborhood secret remains unlisted on the city parks Web site, .Kerry Snow and Michael Greene, both 25, celebrated their first wedding anniversary there with a set of tennis this summer. Ms. Snow, who played for , signed up at 6:15 a.m. to play at 11. By noon that Sunday, the court had been booked through 8 p.m.Two spots in or near offer the best of both convenience and community: Octagon on Roosevelt Island and Frederick Johnson Park in .Regulars at the Roosevelt Island public courts, at the foot of the Octagon tower, a historically preserved remnant of one of the city’s first mental , know a good thing when they see it. And they’re less than eager to share it with the rest of the city.“It’s kind of a well-kept secret,” said Donna Masly, a program manager for the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, the state agency that manages the island. The number of permit holders has grown in the past four years, as the number of residents has increased, and Ms. Masly estimates that 550 permits will be sold this season, a 10 percent increase over 2009.While there’s still room to grow, Ms. Masly said caution was called for. “We don’t want to overpromote them so people can’t play,” she said. “It’s a delicate balance.”The six rubberized hard courts play fast and are not that forgiving, but they are easily accessible from Manhattan and require little or no wait, even on weekend afternoons.The catch? Because the small East River island is leased by the state, city permits are no good there. The corporation issues its own $100 cards that open the gate.Mike Kolba has lived on the island since 1985 and became president of the Roosevelt Island Tennis Association in 2003. He carries a folder of rules and regulations and coordinates round-robin doubles matches on Saturday mornings to help members connect.“It’s not particularly competitive,” he said, “but people are happy to play a friendly set or two.”Ranjit Thomas moved to Roosevelt Island in 1999, discovering the courts, and tennis, in 2001. He now lives in Midtown but continues to buy the island pass instead of the city permit.He said he knew 20 association members by name and liked showing up on a Saturday without a partner to play for two hours. “New York is a good summer tennis city,” he added.The four hard and four rubberized courts in Harlem, affectionately known as the Jungle, were once a mecca for top African-American players. Frederick Johnson, the park’s namesake, went pro nearly a century ago, despite losing his left arm as a child, and later coached the great there.Cathy Manning, a refugee-resettlement case manager, called the courts, on Boulevard at West 151st Street, “my summer home away from home.”“I’m not that good, but I’m very enthusiastic,” said Ms. Manning, who considers herself a newcomer despite playing there 20 years.Sam Penceal arrived at the Jungle in the 1970s. Last fall he organized the David Dinkins Tennis Club, whose 50 members are putting bodies on courts that were often empty a year ago. On a muggy Sunday afternoon, he presided over one of the club’s picnics, which included mac and cheese, deviled eggs, leftover David Dinkins birthday cake and Marva York’s delicious apple pie.Some members come from , , and . Russell Goings, a football player turned entrepreneur turned poet, no longer plays tennis, but he still comes to the courts for inspiration: “This is one of the crown jewels” of the area, he said.Tennis in New York is not always easy.

"'10-08-06,'0','Though it feels like a cultural violation to talk about any television shown in contest with “Mad Men,” our national homage to past depravities, it is merely one of two series about a good-looking divorced white man in conflict with his virility that is offered on Sunday nights at 10. The other series is “Hung,” a comedy that, although it has not given birth to a single trend, expression or style of tie, has distinguished itself as the most topical fictional programming on television. As it’s moved into its second season on HBO, “Hung” has become an even more finely drawn satire of the Great Recession.Notionally a sex farce, “Hung” is substantively a continuing commentary on the humiliations of middle-class life during a downturn in which the spending of the still well-to-do strikes many as a kind of aggravated assault.“Hung” is predicated on a conceptual gag — Ray Drecker, a 40-ish high-school teacher, coach and father of two, supplements his burdened cash flow by providing sexual companionship to women who are bored, lonely, crazy or recovering from frigidity. But the most evocative recurring joke is visual, the shot of Ray’s lakeside bungalow, a casualty of fire, overwhelmed by the towering McMansion next door that is occupied by a saucy woman to whom Ray is providing his gifts gratis.The setting is the world in and around Detroit, that graveyard to the high days of American manufacturing. Ray (played appealingly by Thomas Jane) is the embodiment of the service economy that followed, but never quite provided an analogous glamour. Although he possesses the physical attributes that should make him a winner in his chosen vocation, Ray lacks the drive to bring in the big money. He ambles along — at one point literally, as we watch him run out of gas and push his battered Jeep Cherokee down the road toward his day job where, symbolically, he is emasculated even further, tending to the young.To have situated Ray in middle management, even at an ailing Ford or General Motors, would have suggested a kind of ambition that has never compelled him. He speaks with the monotone intonations of someone lacking expectations, and “Hung” commits itself to the idea that high school isn’t the kind of place for a real adult man who might have any.'"
"'10-08-06,'0','“I’d say at this point the data and the sentiment in the marketplace have certainly gone more Jan’s way than mine,” Mr. Berner said. Some people, he added, “think I’m out of my mind. But I have a conviction in my beliefs that’s based on my analysis.”Mr. Hatzius, a 41-year-old native of Germany who was 3 when Mr. Berner started out as an economist, is more restrained. He can afford to be, having snagged the top spot in a recent ranking of Wall Street economists as well as an award from Arizona State University honoring his “uncanny economic forecasting that anticipated the global financial crisis.”On Wall Street, both men were among a very small group that accurately predicted the recent recession. Mr. Berner’s long résumé includes stints at the Federal Reserve in Washington and Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. “I’ve seen plenty of ups and downs,” said Mr. Berner, 64, sitting in a corner office overlooking the Manhattan skyline at Morgan Stanley’s Midtown headquarters.Showing not even a hint of doubt, Mr. Hatzius said, “The prospect of substantial inflation seems very remote, but the prospect for deflation is far from remote. A double dip is certainly possible but not likely.”Mr. Berner does not expect substantial inflation, but he is predicting inflation will run 1 to 2 percent annually rather than the near-zero level Mr. Hatzius sees by the end of next year.“There is still a one in 10 chance of deflation,” Mr. Berner calculates. “But we already have been much more aggressive and proactive in dealing with the problem than Japan was,” he said, referring to the Federal Reserve’s decision to quickly cut rates and aggressively buy government securities.The split between the chief economists, whose work helps inform trading strategies recommended to investors by their firms, echoes a broader and sometimes fiercer debate among academic economists and commentators about the threat posed by deflation and what the government’s response should be.According to the deflationistas, as they are nicknamed, a new round of stimulus spending by Washington is urgently required to stave off a Depression-like cycle of falling prices and wages that is difficult to reverse once it is set in motion.Inflationistas, by contrast, worry more about the effect that additional government borrowing could have on the recovery. With the budget deficit expected to hover around $1 trillion a year for the next decade, they say, interest rates could eventually surge, making borrowing — and goods — more expensive. A double dip, they say, is highly unlikely.Mr. Hatzius’s gloomy outlook is owed centrally to Americans’ slowdown in spending. Recent data suggest that consumers are using any extra cash they have to pay down debt or put into savings. That places a strain on an American economy that has become hugely dependent on consumer spending.On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that Americans saved 6.4 percent of their after-tax income in June, in contrast to the years before the recession, when savings rates stood at 1 to 2 percent.Last month, the Federal Reserve reported that consumer debt dropped by 4.5 percent in May, a $9 billion decline. It was the 20th consecutive month that figure has dropped. In 2007, consumer debt jumped by 5.7 percent, or nearly $40 billion.“We had a housing and credit boom that was unsustainable, and now this boom has turned into a bust,” Mr. Hatzius said. “There was too much debt, and the deleveraging process has still got a ways to go. It’s going to keep private demand weak.”Another big factor is the amount of slack in the economy. According to a recent report by Nomura, “The U.S. economy continues to operate with a staggering amount of spare capacity — unemployed workers, idle trucks and factories, etc.”Mr. Hatzius agrees, adding that all this extra capacity will restrict the ability of companies to raise prices, thus raising the risk of deflation. “It’s plain to see there’s a ton of slack in the economy,” he said. “We’re not managing to generate enough demand to absorb all these productive resources in the economy.”Mr. Berner is also studying the role that slack and deleveraging are playing, but he draws very different conclusions from Mr. Hatzius. Excess capacity is being reduced more quickly than Mr. Hatzius believes, Mr. Berner said. That will help businesses raise prices and improve profits, thus heading off the threat of deflation.What is more, Mr. Berner argues that the deleveraging process is much further along than Mr. Hatzius contends, which will encourage consumers to start spending again. He expects economic growth in the second half of 2010 to run at more than 3 percent, roughly twice the 1.5 percent rate Mr. Hatzius projects.If Mr. Hatzius is right, unemployment will still stand at 9.7 percent at the end of next year, slightly higher than it is now. Mr. Berner says he believes unemployment should sink to 8.7 percent by then. As for Friday’s numbers, Mr. Berner is calling for a private sector gain of 145,000 jobs versus Mr. Hatzius’s prediction of 75,000 new jobs.Either way, both predict unemployment will remain at uncomfortably high levels for several years.One answer, Mr. Hatzius says, is another round of stimulus spending by Washington to fend off the deflation risk he worries about.Mr. Berner was skeptical of the stimulus bill passed in 2009, and he still “doubts that traditional fiscal stimulus is the right tool for the job.”Instead, he and his colleague Mr. Greenlaw argue for new mortgage rules that would reduce foreclosures and steady the housing market, payroll tax credits to encourage hiring and a new job training corps for unemployed workers.“Friday’s number is just one tile in a mosaic,” Mr. Berner said. “From time to time, it’ll be like I’m winning, from time to time Jan will be winning.”“The truth is that it’s just a crummy moderate recovery,” Mr. Berner added, hedging his bets. “We’ll both testify to that.”'"
"'10-08-06,'0','Ms. Archer and Ms. Orange, who began their tours in 2008, will expose Harlem’s hidden artistic gems on Saturday and Sunday with trolley-bus tours to seven stops, where gallery owners and artists will talk about, and create, their work. The tours end with a meal on the roof deck atop Rio II galleries.One stop that exemplifies the gulf between the Harlem of old and new is Casa Frela, a gallery whose nervy exhibitions sit in an airy Stanford White brownstone.In the 1990s and ’00s, “people used to talk about a new Harlem Renaissance, but that was really a real estate renaissance,” said Lawrence Rodriguez, Casa Frela’s director, who bought the space six years ago. The true renaissance begat a thriving scene whose artistic descendants still live and work in Harlem, he said, making it a multigenerational aesthetic haven unlike newer art enclaves in Williamsburg or Dumbo. “The old guard led the way for my generation,” he said.Among the artists who defined the years between the renaissance and today’s gallery owners is the Weusi Collective, which was at the core of the black arts movement of the 1960s and ’70s. The work of that still-active collective is documented at another stop on the tour, the Dwyer Cultural Center. In a video accompanying an exhibition of the Weusi’s paintings, woodcuts and sculpture, Ademola Olugebefola, a member of the collective, says, “We set out to beautify the black woman, to regalize the black man.” Other members emphasize that theme, referring to themselves as “cultural warriors.”Another stop suggests that the culture war has been fought and the victory decided: the Studio Museum in Harlem, in a gleaming building with three floors of exhibition space that is a far cry from the rented loft where the museum got its start in 1968. The main galleries feature photographs by Zwelethu Mthethwa, a South African. He is among the international figures on the ArtCrawl roster, which includes artists from the Dominican Republic, Japan and, well, Westchester. The tour suggests far more than the cradle of black culture that it first connotes.That Harlem still draws a range of talent is notable, Ms. Orange said. “It is testimony to the fact that Harlem is still here, and we’re still the trendsetter.”WHERE THE ART ISWHEN From noon to 5:30 p.m. on Saturday or 1 to 6:30 p.m. on Sunday; includes after-tour reception.STOPS include Casa Frela, 47 West 119th Street; Dwyer Cultural Center, 258 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 123rd Street; Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street; and Rio II, 583 Riverside Drive, at 135th Street, among others.TICKETS $55 at (212) 866-7427, artcrawlharlem.com; the code “artcol” can be used to order $40 tickets online.'"
"'10-08-06,'0','While the buyers are often paying less than the previous owners did, tenant advocates maintain that some of the prices are still too high for the amount of rental income the buildings generate and the repairs they need.So the new owners, the advocates say, have already revived old tactics of tenant harassment, including bringing trumped-up lawsuits against tenants in rent-regulated apartments, hoping to evict them and then raise the rents under the state’s so-called vacancy decontrol rules.One landlord, Meyer Orbach, paid $70 million in June 2008 for 13 buildings with 250 apartments on West 49th Street; about half of the apartments were rent regulated. Last year, he bought 22 buildings with 384 apartments on West 109th Street.The latter portfolio cost $45 million, or about 60 percent of what was owed by the previous owners, the Pinnacle and the Praedium Group, which had begun eviction proceedings against 5,000 of the 21,000 tenants it had in New York City. Mr. Orbach’s strategy, many tenants say, is no different. He has filed dozens of cases against tenants in housing court, and some tenants complain that private investigators posing as repairmen have been poking around their apartments.Rosa Hernandez, 71, said she and her husband have lived in their two-bedroom fifth-floor apartment at 204 West 109th Street for 32 years. They raised four children in the apartment, where they pay $563 a month in rent. Mr. Orbach’s lawyers say in court papers that she now lives in her native country, Ecuador, and in Florida, where some of her children now live; she denies the claim.Bennett Baumer, a tenant organizer at Housing Conservation Coordinators who is working with tenants on 49th Street, said of Mr. Orbach, “He’s part of a second wave of predatory investors using vacancy decontrol to evict tenants and jack up rents at the expense of affordable housing.”Mr. Orbach’s lawyer, Ken Fisher, rejected that notion, calling Mr. Orbach a “small potatoes” investor, not a Wall Street speculator. He said Mr. Orbach was merely trying to get rid of tenants who had no right to rent-regulated apartments, because they were illegally subletting or had a primary residence elsewhere.“It is an unfortunate fact,” Mr. Fisher said, “that tenants in New York sometimes resort to illegal tactics in order to hold on to rent-regulated apartments.”One tenant currently in court with Mr. Orbach is Felipe Fernandez, who said he has lived in his family’s four-bedroom apartment on West 109th Street since 1974. His parents have since left the neighborhood but he remains, the sole occupant, with an $800-a-month rent. Given the apartment’s four bedrooms, it is easy to see why a landlord would want to remove him. But, Mr. Fernandez said, that does not give Mr. Orbach the right to toss him out of his home.“I grew up around here,” said Mr. Fernandez, 50. “I know the neighborhood and everybody knows me. My daughter went to the school down the street.”Mr. Orbach’s lawyer said his firm’s investigation had indicated that Mr. Fernandez lived somewhere else most of the time; Mr. Fernandez denied that.City officials said they were keeping an eye on Mr. Orbach’s buildings.Although he initially rebuffed their efforts, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, credited Mr. Orbach for evicting an illegal hotel that had been operating in one of his buildings. But, she said, “I still have concerns about whether there is or was harassment going on.”The downturn in the housing market foiled many plans to gentrify buildings in far-flung neighborhoods. Many new landlords were stuck paying mortgages that the buildings’ rent rolls could not support, and some walked away from the buildings, while tenants languished in apartments badly in need of maintenance.“The real culprits,” said Dina Levy of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a tenant advocacy group, “are the banks who, eyes wide open, overleveraged these buildings when they should have known better.”But there is still interest among investors for rent-regulated buildings, said Robert A. Knakal, a principal at Massey Knakal, the real estate broker that sold Mr. Orbach the 109th Street buildings. “The artificially low rents lead to a lot of upside,” he said. “If they’re paying below-market rents, it’s a positive thing if the tenant leaves.”Many tenants in rent-regulated apartments, he said, are “abusing the system.” Legitimate tenants, he said, have nothing to worry about because they cannot be legally displaced.Tenant advocates have had some success. Last year, the city helped broker a deal that allowed the former baseball star Mo Vaughn and his real estate company, the Omni Group, which has had success turning around neglected properties, to take over and begin to fix 14 of the city’s most troubled buildings that had been owned by the Ocelot Capital Group.But rather than serve as a model, the Omni deal has started to look like an exception. City officials have so far not had success replicating the arrangement.One real estate manager, Sam Suzuki, represented a group that bought six other Ocelot buildings in May 2009, raising hopes that conditions would improve. They did not. The number of violations grew under Mr. Suzuki’s watch, and the tenant group of a building at 1585 East 172nd Street filed suit against him.Mr. Suzuki failed to correct violations, show up in court or reveal the names of the owners of the properties, and this summer he served three weeks in jail for civil contempt, a rare penalty in housing court.Mr. Suzuki, in an interview on Thursday, blamed the buildings’ problems on tenants who failed to pay the rent. “There has to be a balance with the landlord and the tenant,” he said. “The tenants have to pay the rent.”A real estate investment company, the Bluestone Group, bought the debt on Mr. Suzuki’s buildings from Dime Savings Bank, making it, in effect, the third time the troubled housing stock changed hands.Eli Tabak, a principal in the company, said the deal was in line with Bluestone’s business model, which he said involved “buying distressed debt at a discount, turning the asset around and turning it into a cash-flowing proposition.”Ten buildings owned by Milbank Real Estate, a Los Angeles company, went into foreclosure last year — and showed up on the eBay classifieds with the name of a Yonkers real estate company on March 30.Housing advocates said these listings on eBay, where sellers may list items but do not put them up for auction, represented a new low, signaling levels of desperation that spelled only more pain for the tenants. The buildings that were owned by Milbank have 547 apartments and more than 3,200 housing code violations.Milbank did not return calls for comment. A new buyer is currently negotiating to take over the portfolio, said Jen Brown, a spokeswoman for LNR Property, the special servicer handling the troubled loan. LNR has declined to disclose the name of the buyer, drawing concerns from Ms. Quinn, whose office has reviewed the portfolio’s finances and fears the new owners are ill-prepared to repair and maintain the buildings.Ms. Quinn took part in a rally on Tuesday in front of one of the Bronx buildings calling for more transparency and accountability.“We believe that this sale is just going to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic,” Ms. Quinn said in an interview. “I’m very concerned that this is déjà vu all over again.”'"
"'10-08-06,'0','“The traders used the claim numbers to sell down this morning on the open,” Mr. Paulsen said. “But the reality is the whisper number on Wall Street for the payroll is it’s going to be higher than the mean expectations.”Analysts projected the unemployment rate to climb to 9.6 percent from 9.5 percent. According to a median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, the economy generated 90,000 private jobs in July.The Dow Jones industrial average was down 5.45 points, or 0.05 percent, at 10,674.98. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 1.43 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,125.81, while the Nasdaq composite index was down 10.51 points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,293.06.The jobs and retail sales reports Thursday were the latest economic data providing mixed signals. A report early this week showed that consumer spending, a crucial driver in a recovery, was slowing.On Wednesday, reports about employment and the nonmanufacturing sector showed a slightly brighter view of the economy. Stocks closed higher.Corporate results released over the last few weeks both fell below expectations and exceeded them. The nervousness was likely to continue through the release of the unemployment report.“The market doesn’t know which part of the economic side to listen to,” said Brett Hammond, the chief investment strategist for TIAA-CREF Asset Management. “There just isn’t any clear direction.”Technology, financials, consumer staples and health care stocks were slightly lower on Thursday.Bank of America was down 17 cents at $14.02. Citigroup shed 4 cents, to $4.10. Microsoft lost 36 cents, to $25.37 and Pfizer fell 25 cents, to $16.19. “I think that this is part of the general nervousness that has been endemic in this market for quite some time,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist for private wealth management at JPMorgan, remarking on the early market movements.“This is a market that goes from hot to cold,” Mr. Chan said. “It doesn’t take much to swing us in either direction.”Investors fled to less risky assets on Thursday.Treasury bills benefited from fears that the jobs figure would be another “nail in the coffin for the economy,” Tom di Galoma, head of United States rates trading at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a research note.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 105 1/32 and the yield fell to 2.90 percent from 2.95 percent late Wednesday.Apart from the impact of the unemployment claims report, the market cast about for direction after absorbing news that the European Central Bank and the Bank of England had kept monetary policies unchanged, and that Greece’s international lenders had given it a good progress report.Shares were mixed in Europe. In London, the FTSE 100 index declined 20.38 points, or 0.38 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt rose 2.25 points. The CAC 40 in Paris was 3.47 points higher.'"

"'10-08-07,'0','The report called into question the future of harness racing in the state and, by extension, its most important race.“It’s obviously a situation that is a concern,” Tom Charters, the executive director of the Hambletonian Society, which manages the race, said in an interview last week. “But we have a two-year contract going forward and I fully expect it to be honored.”Charters said he would like to see the Hambletonian remain at the Meadowlands, and he anticipates the contract will be extended past 2012. He said he has not talked to other tracks about moving the race.The Hambletonian has become strongly identified with the Meadowlands, its home since 1981, but it was previously held for more than two decades in both DuQuoin, Ill., and Goshen, N.Y. The race is the property of the Hambletonian Society, a nonprofit organization created in 1925 to sponsor the race.Restricted to 3-year-old trotters (the other gait in harness racing is pacers), the Hambletonian has been the sport’s richest race since its inaugural running in 1926 at the New York State Fair in Syracuse. It has been a mainstay on national television since relocating to the Meadowlands. As with the Kentucky Derby, its winners are christened million-dollar stallion prospects.Track officials expect a crowd of 30,000 on Saturday, and in recent years approximately $8 million has been wagered on Hambletonian Day. In 2009, nearly a quarter of those bets came from simulcasts in France and Scandinavia, where trotting is extremely popular.“It’s like winning the Super Bowl in football, the Stanley Cup in hockey,” said Jimmy Takter, the Swedish-born trainer who won the 1997 Hambletonian with Malabar Man. “It’s the race that has the biggest impact in the world in harness racing.”When the Meadowlands opened in 1976, Gov. Brendan Byrne sought to bring the Hambletonian there. Alongside the prestigious race, the Meadowlands became the premier site for harness racing. With its one-mile oval, it changed a sport where half-mile tracks were standard. Thoroughbreds began racing at the Meadowlands that fall, but Monmouth Park, further south in Oceanport and its predecessor on the racing calendar, has always been the more popular home for that breed.But the quality of the harness meet at the Meadowlands has gradually declined, to the point where its supremacy finds challengers and the state expects significant reform. Once a big moneymaker, the Meadowlands lost nearly $10 million over all last year.The reasons are many and in some cases outside the control of those in the sport: the drop in popularity of harness racing, greater competition from other forms of gambling, the rise of racetracks with casinos (known as “racinos”) like Yonkers and Pennsylvania’s Chester, and the state’s slow introduction of off-track betting parlors.In 1977, the Meadowlands drew an average attendance of 17,606 over 181 dates. Last year, it drew an average of 2,897 over 147 dates. The fact that people can now bet over both the Internet and the telephone is one significant reason for the decline.But the quiet inside the large facility on race night speaks loudly. The Meadowlands actually draws more fans than other standardbred sites, where slot machines inflate purses but push aside much of the interest in the horses on the track.This year, the Meadowlands is on pace to meet its total from last year of $2.4 million in nightly handle, approximately double its closest standardbred competitors, but down from its high of $3.74 million in 2000.The standardbred industry in the state looks more vulnerable than the thoroughbred one. The Hanson report said the largest part of the sports authority’s losses come from harness racing. The report looked favorably on Monmouth Park’s experiment with a shortened summer meet; its 50 days and $50 million in purses has attracted better horses and higher attendance and handle. On the other hand, the report calls harness racing a “regional niche sport.”The standardbred industry interpreted the report as an indication that Christie wants to shut it down.“I never expected that it would be as bad as it is,” Thomas Luchento, the president of the Standardbred Owners and Breeders Association of New Jersey, said of the report.Luchento said the standardbred industry would try to produce a plan that would suit Christie, which means a way for it to operate without state subsidies. He said that one idea was a shortened meet like Monmouth’s of 100 days and $400,000 in daily purses.However, Luchento expressed unhappiness at what he perceived as the tone and nature of the report. He said he believed “it was a stacked deck from the beginning” because the commission did not include any members of the horse industry.“It was the horsemen that got the blame for this for not having a good business model, when we had nothing to do with it,” Luchento said. “The legislators in the state would come in here, take the money, build other projects.”The report offers four potential options for harness racing, including moving a shorter meet to Monmouth Park; leasing the Meadowlands to the standardbred industry for $1 a year for the next three years, with the industry paying to maintain the facility; converting a commercial farm into a new track; and altogether eliminating the sport. Luchento said he would find it difficult to say yes to almost any of them.According to a Rutgers University study from 2007, horse racing and related operations generate more than $780 million in economic activity each year. More than half of the industry’s 13,000 jobs are tied to racetracks, breeding and training facilities. Horse farms represent more than a fifth of the state’s 790,000 acres, and standardbreds make up two-thirds of the 12,500 racehorses on that land. Luchento said that the industry’s economic impact at a time of high unemployment and budget deficits should not be ignored. But Mulcahy said the state’s budget deficit was the reason horse racing must sustain itself.The Hanson report called for a master plan in six months. The Hambletonian starts the clock.“The state has to get out of the business,” Mulcahy said. “That’s really the answer. We can no longer subsidize any of these operations. We have to put them into a position where we can privatize them.”'"
"'10-08-07,'0','But there is an important difference between the current situation and that last price spike: the Russian drought and ban on wheat exports, in contrast to the global shock in 2008 that drove wheat prices up to nearly $13 a bushel and created tensions in Indonesia and Pakistan, are occurring when global wheat production is plentiful and stocks in the United States are at a 23-year high, analysts said.“This is still going to be the third-largest wheat crop in world history, even with the Russian shortfall,” said Daniel W. Basse, president of AgResource, an agricultural consultant firm in Chicago. “The question becomes, Will the drought persist, and will there be problems elsewhere, in other big producers like Argentina or Australia?”Wheat prices have risen by about 90 percent since June because of the Russian drought and other factors like floods during the planting season in parts of Canada. As the price shock ripples through the supply chain, small food producers may be unprotected because they tend to buy flour on the spot market.Larger companies, like Piantedosi Baking Company of suburban Boston, have hedged against cost inflation.“Now that we are hitting the storm here, we are locked down fairly far, to the end of the year practically,” said Joseph A. Piantedosi Jr., who runs the company with two cousins.Papa John’s Pizza said it had locked in its wheat purchases through the first quarter of 2011, and Domino’s Pizza said it had also hedged.The drought this summer had already pushed the price of wheat futures to their highest level since 2008. Amid growing nervousness on Monday, the number of wheat futures and options contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Trade reached record highs, beating the previous record set in 2008, and more than double the daily average so far this year.Then on Thursday, the announcement of the embargo by Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin caused a further sharp swing — prices hit their upper limits on all three of the exchanges where wheat futures are traded in the United States, in Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis.“It was a really crazy day,” said Frank Stone, 55, of the Kansas City Trading Group.On Friday, the futures prices fell again, this time hitting the lower limits on all three exchanges, on tentative reports that Russia might honor some of its export contracts after all or at least postpone the embargo until after its wheat harvest.According to Interfax, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on the Ekho Moskvy radio station, “The decision to ban exports could be adjusted, depending on the harvest.”By close of trading on Friday, wheat futures for September delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade had dropped 60 cents, to $7.25 a bushel, still sharply higher than a few weeks ago.Cash prices for wheat have risen less significantly than futures prices, traders and analysts said, reflecting the fact that wheat is in healthy supply around the world.“We do have a lot of wheat in the U.S.,” said Erica Olson, marketing specialist at the North Dakota Wheat Commission, a trade group. “We have wheat left over from last year and a good harvest this year.”This is in contrast to the big supply shock in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, for example, worldwide stocks had already fallen sharply. By 2008 they had fallen to the lowest level in 30 years because of falling production and higher consumption, Ms. Olsen said, quoting Department of Agriculture data. Stocks had recovered by May 2010, she said.Maximo Torero, at the International Food Policy Research Institute, said the market reaction was overdone. Russia represents only 11 percent of the world’s wheat exports, he said, and any shortfall could be met by major wheat exporters like the United States, Australia or Canada.The real concern, he said, was that other countries would follow Russia’s lead and stop exporting, a domino reaction around the world similar to the one in 2008 that could cause a sharper increase in prices.Jack Scoville, vice president of Price Futures Group, a futures brokerage in Chicago, said importers around the world who had agreed to buy wheat from Russia and now faced the prospect of broken contracts would have to look for more expensive supplies elsewhere.“There will be higher prices for them,” he said.'"
"'10-08-07,'0','In that interim, the greatest rivalry in baseball was in danger of losing a bit of the tension, but then David Ortiz whacked a homer in the first inning, and the home fans booed, and it felt just like the dozens and dozens of taut games these two old protagonists have played in recent years.The Red Sox cut the Yanks’ lead over the Sox to five games, but the Yankees remained in first place as the Rays lost in Toronto, 2-1, one night after their bizarre loss in their dome.In most seasons, the Yanks and the Red Sox would be jockeying for position in the postseason, but the East Division is not so simple anymore.Tampa Bay has become a factor in that division, ever since 2008, when the Rays reached the World Series. The Rays would be in better shape right now if not for the high pop that plunked off the catwalk high above second base and fell near the pitcher’s mound in the ninth inning of an 8-6 loss to the Twins.The Yankees have seen the dome at work. On April 11, Mark Teixeira thought he had tracked a high infield pop only to have it hit the catwalk and fall to earth, in play, according to the ground rules of that hideous dome. Teixeira called the catwalk and the ground “laughable,” but at least the Yankees won that game.“Even for the home team, it’s hard to prepare for it,” Yankee Manager Joe Girardi said Friday. “And it’s worse for the visiting team.” He added, “Guys are running to where they think they should be.”The miniature-golf-like obstacle in the dome — let’s not call it a ballpark — caused Rays Manager Joe Maddon to make a pitch for a real park, and soon.The two straight losses have put the Rays into second place, and if they stay there, they are staring at playing three road games in a five-game postseason series. In most years starting in 2003, those were the stakes when the Yankees met the Red Sox 18 or 19 times during the regular season. Now the Rays are in the mix.Intelligently built with far less money than what is available to , oh, let’s say the Mets, the Rays have surged ahead of the Red Sox, who have been struck by an unusual number of injuries. Now the Sox have made the first move in this four-game series. Somebody in the top three is going to be left out in early October.The perils of the East Division were acknowledged by Buck Showalter when he was introduced Monday as the latest Orioles manager.“The Yankees aren’t going away, the Red Sox aren’t going away, Tampa’s not going away, and Toronto’s getting better,” Showalter said. “So you’ve got to figure out a way to do it. Tampa Bay’s eliminated a lot of those excuses, and it can be done if you know who you are and stay with the way you have to do it to be successful.”This division is hard from any angle. The Yankees have missed the postseason only once in the last 15 seasons, in 2008. And starting in 2003, the Red Sox have made the playoffs every year except 2006.Tampa Bay has made the postseason only once, in 2008, since being hatched in 1998, and it is now a beacon to other downtrodden teams.Toronto has not been in the postseason since the Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, but it has usually been competitive.Baltimore has not been in the playoffs since 1996 and 1997, and the Orioles promptly let Davey Johnson go, and have not had a winning season since. Good luck to Showalter, still only 54, and having to manage in the same division with the Yankees, the Red Sox, the Rays, the Blue Jays — and the catwalk.'"
"'10-08-07,'0','As in his conversation with the man on I-84 more than a year earlier, Trooper Taylor immediately struck a calm, conversational tone, displaying sympathy with the shooter’s laments while trying to keep him on the phone, learn his location and how heavily armed he was, and urging him to surrender. At the same time, the trooper was forwarding vital information to the State Police’s command post outside the warehouse.“We’re going to have to have you surrender yourself somehow, here, and not make the situation any worse, you know what I mean?” the trooper told him at one point.Ultimately, the trooper could not persuade Mr. Thornton to surrender, and the 34-year-old delivery truck driver, who blamed racial harassment at work for his shooting spree, killed himself.But law enforcement experts on Friday called the recorded exchanges between the two men remarkable.“In calls like this, it’s almost like a hostage-negotiation situation in which the call taker is trying to slow things down, get as much information as possible and establish a relationship with a stranger,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit group focused on improving police techniques. “That this state police officer could quickly establish a rapport and keep him on the line for so long is impressive. He immediately understood who he was talking to and used all of his experience to try to get him to either surrender or at the very least keep him talking and not shoot at other people.”The two men, Mr. Wexler added, spoke as “if they knew each other.”Trooper Taylor, through a State Police spokesman, declined interview requests on Friday. The officer joined the force in 1987, and since then has been assigned to various duties, most recently with Troop H in the Hartford area. Officials would not release his exact age, other than to say he was in his 40s.Lt. J. Paul Vance, the spokesman, said the department had discouraged its officers from talking about the Hartford Distributors shootings while the investigation was under way. But he also said Trooper Taylor simply did not want the attention.“I know him, and he’s that type of individual,” Lieutenant Vance said. “He’s a good, professional trooper, and he’s a trooper for all the right reasons.”Lieutenant Vance said troopers, even veterans, trained regularly for “active shooter” situations, using classroom instruction, mock situations and lessons from the numerous American shooting sprees, like the one at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999.“We’ve learned from history, and our training is centered around past tragedies,” Lieutenant Vance said.Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina, called the recording “one of the most professional” 911 calls he had heard.“And I’ve heard a lot of tapes,” Professor Alpert said, adding that Trooper Taylor followed all the rules: remaining calm, keeping the gunman on the phone — as long as he was on the line, he was not shooting — and trying to get information on his location and weapons. “I don’t think you could script it better,” he said.'"
"'10-08-07,'0','In 1979, a 25-year-old economics student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Ben S. Bernanke turned in his doctoral dissertation. In his acknowledgments, he thanked a faculty member, Peter A. Diamond, as one of four professors who “gave generously of their time, reading and discussing my work.”In April, President Obama nominated Mr. Diamond to the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, where his former student, Mr. Bernanke, has been chairman since 2006.But under an arcane procedural rule, the Senate sent Mr. Diamond’s nomination back to the White House on Thursday night before starting its summer recess. A leading Republican senator, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, said that Mr. Diamond did not have sufficiently broad macroeconomic experience to help run the central bank.The Senate did not turn back two other nominees, Janet L. Yellen and Sarah Bloom Raskin, to join the Fed’s board, though the soonest either could be confirmed now is mid-September. Ms. Yellen, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, is in line to become vice chairwoman of the Fed, the No. 2 to Mr. Bernanke.All three nominees were approved by the Senate Banking Committee, and there does not seem to be enough opposition to permanently block Mr. Diamond. “This is standard operating procedure in the Senate, and we expect that the president will renominate Peter Diamond,” a White House official said of the delay.Mr. Diamond, 70, joined the M.I.T. faculty in 1966 and is an authority on taxation, Social Security, pensions, Medicare, labor markets and behavioral economics. He is so well regarded there that the university commissioned a work by the composer John Harbison to commemorate his retirement in April.As Mr. Shelby noted, Mr. Diamond is not a specialist in monetary economics — the control of the supply of credit and the setting of interest rates — which is the Fed’s traditional purview. But of the five current governors of the Fed, only two, Mr. Bernanke and the vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, are academic economists who specialize in monetary economics. The other three include a former community banker, a former Wall Street executive and a legal scholar.'"
"'10-08-07,'0','Mr. Nuon Chea, the chief ideologue for Pol Pot, who died in 1998, is one of four Khmer Rouge leaders who are due to be tried next year for crimes against humanity in the deaths of 1.7 million people from 1975 to 1979. That trial follows the conviction last month of the chief Khmer Rouge prison warden, Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch.The killings were a necessary part of the revolution, Mr. Nuon Chea told Mr. Thet Sambath during their discussions, which form part of “Enemies of the People,” a film about Mr. Thet Sambath’s search for answers that is now being screened in New York and Los Angeles. Mr. Thet Sambath and his British co-producer, Rob Lemkin, have refused a request by the court for a copy of the film, saying they promised Mr. Nuon Chea that his remarks would be used “for history, not for evidence.”“They were killed and destroyed,” said Mr. Nuon Chea, now 84 years old, fragile and ailing but unrepentant. “If we had left them alive, the party line would have been hijacked.”Until almost the end of their interviews in 2007, just before Mr. Nuon Chea was arrested, Mr. Thet Sambath kept another secret: that his parents had been among the victims.If Mr. Nuon Chea had known this, he said, he might not have let down his guard.Mr. Thet Sambath’s father was stabbed to death after resisting a Khmer Rouge order to give up his property, he said. His mother died in childbirth after being forced into a new marriage with a Khmer Rouge militiaman.“After 1979, I cried almost every night,” Mr. Thet Sambath said.“I felt that I was an orphan with no parents to take care of me, and that feeling pushed me to try to learn about what happened.”When Mr. Nuon Chea heard about his parents, he said, “he was shocked. He could not talk. He became very sad.”And then, possibly for the first time addressing an individual death, Mr. Nuon Chea apologized.It was Mr. Nuon Chea who urged him to keep secrets, Mr. Thet Sambath said, much as he might have instructed young Khmer Rouge cadres when the movement was still an underground insurgency. “At the beginning, it was very hard for me, but later I got used to it,” he said.If their meetings became known, one of them could be harmed, the old revolutionary told him. “He said he had experience in the 1960s,” Mr. Thet Sambath said, “and that is how he got to 1975,” when the Khmer Rouge seized power.“He told me to keep my secrets even from my own family and I will have success,” Mr. Thet Sambath said, and he did. Even with his film complete, he has not told his wife or children about it, perhaps unable to let go of the mission that has consumed him.Even in his prayers, he has not yet told the souls of his parents, on whose behalf he has been searching.“One day, I plan to have a ceremony for them,” he said. “I will light a candle and incense, and I will say, ‘Yes, I got success. I understand what happened to you and to other Cambodian people. You can find peace and be reborn into a better life.’ ”IT was this mission that drew Mr. Thet Sambath into journalism, where he hoped to learn the tools of investigation, he said. He worked first for The Cambodia Daily and now works for The Phnom Penh Post; they are Cambodia’s two English-language newspapers.“Journalism showed me how to connect with people and how to ask questions,” he said. His years of interviews have made “Enemies of the People,” an engrossing documentary that has been honored at the Sundance Film Festival and at other festivals.In addition to Mr. Nuon Chea, he connected with low-level Khmer Rouge operatives, some of the people who carried out the executions that were part of Mr. Nuon Chea’s vision.The results are chilling. In one interview on camera, a farmer describes his work in the killing fields, work in which his hand got so tired slicing throats that he had to change his grip on his knife.“She was in the last batch,” the killer says, recalling one execution. “We’d killed a lot of them except her. She grabbed my legs, screaming, ‘Uncle, please let me live with you.’ I said, ‘You can’t live with me.’ She said, ‘Please, just let me live with you.’ I said, ‘Will you live with me forever?’ She said, ‘Yes, I will.’ She hugged my knees. Then Eng shouted at me, ‘What are you waiting for? Hurry up and kill her.’“Then I started to kill her and pushed her down into the ditch.”The killers, carrying out orders that reached them through a chain of commands from above, speak of a deep remorse that Mr. Nuon Chea seems not to have experienced.“I feel desperate, but I don’t know what to do,” one man says after describing his work as a killer. “I will never again see sunlight as a human being in this world. This is my understanding of Buddhist dharma. I feel desolate.”AND yet Mr. Thet Sambath said he could not help liking Mr. Nuon Chea.“He is a warm person, very warm,” he said.“I mean that I like him right now,” he added. “It doesn’t mean I like him for his regime from 1975 to 1979. I clearly separate that.”They still talk from time to time over a prison telephone, Mr. Thet Sambath said. “When I ask him, ‘How are you?’ he says, ‘Oh, I am fine,’ and he’ll laugh.”In one of the last moments of the film, Mr. Nuon Chea is escorted to a helicopter that will fly him from his rural home to Phnom Penh for trial.The arrest was a finale for Mr. Thet Sambath’s long search for answers and a complicated moment for the child of two of Mr. Nuon Chea’s victims.“When he was taken into the aircraft, that made me very sad,” Mr. Thet Sambath says as the film nears its end. “Not to say he’s a good man, but because we had used to work together for almost 10 years. I am sad, yeah.”'"
"'10-08-07,'0','Sometimes it is really cool to be the underdog, the little team that’s not supposed to win but that keeps scaring the bejabbers out of the power teams. Those teams are so easy to cheer for, bring so much charm to sports. Can you really not root for the Tampa Bay Rays, with their microscopic payroll (compared with the Yankees) and aw-shucks manager? Can you really not root for Boise State football, with all those status quo rattling rallies in a sport whose stuffed-shirt establishment refuses to acknowledge it belongs?But sometimes it stinks being the underdog. Part of the Rays’ charm comes from rattling around in the worst ballpark in the majors, whose ridiculous catwalks cost them a game Thursday — and first place in the American League East. And Boise State’s heroics keep being rewarded with another slap from the cabal that runs college football, its 14-0 season not only failing to be rewarded with a national title (or even the ability to play for the national title), but its preseason ranking this year? No. 5.You could excuse Rays Manager Joe Maddon’s anger after a two-out pop fly by Minnesota’s Jason Kubel clanged off the catwalk that hangs from the ceiling at Tropicana Field and the Rays’ infielders lost track of it until it fell for the game-winning hit. It spurred The Tampa Tribune’s Joe Henderson to plead for the place to be blown up already. Worse, perhaps, is that the Rays know the Twins just got rid of their hideous Metrodome in favor of a lovely new outdoor park.On the flip side, of course, there are also underdogs who give dogs a bad name. Example: the Clippers, who can’t even fire Mike Dunleavy as their coach and general manager without it becoming a fiasco that now includes them suing Dunleavy.The animal kingdom isn’t feeling terribly proud to be linked to Tiger Woods these days either. His latest woes came in the first round of the Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio, which he chunked up to the tune of a 74 on a course he usually dominates. The new goatee look clearly didn’t help him and Foxsports.com’s Robert Lusetich tries to pick through the pieces of Woods’s disintegrating swing.'"
"'10-08-08,'0','A San Mateo County marsh until the ’60s, the community of Foster City is now a late-summer paradise for windsurfers who enjoy its 16.5 miles of navigable canals. Nicknamed the City of Blue Lagoons by residents, it has evolved from an uninhabited mudflat to a proud city of 30,000.Windsurfers of all ages enjoy Foster City’s canals thanks to gentle conditions. The water temperature typically tops 70 degrees by mid-August, the wind stays mild and the lagoon is only 8 to 11 feet deep, said Steve Browning, an instructor at California Windsurfing. Older windsurfers race every Tuesday night.T. Jack Foster bought a mudflat called Brewer Island in 1960 to develop it. It consisted of four square miles of dairy farms and salt ponds. In 2009, Foster City was ranked No. 10 on Forbes Magazine’s list of America’s Top 25 Towns to Live Well.Before construction of Foster City began, the elevation was raised four to five feet by depositing 14 million cubic yards of sand, pumped up from the bay floor, on the surface. This required six years of round-the-clock work.The canals’ inviting deep-blue color is not natural. Foster City darkens its water through organic dyes, said a Public Works Department employee, Juan Carlos Ruiz. “This keeps sunlight out, so algae doesn’t grow,” Mr. Ruiz said.Foster City is divided into nine residential neighborhoods, each with a nautical theme: Islands, Fish, Boats and Boat Parts, Birds, Admirals, Bays, Constellations and Stars, Famous Ships, and Explorers. Most street names indicate their location; for example, Marlin Avenue, Albacore Lane and Halibut Street are in the Fish neighborhood.The Bay Area Dragons — the first dragon boat team in the region — practice here in 44-foot canoes that seat 20 paddlers. A Polynesian outrigger club, Ho’okahi Pu’uwai, is also making a splash.The lagoon covers 218 acres and contains halibut and striped bass. Swimming, fishing and boats (that are not gasoline- or diesel-powered) are allowed.'"
"'10-08-08,'0','HAVANA (Reuters) — Former President Fidel Castro of Cuba addressed a session of Parliament for the first time in four years on Saturday, the latest of several recent public appearances after a long period of seclusion.Mr. Castro, wearing a long-sleeved green military shirt without rank insignia, was greeted by a standing ovation and shouts of “Viva Fidel” as he walked into the National Assembly with the help of aides.It was the first time that Mr. Castro, who turns 84 this month, had participated in a public government meeting since 2006, the year he underwent intestinal surgery.Mr. Castro had requested the Parliament session, which was broadcast live by Cuban state television, to discuss his warnings that the confrontation between Iran and the United States and its allies over the issue of nuclear weapons had pushed the world to the brink of nuclear war.Standing on the podium and speaking in a firm but sometimes halting voice, Mr. Castro read a 12-minute statement saying that a nuclear confrontation could break out if President Obama ordered an attack on Iran, should it resist American and Israeli efforts to enforce international sanctions against it for its nuclear activities.He also referred to the case of one of five convicted Cuban spies jailed in the United States, Gerardo Hernández, saying he hoped that Mr. Hernández’s wife would be allowed to visit him or that he could be released.After his 2006 illness, Mr. Castro disappeared from public view and was seen only occasionally in photographs and videos. In 2008, he formally handed over the presidency of Cuba to his younger brother, Raúl Castro, who also attended the Assembly session .'"
"'10-08-08,'0','“He consciously put his life on the line for his beliefs,” Mr. Little’s brother, John Little, 62, said in a telephone interview from Florida. “He had had so many close calls before. He wasn’t fearless, but he was at peace with danger.”Mr. Little and Dr. Woo had been working with International Assistance Mission, which describes itself on its Web site as an “international charitable, non-profit, Christian organization, serving the people of Afghanistan.” A government inspection team had approved the group’s projects and financing in June, the Web site said.Six Americans, a Briton, a German and four Afghans were working with the group’s mission to Nuristan at the time of the attack although the group has not confirmed that its workers were the ones attacked.Dr. Woo, who was engaged to be married to a man who was also working in Afghanistan, was finishing a documentary about the health system in Afghanistan, and had founded the charity Bridge Afghanistan with Firuz Rahimi, a journalist for the BBC World Service.“She wanted to go and show the life behind the violence,” Mr. Rahimi said. “She was a very kind, and a very determined person. She was somebody who wanted to make a difference.”He first met Dr. Woo at a fashion show two years ago in London to benefit Afghan women. Although Dr. Woo was a runner and a former ballet dancer, before she left for Nuristan, she confided in Mr. Rahimi that she was concerned about the physical demands of the trip.Mr. Little offered similar details to the congregation at Loudonville Community Church in upstate New York when making his presentation there last month.“Tom and Libby’s heart was always dedicated to reach those who had not had access to care, and to share the hope of their faith in the process,” Pastor Mike Conley said. “But they were very careful and knew about the sensitivity of sharing their faith in that region. They expressed their faith in practical ways.”The Taliban, which claimed responsibility for the attack, accused the aid workers of proselytizing. But the group’s director, Dirk Frans, said that although the group was Christian, its policies prohibited proselytizing.David Evans, 57, a longtime friend of the Little family, and the former director of world missions at Loudonville Community Church, said that Mr. Little was never deterred by the violence around him.“When the eye hospital was destroyed by a rocket attack,” Mr. Evans said, recalling a time in the late 1980s or early 1990s, Mr. Little had this reaction:“He said, ‘Let’s go out to pick up the bricks, one by one, and let’s rebuild,’ ” Mr. Evans said.Mr. Little was known for his calm demeanor, said Mr. Evans, who accompanied Mr. Little on one mission in Afghanistan. “Tom was very patient in dealing with people,” he said. “We dealt with government officials, and day after day we would have cups of tea to get where he wanted to get to provide for the poor.”For years, Ms. Little was a teacher at an international school in Kabul, assisting her husband when she could, Mr. Evans said. She was recovering from knee surgery and did not make this latest trip back to Afghanistan, John Little said.Tom and Libby had been high school sweethearts at Ichabod Crane High School in Valatie, N.Y., and Tom’s father, Henry O. Little Sr., was a noted ophthalmologist in Kinderhook, N.Y. Tom Little worked in his father’s office, learning the trade, but studied theology in Toronto before doing medical relief work in Afghanistan.“He learned from the seat of his pants,” John Little said. “He probably knew more about eye disease than most doctors in the field.”In 2007, John said, Mr. Little earned a degree in optometry in Boston so that he could teach the latest techniques in Afghanistan.The couple’s three daughters, Molly, Nelly and Kattie, who grew up in Kabul and for parts of high school attended boarding school in India, have followed their parents’ lead in one way or another, John said. Kattie is a doctor in Texas, John said. Nelly worked in Afghanistan for a nongovernmental organization overseeing the 2005 elections, and Molly works for the United Nations, most recently in Iraq, John said.Connie Frisbee Houde, a freelance photographer who went to high school with Libby Little, visited them several times in Afghanistan.“With a great deal of humor, the Littles recounted tale after tale of inspiring life and death incidents,” Ms. Houde wrote in her blog in 2005. “How during the Russian occupation they had to flee Herat with their three small children to avoid capture or being ‘disappeared’ by the Russians; or how in the early ’90s, they spent months living in the basement of their house and driving two hours around the outskirts of the city to avoid the factional fighting at the front lines so they could continue to provide eye care to the needy.”This undaunted spirit marked the group’s other leader, Dr. Woo. She wrote poignantly of her life in Afghanistan in her blog, in which she juxtaposed warm and humorous stories of ball gowns, pedicures, and kittens with the horrors of war zones and kidnappings.In June, when she learned that two friends of a colleague had died in a plane crash in Afghanistan, she wrote in her blog of her own life and mortality in a war zone:“Nothing in life is for sure, nothing that you see today will always be here tomorrow,” she wrote. “All of these people come to Afghanistan of their own volition, they come knowing that they may pay with their lives, the black humour is rife, a good way to keep the apprehension low, to keep calm and carry on. Perhaps no one ever expects it to be them, perhaps not their immediate friends either, it always some poor unknown person, a local national, a third country national.“We count those that matter to us. We say that we are prepared for the loss whatever that may be but is it ever possible to be so? To be so prepared is that at polar opposites to the decision to be there in the first place, that somehow, it will never be me or anyone close to me.”'"

"'10-08-08,'0','AS chatter has grown about the possibility of a double-dip recession , so, too, have fears about another “D” word: deflation .Late last month, Jeremy Grantham, the chief investment strategist at GMO, an investment firm based in Boston, issued a warning about deflation after worrying for months that inflationary pressures were brewing. Mr. Grantham told GMO clients recently that as the recovery has slowed, “downward pressure on prices from weak wages and weak demand seems to me now to be much the larger factor.”In doing so, he joined a growing list of prominent analysts — including William H. Gross, the co-chief investment officer of Pimco — who’ve raised concerns that consumption may be postponed and growth thwarted if price declines occur throughout the economy.Long periods of deflation are quite rare. In fact, before Japan’s on-again, off-again experience with deflation starting in the 1990s, you have to go all the way back to the Great Depression to find another sustained bout of this trend in the developed world.As a result, if deflation were actually to strike in the United States — and that is a big “if” — investors might not be able to draw from their own experience to determine how best to position their portfolios.So what are investors to do?One textbook strategy is to buy long-term Treasury bonds, which many people already appear to be doing as a hedge against general economic troubles. Yields on 10-year Treasury securities have plunged to 2.8 percent from about 3.8 percent in late April.In the 1930s, this strategy proved successful in combating deflation, as long-term government bonds generated nominal total returns of nearly 5 percent a year, versus annualized losses of 0.1 percent for equities during that decade, according to Ibbotson Associates.Strategists who’ve expressed concerns about deflation aren’t necessarily predicting a return to protracted, Depression-era downward price spirals. “We’re certainly not positioning for a Japan-like scenario,” said Ben Inker, a colleague of Mr. Grantham’s who is GMO’s head of asset allocation.Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the asset management firm Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif., said that while a brief bout of modest deflation was a threat in the short run, inflation — or rising prices that eat away at consumers’ purchasing power — remained the bigger long-term menace.He said that growing fears over deflation made it more likely that policy makers would overreact in their attempts to stimulate growth in the economy. And that, in turn, means that “inflation is still what you have to worry about down the road,” he said.As a result, Mr. Arnott isn’t focusing entirely on near-term deflation. Rather than buying long-term Treasuries, he suggests an investment in Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS.Mr. Arnott argues that if inflation begins to become a threat two or three years down the road, having the inflationary hedge of a TIPS bond will protect an investor against rising prices — which is something that a regular Treasury bond won’t do.In the meantime, individual TIPS are still government bonds backed by the full faith and credit of Uncle Sam. And even if Mr. Arnott is wrong and deflation persists for years, investors who buy individual TIPS will at least have the security of being able to recoup the face value of their bond at maturity, while still earning a yield of around 1.2 percent a year.Now that’s 1.6 percentage points less than what regular Treasuries of equivalent maturities are paying. But, Mr. Arnott asks, “What are the chances of inflation being less” than that for a decade?If you truly fear deflation, fixed-income securities — because of their relative safety and the income they throw off — will most likely be better than equities, money managers say. But they note that investors need to be choosy about the types of bonds they buy.Among corporate securities, investors should pay attention to companies’ balance sheets. “You want to avoid highly leveraged companies,” said Carl P. Kaufman, manager of the Osterweis Strategic Income fund. In a deflationary environment, a debt-ridden company would have to pay back obligations with increasingly valuable dollars. “In inflation, you’re cheapening the value of dollars over time,” Mr. Kaufman said. “In deflation, it’s the opposite: dollars become dearer over time.”Fixed-income investors may want to focus on high-quality companies that routinely generate tons of cash. The same argument goes for equity investors as well.Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s, says that in deflationary times, some stocks could actually post gains. Throughout the 1990s, when the Japanese stock market began to crater under the weight of deflationary forces, technology, telecommunications and health care shares rose on local markets.INVESTORS who want to maintain their stock weightings should consider “high-quality, large, blue-chip companies that have balance-sheet strength,” said Brian McMahon, chief investment officer at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M. He said companies like Google and Microsoft often have an added advantage: dominance over their industries, enabling them to maintain their prices even if others in the industry start to lower theirs.Stocks that pay dividends would also make sense, because the cash thrown off by these shares would be quite valuable in a deflationary environment.In fact, said Mr. Inker of GMO, if investors really fear deflation, they might consider increasing the cash in their portfolios. “There’s a strong case for building up dry powder,” he said. “If something bad happens economically — whether it’s deflation or inflation — that’s generally provides a good buying opportunity for investors who have some cash to put to work.”'"
"'10-08-08,'0','The Mets were eight games out of first place in the National League East going into Saturday’s game, and Minaya insisted the moves did not signal a concession, and were intended to provide the dual function of helping the team this year and in the future.“This is about trying to find something different to get us to score some runs,” he said. “So it’s not only developmental here. “It’s always developmental when you bring young kids up. We still feel we’re in the pennant race and we feel that we’re bringing him up here to help us win some games.”Castillo was hitting .246 with 20 runs in 60 games. Francoeur, though playing well lately, was hitting .241 over all, with 10 homers and 46 runs batted in over 104 games going into Saturday’s game.The Mets were 54-55, having lost 18 of their previous 25 games as their offense production has withered. Even as they sought pitching before the July 31 trading deadline, the focus changed to hitting in the days since.Manuel has said repeatedly that the team is missing the enthusiasm and spark of the younger players, and this appears to be the attempted solution.“The reality is, what’s been missing is scoring runs,” Minaya said. “That’s been missing. But we felt, let’s look at it internally and see what we can do to change it up. When you look at the record, the way we’ve been playing, I felt this is the best way to go.”In addition to Cora, the two veterans who will suffer the most are Castillo and Francoeur. Minaya said Tejada and Martinez were here to play regularly, although he would leave it to Manuel to determined the exact formula. Manuel’s lineup Saturday demonstrated that Tejada’s time had already come.“He’s for the most part going to be the second baseman at this point,” Manuel said. “We’ll try to somehow keep Luis sharp.”Manuel explained that Martinez would play right field against right-handed pitchers, which is a majority of the time. That relegates Francoeur to backup duty for the second time since the All-Star break, when Carlos Beltran came back from the disabled list.Francoeur was sent to the bench at the time as Angel Pagan was moved to right from center upon Beltran’s return. But Francoeur was given his regular starting role again when Bay was placed on the disabled list, and Francoeur performed well. On the current trip, Francoeur was 5 for 14 (.357) with four runs scored and a game-winning home run in Atlanta.Although he could not have been pleased by the move, Francoeur offered no harsh words.“I’ll continue to work hard and prepare and do everything I can to help the team win,” he said.Cora was released just 18 games before his $2 million option for next season would have vested at 80 games played. The move saved the Mets a considerable sum for a bench player who was hitting .207, as Cora was.Tejada, 20, hit .212 in his previous term with the big-league club, and the Mets felt he was showing signs of fatigue. In Buffalo, he was hitting .280.Martinez was batting .255 for the Bisons, with 16 doubles, 12 home runs and 33 R.B.I. 68 games. He made his major league debut with the Mets last season, but he had surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee, which limited him to 29 games.'"
"'10-08-08,'0','When Mr. Obama was elected, 49 Democratic lawmakers represented districts carried by Mr. McCain. Soon, Representative of Alabama left the party to become a Republican, but he was defeated in the primary earlier this year.Then, eight of the Democrats decided not to run for re-election, giving Republicans a good shot at picking up those open seats. Now there are 40 Democratic incumbents remaining in districts won by Mr. McCain.There are multiple combinations for how Republicans can reach the gain needed to win control of the House, but neither side disputes the notion that for Republicans to be successful, some of their victories must come from these split districts.They are by no means all easy targets for Republicans. For a variety of factors, including fund-raising strength and the quality and ideological positioning of the Republican candidates, only 15 of the 40 districts are considered top targets by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Several others are rated competitive by nonpartisan analysts.At least a handful of Democrats in the 40 districts are no longer considered to be as vulnerable as Republicans had hoped, largely because their preferred candidates were defeated by more conservative candidates in primaries.Representatives Jason Altmire of , Walt Minnick of and Zack Space of are among the Democrats no longer seen by Republicans as easy targets.While Mr. Boccieri supported Mr. Obama on health care, economic stimulus and climate legislation, other Democrats voted against one, two or even all three of the measures — meaning Republicans cannot use a single line of attack against them.Democrats take solace in the fact that of the party’s three Ohio lawmakers who come from districts where Mr. Obama lost to Mr. McCain, only Mr. Boccieri has a fiercely competitive race. Representative Charlie Wilson, along with Mr. Space, also is not included among the top Republican targets.Here in the 16th Congressional District, the race between Mr. Boccieri and Mr. Renacci has already become a highly contentious one. The district, which stretches across four counties, includes Stark County and Canton, the home of , a Republican.Mr. Renacci’s strategy is to tie Mr. Boccieri to Mr. Obama and Ms. Pelosi, the House speaker, who is often portrayed by Republican candidates as the embodiment of liberalism run amok. Mr. Boccieri flatly rejects the assertion that he is a puppet of Ms. Pelosi, and he said Mr. Renacci would favor returning to an agenda that Republicans put forward while President was in office.“People are mad at Democrats, but they’re still mad as hell at Republicans,” Mr. Boccieri said. “I am not ashamed of any of those votes that I’ve taken.”When people ask Mr. Boccieri about his opponent’s assertion that he is a reliable vote for Ms. Pelosi and the Democratic Party, he has a statistic at the ready: he says he sided with Republicans 847 times out of 1,464 votes he took in his first term in Congress. The Almanac of American Politics ranked Mr. Boccieri as the 224th most liberal and the 204th most conservative member of Congress.“I’ve staked out one of the loneliest places in Washington,” he said. “But I’m in a quintessential swing district in a quintessential swing state, and that makes me a target.”Democrats sent researchers to investigate the business background of Mr. Renacci, who owned and a car dealership and had a stake in the Destroyers, an arena football team. Four years ago, court records show, he was assessed nearly $1.4 million in unpaid state , interest and fees, which he ultimately paid.Mr. Renacci said his business record was far less important to voters than Mr. Boccieri’s record in Congress.“People understand the tax situation — it’s 30 years of business, 30 years of employing people,” Mr. Renacci said. “Every time he brings it up, I’m going to keep asking him, how about your cap-and-trade vote? How about your health care vote?”Mr. Renacci raised more money than Mr. Boccieri in the second quarter of the year, but Mr. Boccieri had $1.06 million on hand, compared with $662,612 for Mr. Renacci, who also had a four-way primary to contend with. Mr. Renacci, who reported in House disclosure forms that he had a net worth of at least $35 million, has lent his campaign $200,000 and said he would not rule out investing more money in the race.While the district is made up of small and medium-size towns, from River Styx (population 655) to Canton (78,000), it is part of the television market, where it is expensive for Congressional candidates to place advertisements.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has already reserved time for the final weeks of the campaign to run commercials on behalf of Mr. Boccieri.The campaign literature for Mr. Boccieri, which volunteers were handing out last week at the Medina County Fair, does not mention votes that he has taken on health care, the economic stimulus or energy legislation. The word Democrat also does not appear on his brochures.'"
"'10-08-08,'0','EVER stand in a museum or gallery looking at a work of art and wonder: “Gee, what were they thinking?” Some artists are willing to answer that question in person, and dozens, including the photographer Tom Steele, the multimedia artist Avital Oz and the painter Roseline Koener, will meet participants in a self-guided tour of artists’ studios in the greater Westhampton area next weekend. The tour is being presented for the second year by Family Counseling Services in Westhampton.“It’s great for people to come into these studios and see how the art is created and get to speak to the artist directly,” said Candyce Brokaw, a participating artist. “It’s what everybody wishes they could do when they go to a museum.”Ms. Brokaw is not only a participant: the tour was her idea, she said in a recent telephone interview. She was inspired by the annual tour run for the past 25 years by the Artists Alliance of East Hampton. “I always felt that our area had a lot of very good artists that needed to share their art with the community as well,” Ms. Brokaw said.With the help of a fellow artist, Pam Capozzola, Ms. Brokaw started the newer tour, which covers the area from East Quogue to East Moriches. Visitors may drop by any or all of 18 locations, including more than a dozen private studios and galleries, like the Full Moon Arts Center, where several artists will be grouped. About 50 artists will participate, and many will be working.Proceeds from the tour benefit Family Counseling Services, which provides a variety of mental health services with fees on a sliding scale based on income.The artwork on display — and for sale — will be diverse, Ms. Brokaw said. “We have potters, we have woodworkers, we have photographers, we have traditional oil painters,” she said. Her own work, she added, is not exactly traditional. “I’m a visionary artist,” she said, “a self-taught, outsider artist.”'"

"'10-08-08,'0','Both companies press these albums in limited editions of 2,500 per title. Music Matters has released 64 titles so far, with 116 more in the works. Analogue has put out 32. Each title sells for $50 (through direct order from their Web sites, musicmattersjazz.com and acousticsounds.com).Fifty bucks may seem outlandish for a record album. But if your turntable cost a few thousand dollars, and your stereo system cost much more, it’s not out of line, especially since these reissues sound better than originals costing 10 to 100 times as much (when you can find them).“The Blue Note sound”, as devotees call it, was the creation of Rudy Van Gelder, an optometrist who, starting in the early 1950s, took off a day or two each week to record jazz musicians in his parents’ living room in Hackensack, N.J. Demand for his talents grew so steadily that in 1959, at the age of 35, he quit his practice, built a studio in nearby Englewood Cliffs and became a recording engineer full time.Michael Cuscuna, a record producer who has deeply plumbed the Blue Note archive, said: “Rudy went to see a lot of live jazz as a young man. His goal, as an engineer, was to capture that live experience on tape.”There were a handful of great jazz engineers at the time: Fred Plaut at Columbia, Roy Goodman at RCA, Val Valentin at Verve, Roy DuNann at Contemporary. (Some audiophile companies — Speakers Corner, ORG, Music On Vinyl and Pure Pleasure — have also reissued LPs of their albums.)“What made Rudy distinctive,” Mr. Cuscuna said, “was that he had no fear. Other engineers were cautious at setting levels. Rudy pushed it to the edge. He got more signal, more music, more power — this saturation of sound. When you listen to Jackie McLean playing saxophone on a Blue Note album, you hear all this wind pushing through the horn. There’s this up-close, you-are-there sound.”In 1994 Mike Hobson, who owned a high-end audio store in Lower Manhattan, approached Mr. Cuscuna with the idea of reissuing a series of Blue Notes on high-quality vinyl. Mr. Hobson, then 35, had just started Classic Records and was making vinyl reissues of RCA Living Stereo classical LPs, the originals of which were audiophile collectors’ items.Mr. Cuscuna helped Mr. Hobson select titles and arrange licensing rights. Classic’s first Blue Note reissues — famous titles like John Coltrane’s “Blue Train” and Cannonball Adderley’s “Somethin’ Else” — came out in 1996 and sold well enough to spur more.Initially he cut these LPs at 33 1/3 r.p.m. That was daring enough: CDs had reigned supreme for nearly a decade; most audiophiles figured vinyl was dead. Still, Mr. Hobson ultimately wanted to make 45s, and he cut some test pressings just to hear them. They sounded much better.The grooves on an LP are the music’s actual acoustic waves, etched on a master disc’s cutting lathe. A turntable’s cartridge traces those grooves; the signal, when amplified, reproduces the sound.On standard-speed LPs, however, some grooves, especially those representing very quiet sounds, are so tiny and so tightly curved that no cartridge can track them perfectly. As a result fine details — the full shimmer of a cymbal, the vibrating wood of a bass, the sense of real people playing in a real space — get a little bit smeared.But the grooves on a 45-r.p.m. LP are spread out more widely. Their undulations are much less sharp, so they’re easier to navigate. “The cartridge ferrets out a lot more low-level detail within the groove’s walls,” Mr. Hobson said. “It connects you a little more closely to the live music. We’re trying to do time traveling here.”In the mid-1970s a handful of small labels released albums of new music at 45 r.p.m. They never sold enough to generate even a minor trend, but they sounded amazingly vivid.In 1998 Mr. Hobson took a leap and released his first 45-r.p.m. reissues, starting with RCA Living Stereos. In 2000 he moved on to some Blue Notes. (The first ones were, again, the Coltrane and Adderley LPs.) He pressed only a few hundred copies of each. “And they didn’t exactly fly out the window,” he recalled.One problem might have been that he went too far. He’d heard tests in which single-sided LPs — with grooves on one side, a flat blank surface on the other — sounded better than two-sided LPs. (This may seem crazy, but it’s true; I’ve heard the same tests.) So he put out his 45s like that, meaning each album had to be spread out across not just two slabs of vinyl but four. “I figured if we’re going all out, let’s go all out,” he recalled. But these records were very expensive to make, and even audiophiles found them unwieldy.Still, those who heard them were impressed with the sound. One was Chad Kassem, president of Analogue Productions. A canny entrepreneur who speaks in a slow New Orleans drawl, Mr. Kassem started collecting records in 1986, when he was 24. He turned it into a business four years later, first buying and selling private collections, then manufacturing LP reissues, including albums from Fantasy’s Original Jazz Classics catalog, like Bill Evans’s “Waltz for Debbie” and Sonny Rollins’s “Way Out West.”After hearing Classic’s 45s Mr. Kassem put out the first of 100 Fantasy albums in 45 r.p.m. (though on just two LPs per title, not four), in editions of 1,000, for $50 each. About half the titles sold out.Around this time Ron Rambach and Joe Harley started thinking about joining the game. Mr. Rambach had run the archive for Leon Leavitt, the world’s largest purveyor of rare jazz records. Mr. Harley was (and still is) vice president of a high-end audio manufacturer, AudioQuest, and had produced some jazz records on the side.Both were passionate about Blue Note and decided they’d reissue only Blue Note albums. Initially they were going to put them out at 33 1/3 r.p.m., but after they heard Mr. Kassem’s Fantasy 45s, they knew they had to match that sonic standard.They took the competition up a notch by meticulously recreating the Blue Note album covers, matching the Pantone colors and the 3-mil laminate lettering, even using the original photos rather than simply taking a digital scan. And rather than putting each of the two discs inside one record sleeve, they made gatefold covers and filled the inside spaces with fine reproductions of the famous photos that Francis Wolff took at the recording sessions.Finally they decided to reissue some of the more adventurous Blue Notes. Classic and Analogue had focused on more commercial hard-bop artists (for example, Hank Mobley and Art Blakey). Music Matters did some of that too, but also reissued the likes of Eric Dolphy’s “Out to Lunch” and Andrew Hill’s “Point of Departure.”In the meantime Mr. Kassem has moved on to reissuing 45-r.p.m. LPs from the Verve and Impulse jazz catalogs. Kevin Gray, of RTI and AcousTech, who masters LPs for Analogue and Music Matters, and for several larger pop-music labels, is cutting more vinyl now than at any other time in his company’s 15-year history, he said. Last year 2.5 million LPs were sold nationwide, up from 1.9 million in 2008 and 990,000 in ’07. These figures amount to less than 2 percent of the music market, but they’re at their highest level in two decades.The 45-r.p.m. LP is a fringe phenomenon, but it’s the fine-laced fringe of a market that’s in revival. Mr. Rambach said, “There’s plenty of room for everyone.”'"
"'10-08-08,'0','Economists may assert that we’re in the early stages of a recovery, but surveys continue to show that the impact of the Great Recession on American families is deep, widespread and grim. A Pew Research poll published last month indicated that more than half of all adults in the U.S. labor force had experienced some “work-related hardship” — a period of unemployment, a pay cut, a reduction in work hours or an involuntary move to part-time employment — since the recession began in December 2007. A report in March from the Population Reference Bureau showed that more than 70 percent of Americans age 40 and over felt they had been affected by the economic crisis. Government data indicate that the net worth of the average American household has shrunk by about 20 percent — the greatest such decline since the end of World War II. Long-term unemployment — joblessness lasting six months or more — is also at its highest level since the mid-1940s. According to recent data from the Rockefeller Institute, 20 percent of Americans have seen their available household income decline by 25 percent or more.And yet, despite this bleak reality, some talk persists of silver linings: less cash to spend means less materialism, a real change to “the definition of living well,” as Jim Taylor, a vice president of Harrison Group, a market research firm in Waterbury, Conn., told The Times as the big banks melted down in the fall of 2008. At that time, unemployed Wall Street dads were said to be discovering the unexpected joys of domesticity. Minivan moms in the summertime learned that days at the public beach were just as rewarding as playing tennis while the kids improved themselves at foreign-language camp. The glue of all this new happiness was meant to be togetherness — a belief that still sustains reports that people are volunteering more, pulling together and even replacing their propensity to compete with their neighbors with a new spirit of cooperation and solidarity. “There’s a new level of social coordination,” says Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist at Duke University, relating to me how parents of his acquaintance recently agreed to a multilateral halt in the escalation of kid-birthday-party madness in favor of back-to-basics cake and balloons. “In some areas of our life we’re resetting. Over time, we may get de-escalation.”This glass-half-full narrative, the popular trope that the Great Recession will ennoble us by purging us of our excesses, has, as its reference point, the Great Depression — or a certain idea of the Great Depression. After all, we’ve been told countless times, the Depression put an end to the libertine individualism of the flapper age: families stayed home and played Monopoly, finding strength and sustenance with one another. Missing from this rosy picture, however, historians point out, is the fact that, as Steven Mintz, a Columbia University historian puts it, “they had no choice.” The atmosphere was often pretty rotten in those times of togetherness, he says, and many kids reacted by getting away from their parents as quickly as possible: “Teenagers who were unhappy with their families created a separate culture, a teenage culture, for the first time. Their family lives were unpleasant — their fathers were depressed — these kids separated themselves.”What the Great Depression was actually like — mostly wretched — and how we frequently choose to think of it — as ultimately redemptive — are two very different things. Our society didn’t fully come together over the New Deal; the opposition to it was fierce. What would bring Americans their strongest sense of unity, a powerful sense of purpose and energy — and ultimately, jobs and large-scale, life-bettering educational opportunities — was the cataclysm of World War II, according to the historian Glen Elder Jr., author of the classic “Children of the Great Depression.”Our nostalgia for the Depression speaks volumes about how we feel not just about the past but also about our lives today. A craving for a simpler, slower, more centered life, one less consumed by the soul-emptying crush of getting and spending, runs deep within our culture right now. It was born of the boom, and not just because of the materialism of that era but also because of the work it took then to keep a family afloat, at a time of rising home prices and health care costs, frozen real wages and the pressures of an ever-widening income gap. As the recent Rockefeller report showed, for most families the miseries of the Great Recession don’t represent a break from the recent past, just a significant worsening of the stresses they’ve been under for years and years.That the Great Recession could then bring hope for a major recalibration — a resetting of all the clocks — is not surprising. Unfortunately, though, it’s not happening in any meaningful way. The poor are getting poorer, and the rich, despite stock-market setbacks, are still comparatively rich. The most devastating losses in household wealth over the past two years have been suffered by the middle class. And families are fraying at the seams. The Pew poll showed nearly half of people who had been unemployed for more than six months saying their family relationships had become strained, and a New York Times/CBS poll of unemployed adults last winter found about 40 percent saying they believed their joblessness was causing behavioral change in their children.Parents who have jobs are working longer hours than ever. Mothers are taking shorter maternity leaves. The birth rate is on the decline. The divorce rate is declining, too — it’s too expensive for people to break up their households — but that’s not necessarily a family-friendly thing, as a report from the Council on Contemporary Families noted in April: “We know from the experience of the Great Depression of the 1930s that divorce rates can fall while family conflict and domestic violence rates rise.”'"
"'10-08-08,'0','At least some airlines are not gouging their customers. Southwest does not charge passengers a fee to change a ticket and never will, said Brad Hawkins, a Southwest spokesman (though it does charge any fare difference). Airtran charges $75 for ticket changes, as do Alaska and Virgin America if you change your ticket online; by phone, it’s $100.In June, American introduced a “boarding and flexibility” package that gives you a $75 discount on flight changes, as well as early boarding and free standby, for $9 to $19, depending on the flight. Yes, you can now pay a fee to possibly reduce your fees, and that is not a late-night monologue joke.When I recently flew from New York City to Detroit on Delta Airlines, I had a three-hour layover before my flight to Traverse City, Mich., so I tried to get on an earlier flight. But Delta no longer offers free standby travel; instead, you can pay $50 for a confirmed seat on an earlier flight.American, Continental, United and US Airways have all adopted a similar $50 “same-day confirmed” option, essentially eliminating free standby travel — unless you’re an elite frequent flier or paid a higher fare. AirTran, JetBlue and Virgin America still allow free standby travel, or you can pay a fee to switch to an earlier flight.Here’s my problem with these fees: they’re completely one-sided in favor of the airlines. On the outbound leg of my trip, mechanical problems caused me to miss my connection and spend several extra hours in Detroit, but when Delta had the chance to get me to my destination early, I was asked to pay. Eliminating standby travel is also counter to an efficient flow of passengers: by filling empty seats with passengers who are ready and waiting, carriers can open up seats on later flights — potentially accommodating other travelers.When I finally boarded my flight (which was delayed by rain), an elderly man ahead of me was turned away at the gate because his boarding pass was for a later flight. He seemed confused about why he couldn’t board, but the agent brushed him aside. There may not have been an empty seat to give him, but with storms bearing down, why not try to get an old man to his destination? Because there’s a fee for that.The fee to book a ticket by phone rather than doing it yourself online is now $15 to $35 on most airlines, except Southwest, which doesn’t charge.If airline Web sites worked perfectly, and displayed every flight option, with clear disclosures about rules and fees, those fees might be justifiable. But Web sites have glitches, they don’t typically show every flight option, and online ticketing is only getting more confusing as carriers hawk hotel rooms, rental cars and travel insurance during the checkout process and make fee information difficult to find.Many travelers did not grow up with a mouse in hand, and they should not be penalized for needing human help with an expensive, complicated ticket purchase.Last fall, many airlines began imposing holiday surcharges for travel around Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s — a practice that expanded to “peak travel” surcharges of $10 to $30 almost every day this summer.Most travelers aren’t aware of these surcharges because they are not listed separately in price quotes, but FareCompare.com has compiled a helpful chart showing how much you’ll pay for peak travel through early 2011.Rick Seaney, FareCompare’s chief executive, said this strategy allows airlines to raise fares on specific days, rather than across the board, which is a legitimate business practice, but why not tell customers?“Having a bunch of unbundled fees and add-ons makes it more complicated for people to compare apples to apples,” Mr. Seaney said.That appears to be the airlines’ goal, although the government may step in and require clearer disclosure of fees. For now, your best bet is to bookmark SmarterTravel.com’s “Ultimate Guide to Airline Fees,” which lists most fees charged by different carriers. Or fly Southwest, which has committed to not charging for any service that has historically been free.“We’re sticking a stake in the ground on that,” Mr. Hawkins said.'"

"'10-08-09,'1','The Cowboys hope this is the opening step, small as it was, toward becoming the first team to play in a Super Bowl in its home stadium. But that goal will take months, and the most memorable item this weekend for the team will remain Smith’s entry into the Hall of Fame.“Having Emmitt inducted into the Hall of Fame is special,” linebacker DeMarcus Ware said. “For us now playing for the Cowboys, it does make it extra special.”Most of the teams’ regulars worked short shifts, but at least the Cowboys’ starters looked sharp during their stints.Tony Romo led the offense to the Cincinnati 2 with a steady opening drive before stalling, and David Buehler kicked a 20-yard field goal. Romo completed 5 of 10 passes for 59 yards. Owens caught two passes for 18 yards and was thrown to four times by Carson Palmer.SEAHAWKS APPRECIATE OFFICIAL’S ADMISSION The Seattle Seahawks say they appreciate that the official Bill Leavy admitted that he made two bad calls in their Super Bowl loss — and now they’re ready to move on. Nine players remain from the team’s lone Super Bowl appearance in 2006, including quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. He was whistled for a low block on what appeared to be a legal tackle on an interception return in the fourth quarter of the loss to Pittsburgh.The Steelers used the better field position from the penalty on Hasselbeck to score the clinching touchdown in Pittsburgh’s 21-10 victory.“It’s a game; it’s not a perfect science,” Hasselbeck said Saturday, after Leavy again worked at the Seahawks’ training camp practice. “There’s a lot of human involvement there. I’ve played some games that I remember because I feel I did a good job and I remember some other games where I have regrets. That goes for any sport, any player.”Leavy and his crew have been at Seahawks camp the past several days as part of the league’s summer tour of officials informing teams of new rules and interpretations.Leavy told the Seattle-area news media Friday night that he “kicked two calls in the fourth quarter and I impacted the game.” He said he will “go to my grave wishing I’d been better.”FALCONS RECEIVER OUT Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Michael Jenkins will miss four to six weeks with a right shoulder injury.

Flores said he eventually leaned Gill against his police car to keep him from falling.The Colts spokesman Craig Kelley said the team was aware of the incident but did not have all the details and had no comment. Gill is in his second year with the Colts and played in a scrimmage game Saturday.BRONCOS CANCEL PRACTICE The Denver Broncos ensured they would not lose another player to injury Sunday by canceling their practice.

"'10-08-09,'1','“We recreated the $19.99 drugstore alarm clock radio and turned it into a $100 product,” Mr. Ashkenazi said.To increase the likelihood of success with its first Apple accessory, the company purposely mimicked the Apple style in its earliest designs. “Our instructions to our designers were ‘Make it look like Apple designed it,’ ” Mr. Ashkenazi said. Its first product, the iH5, was housed in a white plastic case and packaged in a clean box with minimal graphics. “This was the opposite of our Timex boxes,” he said.“This was a real challenge for us. You get no help from Apple except for specs and requirements. We knew we had something big when stores mistakenly called our products ‘iHome by Apple,’ ” Mr. Ashkenazi said.It transformed the private company, now run by the children and grandchildren of the men who started the company near the foot of Fifth Avenue in New York. It gets the bulk of its revenue from its 20 types of iPod and iPhone audio accessories.With 20 percent of the speaker dock market, the company has twice the market share of Sony, its nearest competitor. It also dwarfs Memorex, iLive and Bose.“IHome has done a good job keeping pace and growing their portfolio,” said Ross Rubin, director of industry analysis at the research firm NPD. “They established the clock dock category and created many variations.”Not that the company has not made mistakes. An under-the-counter kitchen iPod dock failed to attract customers. “It was expensive, and you had to drill under a cabinet to install it,” Mr. Ashkenazi said.In the hotel market, though, the company has placed more than two million alarm clocks with iPod and iPhone docks in almost 40 percent of the 4.9 million hotel rooms in the United States, according hotelnewsnow.com. It cleverly gave itself an edge by designing an iPod alarm clock that would ring only once and then reset itself, preventing the next guest in the room from being unexpectedly awakened at 5:30 in the morning.Responding to the current obsession with software applications, or apps, for the iPhone or iPad, the company has created its first app-aware alarm clock. Its free iHome+Sleep app allows an iPhone user to customize the phone with sleep, wake and music instructions.When a traveler docks the iPhone to the hotel alarm clock, the proper settings are used. That way, a weary traveler never has to figure out how the alarm clock works. The app also handles Twitter messages and aggregates news and weather that is displayed on the iPhone upon awakening.Its first iPad-compatible product, the $199 iA100, will be sold later this year at its usual outlets, including Best Buy and Apple stores. Like all accessories manufacturers, iHome had to wait until the iPad was in stores before it could learn its dimensions and specs.It reconfigured an earlier, iPhone-only design to accommodate the iPad. The iA100, equipped with Bluetooth, can stream music from an unconnected iPhone or iPad across a room. The iA100’s clock also syncs to the correct time on an iPhone or iPad.Given the iPad’s larger battery capacity, Mr. Ashkenazi’s designers were not concerned with having it continuously connected to the docking station to be recharged. To appeal to video game players, iHome increased the unit’s sound quality by incorporating four speakers and enhanced bass response.Though Apple’s products are selling well, some analysts say SDI Technologies is still taking a risk by relying on one company’s products.“You’re tied to the core,” said Robert Enderle, president of the Enderle Group research firm. “If the Android smartphone market takes off, you’re in trouble.”Mr. Ashkenazi is not worried. “The iPad, iPhone and iPod are recession-proof,” he said.'"

"'10-08-10,'0','Since its discovery in a New York State cave in 2006, the fungus called Geomyces destructans has killed about a million cave-dwelling bats of several different species, including the most common Northeastern species, the little brown bat.A new study, published in Science last week, concludes that little brown bats are likely to be extinct within two decades, possibly sooner. According to bat conservation experts, this is “the most precipitous decline of North American wildlife in recorded history” — worse than the destruction of the American bison and the passenger pigeon.Bats afflicted with white-nose syndrome show white fungal splotches. Irritated by the fungus, which destroys the underlying tissue, bats rouse from hibernation early, depleting their energy reserves. Most bats infected with the syndrome are grossly underweight. In some caves, all the bats have died. And the disease has spread with astonishing speed, reaching Oklahoma this spring. In response, state and federal agencies have begun keeping humans out of caves and abandoned mines where bats roost in hopes of slowing the fungus.It is difficult to imagine that an entire species, whose numbers are historically very large, could actually disappear. It is even more difficult, but equally unpleasant, to imagine how their disappearance might change an entire ecosystem.The sky at dusk used to be filled with those predators, each one eating its body weight in insects nightly. Without them, the balance of nature will be changed, with potentially significant impact on agriculture and forestry, which have always depended — almost without knowing it — on the role of insectivorous bats.Earlier this year, President Obama approved $1.9 million for research on white-nose syndrome, but that figure needs to be increased sharply at the earliest opportunity. We need to do everything we can to understand and counteract this terrible scourge.'"
"'10-08-10,'0','Jorge Posada led off with a single before Marcus Thames drove a 1-1 pitch — a sinker that did not sink — off the top of the wall near the Yankees’ bullpen in right-center field for a double.“Guys had good at-bats,” Austin Kearns said. “It’s hot out there. I don’t know if he lost a little something. It’s hard to tell.”After Kearns was hit by a cutter to load the bases, the left-handed-hitting Curtis Granderson came to the plate. That allowed Red Sox Manager Terry Francona to keep the left-handed Lester in the game for one more batter. Lester had thrown 95 pitches.“As the inning was unfolding, we wanted him to get through Granderson,” Francona said.The decision made sense. Granderson is a .209 lifetime hitter against left-handers, and he has continued to struggle against them, batting .206 this season.“I’m honestly not sure,” Granderson said, speaking about his problems against left-handers. “I just try and go up there and get a feel. That’s been my theme and philosophy all year long.”Granderson fouled off two pitches that were out of the strike zone before striking out on a 1-2 curveball that buckled beneath his swing. Francona then lifted Lester and brought in Bard.Bard pumped six straight fastballs, none of them slower than 98 miles per hour. Francona called it the “perfect situation” for Bard, who needed only six pitches to strike out Derek Jeter and Nick Swisher to end the inning — crisis averted.“I was just trying to keep them in the infield, not necessarily strike them out,” Bard said. “It happened to be two strikeouts.”In Jeter’s at-bat, Bard attacked inside with the first two pitches, then changed Jeter’s eye level with a pitch high out of the strike zone. It was effective: Jeter chased it and missed.Bard took the opposite approach with Swisher, throwing three pitches outside. Bard’s last pitch tailed away from the left-handed-hitting Swisher, who flailed at it.“That last pitch he threw at me, man, 99 miles per hour,” Swisher said. “It’s not supposed to move like that.”Bard said he was motivated by the fear of failure on the mound. The Red Sox began the day seven games behind the Yankees in the American League East, and Bard said he did not want to be the one who lost the game for Boston in a pivotal situation.Instead, the Yankees went down swinging.'"
"'10-08-10,'0','SLUM tourism has a long history — during the late 1800s, lines of wealthy New Yorkers snaked along the Bowery and through the Lower East Side to see “how the other half lives.”But with urban populations in the developing world expanding rapidly, the opportunity and demand to observe poverty firsthand have never been greater. The hot spots are , — thanks to the film that started a thousand tours — and my home, Kibera, a slum that is perhaps the largest in .Slum tourism has its advocates, who say it promotes social awareness. And it’s good money, which helps the local economy.But it’s not worth it. Slum tourism turns poverty into entertainment, something that can be momentarily experienced and then escaped from. People think they’ve really “seen” something — and then go back to their lives and leave me, my family and my community right where we were before.I was 16 when I first saw a slum tour. I was outside my 100-square-foot house washing dishes, looking at the utensils with longing because I hadn’t eaten in two days. Suddenly a white woman was taking my picture.

"'10-08-10,'0','According to the Jets, they remain far apart mainly in regard to total compensation. Revis is scheduled to make a relatively paltry $1 million this season, despite Coach Rex Ryan’s consistent lauding of Revis as the best defensive player in football. Revis wants an extension that pays him more than Nnamdi Asomugha, whose deal for more than $15 million a year is considered an aberration by the Jets.The latest proposal from Revis’s side contained “technical changes,” Tannenbaum said, but no fundamental changes. Revis’s agents have not commented specifically on negotiations during his holdout.“We still have a very fundamental difference on what appropriate compensation should be,” Tannenbaum told reporters at training camp. “Until we get that solved, there’s really not much to discuss.”If Revis does not report by Tuesday (he has until midnight), he will lose one year accrual toward free agency under the N.F.L.’s labor agreement. By not reporting to training camp thus far, Revis already has turned his combined salary for 2011 and 2012, a total of $20 million, from guaranteed to nonguaranteed money. He is also receiving a fine of more than $16,000 each day. A new deal would more than make up for all of that.His representatives have indicated Revis would not report to camp without one. Pressed for specifics — like where Revis is, how he is passing his time and whether this constituted progress — Feinsod declined to comment.As to when a deal will be made, Tannenbaum said: “I have absolutely no idea. Do I hope it was a month ago? Sure. But until there’s a deal that makes sense for both sides, he’s not here, and there’s nothing we can do about that.”Last week, Ryan said that Revis would start in the regular-season opener against Baltimore if he showed up “the day before.” But on Monday, smiling and with a shrug, Ryan said he made that comment facetiously.“My thing is, I’m just coaching this group,” Ryan added. “We’re going to prepare like he’s not going to be here.

"'10-08-10,'0','I agree with Frank Micciche that creation of the state health insurance exchanges is a key to achieving health care reform’s lofty goals.But I do not understand why states need flexibility “to determine which benefits their exchanges must offer” because “each state has different needs.” For policy holders, health insurance has only one goal: to help them pay for needed medical care. One of the new law’s regrettable provisions already permits health insurers to offer four levels of plans. The least expensive ones reduce the comprehensiveness of coverage by requiring more out-of-pocket payments — up to 40 percent of the cost of services.People who can afford only less expensive plans often cannot pay the out-of-pocket cost of the care they need. That is the story of the 25 million underinsured Americans who value insurance enough to buy it, but then find that it does not provide access to needed care because of the high cost sharing.Instead of giving states flexibility to vary the content and terms of coverage still more, federal regulators should require that the states’ exchanges carry out the intent of the law by making comprehensive coverage accessible to those who do not have it through employment.The writer is a professor at the Boston University School of Management and the author of “Still Broken: Understanding the U.S. Health Care System.”'"

"'10-08-10,'0','Dr. Hsueh cautions, though, that “no one can guarantee success” with human eggs. He is a basic scientist and is not planning to treat patients.Dr. Louis DePaolo, chief of the reproductive sciences branch at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, emphasizes that the method is still experimental.“This is something that is possible,” he said, “but further refinement needs to be done.” At this point, he says, “you wouldn’t say to a patient, ‘Let’s try this.’ ”The results may also help scientists generate human embryonic stem cells. A problem with getting those cells has been that it is hard to get many mature human eggs for fertilization. Now, Dr. Hsueh says he wants to try to use immature eggs from ovary tissue of women who had their ovaries removed for other reasons. He hopes to nudge the immature eggs to mature.Scientists have long been amazed by the egg maturation process. A baby girl has 800,000 immature eggs in her ovaries when she is born. When she reaches puberty and starts to ovulate, 1,000 of those egg cells start to develop each month. All but one egg typically drop off along the way. No one knows what happens to all the eggs that do not make it.“They presumably die,” Dr. Hsueh said. “Except for some more advanced follicles, no one knows at what stage most of them die.”Fertility treatments use hormones to help eggs that are already far along to mature. But as happens with women just starting menopause, there may be no eggs that are far along. Until now, nothing could be done.The impetus behind the discovery was an accidental finding by other researchers. They had removed a gene in mice and saw something strange and unexpected: all of the animals’ immature eggs started to mature. The mice, in fact, ended up being infertile later in life; they had used up all of their eggs at once.That led to a realization that the key to making immature eggs develop is to inhibit an enzyme known as PTEN and add a protein fragment to help activate the eggs. Stopping that enzyme took the brakes off egg development. With an extra push from the activating protein, the eggs began to grow.Now, Dr. Hsueh says, the investigators improved the methods they report in their new paper. Of course, they do not want to use up all the eggs in an ovary at once. Instead, he said, the idea is to take a small piece of ovary, activate its primordial eggs and put it back in the body, allowing the eggs to grow and mature.The finding, Dr. DePaolo said, “rises to the level of important,” and not only because it may give women more options when their ovaries fail. In addition, he said, the work provides “basic knowledge of how these early-stage follicles get going.”'"
"'10-08-10,'0','Complicating matters, a vocal minority of Fed officials is skeptical that deflation — a spiral of falling wages and prices, which Japan’s economy has experienced since the 1990s — is even a worry.“The outcome of this meeting is more uncertain than in any in at least the last year,” said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor.At the Fed’s last meeting, in June, the prospect of deflation was discussed for the first time this year.Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman for 18 years until he retired in 2006, said Friday that the economic outlook had darkened. “It strikes me as a pause in the recovery, but a pause in this type of recovery feels like a quasi-recession,” he said.He added: “At this particular moment, disinflationary pressures are paramount. They will not last indefinitely.”Mr. Greenspan said there had been “some evidence of a pickup in inflation” until the Greek debt crisis took hold in the spring. But the resulting uncertainty drove down long-term interest rates — the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.82 percent on Friday, the lowest level since April 2009, and barely budged Monday — in a reflection of what Mr. Greenspan called continuing problems in the financial markets.Mr. Greenspan declined to make recommendations or predictions for Fed policy, but on Wall Street, there is already talk that the Fed could begin a new round of quantitative easing — buying financial assets to hold down long-term interest rates and increase the supply of money.Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for Goldman Sachs, predicted on Friday that the Fed would begin a new round of asset purchases — which could include at least $1 trillion worth of Treasury securities — late this year or early next year. He revised down his forecast for the growth of gross domestic product in 2011 to 1.9 percent from 2.4 percent. He also predicted that unemployment would hit 10 percent in the second quarter of next year.Among the voting members of the central bank’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, the presidents of the Fed’s Boston and St. Louis district banks have warned recently about the threat of deflation, while the Kansas City bank president is known for his view that inflation, the Fed’s traditional enemy, remains the greatest threat. But it is Mr. Bernanke who holds the most say over the outcome.Randall S. Kroszner, a former Fed governor, said the committee was certain to alter its outlook in its statement on Tuesday.“I think the language will broadly change to acknowledge the moderation in the pace of the recovery,” he said.Mr. Kroszner said it seemed increasingly likely that the Fed could announce that it would reinvest the cash it receives as the mortgage bonds it holds mature, rather than letting its balance sheet gradually shrink over time.In March, the Fed completed its purchase of $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. A decision to reinvest the bond proceeds in other mortgage-related securities, or in Treasuries, would be largely symbolic but carry great weight, as it would signal concern about the economy, and also make clear that an “exit strategy” from easy monetary policy was not imminent.The Fed might also be poised to discuss two other options: lowering the interest rate it pays on the roughly $1 trillion in reserves that banks are keeping at the Fed in excess of what they are required to, and altering the “extended period” language it has been using to describe how long short-term interest rates will remain at “exceptionally low” levels.Frederic S. Mishkin, another former Fed governor, said that most recoveries hit speed bumps, and that economic indicators contained considerable statistical “noise.” He said the Fed would be prudent not to overreact.“It’s not clear the Fed needs to ease at this point,” Mr. Mishkin said. “If the recovery gets back on track they are still going to have to worry about an exit strategy. Quantitative easing is not a trivial matter. The expansion of the balance sheet leads to many complications for the Federal Reserve.”But Mr. Meyer, the former Fed govenor, said the committee should take into account not just the probability of various outcomes, but the potential damage associated with each of them.“Because the cost of a slowdown in growth is so dramatic relative to that of higher inflation, they should follow the risk-management strategy that Greenspan espoused during the last deflation scare,” he said.During that period, in 2002-3, the Fed kept interest rates low, as the economy recovered from the 2001 recession, to guard against deflation. Those fears did not come to pass. But some now say the Fed kept rates too low for too long, feeding the housing bubble.“It is by no means a slam dunk,” Mr. Meyer said of the Fed’s decision.'"
"'10-08-10,'0','Pet owners might like to think they can judge the moods of their cats or dogs with ease, but finding true scientific methods to evaluate animal emotion is difficult.In a review published in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B, researchers describe a framework that may help other scientists measure animal mood.Because it is difficult to otherwise judge an animal’s emotional state, the researchers devised a model that correlates emotional state to decision making. An animal that adopts a “safety first” stance to a rustle in the forest is probably feeling pessimistic, according to the framework. Conversely, an animal feeling optimistic would interpret the same rustle as a sign of prey.In creating the framework, the researchers used earlier data they gathered on rodents as well as previous research evaluating the moods of sheep and pigs when placed in different environments.“A lot of this comes from research on humans, too,” said Mike Mendl, an animal behavior researcher at the University of Bristol School of Clinical Veterinary Science and the study’s lead author. “But humans are very complicated. In animals, we can think about it in a more simpler way.”'"
"'10-08-10,'0','At the time, Merrill said it had initially excluded the difference because it thought it had protected itself with various hedges.But many of those hedges later failed, and Merrill, the brokerage giant that brought Wall Street to Main Street, soon collapsed into the arms of Bank of America.“It’s like the parable of the blind man and the elephant: you had some people feeling the trunk and some the legs, and there was nobody putting it all together,” Gary Witt, a former managing director at Moody’s Investors Service who now teaches at Temple University, said of the situation at Merrill and other banks.Wall Street has come a long way since the dark days of 2008, when the near collapse of American finance heralded the end of flush times for many people. But even now, two years on, regulators are still trying to piece together how so much went so wrong on Wall Street.The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether banks adequately disclosed their financial risks during the boom and subsequent bust. The question has taken on new urgency now that Citigroup has agreed to pay $75 million to settle S.E.C. claims that it misled investors about its exposure to collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s.As Merrill did with vehicles like Pyxis, Citigroup shifted much of the risks associated with its C.D.O.’s off its books, only to have those risks boomerang. Jessica Oppenheim, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, declined to comment.Such financial tactics, and the S.E.C.’s inquiry into banks’ disclosures, raise thorny questions for policy makers. The investigation throws an uncomfortable spotlight on the vast network of hedge funds and “special purpose vehicles” that financial companies still use to finance their operations and the investments they create.The recent overhaul of financial regulation did little to address this shadow banking system. Nor does it address whether banking executives should be required to disclose more about the risks their banks take.Most Wall Street firms disclosed little about their mortgage holdings before the crisis, in part because many executives thought the investments were safe. But in some cases, executives failed to grasp the potential dangers partly because the risks were obscured, even to them, via off-balance-sheet programs.Executives’ decisions about what to disclose may have been clouded by hopes that the market would recover, analysts said.“There was probably some misplaced optimism that it would work out,” said John McDonald, a banking analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “But in a time of high uncertainty, maybe the disclosure burden should be pushed towards greater disclosure.”The Pyxis episode begins in 2006, when the overheated and overleveraged housing market was beginning its painful decline.During the bubble years, many Wall Street banks built a lucrative business packaging home mortgages into bonds and other investments. But few players were bigger than Merrill Lynch, which became a leader in creating C.D.O.’sInitially, Merrill often relied on credit insurance from the American International Group to make certain parts of its C.D.O.’s attractive to investors. But when A.I.G. stopped writing those policies in early 2006 because of concerns over the housing market, Merrill ended up holding on to more of those pieces itself.So that summer, Merrill Lynch created a group of three traders to reduce its exposure to the fast-sinking mortgage market. According to three former employees with direct knowledge of this group, the traders first tried sell the vestigial C.D.O. investments. If that did not work, they tried to find a foreign bank to finance their own purchase of the C.D.O.’s. If that failed, they turned to Pyxis or similar programs, called Steers and Parcs, as well as to custom trades.These programs generally issued short-term I.O.U.’s to investors and then used that money to buy various assets, including the leftover C.D.O. pieces.But there was a catch. In forming Pyxis and the other programs, Merrill guaranteed the notes they issued by agreeing to take back any securities put in the programs that turned out to be of poor quality. In other words, these vehicles were essentially buying pieces of C.D.O.’s from Merrill using the proceeds of notes guaranteed by Merrill and leaving Merrill on the hook for any losses.To further complicate the matter, Merrill traders sometimes used the cash inside new C.D.O.’s to buy the Pyxis notes, meaning that the C.D.O.’s were investing in Pyxis, even as Pyxis was investing in C.D.O.’s.“It was circular, yes, but it was all ultimately tied to Merrill,” said a former Merrill employee, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to jeopardize ongoing business with Merrill.To provide the guarantee that made all of this work, Merrill entered into a derivatives contract known as a total return swap, obliging it to cover any losses at Pyxis. Citigroup used similar arrangements that the S.E.C. now says should have been disclosed to shareholders in the summer of 2007.One difficulty for the S.E.C. and other investigators is determining exactly when banks should have disclosed more about their mortgage holdings. Banks are required to disclose only what they expect their exposure to be. If they believe they are fully hedged, they can even report that they have no exposure at all. Being wrong is no crime.Moreover, banks can lump all sorts of trades together in their financial statements and are not required to disclose the full face value of many derivatives, including the type of guarantees that Merrill used.“Should they have told us all of their subprime mortgage exposure?” said Jeffery Harte, an analyst with Sandler O’Neill. “Nobody knew that was going to be such a huge problem. The next step is they would be giving us their entire trading book.”Still, Mr. Harte and other analysts said they were surprised in 2007 by Merrill’s escalating exposure and its initial decision not to disclose the full extent of its mortgage holdings. Greater disclosure about Merrill’s mortgage holdings and programs like Pyxis might have raised red flags to senior executives and shareholders, who could have demanded that Merrill stop producing the risky securities that later brought the firm down.Former Merrill employees said it would have been virtually impossible for Merrill to continue to carry out so many C.D.O. deals in 2006 without the likes of Pyxis. Those lucrative deals helped fatten profits in the short term — and hence the annual bonuses paid to its employees. In 2006, even as the seeds of its undoing were being planted, Merrill Lynch paid out more than $5 billion in bonuses.It was not until the autumn of 2007 that Pyxis and its brethren set off alarm bells outside Merrill. C.D.O. specialists at Moody’s pieced together the role of Pyxis and warned Moody’s analysts who rated Merrill’s debt. Merrill soon preannounced a quarterly loss, and Moody’s downgraded the firm’s credit rating. By late 2007, Merrill had added pages of detailed disclosures to its earnings releases.It was too late. The risks inside Merrill, virtually invisible a year earlier, had already mortally wounded one of Wall Street’s proudest names.'"

"'10-08-10,'0','But some proponents of net neutrality say that by excluding wireless and other online services, Google and Verizon are creating a loophole that could allow carriers to circumvent regulation meant to ensure openness.The plan “creates an Internet for the haves and an Internet for the have-nots,” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior vice president and policy director at the Media Access Project, an advocacy group in Washington and a member, along with Google, of the Open Internet Coalition. “It may make some services unaffordable for consumers and access to those services unavailable to new start-ups.”Ivan Seidenberg, chief executive of Verizon, said the proposal excluded cellphone networks because the companies were “concerned about the imposition of too many rules” that could slow the growth of the wireless Web.The proposal also excludes services that broadband providers may create. These services, the companies said, would have to be “distinguishable from traditional broadband Internet access services and are not designed to circumvent the rules.” Mr. Seidenberg said that, for example, the Metropolitan Opera might decide to stream its performances in 3-D through such a service because it would otherwise require too much bandwidth.Mr. Schmidt said Google had no plans to develop these types of online services.But some expressed fears that this exception could let companies bypass open-access regulations. For example, an online video start-up could create a competitor to YouTube that did not run on the public Internet and would pay for faster connections to viewers. As those types of payments grew, the access companies might have less incentive to invest in Internet capacity, pushing more content providers to these special services and creating alternative networks that look similar to cable TV.Jason Hirschhorn, a former president of MySpace and a former executive at MTV Networks, said more questions about the proposal needed to be answered, since the exceptions for new services could be interpreted as “just another way of going against net neutrality.”“Imagine a world where ABC, Comedy Central, MTV, any of these brands, were on some other network, and then there was this open Internet,” he said.Google and Verizon stressed that their plan was not a business deal, but was a policy proposal that both companies intended to follow and that they wanted the Federal Communications Commission to review. The F.C.C., which since June had been convening meetings of Internet companies, carriers and public interest groups to try to come to an agreement on access issues, called off the talks last week after reports that Google and Verizon had come to a private agreement.One F.C.C. commissioner came out against the proposal. “Some will claim this announcement moves the discussion forward. That’s one of its many problems,” the commissioner, Michael J. Copps, said in a statement. “It is time to move a decision forward — a decision to reassert F.C.C. authority over broadband telecommunications, to guarantee an open Internet now and forever, and to put the interests of consumers in front of the interests of giant corporations.”Jen Howard, a spokeswoman for the F.C.C., said that it would not immediately comment on the proposal, and that the views of commissioners did not reflect those of Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman.Mr. Genachowski said last week that “any deal that doesn’t preserve the freedom and openness of the Internet for consumers and entrepreneurs will be unacceptable.”In a speech at the Brookings Institution late last year, Mr. Genachowski addressed the wireless issue, saying that “it is essential that the Internet itself remain open, however users reach it.” But he seemed to show some flexibility on other services.“I also recognize that there may be benefits to innovation and investment of broadband providers offering managed services in limited circumstances,” he said, adding that such services “can supplement — but must not supplant — free and open Internet access.”Rebecca Arbogast, a telecommunications analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, predicted that the F.C.C. would probably demand that any net neutrality rules cover wireless, and that the details of any exceptions for specialized online services be made clear.Silicon Valley companies seemed wary of the proposal. EBay said it would review the suggestions. Paul Misener, vice president for global public policy at Amazon.com, said that although the company agreed that network operators should be able to offer additional services, “we are concerned that this proposal appears to condone services that could harm consumer Internet access.”Groups and companies opposed to open-access regulation also had guarded reactions. AT&T said that it would examine the proposal closely, and that “the Verizon-Google agreement demonstrates that it is possible to bridge differences on this issue.”Gregory L. Rosston, a former deputy chief economist at the Federal Communications Commission and deputy director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, said keeping wireless networks free from regulation made sense, because of good competition among wireless providers. “The more competition you have for broadband access, the less need you have for net-neutrality-type regulation,” he said.'"
"'10-08-10,'0','The treatment is still experimental, said Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr., the senior author of the study, published in the August issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry.Because ketamine is already approved as an anesthetic, physicians could use it off label for other purposes. But Dr. Zarate, a clinical investigator with the National Institute of Mental Health, warns against it.“I’m not encouraging it for clinical use at this time,” he said. “We need more knowledge about safety, and long-term data on efficacy and how it interacts with other antidepressants.”The 18 patients in the study had taken lithium or the anticonvulsant valproate for at least six weeks without getting better. They were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of either ketamine or a placebo saline solution two weeks apart, with each receiving the drug on one occasion and the saline solution on the other. Neither the patients nor the experimenters were told which solution was being delivered.Tests showed that the ketamine patients had significantly fewer depressive symptoms than those who received the placebo — beginning 40 minutes after the infusion and lasting three days. After that, the effect of the ketamine began to fade, and within two weeks those who had received the medicine had about the same symptoms of depression as those who had taken the placebo.There were no serious side effects, although about 10 percent of both those receiving ketamine and those taking the placebo got a headache or nausea, or reported feeling woozy or lethargic after the infusions. The adverse effects associated only with ketamine included feeling strange, having a dry mouth, increased blood pressure or faster heartbeat. After about 80 minutes, there were no differences in side effects between the ketamine and placebo groups.The scientists view these findings as highly significant, because the patients had failed an average of seven antidepressant trials, and more than half had failed to respond to electroconvulsive therapy. But they also emphasized the study’s limitations. The number of patients was small, all were late in the course of their illness, and all were also taking valproate or lithium, which may have affected the results. Finally, there was a small but insignificant placebo effect.Dr. Dost Ongur, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard, doubted that the experiment could be truly double-blinded — the vivid effects of injected ketamine can be easy to perceive, both by the patient and by the person giving the injection.Still, he was impressed. “This is a solid piece of work that really has the potential for being a true advance,” he said. “There is real hope, there is real excitement around this, even though there is skepticism from some quarters.”'"
"'10-08-10,'0','A large Chinese study suggests that otherwise healthy teenagers are much more vulnerable to depression if they spend too much time on the Internet.Researchers who followed more than 1,000 students at high schools in Guangzhou — all of them free of anxiety and depression at the start of the study — found that after nine months, rates of severe depression among “pathological” users were 2.5 times those of the others.The study was published Aug. 2 in Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. It used self-rating scales to assess anxiety and depression, along with an addiction test that asks questions like “How often do you feel depressed, moody or nervous when you are offline, which goes away once you are back online?”Of the 1,041 subjects, 94 percent were classified as normal Internet users and 6 percent as moderately pathological or at severe risk for addiction. After nine months, 87 students, or 8.4 percent, developed mild to severe depression.While depression is an established risk factor for excessive Internet use, the study suggests the reverse may also be true, said the lead author, Dr. Lawrence T. Lam, of the School of Medicine, Sydney, in Australia. He speculated that users often went days or weeks without getting enough sleep, which can contribute to depression, and tended to react intensely to the online game world.“Failure in the game-playing is as real as failure in other parts of their life,” he said.'"
"'10-08-10,'0','Despite the violence, one of the worst attacks on relief workers in the country’s recent history, the International Assistance Mission said it had no plans to leave the country, but was suspending further medical expeditions for lack of experienced personnel.“Two of them had 30 years of experience, local contacts and spoke Dari fluently,” Mr. Frans said. “They are irreplaceable.”He was referring to the team leader, Mr. Little, and his longtime friend and colleague, Dan Terry, both Americans who were among the 10 workers gunned down last week in Badakhshan Province after trekking 100 miles in the Hindu Kush with portable medical facilities. The group focused on eye care but offered other medical services as well. The Taliban and other insurgents claimed responsibility, accusing them of acting as spies and missionaries.Mr. Frans said he was unsure about the immediate fate of the workers’ bodies. Five families of the American victims have expressed a wish for the deceased to be buried in Afghanistan, but American investigators raised the possibility of returning their remains to the United States for autopsy.A spokeswoman for the United States Embassy, Caitlin Hayden, said an a statement that no decisions had been made about how to handle the bodies.“Under federal law, the FBI has jurisdiction to conduct investigations worldwide when U.S. citizens are killed,” she wrote. “Plans have not been finalized by the families and authorities involved, but one of several possibilities is returning the remains of the deceased U.S. citizens with dignity to the United States for autopsies.”The International Assistance Mission released the names of all 10 victims on Monday. It repeated its denials that any had been involved in missionary work or spying.The four other Americans were identified as Cheryl Beckett, 32, of Knoxville, Tenn.; Brian Carderelli, of Harrisonburg, Va., the videographer for the expedition; Dr. Tom Grams, of Durango, Colo., a dentist; and Glen Lapp, a Mennonite nurse from Lancaster, Pa..The German was identified as Daniela Beyer, 35, from the city of Chemnitz, west of Dresden. Dr. Karen Woo, a British surgeon, was the eighth foreigner.The two Afghans were Mahram Ali, a driver, and a man named Ahmed Jawed.Mr. Jawed, 24, was the expedition’s cook and had been on previous expeditions with the aid group, which called him “well-loved for his sense of humor. He would also help dispense the free eyeglasses that the team distributed on the expeditions.His cousin, Mualana Korban Muhammed, remembered Mr. Jawed as an outgoing, polite young man who was the primary source of financial support for his wife, three young children and extended family.The other Afghan victim was Mr. Ali, 51, who came along on the expedition as a driver and to guard the team’s three vehicles. Rahim Majid, the operations manager at International Assistance Mission, said Mr. Ali, too, was a husband and father to three young children. One of his sons had been paralyzed by polio and another’s arm had been amputated. “He was the only person to care for his family,” Mr. Majid said.The surviving member of the team, an Afghan driver named Safiullah, was released by the insurgents after he begged for his life as a Muslim and recited Koranic verses, according to his account to the police. He was being held for questioning by the Ministry of Interior in Kabul — where he had returned with the bodies of his colleagues Sunday, Mr. Frans said, adding that family members had been able to speak to him.Earlier, Mr. Frans had described Mr. Safiullah as a trusted colleague who had worked with the group for four years. At the news conference, he declined to discuss what Mr. Safiullah knew about the attack because of the American and Afghan investigations.Mr. Frans also denied accusations by insurgents that the group had Bibles in Dari or were otherwise engaged in proselytizing. The International Assistance Mission has worked in Afghanistan since 1966 and none of its personnel have engaged in missionary work, which is against the law in Afghanistan and a violation of the group’s own rules.In addition, there was another Afghan survivor of the expedition, Said Yasin, a nurse, who left separately before the attack. Mr. Frans said Mr. Yasin had confirmed that none of the group had Bibles with them, and that he never saw them engage in missionary work during the expedition or otherwise.“As things stand now, I.A.M. is not thinking of withdrawing from Afghanistan,” he said. However, the loss of its medical team members, particularly those with long experience in Afghanistan, made running such provincial outreach impossible, he said.“Tom was the driving force behind much of what has been achieved in eye care in Afghanistan,” he said.'"

"'10-08-11,'0','CHAHAR DARREH, Afghanistan — On paper, the plan for the foot patrol looked perfectly safe. A stroll through a couple of villages. Introductions to a few village elders. A two-mile drive back to the guarded walls of the Afghan police headquarters. Easy.But the first missions of a deployment have a way of going terribly wrong. And so the company commander huddled with his platoon leader in the hours around dawn, checking potential ambush points, charting evacuation routes, worrying about every possible equipment failure.There was one variable, however, they could do little to control: the trustworthiness of their Afghan police partners.In small groups and to themselves, soldiers from the First Battalion, 87th Infantry, quietly fretted. Were those villages really friendly, as the Afghan police claimed? Were those roads really free of mines? What would happen if a police officer tipped off insurgent fighters to the platoon’s movements?Just a week before, a different platoon in the battalion had hit a mine while accompanying the Afghan police along a dirt road. Some soldiers wondered whether the police had led the Americans into a trap. That possibility was quickly ruled out, because the police were in as much danger as the soldiers. But jitters remained.“Everyone knows there is one way in and one way out,” one squad leader said. “I don’t like it.”They call it a training mission, but for the soldiers of the 1-87, their work in Kunduz Province in northern Afghanistan is much more than that. Over a yearlong deployment that started in the spring, the battalion, part of the 10th Mountain Division, will not only try to hone the combat skills of the local police — a ragtag group of illiterate young men and aging fighters — but also accompany them into the most contested hamlets in the region.The goal, a centerpiece of the American strategy to help the Afghan government stand alone, is to show skeptical Afghans that their police can keep them safe. But the unspoken first step in that strategy is getting the American soldiers themselves to trust the police.In their first weeks in Afghanistan, the soldiers of the 1-87 would have to settle for something approaching faith.The Afghan National Police have long been considered the weakest rung of the Afghan security forces, often lacking proper training, equipment, commitment and ethics, American commanders say. More important, American commanders worry that some police officers — whether willingly or under duress — conspire with insurgents.Late last year, an Afghan police officer in Helmand Province killed five British soldiers with whom he had been working.The Afghan security forces have their own trust issues with troops from NATO. In April, German soldiers fired on a truck carrying Afghan soldiers rushing to the aid of a German unit caught in an ambush in the Chahar Darreh district. Six soldiers died.“We are not afraid of the enemy; we are afraid of the Germans,” the district police chief, Gulam Maideen, said.So building mutual trust was crucial, and commanders with the battalion said the best way to do that was to be with the police night and day: “Live, train and operate,” they called it. That is what brought the Second Platoon, Delta Company, to police headquarters in Chahar Darreh on a four-day mission — the first step toward keeping American soldiers in the district full-time.“Some soldiers worry about the national police doing something subversive to them,” said the platoon leader, Lt. Andrew McCarthy. “I’m convinced that these guys are working off the same page as us, that they want the same things as us.”Soon enough, his platoon would test that notion.The Chahar Darreh district occupies the southwest flank of Kunduz Province, where table-flat farmland fades into dusty plateau and empty desert. It is only six miles from the relatively secure bustle of downtown Kunduz, Afghanistan’s fifth-largest city. But it is a time zone away in terms of security.“There is really only one bridge you can get in and out of,” said Capt. David Bell, the Delta Company commander. “So it makes for a really great insurgent safe haven.”The district is part of northern Afghanistan’s Pashtun belt, and many villages here share the language, tribal sentiments and even Taliban sympathies of their brethren in Kandahar and Helmand.They are not technically a combat force, but the police are expected to maintain security on a day-to-day basis — and that means fighting insurgents. Yet by all accounts, they are underequipped and understaffed to do that.'"
"'10-08-11,'0','Particularly unexpected in the data on Wednesday morning was the restraint that Chinese banks showed in issuing new loans, which in turn contributed to slower growth in the money supply. Banks issued 533 billion renminbi ($78.7 billion) in new loans last month, down from 603.4 billion renminbi ($89.1 billion) in June.A broad measure of money supply, M2, rose 17.6 percent in July compared with a year earlier after being up 18.5 percent in June.“We believe this level of broad money supply growth is clearly too restrictive, as it will put more downward pressure on domestic demand growth in the near future,” said two Goldman Sachs economists, Yu Song and Helen Qiao, in a research note.The gradual slowing in China is evident in the factories that have turned the country into the manufacturing center of the world. Industrial output rose 13.4 percent last month compared with the same month last year.By comparison, industrial output had been up 13.7 percent in June from a year earlier, and was up 16.5 percent as recently as May.Much the same pattern was evident in fixed asset investment, which was up 24.9 percent last month compared with a year earlier. It had been ahead by 25.5 percent in June, and 25.9 percent in May.Retail sales rose 17.9 percent in July compared with the same month last year, as Chinese consumers with rising wages continued to flock to stores for ever more spending. But sales had grown 18.3 percent in June compared with a year earlier, and had been up 18.7 percent in May.Chinese policy makers have long feared that inflation could lead to social unrest, and have tailored many policies to prevent it. Consumer prices were up 3.3 percent in July from a year earlier, accelerating from an increase of 2.9 percent in June.But there were signs that future inflation could begin to moderate. Producer prices were 4.8 percent higher in July than a year ago, after being up 6.4 percent in June and 7.1 percent in May.Many businesses are still complaining about rising costs, which may hurt their willingness to invest. Alex Yu, a senior manager at the Dongguan Jet Power Metals and Plastics Factory in Dongguan, China, said that workers’ wages had climbed 20 to 30 percent in the last year while the cost of an indispensable kind of raw plastic had soared 23 percent.“Everything is getting more and more expensive, we feel the impact of inflation in all areas of our business,” he said.On Tuesday, China’s General Administration of Customs announced that the country’s trade surplus reached $28.7 billion last month, the highest level since January of last year, as exports surged and while the growth in imports dwindled.The official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Wednesday that the surplus showed the resilience of China’s exporters but was not a reason to let the renminbi rise more quickly in value against other currencies.The surplus “is not a reason to tout faster appreciation of the Chinese currency as a panacea,” the editorial said. “The real solution to China’s swelling trade surplus must include long-term reforms to enrich Chinese consumers and boost their consumption levels.”But Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who has repeatedly called for a more confrontational trade strategy toward China, said in a statement late Tuesday that China’s latest trade numbers “show just how little motive China has to end its currency manipulation unless it is pushed to do so.”'"
"'10-08-11,'0','Hearing about the excavation, Paulette Gooch, who was 7 when the sergeant, her brother, disappeared and is now 73, went to Germany with her son to see where he died. Ms. Gooch met the farmers who had watched the plane fall from the sky. “The whole town came out to meet us,” she said. The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory said the remains were her brother’s.Those remains — mostly bone fragments — traveled on a plane from Hawaii on Monday accompanied by Sgt. First Class Richard McIntosh, 42. “There’s a saying that goes, ‘Greater love hath no man than to give up his life for his brother,’ ” said Sergeant McIntosh, who is about to retire from the military to be a marine biologist after serving two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. “This is a real honor for me.”A few dozen people gathered around the gravesite at Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery here while six members of the military’s Honor Guard carried the flag-covered coffin to its rest.Elissa Bassett, 55, did not know Sergeant Bonnassiolle or his family. Nonetheless, in an impromptu civics lesson, she drove the 12 miles from her home in San Francisco to attend the funeral with her 5-year-old grandson, Walter, who wore a black suit and white sneakers. “This is a grandma’s way of trying to teach respect for our country,” Ms. Bassett said.Walter’s enthusiasm for war-themed video games concerned Ms. Bassett. “I want him to know when you go bang-bang, something happens,” she said. “I wanted to show him the real cost of war.”'"
"'10-08-11,'0','Joy Levitt, executive director of the Jewish Community Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, remembers her first conversation with Daisy Khan around 2005, years before Ms. Khan’s idea for a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan morphed into a controversy about Sept. 11, Islam and freedom of religion.“Strollers,” said Ms. Levitt, whom Ms. Khan had approached for advice on how to build an institution like the Jewish center — with a swimming pool, art classes and joint projects with other religious groups. Ms. Levitt, a rabbi, urged Ms. Khan to focus on practical matters like a decent wedding hall and stroller parking.“You can use all these big words like diversity and pluralism,” Ms. Levitt recalled telling Ms. Khan, noting that with the population of toddlers booming in Manhattan, “I’m down in the lobby dealing with the 500 strollers.”Clearly, the idea that Ms. Khan and her partners would one day be accused of building a victory monument to terrorism did not come up — an oversight with consequences. The organizers built support among some Jewish and Christian groups, and even among some families of 9/11 victims, but did little to engage with likely opponents. More strikingly, they did not seek the advice of established Muslim organizations experienced in volatile post-9/11 passions and politics.The organizers — chiefly Ms. Khan; her husband, the imam of a mosque in the financial district; and a young real-estate investor born in New York — did not hire a public-relations firm until after the hostility exploded in May. They went ahead with their first public presentation of the project — a voluntary appearance at a community board meeting in Lower Manhattan — just after an American Muslim, Faisal Shahzad, was arrested for planting a car bomb in Times Square.“It never occurred to us,” Ms. Khan said. “We have been bridge builders for years.”How Ms. Khan’s early brainstorming led to today’s combustible debate, one often characterized by powerful emotions and mistaken information, is a combination of arguable naïveté, public-relations missteps and a national political climate in which perhaps no preparation could have headed off controversy.As a result, supporters of the $100 million center, named Park51, which received its final approval from the city last week, are now beginning their fund-raising and detailed planning amid a broader battle. The future of the center — organizers say it will have a mosque, but its 15 floors will be mainly for other functions — has become grist for talk radio, cable television and election fights across the country.Sharif el-Gamal, the developer on the project, said ironically in an interview Friday, “This might become the most famous community center in the world.”For American Muslims, the stakes have become painfully high.“It has repercussions for the entire community,” said Robina Niaz, who runs Turning Point, a group that fights domestic violence among Muslims. “What it has done is suddenly made it legitimate for everybody else out there to lash out at Muslims. It has brought us together. But it also shows how much work we have to do.”In 1999, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, Ms. Khan’s husband, tried to buy the former McBurney Y.M.C.A. on 23rd Street in Manhattan, telling the seller’s broker, David Lebenstein, that he planned a kind of Muslim Y.Knowing that the 1993 World Trade Center bombing still left raw nerves in New York, the imam assured Mr. Lebenstein, “We’re not the ones doing bombs; we’re moderates and Americans.”The sale would have gone through but for financing difficulties, said Mr. Lebenstein, the son of a Holocaust survivor. Imam Feisal is in Malaysia and could not be reached for comment for this article.Imam Feisal, 62, moved to the United States as a teenager with his father, an Egyptian imam, and graduated from Columbia University. Until 2009, he was the Friday prayer leader at Masjid al Farah, a mosque in the Sufi tradition, which emphasizes mysticism and tolerance. The mosque was established two decades ago and is 12 blocks from the World Trade Center.His sermons were infused with a “sweet spirituality,” not focused on “rules and regulations” or politics, said Adem Carroll, director of the Muslim Consultative Network, an advocacy group based in New York. Those sermons attracted his two allies in the current project, slated to be built at 45-51 Park Place.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the evolution of plans for a proposed Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan misstated the role of Daisy Khan in the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Ms. Khan, one of the organizers of the center, has been part of an advisory panel for the museum; she is not on its board. The article also misstated, in some copies, the age of Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, another of the organizers of the center. He is 62, not 61. And the article misstated, in some copies, the date of the arrest of Faisal Shahzad, the suspect in the failed Times Square bombing, an event that helped stoke an uproar over the center. The arrest was on May 3, not on May 4.'"
"'10-08-11,'0','I HAVE never purchased a credit-default swap on a collateralized debt obligation. I have never packaged subprime mortgages and sold them to the highest bidder. In fact, I do not even have a home mortgage. I live in the house my grandparents built and passed on to my parents, who eventually passed it on to my husband and me. Someday it will go to my children, when it is their turn.Still, I am stuck in the middle of this financial overhaul. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may be targeted at risk-taking bankers, but the regulations have the potential to change the way I do business on the farm.I raise mostly wheat and soybeans in northwest Minnesota. Wheat, in particular, is bought and sold in a notoriously volatile market. In February 2008, I sold wheat for $18.69 per bushel. Last month, I was selling it for $3.49 per bushel.To protect myself from such swings, I use derivatives, or agricultural swaps. I make an arrangement with my local grain elevator or a commodities broker months before my crop is harvested to sell it at a guaranteed price; I have already priced some of the wheat I will raise in 2011 at a decent $7.15 a bushel. Of course, since wildfires in Russia destroyed much of the world’s crop and the country banned the export of grain through December, wheat prices have risen over 45 percent from five weeks ago — a clear sign of how volatile the market can be.On the purchasing side, I also use derivatives to protect myself from swings in the cost of fertilizer, fuel and other staples. In the past two years, my nitrogen fertilizer has ranged from $435 to $685 per ton, and my fuel bills are giving me whiplash. While reading through the Dodd-Frank act these past few weeks, I’ve been wondering: Will the regulations on swaps make it more difficult for me to hedge against market swings in prices for crops and supplies?'"
"'10-08-11,'0','RIO DE JANEIRO — The government of Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, has reversed steps toward protecting women’s health and reproductive rights, and backtracked on its intention to guarantee access to legal abortions, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Tuesday.Despite what seems to be a liberal social wave sweeping through Argentina — including Congress’s approval last month of a national law authorizing same-sex marriages, the first in Latin America — the Human Rights Watch report offered a scathing assessment of the reproductive rights policies under Mrs. Kirchner, who took over from her husband, Néstor Kirchner, as president in late 2007.Women continue to struggle to obtain birth control, despite a 2002 law ensuring access to it, and doctors shy away from offering legal abortions in the predominantly Roman Catholic country, the report said. Argentine law strictly limits abortions, with exceptions that include physical or mental risk to the patient and pregnancies resulting from rape.Researchers found that unsafe abortions continued to be a leading cause of maternal mortalities in Argentina. In 2008, more than 20 percent of deaths recorded as a result of obstetric emergencies were caused by unsafe abortions, according to government figures cited in the report.The group said an estimated 40 percent of pregnancies in 2005 ended in abortions, most of them illegal and unsafe. “Little has changed for the women and girls who depend on the public health system,” the organization said.'"
"'10-08-11,'0','The two had words. Phillips removed his helmet and Molina took off his mask as their exchange escalated.Both benches and bullpens emptied. La Russa and Reds Manager Dusty Baker exchanged words in the middle of the crowd.Reds third baseman Scott Rolen, a former Cardinal, went after Cardinals pitcher Chris Carpenter near the edge of the crowd, and the two wound up crunched against the backstop as the crowd surged forward. Carpenter was shoved into the backstop screen.Reds starter Johnny Cueto also ended up against the backstop, kicking furiously to free himself from the mob.“I turn around, and I’ve got Cueto kicking me in the back with his spikes,” Carpenter said. “It’s super unprofessional. I don’t know where he learned how to fight.”Cueto said he was trying to protect himself.The altercation ended after seven minutes. Rolen went up to Carpenter to make amends. Both managers, but no players, were ejected.“I don’t think it’s a big mystery that there was some tension before the game,” Rolen said. “I won’t get into specifics about it. It was two teams defending their own people. It got ugly.”Phillips continued his at-bat and grounded out, leaving him 0 for 6 in the series without a ball hit out of the infield. Molina hit a solo home run off Cueto in the second and a sacrifice fly in the sixth.Phillips got the series started Monday with a little animosity by saying he hated the Cardinals, whom he called complainers. Baker said he talked to him about the comments before the game Tuesday and that he wished Phillips had kept his feelings to himself.Phillips was more diplomatic after his talk with Baker but did not back down.“Everybody, they respect me for what I said,” Phillips said before Tuesday’s game. “Those are my comments. A lot of people feel that way all throughout the league.”The Cardinals complained last season and again on opening day that the baseballs were not properly rubbed in Cincinnati, leaving them slippery.PEDROIA NEARS RETURN Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia ran at full speed before Boston’s game at Toronto and could begin a minor league rehab assignment this weekend. Pedroia is expected to work out Wednesday, including making some cuts when he runs, and run again Thursday before visiting a doctor in Boston on Friday.If all goes well, Pedroia will play at least two games at Class AAA Pawtucket this weekend, either at second base or designated hitter, and could return to Boston’s lineup for an Aug. 17 game against the Los Angeles Angels.Pedroia fractured his left foot when he fouled a ball off his leg during a game June 25.“Ground balls is fine; the only thing that’s tough is running,” he said. “I’ll be smart about it during the game and pick and choose when I need to run.”Pedroia, who ran in spikes for the first time Tuesday, said he would wear extra padding inside his shoes at all times and special protection on the outside of his shoes when he batted.In the Red Sox’ game against the Blue Jays, Mike Lowell hit a home run in the eighth inning of a 7-5 victory.Strasburg was scratched minutes before his scheduled start against Atlanta on July 27 and was later diagnosed with inflammation in his pitching shoulder.RAYS BLANK TIGERS Jeremy Hellickson, who struck out seven without walking a batter, combined with two other pitchers on a four-hitter, and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the host Detroit Tigers, 8-0.THOME POWERS TWINS Jim Thome hit a homer in the second against his former team, and the Minnesota Twins took sole possession of first place in the American League Central by beating the host Chicago White Sox, 12-6.MONTERO LIFTS DIAMONDBACKS Miguel Montero hit a home run to begin the eighth inning, and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the host Milwaukee Brewers, 2-1.DODGERS TOP PHILLIES Andre Ethier reached base six times and scored four runs, and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the host Philadelphia Phillies, 15-9. ...

"'10-08-11,'0','“The same things you’re saying about Nate can be said about our entire football team and our organization,” Smith said. “The résumé of the San Diego Chargers has been an outstanding regular-season team and in the postseason can’t get it done.”Kaeding acknowledged that his problems against the Jets were mostly mental, but he did not see that as a character flaw, simply an area for improvement.“For a guy like Nate, who has been kicking this ball his whole life and can pick out a seat in the stadium and kick the ball into it — that’s how good he is — it’s about removing psychological impediments and allowing him to be free,” said Dr. Michael Lardon, a sports psychologist who has worked with Kaeding most of his professional career.There are a variety of tools for that: yogalike breathing techniques, visualization tapes, talking through what happens during success and failure, and setting up artificial barriers, like skinny goal posts.“It’s not hocus-pocus, just practical application,” Kaeding said.Lardon, who works mostly with professional golfers, said they were not much different from kickers. He pointed to Nick Faldo as a prime example. After blowing leads in majors early in his career, he was called Nick Foldo. But years later, as he went on to win three British Open and three Masters titles, Faldo forged a reputation as one of golf’s strongest-willed competitors.“Most athletes come to a point in their careers where that’s the question that’s brought up — do they have what it takes to be a champion?” Lardon said. “But you don’t buy into it; you see the bigger picture. Getting better isn’t a linear line. It jumps, flattens out; you might have a step back.”The important thing, Lardon said, is to do as Faldo did and take lessons from failure.Kaeding said what disappointed him most against the Jets was that he could not shake his first miss, a 36-yarder in the first quarter. The kick shattered streaks of 20 successful field goals and of 69 from 40 yards or fewer — as well as Kaeding’s sense of assurance that he had moved beyond his earlier cases of the playoff yips.The next kick, a 57-yard attempt on the final play of the half that would have matched his career long, was short — certainly a pardonable offense. But with the Chargers trying to crawl back from a 17-7 deficit, Kaeding missed a 40-yarder midway through the fourth quarter, rendering a later touchdown inconsequential.“I don’t want to say the shock of missing, but there was, ‘Whoa, I just missed,’ and it kind of threw me off,” Kaeding said of the first miss. “I might have fallen into the trap of thinking you’ve got it figured out and putting it on cruise control a little bit. Mentally, you’ve got to be strong enough through the course of the game to put that aside and get your job done. For some reason, I was unable to make that turn in my head and execute the last kick.”After leaving the Pro Bowl early after injuring his thigh, Kaeding returned home to Des Moines for a difficult winter. He received calls, e-mails and text messages from other kickers, including some he did not know well, like the veterans Ryan Longwell and Matt Stover. Kaeding, who with his wife, Samantha, has two small children, said he did not go into deep psychoanalysis as much as he talked with friends and relatives, many of whom have had to deal with adversity in their lives.“There was a lot of asking why and having a hard time coming to terms that it happened and the dichotomy of how well the entire season went, and then there’s such a difference between the two,” Kaeding said. “But you get back to work. I didn’t make any playoff field goals in July when I was practicing. I’m not going to make any playoff field goals in August or October, either.”Those can come, if Kaeding is fortunate, only further down the road. And the only way to get there is by putting one foot down and swinging the other forward, his eyes focused on what lies ahead — no matter how narrow it may look.'"
"'10-08-11,'0','Netflix’s open checkbook demonstrates that Internet streaming is clearly coming to the forefront in Hollywood, but in a carefully controlled manner. Mr. Sarandos said in an interview Tuesday that the content deals were part of “our continued commitment to making streaming a better and better proposition for our subscribers.”Netflix’s future depends largely on cutting financial deals that keep those streams in place.The company first took on the likes of Blockbuster with DVDs by mail. Then, in 2007, it set its sights on online streaming, but existing deals with pay TV operators like HBO made it impossible to stream many of the biggest film releases. These deals preserve what is called the pay television window, which opens up about a year after a film is first released in theaters and gives HBO, Showtime or Starz about 18 months of screening (and, more recently, Web streaming) time.Pay TV arrangements are important contributors to the bottom lines of Hollywood studios, helping them wring more money out of both blockbusters and flops. These arrangements rely on cable and satellite carriers to collect monthly payments.Accordingly, the movies that were initially available on the streaming service were mostly ones “you’ve never heard of,” Mr. Sarandos said. But in 2008 the company cut an important deal with Starz that allowed access to widely known films from Sony and the Walt Disney Company. The payments to Epix will add more films.In doing so, it is essentially creating a new window for movie viewing, one that does not depend on cable or satellite carriers. “If you own content, you want to sell it to as many people as possible without blowing up your existing revenue streams,” said the Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne.At the same time, having Netflix in the marketplace puts pressure on cable and satellite providers “because you’ve got another bidder out there,” he said.The two-year-old Epix is invisible to most consumers because some big companies like DirectTV and Comcast don’t carry it. But it is preserving the deals it does have by carving out a three-month TV window for films before they are available to Netflix subscribers.Jon Feltheimer, the chief executive of Lions Gate, told analysts Tuesday that “by creating this groundbreaking new window for their streaming service, we both protect our traditional M.S.O. customers and create a significant and guaranteed new revenue stream for our service.” M.S.O., or multiple system operator, refers to cable and satellite carriers.Netflix says it prefers to be a distributor for pay TV — not a competitor to it — and wants to license content from HBO and Showtime. HBO has the rights to Fox, Universal and Warner films for at least the next four years.Asked about the giant amount of content that Netflix was lacking because of HBO’s deals, Mr. Sarandos seemed to take a long-term view. “Every deal expires,” he said, “and every deal has to be renewed.”'"
"'10-08-11,'0','Sacha Baron Cohen, who was sued late last year for slander in connection with “Bruno,” his comedy-documentary about a gay fashion reporter, managed this week to get out of another sticky legal situation, Reuters reported. On Monday a federal judge dismissed a copyright claim brought by a writer who said that a scene in the 2009 film was very similar to his own original script, titled “Himbos,” Reuters reported. John Musero filed suit against Mr. Baron Cohen, in character above, the director Larry Charles, the producers Mosaic Media Group and MRC and others in March. Mr. Musero had claimed that a scene in which “Bruno” wrecks havoc at a fashion show because he is stuck in a Velcro suit came from a script that Mr. Musero had pitched to Mosaic, which later rejected it. The court ruled that the idea of a man in a Velcro suit was not subject to copyright and that the two works were not that similar. The protagonist in “Himbos” is chased by a rabbit and cats after rabbit food gets stuck to the back of his suit. “Bruno” shows its title character crashing into a rack of clothes and falling onto a runway.'"

The show’s producers announced on Tuesday that they had also set an opening night, Dec. 21. The musical is estimated to have a $50 million budget, the largest in Broadway history. Directed by Julie Taymor, the Tony Award-winning creator of the long-running musical “The Lion King,” “Spider-Man” appears to have rebounded from a production delay that involved scuttling its original plan to start performances last February. According to executives involved with “Spider-Man,” the new producers have secured enough financing for the creative team to begin rehearsals next week and commit to performance dates and a box-office schedule.

"'10-08-11,'0','Given that the economy seems to have entered this new phase — a new slog — I wanted to use this week’s column to sketch an updated portrait of the economy. The highlights follow. More detailed information is posted on the Economix blog.In the deep economic slump of the mid-1970s, the average hourly pay of rank-and-file workers — who make up four-fifths of the work force — fell 6 percent, adjusted for inflation. In the early 1980s, the average wage fell 3 percent. Even in the mild 1990-91 recession, it fell almost 2 percent.But since this recent recession began in December 2007, real average hourly pay has risen nearly 5 percent. Some employers, especially state and local governments, have cut wages. But many more employers have continued to increase pay.Something similar happened during , notes Bruce Judson of the Yale School of Management. Falling prices meant that workers who held their jobs received a surprisingly strong effective pay raise.This time around, nominal wages — the numbers people see in their paychecks — have risen throughout the slump, as companies have passed along some of the impressive productivity to their (remaining) workers. Meanwhile, inflation has been almost non-existent, except for parts of last year, when real wages did briefly fall.Obviously, real wages could begin falling again if inflation picks up or more employers cut pay. And many workers are already struggling with big debts and diminished accounts. Still, the contrast is pretty stark. The typical jobless person has been out of work six months. The typical worker has received a raise.Central U.S. Does O.K.The hardest-hit parts of the country have been manufacturing regions, like , and , and areas that had huge housing bubbles, like , and .The least affected area is a band running from the Dakotas and down to and . Continuing the concentration theme, this band includes some of the manufacturers and other businesses that have emerged from the recession the quickest.This pattern probably helps explain why the Senate has taken such a leisurely approach to helping the economy in recent months. Many of the states in the best shape also have small populations and, as a result, outsize political power. In , where the unemployment rate is 4.8 percent, there is one senator for every 900,000 people. In Florida, where the unemployment rate is 11.4 percent, there is one senator for every nine million people.The first two years of the downturn were disproportionately blue collar. In 2008 and 2009, the construction industry shed 25 percent of its jobs, and manufacturing lost 16 percent.This year has been different. Manufacturing — especially of so-called durable goods, like computers and machinery, many of which are purchased by companies — has been adding jobs.Many white-collar fields, meanwhile, are losing jobs: state and local governments, publishing, telecommunications. Retailers have added jobs, but more slowly than the rest of the economy, as consumer spending has remained tepid.This shift from blue to white collar is the main reason the downturn has also become more female. In a turnabout from the previous two years, male employment has risen by almost one million this year, while female employment has fallen by 300,000. For similar reasons, employment has risen this year among people who never attended college and fallen among those who did.Over all, though, the downturn has still exacted a much harsher toll on the less educated. The unemployment rate for college graduates is still just 4.5 percent, and the gap between their pay and everyone else’s is larger than it has ever been. For most college graduates, the Great Recession has not lived up to its name.And there is good reason: in today’s high-tech, global economy, educated workers remain very much in demand. They make their companies more productive and the American economy more competitive. They expand the size of the economic pie.If you have doubts, take a look at the last century. In the early 20th century, decided that a high school education would be wasted on the masses. The United States instead made high school universal, and its newly skilled work force helped build everything from the hugely productive factories of the Midwest to modern Hollywood to the world’s most innovative retail and technology sectors.Over the long term, the best response to the current downturn, by far, would be for the country to regain the global lead in education.Of course, that will take years, maybe decades. It will not come soon enough to help the seven million people who have been out of work — and are still actively looking for work — for six months or more.They will need a different kind of help. Maybe it’s a new kind of jobless benefit, like a lump-sum payment that is fairly generous but still them gives an incentive to find new work as soon as possible. Or maybe it’s a new kind of retraining program that, unlike so many past failures, lives up to its promises.Whatever it is, it will need to be something more innovative than the current safety net — which was, after all, created for a very different kind of downturn.'"
"'10-08-11,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Business productivity fell for the first time in 18 months in the second quarter and labor costs were flat, according to government data released Tuesday.Productivity declined by an annual rate of 0.9 percent after rising at a revised 3.9 percent rate in the first quarter, a Labor Department report showed on Tuesday. Falling output per worker implies the economy is operating less efficiently because overall production is below its potential.It was the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008 that output per worker declined.Other data showed consumers growing increasingly gloomy about the economic outlook while business inventories increased and sales slumped.A potential silver lining in the productivity report was the possibility that it might soon force more hiring by employers who might have reached the limits of squeezing current work forces.“If working people longer and harder is no longer bringing large returns to businesses, executives may have to find other ways to expand production,” said Joel L. Naroff, an economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.'"
"'10-08-11,'0','The census’ official count of the American population is not ready yet, but the Census Bureau is issuing a progress report.The bureau said Tuesday, for instance, that its 2010 count would cost about $1.6 billion less than budgeted. This works out to about 11 percent less than the $14.7 billion appropriated over 12 years for the 2010 count, and 22 percent less than budgeted for this year.Robert M. Groves, the bureau’s director, also said Tuesday that despite declining response rates to surveys in general, 72 percent of households returned the mailed census questionnaires, about the same proportion as in 2000. The response rate improved in areas that were considered harder to count, like neighborhoods with a disproportionately high share of poor people or immigrants.Census enumerators knocked on the doors of 47 million households that did not return the mailed questionnaire, the bureau reported. Enumerators failed 22 percent of the time to interview the residents personally and had to rely on neighbors or building managers for information about those households. Ten years ago, those so-called proxy reports accounted for 17 percent of the enumerator follow-ups.On the other hand, enumerators discovered occupants in 27 percent of the 5.6 million addresses that had been considered vacant or that could not initially be found, and at 3.1 million addresses that were provided at the last minute by the Postal Service.'"

"'10-08-12,'0','Such strictures have tightened since spring 2008, many Tibetans say, when a deadly burst of rioting in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, elicited a government response that has sent hundreds of monks, nomads, students and shopkeepers to jail — and several of those accused of rioting to their deaths. But unlike previous crackdowns on dissent in Tibet and adjoining provinces, the current campaign has deeply unnerved those Tibetans — educated, middle-class and bilingual — who always kept their heads down.Robert J. Barnett, director of the modern Tibetan studies program at Columbia, said two years of detentions, secret trials and torture accusations had prompted soul-searching and quiet resistance. Elderly Tibetan cadres have published memoirs on long-forgotten massacres by Communist troops. Middle-age functionaries have openly voiced qualms about their role in China’s bureaucracy. Online, the young and the radicalized post provocative anti-Chinese comments. “People are no longer hiding behind the tradition of self-censorship that comes from fear,” Mr. Barnett said. “What we’re seeing is a new kind of intellectual heroism.”That shift can be seen in the public transformation of Mr. Tragyal, better known by his pen name, Shogdung. The founder of the New School of Thought, he ran an informal salon in Xining where other young iconoclasts shared the writings of philosophers like Friedrich von Hayek or denounced the Tibetan belief in reincarnation.“Some people misunderstood him, saying he opposed Buddhism,” said Phagmo Tashi, a friend and a filmmaker. “The truth is, he only opposed certain aspects of religion that violate universal values like freedom and dignity.”If Mr. Tragyal was once maligned for sentiments that some deemed anti-Buddhist, or for printing his essays in state-run newspapers, he has become something of a hero since publishing “The Line Between Sky and Earth.” Its print run of 1,000 copies — and the thousands of pirated versions that followed — quickly sold out in Qinghai and beyond.In the book, he apologizes for his previous writings and his failure to speak out after the Lhasa riots, saying, “I kept a disciplined silence and stayed passive like a coward, ultimately out of fear.”What changed him, he said, was the sight of so many monks marching in the streets and the stories about harsh punishments for the protesters. He was also moved by passive resisters like Runggye Adak, a nomad whose videotaped paean to the Dalai Lama earned him an eight-year prison term.“I got to thinking that there could be no worse suffering than this, even if someone were to murder your own father, because every time my thoughts turned to the methods of torture used by the dictators, my hair stood on end, I got goose bumps and my heart leapt out of my throat,” he wrote.But perhaps the most audacious sections of his book call on the Tibetan intelligentsia and state workers to stop cooperating with the Beijing government and to wage a campaign of civil disobedience. Though Mr. Tragyal was careful not to advocate Tibetan independence, it is unlikely that the authorities would recognize such a distinction.“I’ve read the book again and again, but I don’t see anything that breaks the law,” said his daughter, Yeshi Tsomo, 25, an editor at a state-owned Tibetan-language publisher. “I fear the government won’t care because they probably don’t like the idea behind the book.”In recent months, a number of prominent Tibetans have been given long prison sentences based on what defense lawyers contend was flimsy evidence or forced confessions.The highest-profile case involved Karma Samdrup, an antiques dealer and philanthropist who was tried on 12-year-old charges of selling stolen relics. His real offense, family members say, was seeking the freedom of his two brothers, who were detained after accusing a local police chief of hunting endangered animals in a nature preserve.In June, Mr. Samdrup was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In a sign of the legal system’s capriciousness, his lawyer, Pu Zhiqiang, said he had not learned until Aug. 2 that Mr. Samdrup’s appeal had been turned down a month before — the day after it was filed. More worrisome, Mr. Samdrup’s wife said, is that he has essentially disappeared, with both the detention center and the court claiming they have no idea where he is.“How is it that such a good man can be made to suffer so much?” his wife, Zhenga Cuomao, asked in an interview.It is the sort of question that Mr. Tragyal poses again and again in his book. He asks why Tibetan society is suffused with fear and why China ignores the human rights conventions it has signed.At the end of the book, he acknowledges that his very words will lead to his own perdition. “I am naturally terrified at the thought that once this essay has been made public, I will eventually have to endure the hot hells and cold hells on earth,” he writes. “I may ‘lose my head because of my mouth,’ but this is the path I have chosen, so the responsibility is mine.”'"

"'10-08-12,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — It may be one of the most beloved activities of hyperactive children and the parents who love them: bouncing in a bounce house. But, according to Attorney General Jerry Brown of California, it may also be toxic.A lawsuit filed Wednesday by Mr. Brown’s office claims that some of the inflatable bounce houses that help entertain — and exhaust — the young guests at children’s parties have unsafe levels of lead, sometimes dozens of times the federal limit.“I was surprised,” said Mr. Brown, who is running for governor in a state with 2.7 million children under age 5. “But as we test more and more of these products, we find dangers.”The suit was prompted by a an investigation by the Center for Environmental Health in Oakland, Calif., an advocacy group that tested dozens of bounce houses, concentrating on the vinyl that gives them their bounce.Lead levels in the vinyl, the tests found, varied from 5,000 parts per million to 29,000, far above the federal limit of 90 to 300 parts per million.Robert Field, senior vice president of Cutting Edge Creations Inc., a defendant in the suit, called the investigation a “witch hunt” that could seriously damage the bounce-house industry.'"
"'10-08-12,'0','Ever since the New York Philharmonic was founded in 1842, the orchestra’s brass section — horn, trumpet, trombone, bass trombone, tuba — had been a man’s world. Then Amanda Davidson auditioned. A graduate of the Juilliard School with a passion for Mahler, Brahms and ESPN, Mrs. Davidson, 28, became the brass section’s first female member last September, having previously been principal trombonist of the San Antonio Symphony. (She competed for the Philharmonic job with Mark Davidson, 27, whom she was dating and later married.) Her title is associate principal trombone, an instrument with which she is familiar. She has been playing it since she was 6.The sound of the trombone: It can be mellow. It can be soft and lyrical. It can be loud and foreboding. A lot of it just depends on what the music calls for. Most of the time in the orchestra I’m not playing with the mellow, beautiful, all-lyrical sound. It’s usually foreboding — here comes death knocking at the door. I’m playing like fortissimo. That’s usually what I’m doing. And that’s fun. I enjoy that, actually.Breaking the brass glass ceiling: I think for the most part I just feel honored. Honored on many levels. Honored just to be here. This is probably one of the best brass sections in the world, and I get to be a member of it. Maybe if this happened a few decades ago, I think I probably would have felt like, “Oh my goodness, I’m the first woman.” It would have been more of a shock or more of a thrill or something. But in orchestras around the country and around the world, there are more and more women there.Her first concert as a member: It was a concert at Carnegie Hall with Andrea Bocelli. I went to Juilliard, so for four years I listened to concerts here and knew what the level of playing was. It’s extremely high. It’s extreme professionalism, an extreme level of playing. I think I was just trying to remain calm and stay focused on the task at hand. I was trying to forget that it was the New York Philharmonic.Life with another trombonist: We play duets together and try to have fun. At first, there was some tension involved, because technically we’re kind of competitors. But we’ve moved away from that. It’s tough. You want the best for the other person and at the same time you want the best for yourself. We always try to encourage one another. Mark helps me stay positive when I start to doubt my playing or I become discouraged.Deep breathing: When I’m on stage and we’re playing something really loud, I have to take in as much air as I can to sustain as long as possible. And maybe I have to work at that a little harder because my lung capacity is probably a little bit less than the people sitting to the right or left of me. When I’m teaching my students and they’re not breathing properly, I usually use the analogy, “It’s not like you’re sitting on the couch and watching TV and flipping through channels. It’s like you’re outside taking a jog.” You’ve got to use your entire upper body.'"
"'10-08-12,'0','Mr. Weaver said that after his initial shock at the agreement, he has accepted it as necessary. He will not be immediately affected since it allows existing egg farms to continue but bars new ones with similar cages. He defends his methods, saying, “My own belief is that I’m doing the right thing.”Egg production is at the center of the debate because more than 90 percent of the country’s eggs are now produced in the stacked rows of cages that critics call inhumane.Ohio is the country’s second-largest egg producer, after . In the modern version of an egg barn, hordes of hens live with computer-controlled air circulation, lighting and feeding, their droppings whisked away by conveyor belt for recycling as fertilizer. As the hens jostle one other, their eggs roll onto a belt to be washed, graded and packed without ever being touched by human hands.Mr. Weaver insists that his chickens are content and less prone to disease than those in barnyard flocks, saying, “If our chickens aren’t healthy and happy, they won’t be as productive.”Keeping chickens in cages is cruel and unnecessary, counter advocates like Wayne Pacelle, chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, which has played a central role in the state-by-state battles. “Animals that are built to move should be allowed to move,” he said in an interview, and for chickens that means space for dust-bathing, perching and nesting.The assertion that animals must be “happy” to be productive is not accurate, Mr. Pacelle added, pointing to abnormal behaviors like head waving or bar-biting and to a loss of bone density in confined animals.In the mid-20th century, developments in animal nutrition and farm technologies as well as economic competition spurred the emergence of large-scale farms, often driving out small farmers who could not afford the large capital or survive the lower prices.Now, the United Egg Producers, a national trade group, says that egg prices would rise by 25 percent if all eggs were produced by uncaged hens, putting stress on consumers and . Animal proponents say that better noncage methods could be developed and that price is not the ultimate issue anyway.The American Veal Association, under pressure from consumers, agreed in 2007 to phase out the close confinement of calves by 2017. The requirement in the California law and the Ohio agreement to phase out the use of “gestation crates” on hog farms will have much wider effects.The family of Irv Bell, 64, has been growing hogs in Zanesville, Ohio, since the 19th century. Where males and females were once put into a pen to mate, sows are now inseminated artificially and most are kept through their in a 2-by-7-foot crate, in which they can lie down but not turn.“I work with the hogs every day, and I don’t think there is anything wrong with gestation crates,” he said. “But I have to be aware of things on the horizon, the bigger things at work.”Formally, the new Ohio agreement only makes recommendations to a state livestock standards board, and getting opponents to recognize the authority of that board was an important achievement, said Keith Stimpert, a senior vice president of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation. “We all know change is coming,” Mr. Stimpert said, adding that farmers would also respond to demands by consumers and restaurants for free-range products.“But is this how we’re going to deal with these issues, on a state-by-state basis?” he asked. That timetables and rules differ among states is going to cause economic harm, he said.The Humane Society of the United States, for its part, is already picking new targets. The advocates have the most leverage, Mr. Pacelle said, in the states that permit referendums. He said that the issues were likely to be pressed in and . Winning concessions may be harder, he acknowledged, in states without referendums, including Iowa and the South.Meanwhile, a new dispute over chicken cages is already brewing in California. The breakthrough 2008 law said that animals could be confined only in ways that allowed them “to lie down, stand up, fully extend their limbs and turn around freely.” Egg producers and even some animal advocates say this may permit housing hens in larger “enriched cages,” with perches and nesting spots.Mr. Pacelle asserts that no form of caging can meet a chicken’s needs for “running, flying and wing flapping” and that denying these impulses can cause a rise in stress hormones.“There’s going to be a legal wrangle over this,” Mr. Pacelle predicted.'"

"'10-08-12,'0','DETROIT — General Motors could file for an initial public offering of stock as soon as Friday, allowing the government to begin selling its stake in the automaker within several months, people briefed on the matter said Wednesday.G.M. is expected to report a second-quarter profit of $1 billion or more on Thursday, setting the stage for the long-awaited filing. A week ago, G.M.’s chief executive, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., said the company was drafting the paperwork and would file a stock registration in “the near future.”Through its sponsorship of the automaker’s bankruptcy last summer — including more than $50 billion in loans — the Treasury Department owns about 61 percent of the company.The automaker is also making progress in lining up a $5 billion credit facility from several major banks to help provide an additional backstop, the people briefed on G.M.’s plans said. These people spoke on condition of anonymity because the filing, first reported on CNBC, had not been made public.Potential investors will be closely watching G.M.’s second-quarter financial report, which Mr. Whitacre has promised will be “impressive.” He suggested that the company would show improvement from its first-quarter earnings of $865 million, G.M.’s first profit since 2007.'"
"'10-08-12,'0','Despite neighborhood unease, the city is moving forward with plans to fully reopen a jail in downtown Brooklyn, but has dropped plans to double its size, the city’s corrections commissioner said Wednesday.The move is part of a reconfiguration of the city’s jail system, which also includes the demolition of rundown buildings at Rikers Island, the construction of a new but smaller building there and the reopening of a jail near the courthouse in Kew Gardens, Queens. With the changes, expected to be completed by 2017, the Department of Correction should be able to house 16,500 inmates, Commissioner Dora B. Schriro said.Although that would be a decrease from the current 19,400 beds, Ms. Schriro said it would still be enough. The average daily inmate populations have steadily fallen, from a high of about 21,400 in 1992 to fewer than 14,000 in recent years.A jail barge in the Bronx that holds 870 inmates will be moved to Rikers Island as part of the project, Ms. Schriro said.The plan is expected to cost $660 million, or about $400 million less than a plan proposed years ago that called for an expansion of the Brooklyn jail, at Atlantic Avenue and Smith Street, and the construction of a new jail in Hunts Point, the Bronx, Ms. Schriro said.'"
"'10-08-12,'0','MOSCOW — Russia announced Wednesday that it had deployed an advanced surface-to-air missile system in the breakaway Georgian enclave of Abkhazia, a sign that Russian forces were becoming further entrenched in a disputed region at the focal point of Russia’s brief war with Georgia two years ago.Georgian officials quickly condemned the move, calling it a violation of the peace agreement drawn up at the end of the conflict.Gen. Aleksandr Zelin, the commander of Russia’s air force, said the system, called the S-300, was deployed to protect Russian military facilities in the enclave and to prevent “violations of government borders,” according to Russian news services.General Zelin said different air defense systems had been sent to protect the skies over South Ossetia, another breakaway region that was the epicenter of the 2008 war.Russia quickly crushed Georgian forces after five days of battle, recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent shortly after the war. Although only Nicaragua, Venezuela and the Pacific island of Nauru have followed suit, Moscow has spent the last two years helping to shore up the governments in the enclaves.'"
"'10-08-12,'0','This is taking high fashion to a whiplash sprint back and forth between the shallow and deep end of the pool, I guess — the interplay of binary opposites. It is not unlike the architecture of the Pompidou Center, where all the plumbing and electricity was radically installed outside of the building in color-coded pipes. (This way, the locus of the metaphysical presence of the dress is all YOU, babe ... I guess.)I tried on a particular black dress because all the seams were finished, and it had a two-way industrial zipper up the side and a great bustle of an asymmetric peplum skirting around the waist ($3,090). It was a fabulous creation, which did all the things good design can do: hold you together, make you more linear than the sum of your parts. For all its glory, it was a bit on the conservative side. I needed to be a few decades older to really get the right juju out of it. But that’s a good thing: It gave me the sense of a vital future in which, in my dotage, I might become not Whistler’s Mother, but Whistler’s hot aunt.“You can be 70 and still score in this dress,” I told Ms. Myers, who agreed.It is perhaps blasphemous to suggest that the worthy Mr. Elbaz’s more profound talent is his genius for interior design, which is so articulated in this space that one really wishes Lanvin had a furniture collection.The lightly pickled parquet floors look as if the lady of the house snowed talc all over them while sashaying from the bath. The mix of furniture is sleek, simple, neo-Classical: upholstered Greco-Roman wooden benches and armless chairs, overlapping zebra rugs. I was told that the blown-glass jellyfish-like chandeliers were selected at Paris flea markets by Mr. Elbaz and his life partner, Alex Koo, Lanvin’s marketing director. “What a life,” I sighed.The third level has a white sitting area, around which are various spangled and shredded components of the Blanche bridal collection. At first, because of the droopy flowers and the fragile-looking nature of one creation in distressed tulle, I thought this might be a reference to Blanche DuBois, but Ms. Myers assured me it was merely French. Still, there was something poignant about the idea of the proto-cougar Blanche finally getting her happy ending, being married in that wilted old ball gown, dancing the Varsouviana, starry-eyed at her besotted groom.Lanvin has scored a hit of late with its jewelry: heavy pearls wrapped in black tulle and silk ribbon. The baubles I saw were even heavier — thick metal chains with panthers and pagan goat heads swinging from them. Somehow these seemed relatable to the symbolic heaviness of wealth: shackles of bling, as seen on TV drug dealers.On my second tour through the racks, the unfinished details began to look less avant-garde than short-cutty. I was annoyed that the zippers on the outside of an otherwise adorable silk dress had been jagged at the ends with pinking shears. A $1,560 cashmere cardigan with shredded chiffon lapels seemed a bit unforgivable. I finally hit the wall at a $3,900 nylon leopard-print raincoat, which was fetching, but I recalled once seeing a very near approximation of it packed in a Totes tube with a matching umbrella for around $32.Such is the danger of great luxury. At a certain point, the snake swallows its own tail. When societies become too rich and civilized, they decline and dissipate around the edges, and they begin to adopt as new and luxe signifiers normally associated with the peasantry. The rich seem to grow nostalgic for entropy after a few decades of being too shiny and clean. Even Marie-Antoinette built her Hameau de la Reine because she needed to dress like a dirty little milkmaid once in a while.The house of Lanvin’s unblemished history in fashion now includes a pricey hint of death around the edges. Just enough of a glimpse of the skeleton under the skin to remind you where all that money will get you, eventually.LA VIBE The ineffable geist of Lanvin was articulated by the young man with the pierced tragus hired to arrange spangled shoes in the vitrines: “Lanvin is one of the most complicated beings, because there aren’t any black-and-white rules. It’s about a spirit and a feeling.”LES VAIN While the staff is relaxed and down-to-earth, customers can be a bit (ahem) resistible. I saw a lockjawed young woman breeze down the stairs past various saleswomen, saying: “Mo-o-om? Can you thzip the top of my dreth?”LAWN VAN: When in doubt, almost everything is around $3,000, but there are token creations wrought in T-shirt material for the labor or label slave — or both (deconstructed T-shirt, $335; goddess-draped jersey dress, $660).'"

"'10-08-13,'0','PEORIA, Ill. (AP) — Caterpillar said Thursday it would build a new plant in Texas to manufacture hydraulic excavators that would employ more than 500 workers.The plant, in the south central town of Victoria, will triple Caterpillar’s hydraulic excavator production capacity in the United States, and double the number of Caterpillar’s employees making excavators in the country. Construction of the 600,000-square-foot structure will begin next month, with production expected to start in mid-2012.“Based on our comprehensive review of possible locations, Victoria’s proximity to our supply base, access to ports and other transportation, as well as the positive business climate in Texas made this the ideal site for this project,” said Gary Stampanato, Caterpillar vice president with responsibility for excavators.Caterpillar received a $1.18 million grant from the Texas Enterprise Fund as part of its commitment to build in the state, Gov. Rick Perry said Thursday. Since its creation in 2003, the fund has invested more than $397 million in securing job-creating projects in the state.Currently in the United States, Caterpillar produces two excavator models at a facility in Aurora, Ill., where it also makes wheel loaders, soil and landfill compactors, wheel dozers and components. Caterpillar also makes excavators in Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Indonesia, Japan and Russia. The new plant will manufacture the two models now made in Aurora, as well as several other models now produced in Akashi, Japan, and exported to the United States.In July, Caterpillar reported a 91 percent surge in second-quarter earnings driven by strong sales, particularly in emerging markets like China.'"

"'10-08-13,'0','Its narrative is organized around Mr. Killen’s trial. As this event approaches and unfolds, we hear from black and white members of the Philadelphia Coalition, a kind of unofficial truth commission devoted partly to bringing about reconciliation on a personal level, partly to exercising moral pressure on state officials.We also hear from other residents of Neshoba County, many of whom are adamant that the past should be left alone. Their wish to “let sleeping dogs lie” collides with the families’ longstanding desire to see justice done.But the dramatic heart of the film consists of scenes that, in plain moviegoing terms, transform “Neshoba” from an earnest courtroom chronicle into something much more fascinating and troubling. These are interviews with Mr. Killen himself. A member of the Philadelphia Coalition observes that a lot of white Southerners who hold racist views tend, nowadays, to express them “in code.” Mr. Killen is not one of them. His passionate defense of segregation is startling now, though it would have been unremarkable in 1964.“I’m not a Jew hater,” he says at one point, after having explained how Jews and Communists control the media, and he is unguarded and outspoken in defending his loathing for the “outsiders” and local troublemakers who threatened his Christian, racially pure way of life 40 years ago.Mr. Killen is a contradictory figure. A hard worker and, by the testimony of his wife, a devoted husband, he can be witty and gracious. But the camera stays with him long enough to catch glimpses of the darker aspects of his personality, in particular the cold, contemptuous, dehumanizing way he speaks of his adversaries. He proclaims his innocence and yet, at the same time, often seems tempted to boast about the crimes — principled acts of civic duty, in his mind — that he says he had no part in.His defenders, including some former members of the Ku Klux Klan, argue that the prosecutors made Mr. Killen a scapegoat. Ben Chaney and others wonder why he was the only suspect indicted for a murder that is known to have involved at least a dozen local citizens, quite a few of whom are still alive.It is by now a matter of historical record that in a great many Southern jurisdictions, from Albany, Ga., to Lowndes County, Ala., and throughout Mississippi, law enforcement officials and politicians, citizens’ councils and the Klan worked together to terrorize and intimidate blacks and to enforce a self-protective code of silence on potentially dissenting whites.All of this history is richly present in “Neshoba,” but it is not only of historical interest. It was a Mississippi writer, after all, who observed that “the past isn’t dead. It isn’t even past.” This film is a document of hope, progress and idealism but also a reminder that the deep springs of bigotry and violence that fed a long, vicious campaign of domestic terrorism have not dried up.Produced, directed and edited by Micki Dickoff and Tony Pagano; written by Ms. Dickoff; director of photography, Mr. Pagano; music by Chris Davis; released by First Run Features.

"'10-08-13,'0','There are some movies about youth that just make you feel old, even if you aren’t. “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” based on a series of sprightly graphic novels by Bryan Lee O’Malley, has the opposite effect. Its speedy, funny, happy-sad spirit is so infectious that the movie makes you feel at home in its world even if the landscape is, at first glance, unfamiliar.I don’t mean the streets of Toronto, where the movie is set, and which we have all seen on-screen before, usually pretending to be the streets of other cities. (“Wait, they make movies in Toronto?” says Scott Pilgrim, deadpanning one of a million quick little jokes threaded through the action.) The drab, mumbly realism with which the director Edgar Wright depicts that city is offset — subverted, enlivened, thrown into crazy do-it-yourself pop-art relief — by images and situations drawn from arcade video games.These are part of Scott’s life in the usual way. He is a 22-year-old bass guitarist who plays the game Dance Dance Revolution on a date with one girlfriend and tries to impress both her and another would-be girlfriend with arcane lore about the origins of Pac-Man. But Scott, played by Michael Cera with even less macho swagger than he showed in “Juno” and “Superbad” (he has the voice of Gumby and the muscle tone to match), is also a video game character. His post-adolescent life — rehearsing with his band, mooning over some girls and avoiding others, hanging out with his roommate, moping and napping and avoiding work — is periodically disrupted by spectacular battles with mighty foes. Their powers and his are tallied up on-screen, and he must negotiate a complex system of points, levels and lives of a kind easily recognizable to any joystick jockey.To say that “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” is the best video game movie ever may sound like absurdly faint praise, though I have high hopes for “Tron: Legacy.” Most films that try to exploit the popularity of gaming mimic the look and mood of state-of-the-art first-person games, rather than the cruder, more cartoony ones evoked here. But Mr. Wright’s deeper ingenuity (and Mr. O’Malley’s) is to collapse the distance between gamer and avatar not by throwing the player into the world of the game, but rather by bringing it to him. (If you want to reverse this process there is now a Scott Pilgrim video game.) As a result, the line between fantasy and reality is not so much blurred as erased, because the filmmakers create an entirely coherent, perpetually surprising universe that builds on Mr. O’Malley’s bold and unpretentious graphic style without slavishly duplicating it.But back to Scott, who lives in a basement room with Wallace (Kieran Culkin), a gay best friend who happily embodies the stereotype even as he smashes it to pieces. Wallace is one of several characters who observe and comment on Scott’s life while conducting their own dramas in the margins of his mock-epic struggle. Another is Scott’s sister, Stacey (Anna Kendrick), who offers him not-so-patient advice on his girl troubles, which seem to be legion. When the story begins, Scott is still bruised after being dumped, a year earlier, by Envy (Brie Larson), who has gone on to become a rock star, with a recording contract and posters of her looking fierce all over town.'"

"'10-08-13,'0','The farm stand is becoming the new apothecary, dispensing apples — not to mention artichokes, asparagus and arugula — to fill a novel kind of prescription.Doctors at three health centers in Massachusetts have begun advising patients to eat “prescription produce” from local farmers’ markets, in an effort to fight obesity in children of low-income families. Now they will give coupons amounting to $1 a day for each member of a patient’s family to promote healthy meals.“A lot of these kids have a very limited range of fruits and vegetables that are acceptable and familiar to them. Potentially, they will try more,” said Dr. Suki Tepperberg, a family physician at Codman Square Health Center in Dorchester, one of the program sites. “The goal is to get them to increase their consumption of fruit and vegetables by one serving a day.”The effort may also help farmers’ markets compete with fast-food restaurants selling dollar value meals. Farmers’ markets do more than $1 billion in annual sales in the United States, according to the Agriculture Department.Massachusetts was one of the first states to promote these markets as hubs of preventive health. In the 1980s, for example, the state began issuing coupons for farmers’ markets to low-income women who were pregnant or breast-feeding or for young children at risk for malnourishment. Thirty-six states now have such farmers’ market nutrition programs aimed at women and young children.Thomas M. Menino, the mayor of Boston, said he believed the new children’s program, in which doctors write vegetable “prescriptions” to be filled at farmers’ markets, was the first of its kind. Doctors will track participants to determine how the program affects their eating patterns and to monitor health indicators like weight and body mass index, he said.“When I go to work in the morning, I see kids standing at the bus stop eating chips and drinking a soda,” Mr. Menino said in a phone interview earlier this week. “I hope this will help them change their eating habits and lead to a healthier lifestyle.”The mayor’s attention to healthy eating dates to his days as a city councilman. Most recently he has appointed a well-known chef as a food policy director to promote local foods in public schools and to foster market gardens in the city.Although obesity is a complex problem unlikely to be solved just by eating more vegetables, supporters of the veggie voucher program hope that physician intervention will spur young people to adopt the kind of behavioral changes that can help forestall lifelong obesity.Childhood obesity in the United States costs $14.1 billion annually in direct health expenses like prescription drugs and visits to doctors and emergency rooms, according to a recent article on the economics of childhood obesity published in the journal Health Affairs. Treating obesity-related illness in adults costs an estimated $147 billion annually, the article said.Although the vegetable prescription pilot project is small, its supporters see it as a model for encouraging obese children and their families to increase the volume and variety of fresh produce they eat.“Can we help people in low-income areas, who shop in the center of supermarkets for low-cost empty-calorie food, to shop at farmers’ markets by making fruit and vegetables more affordable?” said Gus Schumacher, the chairman of Wholesome Wave, a nonprofit group in Bridgeport, Conn., that supports family farmers and community access to locally grown produce.If the pilot project is successful, Mr. Schumacher said, “farmers’ markets would become like a fruit and vegetable pharmacy for at-risk families.”The pilot project plans to enroll up to 50 families of four at three health centers in Massachusetts that already have specialized children’s programs called healthy weight clinics.A foundation called CAVU, for Ceiling and Visibility Unlimited, sponsors the clinics that are administering the veggie project. The Massachusetts Department of Agriculture and Wholesome Wave each contributed $10,000 in seed money. (Another arm of the program, at several health centers in Maine, is giving fresh produce vouchers to pregnant mothers.) The program is to run until the end of the farmers’ market season in late fall.One month after Leslie-Ann Ogiste, a certified nursing assistant in Boston, and her 9-year-old son, Makael Constance, received their first vegetable prescription vouchers at the Codman Center, they have lost a combined four pounds, she said. A staff member at the center told Ms. Ogiste about a farmers’ market that is five minutes from her apartment, she said.“It worked wonders,” said Ms. Ogiste, who bought and prepared eggplant, cucumbers, tomatoes, summer squash, corn, bok choy, parsley, carrots and red onions. “Just the variety, it did help.”Ms. Ogiste said she had minced some vegetables and used them in soup, pasta sauce and rice dishes — the better to disguise the new good-for-you foods that she served her son.Makael said he did not mind. “It’s really good,” he said.Some nutrition researchers said that the Massachusetts project had a good chance of improving eating habits in the short term. But, they added, a vegetable prescription program in isolation may not have a long-term influence on reducing obesity. Families may revert to their former habits in the winter when the farmers’ markets are closed, these researchers said, or they may not be able to afford fresh produce after the voucher program ends.Dr. Shikha Anand, the medical director of CAVU’s healthy weight initiative, said the group hoped to make the veggie prescription project a year-round program through partnerships with grocery stores.But people tend to overeat junk food in higher proportion than they undereat vegetables, said Dr. Deborah A. Cohen, a senior natural scientist at the RAND Corporation. So, unless people curtail excessive consumption of salty and sugary snacks, she said, behavioral changes like eating more fruit and vegetables will have limited effect on obesity.In a recent study led by Dr. Cohen, for example, people in southern Louisiana typically exceeded guidelines for eating salty and sugary foods by 120 percent in the course of a day while falling short of vegetable and fruit consumption by 20 percent.The weight clinics in Massachusetts chosen for the vegetable prescription test project already encourage families to cut down on unhealthy snacks.Even as Ms. Ogiste and her son started shopping at the farmers’ market and eating more fresh produce, for example, they also cut back on junk food, she said.“We have stopped the snacks. We are drinking more water and less soda and less juice too,” Ms. Ogiste said. “All of that helped.”'"
"'10-08-13,'0','Still, the Afghan National Army runs relatively few operations on its own, particularly large-scale ones. They take a little more than half as many casualties as coalition military forces, who now have roughly the same number of troops in the country. (In 2009, according to NATO figures, 282 Afghan soldiers were killed, compared with 521 coalition soldiers.) American advisers are included in most Afghan operations. It is not clear whether any were involved in this one.The operation began when the Afghan Army sent a battalion of about 300 men from the First Brigade, 201st Army Corps, into a village called Bad Pakh, in Laghman Province, which is adjacent to the troubled border province of Kunar. Their operation, which began on the night of Aug. 3, was to flush out Taliban in a rugged area where they had long held sway. First, using the Afghan Army’s own helicopters, a detachment was inserted behind Taliban lines, while the main part of the battalion attacked from the front.But, according to a high-ranking official of the Afghan Ministry of Defense, the plan was betrayed; Taliban forces were waiting with an ambush against the main body of troops. Then the airborne detachment was cut off when bad weather grounded its helicopters, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.In the confusion, the 201st Army Corps commanders lost contact with the battalion. The battalion’s Third Company — 100 men — took particularly heavy casualties, the official said, although he did not have a number. He said many of the company were killed, captured or missing, and as of Wednesday at least, the status of the rest of the battalion remained unclear.However, the senior American military official said the battalion had not been lost. “We know exactly where that battalion is,” he said, “although there are several soldiers unaccounted for and several killed.” He estimated that “about 10” soldiers had been killed and that no more than a platoon were missing, meaning up to 20 soldiers.An official of the Red Crescent in the area said that casualties were very heavy on the government side and that the Taliban had destroyed 35 Ford Ranger trucks, the standard Afghan Army transport vehicle, which typically carry six or more soldiers each.Officially, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. Muhammed Zahair Azimi, said that there were only seven dead and 14 wounded and that the number taken prisoner was unknown. “We cannot say the number captured because some of them were in difficult places, but some of our soldiers were captured by the Taliban,” General Azimi said Wednesday. In addition, seven army vehicles were burned, he said, adding, “No other vehicles are in the hands of the enemy.”A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, spoke of a far more devastating toll. He said the militants’ ambush killed 27 Afghan soldiers, wounded 14 and led to the capture of 8, while 18 army vehicles and 6 tanks were seized. “The NATO-Afghan terrorists were forced to retreat in humiliation after taking on heavy casualties,” Mr. Mujahid said. The Taliban often wildly exaggerate the damage they inflict.Both Afghan and American officials said that many Taliban fighters were killed and that the insurgents continued to take casualties through Thursday. Government forces now have the Taliban surrounded, General Azimi said.A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Kabul, Bijan Frederic Farnoudi, confirmed reports that the group had tried to recover bodies and the wounded but had been turned back because the fighting was too intense. “We’re monitoring and ready to go,” he said. “As soon as it’s possible we’re willing to go in.”A tribal elder, a former Taliban official who has switched to the government side, said the Taliban contacted him to arrange for the Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross to remove the dead. “The Taliban commander said the bodies are decaying and it’s a problem for us,” he said, asking not to be named for his safety. “One of the Taliban told me, ‘I took three A.N.A. soldiers prisoner myself, then took them home and killed them in my house, so my home would be the home of a hero.’ ”The International Security Assistance Force referred all questions about the operation to Afghan officials. “We can’t confirm information past what the M.O.D. released since this started as a unilateral Afghan operation,” said Col. Hans E. Bush, a spokesman for the NATO mission in Afghanistan. He added that a “personnel recovery” operation was under way, using the term for a rescue operation for wounded, dead or missing soldiers.“When ISAF conducts personnel recovery missions,” Colonel Bush said, “we consider them sensitive operations and do not provide public details while the operation is under way in order to safeguard any information/intelligence advantage we may have.”Most officials in Laghman Province declined to comment about the fighting. On Wednesday, Iqbal Azizi, the governor of Laghman, described it as minor and said that only one policeman had been killed.A local journalist for Pajhwok Afghan News, a news agency, who wrote about the attack was called in by the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan intelligence service, and questioned for several hours, according to the news agency’s director, Danish Karokhel.'"

"'10-08-14,'0','For months, the Federal Communications Commission’s efforts to guarantee nondiscriminatory access to broadband Internet have met opposition from the companies that provide broadband service and from their allies in Congress. On Monday, Verizon and Google created a stir by jointly proposing an alternative set of rules as the basis for new legislation governing the Internet.Every voice is valuable in this debate, and some of the ideas put forth by Google and Verizon are reasonable in principle. But the overall effect would dangerously limit the commission’s reach. That’s not where Congress should be headed. The F.C.C. should have an expanded role in regulating what is rapidly becoming the most important channel of communication in the world.The Google/Verizon proposal gives broadband providers lots of leeway to offer preferential treatment to some and to choke off others. Most important, the two companies propose to exempt wireless communication from most government regulation — a serious error.We strongly agreed with the principle articulated by President Obama and his F.C.C. chairman, Julius Genachowski, that the Internet should remain open on equal terms to all, a level playing field for Web sites big and small. Phone and cable companies claim that overregulation of broadband will stifle investment. They say the principle of “net neutrality” must be tempered by provisions to allow service providers to manage traffic on their pipes. This is not unreasonable in principle, if narrowly tailored to the problem. But the Verizon-Google proposal gives companies too much wiggle room.They would allow broadband service providers to split the Internet into a high-end pipe for new types of zippier paid services and a lower-speed pipe carrying regular broadband. And they propose to bar only “undue” discrimination that causes “meaningful harm to competition or to users” of broadband. Providers would be allowed to manage their networks to address congestion, “ensure network security or integrity,” to “prioritize general classes or types of Internet traffic,” to “ensure service quality” and more.The companies propose freeing wireless broadband — the fastest growing part of the Internet — from any antidiscrimination restrictions. Verizon, which markets phones running Google’s Android operating system, might, for instance, find it lucrative to one day block Microsoft’s search engine, Bing.'"

"'10-08-14,'0','In all those examples, the agencies are exceeding what federal law requires in terms of openness and disclosure. The motive, the regulators say, is to forestall any notion that the banking industry’s well-heeled lobbyists, lawyers or bankers — who are, in some cases, former regulators themselves — could have undue influence over the new rules.“We owe it to the public to have an open-door policy so that people can see for themselves how financial services reform is going to be implemented,” Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., said in announcing the agency’s new disclosure requirements.Other regulatory agencies, like the Federal Communications Commission, already disclose meetings between regulators and lobbyists over proposed rules. What is new in the case of the financial regulators is that the disclosure rules apply to all discussions involving the legislation, before any particular rule-making.Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant at the S.E.C., said the agency was probably motivated not just by a desire for transparency, but by a need to streamline the huge rule-writing task ahead.“I don’t think it’s a sea change in terms of the agency being transparent, but it’s an excellent, thoughtful response to the fact that they have so many rule-makings to do in such a short period of time,” he said. “This is the only chance of getting through it in a reasoned manner.”Signed by President Obama last month, the Dodd-Frank bill, as the financial regulatory legislation is being called, requires regulators to draft hundreds of rules governing everything from bank capital standards to derivatives trades. In many cases the rule writers have been given broad discretion, prompting fears from supporters of the law that its goals could be thwarted by watered-down rules.Lobbyists so far have accepted the new requirements without complaint. “There is no nefarious handshake meeting that is being kept secret,” said Scott E. Talbott, a lawyer and lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry group that supports disclosure, though he acknowledged that some companies might not be comfortable with extensive disclosure.“Some participants prefer not to take a high profile,” he said. “Some like to stay under the radar. But the point here is to get the right answer, and full disclosure and debate is the best way to achieve that.”But one former regulator expressed concern that the new rules — the Fed and the F.D.I.C. are insisting that even coffee shop conversations be reported — might have unintended effects.“It seems to me that it’s really going overboard to provide public disclosure of all of that,” said Robert L. Clarke, who was comptroller of the currency from 1985 to 1992. “I would hope it wouldn’t have a chilling effect on people’s willingness to express their views on the regulatory process.”Mr. Clarke, a banking lawyer in Houston, does not currently represent any clients seeking to shape the forthcoming rules. But he said that regulators often lacked industry experience and could benefit from the perspectives of bankers and the trade associations that represent them.“When you’re dealing with regulatory agencies, as opposed to politicians, people tend to overestimate the amount of influence that lobbyists can have,” Mr. Clarke said. “I’m concerned that the public might have the impression that when these regulations get written, the industry representatives and the regulators get into a smoke-filled room and out comes the regulation. That’s not the way it works.”The federal Administrative Procedures Act has long required that agencies give notification about proposed rule-makings and allow the public to comment.Agencies like the Fed and the S.E.C. are going beyond the law’s requirements by disclosing meetings with lobbyists, and by encouraging and publicizing submissions even before there are proposed rules.Not all of the agencies affected by the legislation are going that far.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the agency that Mr. Clarke used to lead, is sticking with past practices.“We think the existing process has served us well,” said Robert M. Garsson, a deputy comptroller at the office, which supervises national banks. “We do try to encourage interested parties to provide comments in writing so they can be published for the public to review, and we do, as part of the comment file, list meetings held with interested parties.”The Office of Thrift Supervision, which supervises savings-and-loan associations, will continue to release public information from the appointment calendars of its officials “upon request, as it has in the past,” said a spokesman, William M. Ruberry. (The office is a special case; under the Dodd-Frank law, it is being eliminated, with its functions transferred to other regulatory agencies.)Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies campaign contributions and lobbying, said that prompt disclosure of lobbyists’ contacts with regulators was even more significant than opening the electronic floodgates to public comment.“It’s rare in the federal government for the public to have meaningful access to meetings between lobbyists and officials,” he said. “Any step that’s going to enhance transparency and the public’s ability to find out which lobbyists, from what company or industry, are meeting with whom is a good thing for public knowledge.”Mr. Levinthal said he hoped the regulatory agencies would guard against efforts to “make an end-run” around the new requirements. “Lobbyists want as little of their activities publicized as possible,” he said.'"

"'10-08-15,'0','State and local school financing, which make up almost all of public schools’ money, is falling because of budget-balancing efforts and lower property- and sales-tax revenue.“Some of the things that have been historically provided by schools, we’re not able to provide at this point,” said Barbara A. Chester, president of the National Association of Elementary School Principals.On the list for pre-kindergartners at McClendon Elementary in Nevada, Tex.: a package of cotton balls, two containers of facial tissue, rolls of paper towels, sheaves of manila and construction paper, and a package of paper sandwich bags.Pre-kindergartners in the Joshua school district in Texas have to track down Dixie cups and paper plates, while students at New Central Elementary in Havana, Ill., and Mesa Middle School in Castle Rock, Colo., must come to class with a pack of printer paper. Wet Swiffer refills and plastic cutlery are among the requests from St. Joseph School in Seattle. And at Pauoa Elementary School in Honolulu, every student must show up with a four-pack of toilet paper.For the retailers, back-to-school season is second only to the holidays, and parents’ longer school-supply lists are a bonus — especially at a time when shoppers are reluctant to spend. While the impact is not enormous, retailers are looking for anything to lift sales.“It’s newfound business that the retailers didn’t have a year or two ago,” said Steve Mahurin, executive vice president of merchandising for Office Depot.The shift is notable even at stores that sell much more than office supplies.“When I walk through the back rooms of our stores where the layaway orders are stored, not only are you seeing things you expect to see — computers, apparel,” said Mark Snyder, chief marketing officer of Kmart, “you’re seeing these sort of household supplies that teachers are asking, school systems are asking, kids to now bring.”For several years, the lists have been getting lengthier, but in many parts of the country, educators and retailers say, the economic downturn has also pushed them into uncharted territory. “It’s definitely spiked this year,” said Bob Thacker, senior vice president of marketing and advertising at OfficeMax.Many stores have tailored their offerings to reflect the demands of local schools, collecting the back-to-school supply lists and stocking inventory accordingly.Mr. Thacker said the change had meant bigger orders this summer of things like cleaning supplies and paper towels. “It’s just changed the way our merchants buy things for their different areas,” he said.In some places, though, parents being asked to make up depleted school budgets are under budget pressure, too, which has left schools without a clear solution.Malcolm Thomas, the superintendent of the Escambia County school district on Florida’s Gulf Coast, has put supplies like plastic bags, Kleenex and soap under an “optional” category because “we know that people in our community are hurting,” he said. He also seeks donations from local businesses.If those efforts don’t bring in enough supplies, it means either his teachers — who start at a salary of $32,500 — usually pay for the supplies themselves, or the district “would probably have to get into cutting personnel if we had to supply absolutely everything,” he said.In Noblesville, Ind., Kristi Smith, 41, a teacher’s aide, said she was sympathetic to the cost pressures at her daughters’ elementary school, but she also thought the supply list was a little extreme.“Sometimes I think it’s too much,” she said. “Is my fourth grader really going to use 50 pencils herself?”Ms. Cooper, the Alabama mother, spent her summer making the most of the school-supply stores’ new interest in classroom supplies. “Each week I go to the stores’ Web sites — Staples, OfficeMax, Office Depot,” she said, and posts the deals on a blog for fellow bargain hunters. “All three of these major stores are offering jaw-dropping deals every week,” she said.And as overwhelming as it might seem to some parents, she would rather buy the goods than expect Emily’s teacher to do so, she said.“We don’t expect Wal-Mart cashiers to buy the plastic bags for our groceries, or the mailman to pay for the gas to deliver our mail,” Ms. Cooper said.'"

"'10-08-15,'0','That dual legacy — a brilliant collection but with a low public profile — is what Mari Lyn Salvador inherited when she took over as the museum’s director in December.Ms. Salvador has embarked on an ambitious effort to centralize the museum and bring it to the public. If she succeeds, the Bay Area could eventually be host to a world-class anthropology museum that boasts the open access that its founder envisioned.“Phoebe Hearst believed in public education, research and learning, not just in acquiring objects,” Ms. Salvador said. “The museum should become an open source.”The collection is housed in more than 100,000 square feet in scattered facilities on or near the campus, but Ms. Salvador said she dreamed of a new facility that could accommodate research and that included a hands-on open study section and a public museum. She envisions interactive online access to the collection, as well as video-streaming courses from faculty members and other scholars.That vision, Ms. Salvador concedes, would carry a hefty price tag. She demurs at identifying a hard number, mindful of the economy and the state’s budget shortfall, saying instead that fund-raising will occur in stages over the next seven or more years. The current operating budget is $3 million, of which $1.275 million was paid by the state in the 2008-9 fiscal year, down about $50,000 from the previous year, Ms. Salvador said.In the meantime, work has begun on creating a contemporary catalog of the collection. Michael Black, a boyish scholar with a doctorate in human evolution who manages the museum’s research and information systems, is busy digitizing old, barely discernible, sometimes handwritten catalog cards.“For a century, this information was tightly controlled,” Mr. Black said. “We got resistance from the old academics who didn’t want us giving away information they felt entitled to keep to themselves in order to lure their graduate students.”“We’re mere custodians,” Mr. Black added. “My job is to get the collection documented and deliverable to the most people.”Robert Price, associate vice chancellor for research at Berkeley, said in an e-mail: “Unfortunately, the museum has not had a facility with which it could adequately display its world-class collections. Going forward, and under the leadership of the museum’s new director, we intend to raise the funds to construct such a building so that the public can enjoy the Hearst’s priceless treasures.”Ms. Salvador has begun inviting people in. At the end of April, artifacts from the Egyptian collection were put on display — first for a group of third graders who had spent a year studying Egyptology, and then for the general public.A visit to the labyrinthine catacombs beneath the museum reveals a broad range of treasures — 1,500-year-old Peruvian tapestries, Egyptian pottery from early 20th-century expeditions joined by Ms. Hearst herself, Turkish dervish skirts, American Indian baskets adorned with quail topknot feathers.Using a heavy metal wheel, Natasha Johnson, a museum collection manager, swings open a high, sturdy metal vault. With a look of reverence and childish excitement, she slides out one of the shelves — marked 1-19477 — to reveal a single, luminous, finely tapered, nearly three-inch-long triangle, which turns out to be an early 20th-century arrowhead.The story behind the object is as compelling as its beauty. It was fashioned from brown glass by Ishi, the last surviving member of the Yana, the last of California’s indigenous tribes, who lived as if in the Stone Age in the Sierra foothills until discovered in 1911.Ishi actually lived for a period in the Hearst Museum; he became an ex officio member of the faculty, offering firsthand insights into a departed culture.Ms. Salvador made a name for herself as a scholar of ancient Panamanian textiles, as well as serving on the faculty at the University of New Mexico and as the director of the Museum of Man in San Diego. She earned her bachelor’s degree, master’s degree and Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from Berkeley, but said she hesitated at first to take a job at her alma mater given the challenges with the museum and its known emphasis on research.But she said she was attracted to the challenge of creating a public museum while preserving the research tradition.“All the scholarship is not going away,” Ms. Salvador said. “But should scholarship be confined to recognized scholars? To learn or understand deeply one’s own culture is to learn and respect other cultures. Students should curate their own shows. Members of communities represented here can not only rediscover their heritage but teach us, as well.”Those are sweet words to Ira Jacknis, a research anthropologist who has been at the museum for 20 “sometimes trying” years.“As it stands,” Mr. Jacknis said, “we are a big museum in terms of collection, but in terms of square footage and display space in ratio to our objects, we are tiny. Similar museums at the Universities of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, New Mexico and Arizona all have more space and more modern facilities housing far fewer items.”Mr. Jacknis, the museum’s resident anthropologist and a Hearst scholar, also sings the collection’s praises. “I still step down into the collections in our basement and know I am in a fantastic space,” he said. “I come to work every day and learn something new.”The American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington are also not open viewing centers. Only 2 percent of the 30 million specimens and artifacts held by the New York museum are within public view at any one time. The rest, a spokesman said, “remain invaluable resources for museum scientists and their colleagues worldwide.”Ms. Salvador said she had no illusions about the Hearst Museum’s becoming a million-square-foot Smithsonian of the West. Her dream, she contends, is to continue Phoebe Hearst’s dream for the collection, as articulated in a letter Ms. Hearst wrote on July 24, 1900, to a colleague at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, to facilitate “the dissemination of knowledge among the many, not the pride of possession by the few.”'"
"'10-08-15,'0','JVAVUNIYA, Sri Lanka (Reuters) — Members of Sri Lanka’s minority Tamils testified before a government-appointed war commission on Saturday, alleging human rights violations during the final stages of the army’s offensive against separatist Tamil Tiger rebels.Witnesses told the commission about loved ones who were taken away by unidentified gangs, and sometimes by the military as it pressed on against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in a 25-year war that ended last year.“My husband was abducted in a white van on Sept. 4, 2008, by an unidentified gang,” Umakanthan Naguleshwari told the commission with tears in her eyes. “There is no information about him.”President Mahinda Rajapaksa set up the panel, called the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission, to look into the last seven years of the war, after turning down Western requests for an independent investigation into widespread allegations of abuse by the military during the war.The United States and rights groups have questioned the credibility of the commission, which began hearings this week in the northern town of Vavuniya where tens of thousands of minority Tamils displaced by the fighting were kept in camps.'"
"'10-08-15,'0','WITH the academic year about to begin, colleges and universities, as well as students and their parents, are facing an unprecedented financial crisis. What we’ve seen with California’s distinguished state university system — huge cutbacks in spending and a 32 percent rise in tuition — is likely to become the norm at public and private colleges. Government support is being slashed, endowments and charitable giving are down, debts are piling up, expenses are rising and some schools are selling their product for two-thirds of what it costs to produce it. You don’t need an M.B.A. to know this situation is unsustainable.With unemployment soaring, higher education has never been more important to society or more widely desired. But the collapse of our public education system and the skyrocketing cost of private education threaten to make college unaffordable for millions of young people. If recent trends continue, four years at a top-tier school will cost $330,000 in 2020, $525,000 in 2028 and $785,000 in 2035.Yet most faculty and administrators refuse to acknowledge this crisis. Consider what is taking place here in New York City. Rather than learning to live within their means, Columbia University, where I teach, and New York University are engaged in a fierce competition to expand as widely and quickly as possible. Last spring, N.Y.U. announced plans to increase its physical plant by 40 percent over the next 20 years; this summer Columbia secured approval for its $6.3 billion expansion in Upper Manhattan. N.Y.U. is also opening a new campus in Abu Dhabi this fall.The financial arrangements for these projects remain obscure, but it is clear that they will not be completed without increasing the universities’ already significant and perhaps unsustainable levels of debt. Last year Columbia reported $1.4 billion in outstanding debt against a $5.89 billion endowment. N.Y.U. had a staggering $2.22 billion debt with a relatively modest $2.2 billion endowment — one that had shrunk by more than 11 percent over the previous fiscal year. For universities, as for banks, the question is not only the value of current and projected assets but also the availability of liquidity so they can pay off interim debt obligations during a time of financial instability.There is a similarity between the debt crisis on Wall Street and what threatens higher education. Just as investors borrowed more and increased their leverage in volatile markets, many colleges and universities are borrowing more and betting on an expanding market in higher education at the precise moment their product is becoming affordable for fewer people.Financial aid is drying up and government support is not keeping pace with the rising cost of college, so students and parents are being forced to borrow more heavily. For decades, admissions offices have marketed themselves by promising a significant return on the investment in the form of higher lifetime income. But with the cost of an undergraduate degree well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, this argument is no longer persuasive. Students and their parents are carrying unsustainable levels of debt, which is likely to lead to a crisis that will mirror the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. To make matters worse, student debt is even more toxic than a soured mortgage, because it is nearly impossible for a person to legally walk away from student loans the way a homeowner can walk away from a mortgage.'"
"'10-08-15,'0','IN our society, cars receive considerable attention and study — whether the subject is buying and selling them, the traffic congestion they cause or the dangerous things we do in them, like texting and talking on cellphones while driving. But we haven’t devoted nearly enough thought to how cars are usually deployed — namely, by sitting in parking spaces.Is this a serious economic issue? In fact, it’s a classic tale of how subsidies, use restrictions, and price controls can steer an economy in wrong directions. Car owners may not want to hear this, but we have way too much free parking.Higher charges for parking spaces would limit our trips by car. That would cut emissions, alleviate congestion and, as a side effect, improve land use. Donald C. Shoup, professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, has made this idea a cause, as presented in his 733-page book, “The High Cost of Free Parking.”Many suburbanites take free parking for granted, whether it’s in the lot of a big-box store or at home in the driveway. Yet the presence of so many parking spaces is an artifact of regulation and serves as a powerful subsidy to cars and car trips. Legally mandated parking lowers the market price of parking spaces, often to zero. Zoning and development restrictions often require a large number of parking spaces attached to a store or a smaller number of spaces attached to a house or apartment block.If developers were allowed to face directly the high land costs of providing so much parking, the number of spaces would be a result of a careful economic calculation rather than a matter of satisfying a legal requirement. Parking would be scarcer, and more likely to have a price — or a higher one than it does now — and people would be more careful about when and where they drove.The subsidies are largely invisible to drivers who park their cars — and thus free or cheap parking spaces feel like natural outcomes of the market, or perhaps even an entitlement. Yet the law is allocating this land rather than letting market prices adjudicate whether we need more parking, and whether that parking should be free. We end up overusing land for cars — and overusing cars too. You don’t have to hate sprawl, or automobiles, to want to stop subsidizing that way of life.As Professor Shoup wrote, “Minimum parking requirements act like a fertility drug for cars.”Under a more sensible policy, a parking space that is currently free could cost at least $100 a month — and maybe much more — in many American cities and suburbs. At the bottom end of that estimate, if a commuter drives to work 20 days a month, current parking policy offers a subsidy of $5 a day — which is more than the gas and wear-and-tear costs of many round-trip commutes. In essence, the parking subsidy outweighs many of the other costs of driving, including the gasoline tax.In densely populated cities like New York, people are accustomed to paying high prices for parking, which has helped to encourage a relatively efficient, high-density use of space. Yet even New York is reluctant to enact the full social cost of the automobile into policy. Proposals to impose congestion fees have failed politically, and on-street parking is priced artificially low.Manhattan streets are full of cars cruising around, looking for cheaper on-street parking, rather than pulling into a lot. The waste includes drivers’ lost time and the costs of running those engines. By contrast, San Francisco has just instituted a pioneering program to connect parking meter prices to supply and demand, with prices being adjusted, over time, within a general range of 25 cents to $6 an hour.Another common practice in many cities is to restrict on-street parking to residents or to short-term parkers by imposing a limit of, say, two hours for transients. That makes parking artificially easy for residents and for people who are running quick errands. Higher fees and permit prices would help shore up the ailing budgets of local governments.Many parking spaces are extremely valuable, even if that’s not reflected in current market prices. In fact, Professor Shoup estimates that many American parking spaces have a higher economic value than the cars sitting in them. For instance, after including construction and land costs, he measures the value of a Los Angeles parking space at over $31,000 — much more than the worth of many cars, especially when considering their rapid depreciation. If we don’t give away cars, why give away parking spaces?Yet 99 percent of all automobile trips in the United States end in a free parking space, rather than a parking space with a market price. In his book, Professor Shoup estimated that the value of the free-parking subsidy to cars was at least $127 billion in 2002, and possibly much more.PERHAPS most important, if we’re going to wean ourselves away from excess use of fossil fuels, we need to remove current subsidies to energy-unfriendly ways of life. Imposing a cap-and-trade system or a direct carbon tax doesn’t seem politically acceptable right now. But we can start on alternative paths that may take us far.Imposing higher fees for parking may make further changes more palatable by helping to promote higher residential density and support for mass transit.As Professor Shoup puts it: “Who pays for free parking?

"'10-08-15,'0','I often visit the museums that were the subject of “Fine Perk for Museum Chiefs: Luxury Housing (It’s Tax-Free),” (front page, Aug. 10).I recognize that there is a high cost to maintain a museum and to bring in new exhibits. But I am offended that I am expected to pay between $10 and $25 each time that I want to enter the museum, while the directors earn $1 million or more, plus tax-free and rent-free use of a multimillion-dollar apartment.Museums are quickly becoming out of reach for all but the economically comfortable classes. In this time of deep recession, the boards of these museums need to take steps to ensure that all members of the public are able to afford the entry fee.I am realistic enough to know that if the Internal Revenue Service makes the museum chiefs pay income taxes on their rent-free residences, the museum boards will simply increase their salaries to pay the taxes — with the rest of us picking up the tab.'"

"'10-08-15,'0','Summer is probably the best time to enjoy that great American classic, the hot dog. And if you aren’t in the mood to fire up your own grill, there are some terrific frankfurters to be had at So Dam Hot, a storefront operation in Valhalla that serves mainly takeout.So Dam Hot (the name is a play on the nearby Kensico Dam) starts with pure beef hot dogs and traditional soft white buns. Both are cooked on a flat griddle visible from the counter. The result is slightly toasted bread yielding to a deliciously spicy dog.But the experience doesn’t end there. So Dam Hot is known for its toppings, which run from the expected (sauerkraut, relish, onions) to the unusual (no-bean chili, bacon and the store’s own creamy sauce with a kick). For the intrepid, there are about 50 hot sauces like Tabasco and the evocatively named Weed Killer and Devil’s Brew. The Source, made from “ghost” pepper extract, is the spiciest of all.The hot sauces are favorites of customers who order chicken wings. So Dam Hot, which has about 15 seats, also serves hamburgers, fries, pulled pork sandwiches and chicken fingers. But it’s the hot dogs — a welcome alternative to the boiled, tasteless version sold in most places — that set So Dam Hot apart.The store’s funky image is completed by its owners, Joshua Brand and Scott Licciardi, both in their late 20s, who took over the place three years ago with the enthusiasm of new entrepreneurs. Their tongue-in-cheek “restaurant rules” will win you over. “If you are concerned about calories,” says No. 3, “you are in the wrong place. We are concerned about taste.”So Dam Hot, 10 Broadway, Valhalla. (914) 328-6051; sodamhot.com.

"'10-08-15,'0','Q Who are some of your clients?A It’s a sensitive situation. I can only name the ones that are already out there in public record. Our clients over the last four or five years would include guys like Cerberus and GMAC and D. E. Shaw, the hedge fund. It would include financial institutions like ING.A We represent ING as a financial institution in dealing with a workout situation on 610 Lexington. There’s active discussions going on with the current developer, Aby Rosen. ING Real Estate Finance is in judicial proceedings in terms of foreclosure. We’re trying to find the best way to optimize recovery for our asset: we lent much of the money for the project.Q Where does New York stand in the recovery process?A New York has better prospects, on average, because it has a demand function that’s not just domestic, and because of that it tends to rebound faster.I think the high, high end is insulated relatively. But not so for repositioned properties that were bought at values that looked like value in the ’06-’07 vintage and now have value declines. There seem to be pockets on the residential side — if you’re in that $400,000-to-$700,000 range, it’s attractive and within reach for more people. At the peak, they might have been $600,000 to $1.2 million.Q Do you see investment opportunities in distressed property?A The supply isn’t quite there yet. The assets are being restricted on the balance sheets of the financial institutions.Q Why aren’t the banks making more deals?A You know the expression: a rolling loan gathers no loss. Every time you recognize a loss, that affects your capital ratios. And so there’s a time game that goes on. You want to shore up your reserves over time and defer your recognition of losses wherever you can.There is a fair amount of capital that has amassed — in REITs and funds that are focused in distressed investing. They’re all waiting for something to break. But I think there has to be a confidence level in the macro economy.A I think that stagnation is concerning people. It’s like a ball and chain dragging down an institution. And that’s pretty prevalent.Q When will things loosen up?A I think it’s more in the 2011-2012 period.A The reality is, a lot of the skill sets you learn in emergency medicine are not totally different from dealing with distressed businesses: you’re bleeding cash instead of blood, and you try to stop that bleeding and restore it to health.Q What do you do for fun?A We’re avid sports fishermen. I mostly go after big tuna — yellow fin tuna. My “couch time” is on the water — it’s therapeutic, and I don’t think about business.Q So what was your biggest catch?A About 325 pounds down in Mexico, where we have a place. It took a little over two hours to bring it in.'"
"'10-08-15,'0','Don’t let the title fool you. A lot of ground is covered in Richard C. Morais’s first novel, “The ­Hundred-Foot Journey”: close to 25 million feet, by my count, from India to England and then France, the last leg via a tricolor caravan of used Mercedes-Benzes that chugs through much of Western Europe. This is to say nothing of the psychological distance traversed by the narrator, Hassan Haji, a Muslim boy born on the edge of a slum in what was still called Bombay and then catapulted to Paris’s temples of haute cuisine. One moment he’s stirring a caldron of curried fish heads, the next he is feeding Siberian ptarmigan — roasted with herbs cut out of the bird’s own crop — to the likes of Christian Lacroix .The pace is brisk. Hassan’s Bombay childhood, including the horrific death of his mother at the hands of a Hindu mob, is dispatched in 30 pages, his coming-of-age in London (first love, first egg salad sandwich) in another 20. His father then whisks the family off on a tour of Europe by motorcade, stopping only when one of the cars breaks down in rural France — conveniently in front of a mansion for sale, which Papa immediately decides to convert into a boisterous, Bollywood-esque eatery, with Hassan as its chef.The problem is, just across the street (a hundred feet away, to be exact) stands a celebrated country inn, an archetype of French rustic elegance, complete with a “battered-black” Citroën in the driveway and Satie piped into the dining room. The proprietor, Mme. Mallory, embittered by her failure to earn a third Michelin star, gives Hassan his first exposure to that “uniquely Gallic look of nuclear contempt for one’s inferiors.” It doesn’t help matters when she comes to dine at Maison Mumbai, ready to crow over its mediocrity, and discovers that the untrained Hassan is a culinary genius. She weeps into her napkin, then declares war.Morais, formerly a senior editor and foreign correspondent at Forbes, has done his research. The novel is seeded with delightful arcana, like a recipe for rat from an old edition of Larousse Gastronomique, which advises using a specimen found in a wine cellar (“so much more flavorful”). A chef dabbling in postmodern gastronomy concocts a dish from crushed cough drops. And one character is clearly inspired by the chef Bernard Loiseau, who committed suicide in 2003, when he was said to be on the verge of losing his third Michelin star.Certain readers will want to skip ahead to the descriptions of food, as others do to sex scenes. A pan seethes with “prattling onions and furiously spitting lemon grass”; an artichoke appears as a “spiky hand grenade.” Dining on the sea cliffs of Marseille, Hassan is served tiny clams “no bigger than babies’ fingernails,” which, in the kind of detail that makes foodies swoon, are “grown in the restaurant’s own grotto under the pounding cliff face.”The novel’s charm lies in its improbability: it’s “Slumdog Millionaire” meets “Ratatouille.” Accordingly, everything is drawn in broad strokes. Hassan’s father is Falstaffian in physique, Napoleonic in ambition. His archenemy, Mallory, who ultimately becomes Hassan’s mentor, spends her days pulverizing the self-­esteem of her staff and resurrecting “challenging” dishes (e.g., the testicles of young bulls, stuffed with powdered fennel seed and pine nuts) from her hoard of ancient cookbooks. Even a fishmonger with Tou­rette’s pops up.The latter part of the novel sags a little, bereft of the colorful Papa and Mallory. In a wanly sketched Paris, Hassan charts his ascent to the top ranks of chefs as if ticking off bullets on a résumé. We’re given perhaps too much information on French labor law. The mood turns ­earnest.There is something absurdly over the top about the food world — the kitchens awash in testosterone, the eternal flames, the flaunting of knives and burns, the lives laid waste in pursuit of what is, let’s face it, a fleeting sensual pleasure. It’s a setting ripe for farce, and Morais is at his best when he delivers that.'"

"'10-08-16,'0','Settling that, and gaining a work permit for him to play in England, was a lesson in how complicated player transfers to the Premier League, the world’s richest league, have become. “Any player in the world would want to play for Chelsea,” Ramires said on his arrival.He repeated the mantra that the Premier League was the best and the most competitive on earth. Spain, with the style and power of Barcelona and Real Madrid, may have something to say about that.But the premise that England’s is truly a competitive league is being shot to pieces by Chelsea. Its six-goal trouncing of newly promoted West Bromwich followed a 7-0 beating of Stoke City and an 8-0 obliteration of Wigan Athletic in Chelsea’s final two home games last season.The gap between the wealthy clubs — and the playing strength their riches can buy — and the rest of the league is widening. There are new rules this season designed to try to protect English players from being crowded out of their own league. When those rules take effect Sept. 1, clubs like Manchester City will have to trim back from rosters of 40 or more to a maximum of 25, at least eight of whom must be “home produced.” The pain and the ruthlessness of that process is about to dawn on players who blindly signed up with England’s most acquisitive clubs.Meanwhile, though, there is a touch of real romance to the English season. It happened a few years ago when Wigan rose from the lowest professional echelon to the Premier League. Hull City and Burnley soon followed. Small clubs, operating on minuscule budgets but high-powered team spirit, made it to the promised land.Wigan, alone among those three, is still up with the big boys. But it was Wigan that was humbled Saturday by the latest newcomer to crash the elite. Forget Chelsea’s routine hammering of a team not in its league; the 4-0 win by Blackpool at Wigan was the story of the day.Blackpool was once the team of the England national team players Stanley Matthews, Jimmy Armfield and Alan Ball. But its famed tangerine colors last appeared in England’s top soccer division 39 years ago. And its sudden rise this summer was so unexpected that its tiny 99-year-old stadium, Bloomfield Road, was unfit for play. While the builders worked around the clock on renovations, 4,200 fans traveled to Wigan for Saturday’s league opener.Blackpool’s team has been rebuilt, too. Its promotion last season was achieved with players borrowed from other clubs, and when they were recalled, the team’s manager, Ian Holloway, had to hastily find new ones.Last Wednesday, he signed five players in one day. Three of them went straight into the first team, and one of them, Marlon Harewood, set up the first goal and scored two others Saturday.“The summer has been hideous,” Holloway said. “I’m shocked at the salaries everybody in this league is paying. We are completely out of our depth.”A joker with a seriously competitive inner streak, Holloway said before kickoff Saturday that he was having to fight his own club chairman, Karl Oyston. “I have total optimism; my chairman has total pessimism,” he said.“The chairman’s grip on the money is more impressive than a top gymnast doing a high-bar routine,” he said, “and I’m trying to pry those fingers open to deals he’s probably not comfortable with.”The manager and the town are a match for each other. Both are in the business of putting on a front that disguises the business of surviving.One British newspaper on Sunday published a list from top to bottom of the value of the 11 players each team started as the new season kicked off.Manchester City and Chelsea, each with teams that cost more than $235 million in transfer fees, were at the top of the list. West Bromwich, which spent $21 million, was second to last. Blackpool was rock bottom.And when Holloway was asked whether he dared to dream of a four-game winning streak to start the season, he replied: “I had quite the opposite dream. In fact, I still have it — we have to go to Arsenal next week.”'"
"'10-08-16,'0','Some say that as Google has grown up and become a large multinational company, it has been forced to start weighing its business interests against the more idealistic leanings of its founders and many of its employees.“I don’t know that Google pondered the moral decision this time,” said Jordan Rohan, an Internet and digital media analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “I think the business decision to cooperate with Verizon superseded the other complications and side effects that it may cause.”Google strongly defends its proposal with Verizon, saying it does not violate net neutrality principles and, if adopted by regulators, would protect wired Internet access more than it is protected now.“We don’t view this as a retreat at all,” Alan Davidson, Google’s director of public policy, said in an interview. “Google believes very strongly in net neutrality.”But the proposal left Google’s former allies, as well as many other technology and media companies, feeling disappointed and even betrayed. The risk, they say, is that without adequate regulation, Internet access companies could exercise too much control over what their customers can do online, or how quickly they can gain access to certain content. They could charge companies for faster access to consumers, hurting smaller players and innovation.“Google has been the most reliable corporate ally to the public interest community,” said Josh Silver, president of Free Press, an advocacy group. “That is why their sellout on net neutrality is so stunning.”The proposal from Google and Verizon was all the more surprising to some advocates because it was released just as broader talks brokered by the Federal Communications Commission were close to producing a draft compromise agreement, according to three people briefed on the talks, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the talks were supposed to be confidential.Unlike the Google-Verizon proposal, the agreement would have imposed some rules on wireless Internet, these people said.“We were very close,” said one person briefed on the talks. Both the F.C.C. and Google declined to comment on those discussions. After reports of a Google-Verizon deal emerged, the F.C.C. called off the talks, which in addition to those two companies included AT&T, a cable industry group, Skype and the Open Internet Coalition.Though Google has long said that it thinks openness rules should be applied broadly to Internet access, the company was persuaded that wireless is different because it is evolving rapidly and there is more competition, Mr. Davidson said. Wireless carriers say they need more leeway to manage their networks because it is difficult and expensive for them to add more capacity.The shift was also a pragmatic compromise to get “broader support, in this case from Verizon and hopefully others,” he said.Still, Google’s new position on net neutrality represents a scaling back of the company’s ambitious goals. When Google began building a presence in Washington in 2005, net neutrality was one of the first issues it embraced. And over the years, Google’s drive to open up the wireless industry became a corporate mission, backed by the company’s financial might.In 2007, Google made a $4.7 billion bid in a government auction of wireless airwaves. The company’s goal was not to win the auction, but to raise the price above a threshold that would set off rules forcing openness on the airwaves. Verizon won the auction and soon plans to deploy a high-speed network that will be bound by those rules.In January, Google introduced its own phone, the Nexus One, and opened an online store to distribute it. By selling directly to consumers, Google was challenging the control that wireless carriers have over the distribution of phones, especially in the United States. But Google quietly killed the Nexus One and the phone store this year.Analysts say Google’s new, more conciliatory approach to the wireless industry was born of necessity.Verizon offers a number of smartphones that run the Android software from Google, and Verizon is handling growing amounts of data flowing through its network to and from those phones. The volume will only increase as new mobile devices are developed and people use them to watch movies and do other bandwidth-intensive activities. Meanwhile, Google is looking to the mobile Web to feed much of its future growth.“This is about Google becoming friendlier with the wireless industry so that more Google searches are conducted on wireless devices,” Mr. Rohan said. If wireless was exempted from net neutrality rules, Verizon could limit the use of some applications and spend less money improving its network, or get paid by Web companies for delivering content.Some people see echoes of Google’s decision to go into China in 2006. In that case, after a lengthy internal debate, Google put aside its aversion to censorship and decided to enter what quickly became the world’s largest Internet market. Google has since pulled its search engine out of mainland China after online attacks that originated there, but the decision to do business there tarnished the company’s reputation among human rights advocates and disappointed many employees.“I don’t fault Google and Verizon for striking a deal,” said Susan Crawford, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School and a longtime supporter of net neutrality. “A large private company is always going to operate in its own interest, and for anyone to believe otherwise would be naïve.”Professor Crawford, who is critical of the proposal, said the F.C.C.’s lack of action on access rules pushed Google to seek a compromise. “Google had no choice but to cooperate with the friendliest carrier it can find, which is Verizon,” she said.But disappointed consumers and advocates seem to be holding Google to a different standard, in large part because of the image it created.“If the world of business is an ugly world full of rats, they’ve managed to create a bushy tail for themselves and come across as a very, very cute rat with terms like ‘Do no evil,’ ” said Scott Galloway, professor of brand strategy at the Stern School of Business at New York University. “The downside of that is that people have expectations that they’re going to fight these quixotic battles, and the bottom line is their obligation to their shareholders.”Not all believe that Google has betrayed its principles. Some longtime Silicon Valley chroniclers say they still think Google is trying to do the right thing, not only for itself, but also for the Internet as a whole.“I would rather have a company like Google that means to do no evil and is struggling with compromises on these hard issues than a company that doesn’t see a struggle,” said Tim O’Reilly, founder and chief executive of the technology publisher O’Reilly Media. “Most companies don’t even see things in those terms.”'"
"'10-08-16,'0','“It is not one of the debates we are involved in,” he added. “It tends to be between industry titans.”Created in 2000 by antiglobalization advocates, Riseup “started with a handful of accounts on a few donated PCs stashed in someone’s basement,” Devin Theriot-Orr, an immigration lawyer who is also part of the core group of a dozen or so who run the site, wrote in an e-mail. “Ten years later, we are still volunteer-driven and have a large user base from all over the world.”Riseup handles hundreds of thousands of e-mails a day, and the groups whose lists it hosts — animal rights outfits, freegans, guerrilla gardeners, edible-forest enthusiasts, squatters, anarchist-book sellers — send to three million addresses, Mr. Theriot-Orr said.Riseup was leery of describing the groups: in the possibly overstated words of Mr. Saxon, “Any group we name would not want to be named.”With Riseup’s connections to political groups, you may think it is most concerned that a nonneutral Internet would be a threat to its often politicized communications; that, in essence, a nonneutral carrier could punish political groups it disagreed with.But both Mr. Saxon and Mr. Theriot-Orr said their bigger fear was the additional level of monitoring — they call it surveillance — that an Internet with built-in nonneutrality would require: monitoring so that packets of information can be routed at the agreed-upon speed and that premiums can be charged.Yes, even in these politicized times, Internet neutrality has generally been viewed on commercial terms, not political ones. And the surveillance that worries the members of the Riseup collective is now being used to sell products — and help defray the costs of building the Internet’s infrastructure, their supporters would quickly point out.Without neutrality, say advocates of online privacy, the Internet becomes more like a mall — where users are from the start viewed as consumers — and less like a public square.“The people who are pushing for a nonneutral world are pushing it for monetary purposes,” said Cindy Cohn, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for privacy online.“Interfering with packets,” she said, echoing Mr. Saxon’s concerns, “creates the space for this kind of surveillance.”The fact is that monitoring Internet users is increasingly crucial to online business — whether by e-commerce sites that recommend purchases or by search engines that remember what you looked for in the past to improve results or by e-mail services that place ads based on words in the messages.For a recent series in The Wall Street Journal about how Web sites track their visitors, called “What They Know,” The Journal studied the top 50 Web sites in the United States to see how many tools they embedded in visitors’ computers. Many use more than 100 such tools; only Wikipedia had none.Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School who is an advocate for free software and online privacy, sees frameworks like the one proposed by Google and Verizon as emphasizing the business of the Internet at the expense of the privacy of the Internet.“As the network does more to adapt to what commerce needs, it becomes more and more about knowing what’s inside the head of the user, about what the person is doing and buying,” he said.Rather than a neutral Internet — with its implied competition between rival businesses — the people at Riseup would seem to be wishing for a “plain” Internet that would merely facilitate communication and connections, and minimize the role of commerce.Mr. Saxon wrote in an e-mail that it would even be worth a fee: “If people paid for what they use, rather than having their behavior tracked and monetized to pay for ‘free’ services, then the small providers stand more of a chance.”Recalling Riseup’s start in an interview, Mr. Saxon went back to 2000. “Free e-mail that was available had a tag line on the bottom,” he said. “People would sign up on Hotmail to organize the vegan potluck dinner and the ad would say ‘win free steaks.’ ”'"
"'10-08-16,'0','Ralph Alessi has never had a problem with precision or grappled publicly with the mechanics of his art. His trumpet tone conveys a rounded luminescence, like the moon in full phase, and his technique is an astonishment of fluency. The challenge for him, at least as a bandleader, revolves around emotional expressiveness, along with the issue of purpose. At times it can seem as if Mr. Alessi favors open-endedness because he doesn’t trust his own conclusions or his means of making them felt by an audience.All of which helps frame the nature of his achievement at the Jazz Standard on Wednesday. Mr. Alessi was booked there for a single night, with a rhythm section composed of the pianist Jason Moran, the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer Nasheet Waits. Their first set was generously apportioned but over too soon. Mr. Alessi, working with these partners, gave it the urgent force and clarity of a manifesto.They drew mainly from “Cognitive Dissonance,” an album released last month (on the Italian label Cam Jazz) but recorded more than five years ago. It’s a strong effort, one of Mr. Alessi’s best, but it was handily outshone by this performance. The cooperative history among the players — all of whom also appeared on Mr. Alessi’s album “This Against That” (RKM), in 2002 — threw the music into high contrast and sharper relief.Some of the vital chemistry was undoubtedly the work of Mr. Moran and Mr. Waits, who for the last decade have worked together in Mr. Moran’s trio, the Bandwagon. “Duel,” a loose-limbed acoustic-funk tune, culminated in precisely the sort of hiccup-vamp that the Bandwagon so often exploits: a hip-hop device transplanted into post-bop soil. Elsewhere there was the pairing of classical sobriety and Thelonious Monkish friction that Mr. Moran has made a part of his signature.But it didn’t feel as if Mr. Alessi had simply hopped aboard the Bandwagon, or swiped another group’s playbook for his use. For one thing, he has a deep connection with Mr. Gress, who tackled the set as more of an annotator than an anchor.For another, the bond between Mr. Gress and Mr. Waits, longtime partners in the Fred Hersch Trio, was similarly distinct, a lesson in earthy elasticity. “Dog Waking,” the set opener, had bass and drums in a state of maximum suspense, carrying a faintly West African motif as Mr. Moran moved from one chordal encampment to the next.'"
"'10-08-16,'0','“If we said buildings in Paris couldn’t be above a certain height you wouldn’t cut off the top of the Eiffel Tower,” Mr. de Colmont said. “Well, this is the Eiffel Tower of the French Riviera.”The mayor is seeking a compromise, but has not backed down. The town hall at Ramatuelle, where Pampelonne is situated, is planning to open its doors, starting Monday, to receive comments from the public.“We all want to be here for the long term,” said Guy Martin, the chief of staff for Mayor Roland Bruno. “That’s why we need to make sure there’s a sustainable equilibrium between the environment and the community.”Like much in France, though, the dispute is not so simple. Opponents of the move claim that it is really an effort to clear the way for big, well-connected companies to move in on the local businesses’ turf. Officials respond that the ruckus being raised by Mr. de Colmont and his colleagues is mostly in defense of their own form of crass commercialism.French law prohibits private development on public beaches. But decades ago, residents built on Pampelonne by obtaining renewable one-year permits that allowed them to offer “public services,” like Jet Ski rentals and lifeguards, if the construction was dismantled when the contract expired.If applying annually for permits was a nuisance, it at least protected small business owners, since no large company was willing to put up with the risk of losing a substantial investment, said Carole Balligand, the chairwoman of Save Pampelonne, a group that represents the local businesses that are in danger.From the government’s perspective, however, all the activity stemming from the permits has hastened the erosion of an important dune on Pampelonne filled with rare native plant species. In 1986, the French Parliament passed a law to restore the area. Four years ago it ordered those in the area to strike a better balance between the environment and commercial activity.Under the government’s plan, the commercial operators would be allowed on 20 percent of the beach rather than 30 percent, meaning their plots would be reduced to 23 from 28. As for the dune, it would be cordoned off to let nature do its work.Local people are upset at another proposal, to require commercial beach activities to end on Sept. 1 every year — still the high season — rather than sometime in October, and to allow new businesses that build behind the restored dune 10-year operating permits. That, they suspect, is less about protecting the environment than attracting mass vacation companies with deep pockets, like Club Med.''This would mean the total destruction of everything that has been here for nearly half a century,'' Mrs. Balligand said. She and others have calculated that the new plots could accommodate about four large hotel chains. ''They will turn us into a place like Cannes, where there is no soul,'' she said.What is more, Mrs. Balligand’s group, after digging up photos from the Allied landing on Pampelonne beach in August 1944, contends that no large dune ever existed. She accuses the government of using environmental arguments as an excuse to bring in bigger businesses.In summer, about 20,000 people frolic on Pampelonne beach every day. While Paris and Nicky Hilton, Tina Turner, Bono and a constellation of other stars frequent its playground, so have a number of international artists, intellectuals and politicians. Many mix with the coterie of low-key, wealthy local residents whose families were here well before Ms. Bardot put Pampelonne on the map in the 1956 French film “And God Created Woman.”''After the war, development arrived, and eventually Brigitte Bardot,'' Mr. Martin said. ''And then the public came, because there were few people whom Brigitte Bardot did not attract.''Before Ms. Bardot, St.-Tropez was more like the Saint-Germain des Prés quarter of 1920s Paris. It was an eclectic beach town that drew few rich people. These days, “the gulf of St.-Tropez is covered with yachts, pretty much all of which are registered in tax havens,” Mr. Martin said.The prospect of losing those clients and their free-flowing cash has Mr. de Colmont alarmed. His private beach plot is small, but it has been the stuff of legend ever since Ms. Bardot and the director Roger Vadim came during filming to seek food at what was then an outdoor dining table set up by Mr. de Colmont’s father for his family.Last Thursday, Mr. de Colmont called off his planned one-day strike, he said, after the mayor’s office gathered him and other residents to discuss the matter “more reasonably.” But he is not ruling out a shutdown if the government digs in.As he presses his fight, Mr. de Colmont will have at least one heavy hitter at his side. “Joan Collins left me a message the other day to ask what she could do to support me,” he said. “She has proposed to come give her point of view” to the mayor.Such celebrities, of course, attract plenty of gawkers. Mr. de Colmont wants to be sure that the riffraff doesn’t get out of control, scaring the big spenders away. On a recent day, he said, 300 clients paid to use the amenities on Le Club 55’s plot, while only 100 people sat on the larger public beach next to his. “I would prefer,” he said, “not to have Club Med people crowding out those who are already here.”'"
"'10-08-16,'0','Mr. Lee did not elaborate on what prompted his proposal. But it came as officials and analysts in Seoul contemplated the possibility that the North’s leader, Kim Jong-il, could die before a successor gained firm control.South Korean intelligence analysts said Mr. Kim suffered a stroke in 2008, and he has reportedly been preparing his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, who is believed to be in his late 20s, to be his heir. Unlike Mr. Kim, who had held important party and military posts for years before his own father, President Kim Il-sung, died in 1994, Kim Jong-un holds no known official title.The North Korean government has recently begun indoctrinating its people with songs and lectures lionizing the son, according to South Korean intelligence officials. Still, the younger man’s apparent lack of leadership experience has prompted analysts to speculate about potential instability if Mr. Kim dies suddenly, and the possibility that China might intervene militarily.“North Korea will take a unification tax as the expression of a South Korean attempt to prepare for a sudden collapse of the North Korean government,” said Kim Yong-hyun, an analyst at Dongguk University in Seoul.Yang Moo-jin, a researcher at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said, “President Lee should have first reinstalled South-North exchanges and laid the groundwork for the mood for unification before proposing a unification tax.”South Korea and the United States are to begin another set of joint military exercises on Monday, which the North has denounced as a rehearsal for an invasion. On Sunday, the North’s military said it would “deal a merciless counterblow” to the United States and South Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency said, promising the most severe punishment “ever met in the world.”Inter-Korean relations have chilled to their lowest point in years under Mr. Lee, a conservative who opposed providing aid to the North while it was developing nuclear weapons.Tensions rose after a South Korean warship was sunk in March and the South, accusing the North of torpedoing the ship, cut off most cross-border trade. Forty-six South Korean sailors were killed in the sinking.Like his predecessors, Mr. Lee envisioned a gradual unification, with the North’s abandonment of its nuclear arms capacity to be followed by extensive economic cooperation that would enable it to narrow the gap between its economy and the South’s, which is more than 30 times larger.“Most South Koreans say they want unification, but they don’t necessarily want to pay for it,” said Mr. Kim of Dongguk University.'"

"'10-08-17,'1','Goldman Sachs has been at the vanguard of Wall Street firms in accepting the realities of the marketplace. During the crisis, Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, noticeably stood out among his investment banking brethren because he argued vociferously against an industrywide push to relax mark-to-market accounting. But on matters relating to its image, Goldman has been stubbornly resistant. That may be about to change.When it comes to public perception, Goldman has been to hell and back. Its financial success coming out of the 2008 panic and subsequent market rescue by the government made it a public whipping boy for all who detest Wall Street, and blame the industry for sinking America into an economic crisis. Goldman has been pilloried by politicians, labeled a blood-sucking vampire squid in Rolling Stone magazine and henpecked by regulators.In the markets, wide shifts in sentiment are common, of course. In March last year, investors hated all manner of financial assets, almost indiscriminately. Goldman executives didn’t think that was fair, but they accepted the realities of the market, wrote down the value of assets on the company’s books and took their lumps. In a mark-to-market world, you don’t fight the judgment, you roll with it and adapt.That’s not the way Goldman handled its image, though. With few exceptions, Goldman dismissed the verdicts of its critics. That just created more of them, culminating in an ignominious Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charge and settlement. It all tarnished the firm’s stated goal of unparalleled client focus.But Goldman’s leaders seem at last to be acutely aware of all this. The firm is examining not just its business practices but its business model more broadly. Some executives talk of a spiritual, introspective exercise taking place under the aegis of the Business Standards Committee established in May to “reinforce the firm’s client focus and improve upon the transparency of our activities.”'"
"'10-08-17,'1','Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll said he expected Balmer would be ready to practice on Tuesday.The 49ers also signed the free-agent running back Brian Westbrook to a one-year deal, giving him the second chance he has been seeking.Westbrook visited several teams after he was released by the Eagles in February after an injury-filled 2009 season. The Niners had a need after Glen Coffee, the backup to starter Frank Gore, abruptly announced his retirement Friday.Westbrook led the N.F.L. with 2,104 yards from scrimmage in 2007, but he missed eight games last season with two concussions and an ankle injury.SCHOBEL SAYS HE’S RETIRING The former Buffalo Bills linebacker Aaron Schobel is retiring, saying he lost his hunger for playing last year.The Bills released Schobel on Aug. 4 after nine seasons. He was a two-time Pro Bowl selection, and his 78 career sacks rank second in Bills history behind the Hall of Famer Bruce Smith.“I really didn’t have a lot of fun playing last year,” Schobel said.Schobel, 32, lives in Columbus, Tex., about 70 miles west of Houston, and the Texans contacted him about continuing his career close to home this season.“The decision came down to whether I wanted to play,” Schobel said. “I didn’t really feel like I wanted to do it.”BILLS SHORT AT RUNNING BACK So much for the Buffalo Bills’ plan to ease the rookie C. J. Spiller into their running back rotation. With the starter Fred Jackson out at least a month with a broken left hand and his backup, Marshawn Lynch, limping on a sore ankle, Spiller will be running and receiving and returning punts for the remainder of the preseason at the very least.“It doesn’t matter to me if I have to play the whole game,” Spiller said. “This is football. This is what I love to do.”Spiller, drafted ninth over all out of Clemson, spoke after the Bills returned to training camp for their first practice since a costly 42-17 preseason-opening loss at Washington on Friday.Wearing a cast covering most of his lower left arm, Jackson revealed that he would miss four to six weeks after breaking his hand on the second play from scrimmage.Lynch, who split the starting duties with Jackson last season, was hurt later in the opening drive.COLTS HURTING IN SECONDARY Colts safety Jamie Silva is out for the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during Sunday’s preseason loss to San Francisco.He is the second Colts defensive back to sustain a serious knee injury; cornerback Kevin Thomas injured his right knee during a rookie minicamp and is also expected to miss the season.AROUND THE LEAGUE The Cardinals said wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald would not play in Arizona’s three remaining preseason games because he has a sprained right knee. ...

"'10-08-17,'1','Vedanta Resources, a mining company based in Britain, said Monday that it would buy a stake in an Indian energy company for $9.6 billion in a move intended to bolster India’s domestic oil production.Vedanta, headed by the mining billionaire Anil Agarwal, said it was buying a stake of 31 to 40 percent in Cairn India from Cairn Energy, an oil and gas exploration and production company that operates in Southeast Asia.Vedanta agreed to pay 405 rupees ($8.66) a share for its stake in the subsidiary, a premium of about 32 percent over recent share prices.Vedanta also agreed to collaborate with an Indian iron ore producer, Sesa Goa, to make a tender offer for another 20 percent of Cairn’s diluted shares.Vedanta said it was financing the deal with debt and internal cash reserves.The acquisition is intended to build up an “Indian natural resources champion,” Vedanta said. Cairn India produces 125,000 barrels of crude oil a day from the Rajasthan field, which holds an estimated 6.5 billion barrels of oil and gas.“Cairn India represents a unique oil and gas exploration and production platform with the second-largest reserves in India among private sector oil companies, a proven management team, and low-cost production,” Vedanta said.'"
"'10-08-17,'1','Our guides from Reality Tours and Travel showed us the challenges of life in the slums and the many ways that the residents support themselves through recycling, small industry and education. They forbid photography and work with residents to help protect their dignity. My students came home with a better understanding of global poverty and a better awareness of poverty here at home.While such tours raise a host of potential problems, I believe that done right, this sort of interaction can create life-changing experiences for all travelers.The writer is an associate professor of religious studies and theology at Canisius College.Kennedy Odede has a right to his outrage and anger at “slumdog tourism.” But there is another version of how many Westerners experience the developing world.For the last dozen or so years, my wife, daughter and I have gone to many remote spots in Asia, Africa and South America. At first, we started off as tourists, perhaps doing some of the things that Mr. Odede rightfully views as exploitative.But as you see more and more in the world, there is a gradual shift from tourist to traveler — the traveler being the one who wants to give rather than receive, who seeks empathy and understanding, who shuns vicarious experience and who wants to find a way to bridge the social and economic gaps that divide people.Even with the vast gaps of culture and wealth in the world, we have found that all people, regardless of status, love their children and families, have incredible generosity of spirit, and love to laugh.I remember a company we traveled with whose motto was “accept cultural differences with grace.” Once we learned to relate those words to our actual experience, it made all the difference.Many tourists really do not understand that they are as much the observed as the observer. Even though there can be mistakes at first, the journey from tourist to traveler is well worth taking.To assert that voyeurism rather than altruism is the driving force behind “slum tourism” is to dismiss the impact of seeing poverty. The International Housing Coalition seeks to educate the international donor community and developing country governments about the importance of providing more assistance to urban and slum areas.We have learned that the members of Congress who are most supportive of giving more attention to the problems of slums and urban development are those who have visited slums and have been exposed to their conditions.Tours of Kibera or Dharavi alone will not address the suffering of residents. But they can generate the political will and empathy that are necessary for any serious commitment to effective solutions. If more people were exposed to the plight of the urban poor, more progress could be made.'"
"'10-08-17,'1','Higher energy prices drove inflation in the euro area to an annual rate of 1.7 percent in July, the highest level in 20 months but still within the range considered acceptable by the European Central Bank.Excluding energy prices, inflation increased by 1.1 percent in July when compared with the previous year. That was up from 0.9 percent in June, Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics office, said Monday.The rise in overall prices, from a rate of 1.4 percent in June, was not considered alarming by economists, who generally expect price pressures to remain in check as growth slows in most of Europe.“We need to see convincing signs of an upturn in domestic demand, and we’re not seeing that just yet,” said Nick Matthews, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. “Underlying domestic price pressures are still quite contained.”But the European Central Bank could have problems finding a monetary policy that is right for all 16 euro area members if prices continued to rise in some countries while holding stable or even falling in others.Inflation in Germany was 1.2 percent in July, up from a yearly rate of 0.8 percent in June. The rise in prices came as the German economy expanded 2.2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to figures released last week.'"
"'10-08-17,'1','Republicans said Mr. Obama’s defense of the right of the developers to pursue the project showed that he was out of touch with average Americans.“It is very troubling to see President Obama again turning a deaf ear to the thoughts and concerns of a majority of Americans,” said James Renacci, a Republican candidate in Ohio’s 16th District, who said people at a recent public meeting were furious about the mosque proposal.The remarks were a rare instance in this campaign season when Republicans have strayed from a focus on economic issues in their push for substantial gains in the House and Senate in November. The intensity of their attacks showed that they do not appear worried about the risk of being seen as intolerant or not supportive of the right to freedom of religion.Some leading Democrats said it was the president’s role to stand up for constitutional rights in the mosque dispute.Representative James E. Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, said Monday that “articulating the constitutional principles” on which the country was founded and “calling for tolerance on the part of all of its people” were part of “a presidential act worth exercising.”Privately, many Democrats were not pleased that the issue had been thrown into their laps during the summer recess as they believed they had been making inroads by talking about how some Republicans support privatizing Social Security. But strategists said Democrats could counter the Republican offensive by labeling the mosque dispute as a local issue and saying Democrats remain focused on the economy.Some also said the White House should not have put lawmakers on the spot in the first place and could have been better prepared for the president’s statement, lining up religious and community leaders to offer support for the right to build the mosque and undermine Republican attacks.Other Democrats said they did not see the fight resonating strongly outside New York and did not expect it to become a defining campaign issue.Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who represents the district that includes ground zero, said he doubted that the fight over the mosque would inflict much damage on fellow Democrats in the November elections.Mr. Nadler, whose view is that the developers were entitled to build the mosque at the selected location if they choose, said, “Ultimately I suspect that once this simmers down in a few weeks, people will realize that everybody’s liberty is at stake here.”The planned community center, perhaps 15 stories tall, would be built in three adjacent buildings two blocks north of ground zero, though one building, owned by Consolidated Edison, has yet to be sold. The other two are all but vacant now; worship services are already taking place in one of them.The developer, Sharif el-Gamal, a real estate investor born in New York, has said the center would include meeting rooms, a prayer space, a 500-seat auditorium and a pool. Two mosques, founded in 1970 and 1985, are already within several blocks of the proposed center. They are so busy and crowded that a search was begun for more space.Before Mr. Obama spoke out, leading Republican figures like Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, and Sarah Palin, the party’s 2008 vice-presidential nominee, had been voicing opposition to the Islamic center. That caused other Republicans to warn that the party risked a backlash and was alienating the nation’s Muslims.But Mr. Gingrich showed no sign of backing down on Monday. “Nazis don’t have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust Museum in Washington,” Mr. Gingrich said on the Fox News program “Fox and Friends.” “We would never accept the Japanese putting up a site next to Pearl Harbor. There’s no reason for us to accept a mosque next to the World Trade Center.”Democratic campaign officials accused Republicans of exploiting the Sept. 11 attacks, noting that their outrage over the Islamic center came just weeks after many House Republicans opposed a new medical program to monitor and treat emergency workers and others suffering ill effects from exposure to hazardous materials at ground zero.'"
"'10-08-17,'1','In a test run on Friday, shrimpers found no sign of oil on their nets or shrimp, Mr. Smith said, but shrimpers had trouble finding buyers.Louisiana has asked BP for $450 million to pay for continued testing of seafood and a marketing campaign over two decades, and requested that the federal and local agencies that have been testing fish, shrimp, crabs and oysters report the results in one central location, Mr. Smith said.“We need to bore the consumer with good news,” he said. “This is probably the most tested food source there is in the U.S. and will be for quite some time.”The Food and Drug Administration said that all seafood samples had tested below the level of concern for health risks from petroleum compounds, and that it was developing a test for dispersants in food. Only 2 of 2,500 water samples have tested positive for dispersants, it said.The state has asked BP to finance a program seafood officials are calling Back to the Dock, which would pay shrimpers a 30 percent premium for their product to rebuild the steady supply the industry needs.Shrimp prices spiked after the oil spill began because customers were worried about running out, but they have been falling rapidly since mid-June, according to Urner Barry, a company that tracks market data. “The market is weak,” said Paul B. Brown Jr., its president. “Nobody knows what the demand is going to be.”Keath Ladner, the owner of Gulf Shores Sea Products in Lakeshore, Miss., a distributor, said it would be “economically irresponsible” for the 70 boats he usually buys shrimp from to go out. His biggest customer, which buys two million pounds of shrimp a year, had canceled its entire order.“The sentiment in the country is that the seafood in the gulf is tainted,” Mr. Ladner said. “People are scared of it right now.”But on Monday morning the easygoing Mr. Alfonso, at least, was ready to shift into high gear. At 6 a.m., the official start time, he was suddenly everywhere in his plastic clogs, speed-walking from the trawl nets to the winches, kneeling on the fiberglass deck of the Kristy Misty, which he built and named after his daughters, and finally lowering the skimmer nets, one on each side of the boat, into the water.He did not relax, but peered at them anxiously, watching for the spritz of a shrimp darting from the water. “I want to see them jump,” he said. “Jump, jump, jump.”As he worked, Mr. Alfonso explained his view that the main factor affecting the shrimp’s behavior this year was not the oil but the large amounts of fresh water that had been diverted from the Mississippi River to push oil away from the marshes. It had also pushed the shrimp away, disrupting the marshes’ normal temperature and salinity. That made them harder to catch.Instead of running together, he said, the shrimp were dispersed. “See how we ain’t seeing no shrimp jump?” he asked. “That’s not good.”He added, “There’s too much stuff disturbed them. The shrimp out here don’t know which way to run because of that fresh water.”The radio buzzed. “Lucky Dog?” a fellow shrimper inquired, using one of Mr. Alfonso’s nicknames.He answered using the slang term for shrimp, “I’m looking for some bugs, but I ain’t seen too many yet. Whatever it is, it is. At least we’re out here.”Mr. Alfonso would customarily spend $800 on ice and diesel, but he had spent only half that, because he was unsure what the return on his investment would be. He said that there was one dock buying shrimp in his hometown, Delacroix Island, and that it was selling to the one seafood processor still open.When it was time to haul up the nets, they hung like two heavy, squirming pendulums, streaming with water. Mr. Alfonso released the ties, sending the pile skidding onto the deck, and began shoveling the sardines, crabs and other bycatch right off the edge into the water. The pale shrimp smelled briny and fresh. All told, he had about 80 pounds of shrimp from the first drag — not nearly the hundreds of pounds per drag that are customary on the first day of the season, but not the worst Mr. Alfonso had seen.“This crop of shrimp here, in a month they should be laying eggs again in the inside waters. I doubt if they’re going to do it,” he said. Then he picked up a couple of baby shrimp and held them in his palm before tossing them back. “This,” he said, “is what we need to see.”'"
"'10-08-17,'1','Traditionally, mortgage brokers were paid directly by the home buyer. The rise of the premium allowed the brokers to be compensated by the lender as well. Lenders in effect started paying bonuses to brokers who brought them high-interest loans that were naturally coveted by mortgage investors.From there, critics said, it was a short step for some brokers to put unsuspecting buyers into these loans and tell them it was the best deal they could get. Subprime lenders in particular often used yield spread premiums.“People didn’t just happen to end up in risky loans,” Mr. Calhoun said. “Mortgage brokers and other people on the frontlines were getting two to three times as much money to push buyers into those loans than they were into 30-year fixed-rate loans. So what do you think happened?”Brokers argued that it was frequently in the interest of the borrower, especially a low-income buyer, to pay a higher rate in exchange for bringing less cash to closing.Attempts at reform achieved little, and during the housing boom the yield spread premiums became ever more prevalent. In many cases, groups like the Center for Responsible Lending found, borrowers never realized they were paying both higher fees and a higher rate.While the new rules prohibit payments to a lender or broker based on the loan’s interest rate, they do allow for compensation based on a fixed percentage of the loan amount.To avoid steering the buyer into a loan that is offering less favorable terms, the rules now say that the borrower must be provided with competing options, including the lowest qualifying interest rate, the lowest points and origination fees, and the lowest qualifying rate without risky features like prepayment penalties.The National Association of Mortgage Brokers, which had long argued that efforts to reform the premium unfairly singled out its members, pronounced itself satisfied with the new rules.The Fed rules “put everybody on the same footing,” including brokers and banks, said Roy DeLoach, executive vice president for the brokers’ association.The rules take effect in April. Similar, and in some ways broader, rules in the financial reform bill will take effect later.'"
"'10-08-17,'1','Nipple piercings may be in fashion these days, but women who have them are at much higher risk for developing painful, recurrent breast abscesses, a new study reports.The abscesses — pus-filled infections surrounded by swollen, inflamed tissue under the areola — can develop a month to seven years after a nipple is pierced. They recur frequently, are difficult to treat and often require surgery.Though individual cases have been reported, the new study, published in The Journal of the American College of Surgeons, is the first to document the risk associated with nipple piercings, said the lead author, Dr. Vinod Gollapalli, a breast surgeon at the University of Iowa.The study was relatively small, comparing a control group of women with 68 University of Iowa hospital patients who had breast abscesses not caused by obvious risk factors like breast cancer and radiation.Nipple piercing was associated with a 10- to 20-fold increase in subareolar abscesses over nearly six years, from January 2004 to November 2009. (Another risk factor was smoking, with a six- to eightfold increase.)For women considering a nipple piercing, Dr. Gollapalli said, the message is that “this is not a totally benign procedure.” Even if the piercing is done properly, he added, the presence of foreign material in the body can be a focal point for an infection.'"
"'10-08-17,'1','Young teenagers who use acetaminophen even once a month develop asthma symptoms more than twice as often as those who never take it, a large international study has found. And frequent users also had more eczema and eye and sinus irritation.Other studies have linked acetaminophen (often sold as Tylenol and in other over-the-counter remedies for pain, colds, fever and allergies) with an increased risk of asthma. But the new study’s authors cautioned that the findings did not mean children should stop using it.“Acetaminophen remains the preferred drug to relieve pain and fever in children,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Richard W. Beasley, a professor of medicine at the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand. He noted that aspirin and ibuprofen should not be used in children with asthma, since they can bring on an attack.Although the study does not prove that acetaminophen actually causes asthma, the authors speculated that the drug might have systemic inflammatory effects and result in greater allergic immune response.The report, from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, or Isaac, was based on data from more than 322,000 children age 13 and 14 from 50 countries.'"

"'10-08-18,'1','A federal judge in Virginia on Tuesday threw out piracy charges against six Somali men captured after an attack on a Navy ship off the coast of East Africa, saying the government had not shown that the men’s actions violated American piracy law.The incident occurred April 10 in the Gulf of Aden, when a skiff approached the Ashland and, according to the government’s case, someone on the skiff fired a shot at the ship. The Ashland responded with fire that destroyed the skiff and killed one of the passengers.The remaining men on board were captured and indicted on eight counts that included piracy, which an 1819 law said was “defined by the law of nations” and carries a life sentence.Lawyers for the defendants asked Judge Raymond A. Jackson of Federal District Court to dismiss the piracy charge, saying it did not apply to the incident because the Supreme Court decision dealing directly with the statute’s definition of piracy, United States v. Smith in 1820, called it “robbery at sea.” The incident, they argued, did not fit the description.Judge Jackson wrote that “the definition of piracy in the international community is unclear” and that “the court’s reliance on these international sources as authoritative would not meet constitutional muster and must therefore be rejected.”'"
"'10-08-18,'1','In the end, many officials expect an eventual agreement on some sort of consensus government so inclusive as to be woefully weak, unable to assert itself and beset by stalemate over the laws necessary to shape post-American Iraq. But the failure of the elite that the United States helped to choose may serve as a lasting American legacy here, raising fundamental questions about the body politic it leaves behind as the American military departs by 2012.“I think it’s a valid question to ask: Is this system going to work for Iraq, given its history, its peculiarities and so on?” asked Ryan C. Crocker, who preceded Mr. Hill as the American ambassador to Iraq. “I don’t have an answer. But it’s a question that’s going to need to be dealt with.”To a remarkable degree, Iraq remains haunted by the decisions of the earliest days of the occupation in 2003, when expediency trumped foresight.Debates still rage in Iraq over the choices the United States made: disbanding the Iraqi military, the purge of members of Saddam Hussein’s Baath Party and the decision to occupy Iraq rather than create a transitional Iraqi government. But perhaps the most far-reaching bequest was the power the exiled opposition and Kurdish parties have held in Iraq since 2003, filling a vacuum left by Mr. Hussein’s withering assault on any dissent.Despite expectations that a more grass-roots leadership might emerge, only the followers of Moktada al-Sadr, a populist cleric, have done so. Otherwise the names in 2003, with the exception of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, remain much the same: two former prime ministers, Ayad Allawi and Ibrahim al-Jaafari; Ahmad Chalabi, an American ally turned critic; Mr. Abdul Mahdi; the Kurdish leaders; and two generations of Hakims, a prominent Shiite religious family.Asked if the Americans bore blame for their prominence, Mr. Crocker said, “I don’t think so. You can ask the question, was the whole bloody thing a mistake? I don’t spend a lot of time on that. But if not them, then who?”Palace intrigue only begins to describe the style of the political elite here since taking power, many of the players still imbued with a sepia-tinted recollection of a Baghdad only rarely mirrored in today’s rough-and-tumble streets. Most remain friends, at least in public. But the clandestine secrecy of exile, with its endless plotting and duplicitous maneuvering, still shapes their interaction. Then, survival was the goal; in many ways, it remains the same.“Most of them, in my understanding, are still acting as if they’re in the opposition rather than trying to build a state,” Mr. Abdul Mahdi said. “I’m not excepting myself or any other.”Between a flurry of meetings, another leading politician called his colleagues ineffective, overly impressed with the trappings of power and so greedy as to “border on being kleptocrats.” He added, “They put the immediate above the important and tactical issues above strategic matters.”He was reluctant to speak on the record; to do so might upset potential allies.“The same people, coming and going,” lamented Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish lawmaker who served on the American-appointed Governing Council in 2003. “If someone died, he’s no longer around, but that’s it.”As he spoke, his generator failed, plunging his house into the claustrophobic heat of a Baghdad summer. For a few hours, he suffered as does much of the rest of Baghdad, where electricity lasts for but a few hours, water is sometimes contaminated, trash piles up in the streets and the infrastructure is crumbling.“We have failed for the past seven years,” he said.In a hopeful irony, the very acknowledgment of that failure says something about a country still wrestling with the end of dictatorship; the ossified elite of Egypt and Syria would never do the same. Indeed, some politicians and analysts say that the political class faces an impossible task, beset by feeble and corrupt institutions, the vagaries of Mr. Hussein’s rule and a political culture that celebrates the spoils of victory.Iraq’s neighbors, in particular Turkey and Iran, often unhelpful, have taken to playing politics here like a parlor game. To break the deadlock, American officials were pushing for a power-sharing agreement that would keep Mr. Maliki as prime minister, and Mr. Allawi in charge of security. But, Iraqi officials say, the Iranians are opposed to Mr. Allawi, while the Turks have lingering reservations about Mr. Maliki. Syria, Jordan, plus Saudi Arabia and the other Arab states of the Persian Gulf are sure to want a say.“We should blame ourselves as politicians because we allowed such countries to have so much influence in Iraq,” said Mithal al-Alusi, a former lawmaker.The disenchantment is so pronounced, in fact, that many leaders see less a threat in the flagging but resilient insurgency and more in something unpredictable, what Mr. Abdul Mahdi termed “an adventurer” seeking to exploit chronic crises.A leading politician related a recent conversation he had with a top Iraqi general. The politician asked about the possibility of a coup. The general, he said, deeming the talk serious, pulled out a map of the capital and provided a disconcertingly elaborate plan to execute one: overturning trucks to block the route from the main American base to the Green Zone, seizing television stations, besieging Parliament, and so on.“When you’re president,” he quoted the general as asking, in utter seriousness, “can you make me minister of defense?”'"
"'10-08-18,'1','The law lifts restrictions on Palestinians’ employment in the formal labor market, though they would still be officially treated as foreigners. They would be barred from working as engineers, lawyers and doctors, occupations that are regulated by professional syndicates limited to Lebanese citizens.Though the law fell short of some refugees’ hopes, many welcomed it, in particular the law’s granting of access to social security benefits to refugees.“I am 51 years old, born and raised here, and this is the first time I feel like I am a human being,” said Abu Luay Issawi, who owns a grocery store in Mar Elias, a refugee camp in Beirut.Electricity was out in the camp on Tuesday. No water was running, as is the case almost every day in Mar Elias, which is overcrowded and lacks basic infrastructure.Mr. Issawi said he had graduated among the top of his class from Beirut Arab University more than two decades ago with a degree in engineering, but was never able to find a job here. “I don’t remember anything about engineering,” he said. “But it is nice to know that my son will have a better future.”His neighbor interrupted him. “If I am going to live and die here, then I want all my rights,” Youssef Ahmad, 52, said.His sentiment underlined the broader context of Tuesday’s law. Beyond Lebanon, the refugees’ fate remains one of the most emotionally charged issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinian negotiators have demanded at least partial repatriation of the refugees and their descendants, but Israel has refused, saying an influx of Palestinians would change the country’s demographics. Many in Lebanon believe that resolution of the refugees’ permanent status awaits Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.Human rights activists in Lebanon said hurdles still remained, although they described the legislation as a crucial, albeit long-delayed step in improving Palestinians’ conditions here.“This should be the start and not the finish line in the march toward achieving human rights for Palestinians,” said Nadim Houry, the director of Human Rights Watch in Lebanon.Others worried that the day-to-day reality of Palestinian refugees might not change all that much. Employers will still probably be more inclined to give jobs to Lebanese citizens, given the bureaucratic hurdles of securing permits to employ foreigners.“It’s not a full congratulation,” said Samira Salah, a Palestinian human rights activist. “For the outside world, it may be considered an achievement, but for Palestinians not so much.”Palestinian refugees, who constitute nearly a tenth of the country’s population, have long been denied basic rights in Lebanon. They are not allowed to attend public schools, own property or pass on inheritances, measures Lebanon says it has adopted to preserve their right to return to their property in what constitutes Israel now.The legislation does not address any of those issues, though some lawmakers have said they may push for greater rights in coming months.“The second battle is the right to own property,” said Walid Jumblatt, a lawmaker and Druse leader who introduced the legislation in Parliament.'"
"'10-08-18,'1','For almost half a century, an unfinished Nazi propaganda film of the Warsaw Ghetto, simply titled “Das Ghetto” and discovered by East German archivists after the war, was used by scholars and historians as a flawed but authentic record of ghetto life. Shot over 30 days in May 1942 — just two months before deportations to the Treblinka extermination camp would begin — this hourlong silent film juxtaposed random scenes of Jews enjoying various luxuries with images of profound suffering.Like the flickering shadows in Plato’s Cave, these images were subjected to a radical rereading with the appearance of another reel in 1998: 30 minutes of outtakes showing the extent to which scenes had been deliberately staged. Over and over, in multiple takes, we see well-dressed Jews enter a butcher’s shop, ignoring the children begging outside. In a similar scenario, prosperous-looking passersby are directed to disregard the corpses abandoned on the sidewalk. The propagandists’ manipulation of their half-million prisoners was now clear, even as its eventual purpose — perhaps more than just to manufacture scenes showing callousness on the part of wealthy Jews toward their less fortunate brethren — remained as murky as ever.In “A Film Unfinished,” the Israeli director Yael Hersonski embarks on a critical analysis of “Das Ghetto” that is remarkable as much for its speculative restraint as for its philosophical reach. Moving methodically reel by reel and acknowledging the “many layers of reality,” the director creates a palimpsest of impressions from multiple, meticulously researched sources representing both victims and oppressors.Though excerpts from a taped interview with Willy Wist, one of the cameramen who worked on “Das Ghetto,” are as evasive as one might expect, other witnesses did not hold back. Readings from personal diaries, like those of Adam Cherniakov, the head of the Jewish Council (whose apartment was used by the Nazis to stage several scenes), and from the minutely detailed reports of the ghetto commissioner Heinz Auerswald, provide vivid insight into the restrictions of daily life and the methods of the Nazi filmmakers.Carefully pairing actual scenes with the journal descriptions (the film’s editing, by Joëlle Alexis, is astonishingly exact), “A Film Unfinished” is really an exploration of watching — or, more precisely, of the difference between watching and seeing. Nowhere is this more evident than in the director’s decision to invite five survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto to view the original footage and to film their reactions.'"
"'10-08-18,'1','Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, said the possibility of deflation was remote.“I am not taking concerns of deflation all that seriously,” Mr. Baumohl said. “The global economy is out of the recession phase. It is growing, admittedly slowly, but it is still growing and I expect economic activity will pick up more momentum.”“The dilemma is, Where is the economy headed later this year and into 2011? What we are focused on is the outlook,” Mr. Baumohl said.The rise in the price index last month was attributed to increases in consumer foods, which rose 0.7 percent, with most of the price rises for fresh and dried vegetables. The last time the overall index rose was in March, when it had a 0.8 percent increase.On Friday, the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in July on a seasonally adjusted basis, and 1.2 percent in the last 12 months. When energy and food prices are subtracted, the core index rose 0.1 percent in July, after rising 0.2 percent in June.The Federal Reserve said last week that it expected inflation to remain subdued for some time. With that expectation, the Fed has kept the federal funds rate near zero since December 2008.With inflation well below the Fed’s implicit target of around 2 percent, many economists, including committee members of the central bank, have spoken of concerns that the economy could instead be at risk of declining wages and prices.Last week, the Fed, saying its confidence in the recovery had dimmed, announced plans to buy long-term government debt by using the proceeds from its mortgage bond portfolio.Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president of fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, said the Fed move helped put Tuesday’s rise in the price index in context.“In the past, I may have been concerned that the uptick in P.P.I. would trickle down to consumer prices, but not today,” Mr. Giddis said.“As has been made abundantly clear by the economic data released in recent weeks and, more to the point, the Fed’s decision to restart quantitative easing, inflation should be the least of our worries right now,” he said in a research note.A separate report from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday showed that output from manufacturing, a sector that has been a bright spot in the recovery, increased 1.1 percent in July after falling 0.5 percent in June. A large contributor to the jump in output was an increase of nearly 10 percent in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Over all, industrial production rose 1 percent last month.The statistics were the latest to reflect an economy in a period of sluggish recovery. Recent macroeconomic data has highlighted the impact of factors including government stimulus, labor market weakness and households struggling with debt.In the housing sector particularly, factors including government tax credits, demand, and debt burdens have had an impact on construction and sales.A third report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed that housing starts rose 1.7 percent in July to the seasonally adjusted annual rate of 549,000. Permits declined 3.1 percent, a 14-month low.“Financial distress on the part of many households, ongoing labor market weakness and vicious competition from an enormous overhang of existing homes all point to a very tough slog for home builders in the months and quarters ahead,” said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR Inc.'"
"'10-08-18,'1','You do not have to serve smoked salmon with Scotch or fried chicken with bourbon. But mezcal is so deeply rooted in the heart of Mexico that whatever you serve alongside begs for chilies and cilantro at the very least.Glasses of mezcal, perhaps with a beer chaser, could accompany a dinner, but my preference is to sip mezcal with snacks or appetizers that have a Mexican accent. At a farm stand, I saw fresh, shiny, hunter-green poblanos, and pounced on them. These generously sized, almost triangular chilies deliver moderate heat and are usually stuffed and fried, though sometimes baked.I split them, then charred them lightly under the broiler. My filling of smoked cheese, smoked paprika, egg, sour cream and cilantro, also glazed under the broiler, was in harmony with the smoky-tasting mezcal, a splash of which went into the simple fresh salsa topping.1. Heat broiler. Slice peppers in half vertically and remove core and seeds. Place peppers, skin-side up, in a baking pan and broil at least 6 inches from heat, until lightly browned and blistered, about 10 minutes. Remove from broiler and turn peppers skin-side down on baking pan.2. In a small serving dish, mix tomato, onion, chipotle powder and mezcal. Season with salt.3. In a small bowl, beat eggs well. Mix in sour cream, cheese, paprika, cilantro and salt to taste. Spoon mixture into cavities of peppers. Broil until tops are lightly browned and glazed, about 5 minutes, watching carefully so they do not burn. Serve with salsa.'"

"'10-08-19,'0','“Nightly Business Report” on PBS, by some measures the nation’s most-watched business newscast, has been acquired from its owner, the public station WPBT-TV in Miami, by a private company headed by Mykalai Kontilai, a former manager of mixed martial artists and distributor of instructional television programs.The acquisition of the program, which Mr. Kontilai said was completed on Friday, was announced to the staff on Wednesday. The move is the second major change in the last year for the half-hour program. In December, Paul Kangas, an anchor who had been with the program since its founding 31 years ago, retired, and the program was redesigned, with Tom Hudson in Miami and Susie Gharib at the New York Stock Exchange as anchors. About 500,000 viewers tune in nightly.Like many public television programs, “Nightly Business Report” has struggled recently to find enough corporate underwriting sponsors. Mr. Kontilai, in a telephone interview, said he and his business partner, Gary Ferrell, a former president and chief executive of North Texas Public Broadcasting, approached WPBT in February.“I identified ‘Nightly Business Report’ as a program I felt could be expanded, could be propagated on a worldwide level because of the topic being a broad topic,” he said.Mr. Kontilai said that he had already begun talking to international distribution outlets and that international deals could attract more corporate sponsors. In addition, he said he saw educational licensing opportunities and was approached about a radio spinoff. The program will have a new Web site separate from its current presence on pbs.org.Rick Schneider, WPBT’s president and chief executive, said the program was not for sale when Mr. Kontilai made the approach, but that the sale made sense for WPBT. “They are committed to what ‘N.B.R.’ does, and they have the ideas and resources and potential to take it to the next step,” he said. “It is at a point where they as a company can do more things with it than we as a station could.”'"
"'10-08-19,'0','While other cities — Boston and Miami, to name two — long ago surrendered much of their waterfront to developers, allowing hotels, condominiums and office towers to dominate their coastlines, Portland has resisted. Regrets over a condominium project, built on the waterfront in the 1980s, led to the tight zoning that exists today.Under the proposal, up to half of the ground-floor space in buildings along the wharves could be devoted to nonmarine use. Condominiums would be banned, as they are now, but offices, shops and restaurants could open if the city deemed them compatible with maritime tenants.Portland agreed a few years ago to allow nonmarine businesses on the upper floors of wharf buildings, and there are now some 50 of them in the central waterfront zone. In the biggest such experiment, Pierce Atwood, the state’s largest law firm, will move next year to a 19th-century warehouse on the Portland Fish Pier. The plan has been criticized, partly because the warehouse owner is getting a $2.8 million tax break to help pay for renovations before the move.Last month, the city asked a bait shop to move away from the warehouse — a sign of doom for fishing interests along the waterfront, some said, if more nonmarine uses are allowed. The city said the bait shop had to move because it was blocking emergency access to the warehouse. But others suspect that Pierce Atwood did not want the shop, and its nose-assaulting odor, too close.“It’ll take the paint right off your car,” Mark Usinger, who owns a ship chandlery on one of the wharves, said of the bait smell. “But it’s part of the work and the life we have here. When you bring people in who don’t see things that way, it’s nothing but a losing proposition for us.”Dennis Keeler, a partner at Pierce Atwood, said the smell had indeed been a concern but that the bait shop had been amenable to moving.“We think it’s pretty cool,” Mr. Keeler said of the firm’s new location. “We’re in Portland, so connecting to the waterfront seems like part of who we are.”Mr. Poole has rented space to an engineering firm, a real estate brokerage and other white-collar tenants since the upper-floor zoning rules were loosened in 2006. They have co-existed well with his marine tenants, he said. “The property owners are committed to keeping this a commercial working waterfront,” he said. “We don’t want to take anything away from the marine world.”But Mr. Usinger said that even having nonmarine tenants on upper floors had caused headaches. On the wharf where he rents space, he said, an artist and a drum circle were good neighbors but a Zumba studio was proving troublesome.“They come in and look at us with dirty looks,” he said of the people who come to the wharf for Zumba, a cardio-dance workout. “It’s not a good fit.”The fishermen who still use the wharves were quiet through much of the debate over the last year, but some have organized against the changes recently.Mr. Usinger said he feared wharf owners would find ways to force out marine tenants despite the requirement to preserve half the ground-floor space for them.“A T-shirt shop could say, ‘That smell is just driving my customers out of here,’ ” he said. “It could say, ‘I’ll pay you extra money every month to leave that marine space vacant.’ ”But Lyman Kennedy, a lobsterman who rents a berthing space on Union Wharf, said he sympathized with the wharf owners and did not think they would betray their marine tenants.“Let’s face it — the guy’s a businessman,” Mr. Kennedy said of his landlord, Mr. Poole. “I sympathize with the fishermen and think they should be provided for, but not at the expense of losing the wharf or letting it get so dilapidated that nobody can work here.”'"

"'10-08-19,'0','Banks’ new appetite for deal financing has its limits. They tend to favor large, cash-generating companies. And they expect a large proportion of acquisition-related loans to be refinanced quickly.Besides, the loans are not without risk. Vedanta’s deal, for instance, prompted a ratings downgrade, as it increased the company’s net debt to 4.5 times the expected 2010 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization after the acquisition, from around 0.4 times currently.Clearly, M.& A. financing is far more readily available than it was a year or so ago. Yet even after the latest deals, acquisition volumes this year remain low. The supply of debt may be recovering, but a shortage of confidence on the part of companies is keeping demand subdued.Stanley Druckenmiller’s retirement may say something important about hedge funds. He plans to close down his 30-year-old, $12 billion firm, Duquesne Capital Management. On one level, it’s a case of a very rich guy wanting to play more golf. But on another, it suggests bigger fund firms may struggle to live up to past glories.Mr. Druckenmiller, a onetime colleague of George Soros, clearly doesn’t need the money. Forbes pegged his wealth at $2.8 billion this year, and he’s only 57. The desire to keep winning has kept other billionaires involved in the investing business far longer. His old boss Mr. Soros, for instance, just turned 80.Early retirement can have its appeal. There’s nothing wrong with recognizing the toll that managing other people’s money can take. And investors with considerably smaller fortunes have been lured by the golf links. Mr. Druckenmiller also has serious philanthropic interests.But there’s another factor. Duquesne is down some 5 percent so far this year. Mr. Druckenmiller’s vehicle has never lost money over a full year. In a letter to investors, he said managing so much money made it hard for him to meet his performance standards. Duquesne has delivered average annual returns of 30 percent or more since 1986.Investors would be wise to reflect on the size question. Much of the new hedge fund investment is going to the biggest firms, some that now manage more than $30 billion each. They offer diversification and the plentiful resources and infrastructure that comfort many institutional investors. But they may also need to find bigger opportunities, take more risk or settle for lower returns than otherwise similar smaller funds.Mr. Druckenmiller’s coming retirement offers an opportunity in this regard. Some notable fund founders have passed the baton to groomed successors. But in other cases, like Duquesne, a founder’s departure means investors will get their cash back and have to redeploy it. Given what Mr. Druckenmiller seems to be saying about the challenges facing the largest firms, he may be leaving investors with a valuable parting tip.'"
"'10-08-19,'0','During his career, Mr. Druckenmiller, 57, hit many highs, perhaps none greater than heading the $10 billion bet by Mr. Soros against the British pound in 1992. That gamble shook markets, forcing a major devaluation of the pound.“Druckenmiller deserves 95 percent of the credit,” said Sebastian Mallaby, a fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations and the author of “More Money Than God,” a new book on the history of hedge funds. “By that point, Soros had become more of a coach.”With Mr. Soros, Mr. Druckenmiller helped pioneer an investment strategy that today is referred to as macro trading. They married two different strands of investing. On one hand, the two fund managers placed large bets on global currencies and commodities by watching charts and focusing on political trends. But they also engaged in old-fashioned stock picking, researching companies through fundamental security analysis.“He helped create a new hedge fund model by fusing those two separate traditions,” Mr. Mallaby said. “Druckenmiller had it all in his head at once.”After beginning his career as a stock analyst at Pittsburgh National Bank, the Pittsburgh native struck out on his own, founding Duquesne Capital Management in 1981.Later that decade, Mr. Soros, who had begun shifting his focus to philanthropy, recruited Mr. Druckenmiller to become the principal manager of his Quantum Fund after Mr. Druckenmiller read Mr. Soros’s book “The Alchemy of Finance” and arranged to meet him.After nearly falling out over investment styles, Mr. Soros decided to move to London to give Mr. Druckenmiller more space, Mr. Mallaby recounted in his book.“I’m going to Europe,” Mr. Soros said, according to Mr. Mallaby’s account. “Now we’ll find out whether I’ve just been in your hair too much or whether you really are inept.”Mr. Druckenmiller declined to comment. News of his decision to close Duquesne was first reported by Bloomberg News.Duquesne has not had a down year in its 30-year history. But while his fund reported positive returns in 2008 and 2009 — during the height of the financial crisis — it failed to meet his average historical returns. Duquesne gained about 10 percent in 2009 when others gained on average 20 percent.Mr. Druckenmiller’s career has not been without missteps. At the peak of the technology boom in 1999 and 2000, he made a big bet on Internet stocks. The bursting of the dot-com bubble in March 2000 hurt his portfolio, prompting him to quit his post managing the Quantum Fund after a dozen years.At the time, he said: “We thought it was the eighth inning, and it was the ninth. I overplayed my hand.”During the financial crisis, Mr. Druckenmiller, worried about the fate of his fund, withdrew most of his money from Goldman Sachs, causing a schism with the firm.“The one thing I’m doing is I’m learning who my friends are and who my enemies are, and I’m making lists,” Goldman’s president, Gary D. Cohn, told Mr. Druckenmiller at the time.Mr. Miller plans to spend more of his time on philanthropy; last year he gave $100 million to the New York University Langone Medical Center to help start a neuroscience center.Mr. Druckenmiller is known as a passionate sportsman, both as a participant and spectator. A devoted Pittsburgh Steelers fan who routinely attends home games, Mr. Druckenmiller made an unsuccessful bid for the National Football League team in 2008. He is also an avid golfer, with memberships at a bevy of exclusive clubs, including the National Golf Links of America in Southampton, N.Y., and Oakmont Country Club in Pittsburgh.'"
"'10-08-19,'0','In the boiling caldron of American outrage, here’s one to throw in the pot.In this faded industrial town on the Erie Canal, the old United Methodist church downtown is being turned into a mosque, the old roof topped with minarets, the crescent moon and star of Islam on new white stucco replacing the familiar red-brick facade. Like the immigrants and refugees making up an ever-increasing share of the local population and the 42 languages spoken in the local schools, it is one more sign of how much the familiar world here is fading into the past.Somehow, though, people here have not been given the current script. Instead, while mosques and Islamic community centers have been contested from near ground zero and Staten Island to Murfreesboro, Tenn., Temecula, Calif., and Sheboygan, Wis., Utica is a place where the dog hasn’t barked.Instead, the mosque has been welcomed by, among others, former church members grateful that the old building will be saved. Some 200 people showed up this month for a tour by the Landmarks Society of Greater Utica.Utica is hardly some post-racial nirvana, and it probably helps that the Muslim community is largely Bosnian, not Arab. But if we had today’s stories told by Frank Capra rather than by talk radio, there are more than a few that could be told in this town, which is being revived by immigrants and is embracing difference not in the didactic style of do-gooder moralizing but as a continuation of what Utica has always been.“Where would we be today if no one welcomed the Italians, like my father, the Irish, the Polish, who became the backbone of this community,” said Mayor David R. Roefaro, who owns a funeral home. “When I ran for office, my slogan was ‘We’re in this together,’ because I believe it.”Like most of upstate New York, Utica has seen better days. The population, more than 100,000 for much of the past century, is now around 60,000. Most of the old textile and manufacturing jobs are gone. That said, a flood of immigrants and resettled refugees, Bosnians, Burmese, Somalis, Vietnamese, Iraqis and many others, who now make up about a quarter of the population, have almost stopped the population decline. The Bosnians, in particular, have refurbished much of the housing, and Utica feels like a place with a pulse and maybe even a future.'"
"'10-08-19,'0','I was at what turned into ground zero on 9/11, and despite all the years that have passed, the images of that day have not faded from my memory. I suspect that is true for all who were there and witnessed the jumpers, the collapse of the twin towers and the overall horror of those few morning hours on a beautiful September day.Like many New Yorkers and Americans, my initial reaction to these plans for the cultural center and mosque was no way. Not at that site. But upon reflection I have come to a far different opinion.It now makes perfect sense to me that this mosque should be in sight of ground zero. For when it is completed and crowded with worshipers of the Muslim faith, let them be fully aware by passing close by the site of 9/11 that violence has no place in religion.We can only pray that the sordid history, throughout the centuries, of killing in the name of God, in any form, will finally cease. I believe this mosque can serve as a constant reminder of tolerance and peace in the shadow of what happened that day.The stated motive of building an Islamic center and mosque near ground zero is to bring Muslims and non-Muslims together, a worthwhile goal. Fostering good relations between different communities requires, above all else, sensitivity, and the ability to see through the eyes of the other.'"
"'10-08-19,'0','Custom aquariums are popular for two reasons, interior designers say. One is that upscale nightclubs, restaurants and boutique hotels have been installing them, which gives homeowners the me-too idea. Another is that, among people of means, a dazzling aquarium is one of the last surefire ways to impress their peers.Christopher Stevens, a Manhattan interior designer, said he has worked several giant fish tanks into residential projects at the request of clients. “They have a collection of cars, of motorcycles, of art, they have three dogs,” Mr. Stevens said. “It’s like, ‘What else, what’s the next thing to wow my friends?’ It doesn’t seem like the kind of thing you’d see in high-end interior design, but that’s being reconsidered.”He sees it as a way to add movement and fluidity to what might otherwise be an arid space. “One of my challenges in doing more modern residences these days is just sort of to soften things,” he said. “How do you humanize this space, how do you introduce natural elements? How do you make it feel like you’re not standing in a white, pristine, soul-less box?”But all that movement and fluidity comes at a price. Universally, owners of fantasy fish tanks describe them — usually in the same breath — as very relaxing and very expensive. Aquariums like the Wilzigs’ tend to cost a minimum of $50,000, plus at least $1,000 a month for maintenance. And that’s before buying a single fish.In the world of fantasy fish tanks, it is not uncommon to pay $600 for a black tang or $5,000 for a pet shark, or to have service people on call 24/7 in case a fish gets sick or dies, which could contaminate the entire tank.“I get calls at quarter to 12 on New Year’s Eve,” said Ralph Ammirati, owner of Aquarium Network in Bellmore, N.Y. “We answer the phone.”Joseph Caparatta, owner of Manhattan Aquariums, which sells tanks small and large from a showroom on West 37th Street, said that, increasingly, “Most of the jobs we get come from architects and designers who have to fill a 6,000- or 7,000-square-foot apartment.”It was Mr. Caparatta who suspended a 700-gallon aquarium from the ceiling of a town house apartment in the West Village owned by Richard Wise and Andre Jones. The filled tank weighs at least 6,000 pounds and has cost the couple some $200,000 in equipment and service.“At night, we sit in the living room and sort of get lost in it, instead of the television set,” said Mr. Jones, 40, who owns a construction company, Wise Builders LLC, with Mr. Wise. “It’s always the centerpiece of the party.”The couple keeps bags of brine shrimp and sardinelike fish called silversides in their freezer drawer, next to the Häagen-Dazs and Lean Cuisines. “We feed the fish once a day,” Mr. Jones said. The equipment needed to support the huge aquarium — pumps, pipes, chillers — occupies a walk-in closet as well as part of a roof deck.Their three-year-old tank has a salt-water coral reef filled with catfish, tangs, pink damsels and a two-foot eel that rarely shows itself. “Don’t ask me the names of the fish,” he said. “Joe gives them to me, and then I make up my own.”He added: “At first, when we lost fish, we’d be all traumatized. Now we’re not quite as traumatized.”Their apartment is on the market for $16.9 million, and some potential buyers have expressed interest in keeping the aquarium, while others have said they would want to remove it. Meanwhile, Mr. Wise and Mr. Jones have bought a new place nearby and are considering jellyfish for the dining room.“We went on vacation to Fort Lauderdale and stayed at the W, and they had a tank with all jellyfish,” Mr. Jones said. “That’s like living art to me.”Jellyfish tanks are even more expensive and difficult to build than fish tanks, said Justin Muir, owner of City Aquarium, a Brooklyn-based rival to Manhattan Aquariums. For one thing, jellyfish have to be fed live food every day.But “some people are like, ‘O.K., $5,000 every month to take care of the tank, plus $100,000 cost of the tank — I’m cool with that,’ ” he said.Mr. Muir, a marine biologist who has been building custom tanks for 10 years, considers himself an artist who works with water, light and high-end cabinetry. His starting price: $50,000.Forget miniature mermaids and artificial plants; he uses handmade sculptures and antique statues, as well as exotic fish, sea horses and coral. He even shops at ABC Carpet & Home, he said, “for crystals and all kinds of things we can sink into aquariums. We do a gem tank with all these minerals and geodes that are a perfect habitat for fish.”Mr. Muir’s clients include C. C. Sabathia and Jorge Posada of the New York Yankees, plus plenty of hedge-fund millionaires. He also did a six-foot-long tank for the bedroom of Anna Anisimova, the daughter of a Russian metals billionaire, who lives in the Time Warner building; according to Mr. Stevens, who designed the apartment, the heiress was inspired by aquariums in nightclubs and lounges that she frequents.The most expensive tank Mr. Muir ever built, though, was a $750,000 one for a woman in Dallas who had visited the Maldives and wanted to recreate the experience of lying in tropical waters gazing up at the stars. She had a planetarium ceiling and crescent-shaped aquarium panels hoisted by forklift into her second-floor bathroom.But the real expense of owning such a fantasy tank is the maintenance. Mr. Muir has a staff of seven technicians and biologists who make house calls. “Some clients want nothing to do with the fish tank — they don’t want to feed it, they don’t want to clean algae off the glass,” he said. And most fish should be fed at least every other day. “That’s $150 per visit right there.”Among Mr. Muir’s favorite tanks is the one he built in 2005 for the Wilzigs in TriBeCa, for which he charged $37,000. (“It should have been more,” he said. “But I was just starting out.”) His goal was to play up the home’s tricked-out lighting system by making the tank translucent and using nothing but colorless fish and tiny glass beads inside.As Mr. Wilzig likes to tell visitors, his lighting system uses the same software as that of a professional rock concert or a Broadway show. “The whole essence of the house was to be push-button color-changing,” Mr. Wilzig said. “The apotheosis of that was to take the fish themselves and have them be swimming in whatever color you want.”One of the best colors is yellow, he said, because the fish really stand out, but he likes others too. “When you hit the button for red, all of a sudden it’s like the surface of Mars — red fish swimming over a red planet. When you hit white, it’s like the fish are swimming over an arctic ice floe.”In 2007, Mr. Muir built a similarly sleek aquarium for a couple in Chelsea. At first, the 900-gallon tank held a lone shark — her name was Ursula. When she died, she was replaced by multiple sharks that eventually outgrew the tank and were donated to the New York Aquarium in Coney Island. Today, the occupants are more than a dozen fish of different sizes and shapes.“I enjoy the fish just so much more than the sharks,” said Ryan Nickulas, 30, an owner of a hair salon in the West Village, who lives there with his spouse, Desmond P. Smith, 38, a financial services executive. “They’re more interactive, they’re more fun to look at, they’re more vibrant, and there’s more movement in the tank.”The couple had considered a pool table or a waterfall for the spot in the living room occupied by the aquarium, but are pleased with their choice.“Especially if you view the tank at night, it truly does look like fish swimming in the skyline,” Mr. Nickulas said. “There’s such a serene quality to a tank that it really just calms the entire space.”A LARGE apartment is not a prerequisite for a breathtaking aquarium. Tod Michael Volpe, an art appraiser and consultant who lives in a small studio in Murray Hill, has a five-foot-long, 150-gallon coral reef tank built into the divider between his living room and dining area.“The tank is like my life force,” said Mr. Volpe, 61, a master scuba diver who got the tank last year. “It’s endless pleasure and satisfaction. I’ll stare at the tank until 2 o’clock in the morning.”While some aquarium owners don’t know the breeds of their fish, Mr. Volpe knows all the ones in his tank, as well as the individual habits of each. He has a poisonous rockfish he feeds by hand, a spotted purple grouper (“I brought him up since he was a baby, and now he’s nearly a foot long”), a “very wonderful” clown triggerfish and many others. He checks on the fish all the time to make sure they look healthy, and he leaves the air-conditioner on in his apartment to keep the water cool.Mr. Volpe was once a high-flier in Hollywood who bought artwork for celebrities like Barbra Streisand and Jack Nicholson, but in the late 1990s he pleaded guilty to defrauding them and served time in jail. Today, he said, the aquarium is part of his healing journey.“To me, this is not a fish tank,” he said. “It teaches me about life, respect, how creatures who literally have a world all unto themselves can interact with each other and how happy they are when they have what they need.”On a practical level, Mr. Volpe does worry about the weight of the tank. Mr. Caparatta, who built his aquarium, assured him that the base was properly reinforced. “I have hundreds of gallons of water that could destroy the apartment underneath,” Mr. Volpe said. “Joe said, ‘Tod — relax.’ ”When Jim Robinson built his three-story house on a lake in Windermere, Fla., nearly four years ago, he had his contractors use a special high-compression cement in the base, knowing he wanted to install a 700-gallon aquarium. It is six feet tall, eight feet long and about two feet wide, and it divides his kitchen from his living room.“I’m about five or six miles from Sea World and five or six miles in the other direction from Epcot,” said Mr. Robinson, 49, who owns an entertainment company called Electro-Magic Productions. “I’ve grown up with all those aquariums all around, so maybe subliminally, I wanted to have something like that as well.”He and his architect designed the house around the aquarium and an outdoor infinity edge pool. An important feature was a spiral staircase made of glass and mahogany, so that “wherever you stand in any of the rooms, you actually can see through the staircase and see the aquarium,” he said.The people who service tanks like this sometimes must go to extraordinary lengths. Mr. Robinson’s aquarium man, Bill Hamel of Looking Glass Aquariums in Orlando, brings 350 gallons of distilled salt water every four weeks to change the water — something that costs Mr. Robinson about $500 each time.Mark Collier, who owns Custom Marine Aquaria in Scottsdale, Ariz., once built a 30-foot-long aquarium into the floor of someone’s game room, which contained a pool table, big-screen TV and “water wall” that gave the illusion that water was cascading into the aquarium (it wasn’t). Total installation cost for the aquarium alone: $200,000.To clean the tank, he had to dive into it, wearing a cord around his ankle that his partner could use to pull him out if need be. “I would basically kind of crawl through the aquarium and back myself out again,” Mr. Collier said.The aquarium is no longer in use, he added, as a bank has since foreclosed on the house.Outside the realm of custom design, one of the more eye-catching ready-made aquariums is the Spacearium, a flat, elliptical tank that is suspended from the ceiling. The Spacearium comes in three sizes — from five to eight feet long — and the fish that live in it can be no more than 4 inches long, since the tank’s maximum width is either 12 or 14 inches. The Spacearium can weigh up to 800 pounds, and all the filters and other hardware are hidden from view.“Because of the very unusual shape, you get a 360-degree view of the aquarium content,” said Lionel Dimitri, vice president of Aquarium ASP, the company in Laval, Quebec, that brought the Spacearium to market four years ago.“We typically reach people who like the unusual,” he added. “I would say 95 percent of our residential customers never had an aquarium before and weren’t even considering one in the first place until they bumped into our product in a magazine or shows.”It was a picture in The Robb Report, a luxury goods magazine, that prompted Tom Gosling to buy the Spacearium and modify his building plans. He was building his 3,500-square-foot home in Kitchener, Ontario, and opted to scrap some cabinets between the kitchen and the living room in favor of the hanging aquarium.“I fell in love with it,” said Mr. Gosling, 42, who owns a supply business called Gosco Valves. “Every person who comes into the house comments on how cool it is.”He paid $8,000 for the Spacearium and said that the investment was more than worth it. “It’s kind of like a fire; you can sit there and watch it for hours,” he said. “You can be all wound up, and you sit down in front of the tank and suddenly everything is totally relaxed — it’s so therapeutic.”'"

"'10-08-19,'0','The price changes at Pizza Hut are indicative of how marketers are scrambling to address changing consumer behavior as the economy remains sluggish. Not that long ago, it was believed that marketers would soon be able to stop running price-oriented ads, or at least fewer of them.But the most recent economic news, suggesting that the recovery has slowed, is calling into question those assumptions. That is why, for instance, Quiznos is promoting a value menu with sandwiches priced at $3, $4 and $5, and the Campbell Soup Company is running ads in Sunday newspaper coupon inserts that proclaim Chunky soup can help make “dinner for $4 in under 4 minutes!”“We want to make sure we can provide people’s favorite foods at accessible prices,” Brian Niccol, chief marketing officer at Pizza Hut, said at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon at the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan.In some cases, the sale represents “almost a 50 percent reduction” in menu prices, Mr. Niccol said.Mr. Niccol’s use of the phrase “favorite foods” was no accident. Pizza Hut also plans to introduce a brand campaign that will carry the theme, “Your favorites. Your Pizza Hut.” The brand campaign is likely to begin appearing in early September, Mr. Niccol said, and will be interspersed with ads for the sale and ads for the new menu items like the Big Italy.“We want to build loyalty beyond the price,” Mr. Niccol said in an interview, adding that the way to do that was to make sure consumers “see the value in the brand that goes beyond the price.”“Ten dollars for the type of pizza product we provide,” he added, “it’s tremendous value.”To that end, a television commercial about the sale addresses the quality of Pizza Hut menu items. “We’ve changed just about everything,” an actress playing a restaurant employee says at the end of the spot, “except how your favorite pizza tastes.”That Pizza Hut sells consumers’ “favorite food” will be just as important to Pizza Hut’s marketing efforts, Mr. Niccol said, as providing their “favorite value, favorite experiences and favorite thing you didn’t even know yet.”As an example of the last favorite, he described how Pizza Hut wanted to extend its successful ordering application for the iPhone — which has already generated more than $10 million in sales, he said — to mobile devices like the iPad and Droid. (Pizza Hut also offers online ordering.)All the ads are being created by the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Martin became the Pizza Hut lead creative agency in December, replacing BBDO New York — part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group — after more than two decades.Martin has “a real ability to connect with consumers in the current economic conditions,” Mr. Niccol said, referring to work the agency creates for other clients like Geico and Wal-Mart.Andy Azula, a creative director at Martin, was in a video clip shown at the news conference to discuss the brand campaign. The idea is to present pizza as a “part of other favorite things,” Mr. Azula said, adding that the commercials would feature Pizza Hut employees.Mr. Niccol said Pizza Hut would make full use of what he described as its “big, powerful media budget” to run the brand ads, the sale ads and the ads for the new items like the Big Italy, which a commercial boasts is “bigger than two medium pizzas.”Pizza Hut spent $199.2 million to run ads in major media last year, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP. In the first quarter of this year, the company spent $60.6 million, Kantar Media reported, compared with $59 million in the same period a year ago.And Pizza Hut will expand in the social media, Mr. Niccol said. The brand has more than a million fans on Facebook, he added, and is sponsoring a promotion on Foursquare, the social networking service for mobile devices.“In the first couple days, we had 300 mayors check in,” he added, using a Foursquare term for users who achieve a status level. “I guess that’s good.”'"
"'10-08-19,'0','Beset by a series of recalls of Tylenol and other popular over-the-counter drugs, Johnson & Johnson said Wednesday that it planned to revamp its quality controls, creating a single framework for its drug, medical device and consumer health care divisions.Ajit Shetty, the corporate vice president responsible for supply chain operations, will oversee the new system, reporting directly to William C. Weldon, Johnson & Johnson’s chief executive. The company said it also planned to appoint chief quality officers for each of its three major divisions.Mr. Weldon first gave details of the plan in an interview Wednesday with The Wall Street Journal.The quality control reorganization comes after a number of recent recalls of Tylenol, Motrin and other products by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a unit of Johnson & Johnson. The recalls have led to the temporary shutting of one manufacturing plant.McNeil’s conduct surrounding the recalls is the subject of inquiry by both the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations and by the Food and Drug Administration’s office of criminal investigations. In the last two years, F.D.A. inspectors have found significant violations of manufacturing standards at two McNeil plants, according to the agency’s Web site.In January, McNeil recalled millions of bottles of adult Tylenol, Motrin and other products made at a company plant in Puerto Rico after consumers complained about a moldy or musty odor in the products. The company said a byproduct of a chemical used to treat wooden transport pallets had leached into the products, causing the moldy smell.In April, McNeil recalled an estimated 136 million bottles of liquid children’s Tylenol and other products made at a company plant in Fort Washington, Pa. The company recalled the products because they might have contained too much of the active drug ingredient or foreign particles, the F.D.A. said.In July, McNeil said it was starting a program to improve manufacturing and quality and it has temporarily closed the Fort Washington plant.'"
"'10-08-19,'0','It was bound to happen. Although the Arcade Fire had its moment in the spotlight when it beat out Eminem for the No. 1 spot on the Billboard album chart last week, the natural order of the pop universe has been restored, with Eminem’s “Recovery” (Aftermath/Interscope) retaking No. 1 by a wide margin. “Recovery” sold 133,000 copies last week, according to Nielsen SoundScan, landing the album at the top of the chart for the sixth time in eight weeks. The Arcade Fire’s album, “The Suburbs” (Merge), fell to No. 2 with 52,000 sales, a 66 percent decline from the week before. (Although sales for “Recovery” have dropped since it was released, they have held steady in the mid-100,000’s, and the album has sold a total of 2.1 million copies so far.) The soundtrack to the Disney Channel movie “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam” (Disney), with songs by Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers, opened at No. 3 with 41,000 sales.

"'10-08-19,'0','“There is every reason to note significant progress in relations between our countries,” Mr. Medvedev said to his Afghan counterpart, Hamid Karzai, at the meeting, held at Mr. Medvedev’s summer residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, according to Russian news agencies. “Russia is prepared to develop ties with its Afghan partners.”The Kremlin is proceeding cautiously, however, as the Afghan quagmire, which cost 14,000 Russian lives, resonates as painfully here as the Vietnam War does in the United States.While Mr. Medvedev hosted the meeting, he was actually more in the salesman’s role than the buyer’s. The Russian economy, dragged down by low prices for oil and other commodities and savaged by the financial crisis, shrank by 8 percent last year and is expected to grow by only 4 percent this year.Studies by American geologists have indicated that Afghanistan is ripe for a potentially profitable mining boom, and others are already piling in. The China Metallurgical Group, for example, has already agreed to invest $3 billion in a copper mine south of Kabul.On the sidelines of the summit meeting on Wednesday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said Afghan officials had invited Russia to take part in a project to lay an electrical wire across Afghanistan that would distribute an abundance of hydroelectric power in Tajikistan to energy-hungry Pakistan.In comments carried by the Interfax news agency, Mr. Lavrov conceded that the idea existed only on paper now, but said Russia would be “keen” to take part if it came about. Mr. Lavrov said it would be “hard to overestimate” the importance of such a new electrical system in helping Afghanistan recover from decades of war and troubled government.At the meeting, the four presidents discussed possible joint projects in infrastructure, transportation and mining in Central Asia, Mr. Lavrov said. For now, dismal security would seem to rule out much work on capital-intensive enterprises like industrial scale mining. Mr. Medvedev offered the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, support in dealing with the severe floods devastating his country, but his focus was clearly on the Afghan president.Russian officials repeated their offer to provide helicopters and small-caliber weapons to help the Afghan government defeat the Taliban insurgents and perhaps better control the opium trade. Russia has offered 20 helicopters, but is asking NATO to help finance the sale.Recently, the Kremlin has sharply criticized the United States for tolerating poppy cultivation, because much of the Afghan opium crop is finding its way to Russia and contributing to rising rates of heroin addiction.'"
"'10-08-19,'0','JERUSALEM — Amin al-Hindi, an associate of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and a former Palestinian Authority intelligence chief who was widely suspected of having played an organizing role in the deadly attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, died Tuesday in Amman, Jordan. He was 70.His death was reported by the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, which did not list the cause. However, the Palestinian ambassador in Amman, Atallah Kheiry, told Agence France-Presse that Mr. Hindi had been treated for cancer.Mr. Hindi was born in Gaza in 1940 but spent many years in exile as a security officer for Fatah, the Palestinian national liberation movement that was founded by Arafat in the late 1950s and became the dominant force in the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Palestinian umbrella group.If Mr. Hindi was involved in the Munich attack — he never publicly acknowledged any responsibility — he may have been the last of the plotters to survive. Several were tracked down and killed by Israeli counterterrorist squads abroad. The self-declared mastermind of the attack, Mohammed Oudeh, better known by his guerrilla name, Abu Daoud, died in early July in Damascus at age 73.The Munich attack, carried out by Black September, a shadowy terrorist apparatus associated with Fatah and the P.L.O., shocked people around the world. Eight Palestinians broke into a dormitory at the Olympic village where Israeli team members were sleeping and took them hostage in the early morning of Sept. 5, 1972. Two of them tried to overpower the militants and were shot and killed.Israel refused to accede to the terrorists’ demands to release Palestinian prisoners, and the nine remaining hostages and their captors were eventually transported by helicopters to a military airfield, where officials said they were to be flown to Cairo. Instead, West German sharpshooters tried to rescue the Israelis, setting off a gun battle in which five Palestinians, a German police officer and the nine hostages were killed.'"
"'10-08-19,'0','“By focusing on getting big legislative accomplishments, which was understandable, they necessarily gave up a larger image of him as president,” Mr. Podesta said, referring to White House advisers. “They cast him as the prime minister. They were kind of locked into the day-to-day workings on the Hill.”This was not a given. All presidents have laws they want to pass, but they have broader thematic priorities, too. Ronald Reagan saw a renewal of American optimism as a vital goal. Bill Clinton publicly hammered away at his ideas about economic transformation and “reinventing government.”Unlike his recent predecessors, however, Mr. Obama had spent his entire political career in legislative posts, and he seemed determined, above all else, to clear the Congressional hurdles that had thwarted the others. He chose a vice president and a chief of staff who were masters of the legislative arena, and he filled his most senior posts (aside from those occupied by longtime advisers) with former Congressional aides.Mr. Obama’s central strategy was to concentrate on cajoling Democratic lawmakers into passing a series of bills — the stimulus package, the health care overhaul, a new set of financial regulations. Rather than spend a lot of time rallying public support for the agenda, Mr. Podesta said, the administration expected to get an “updraft” from an improving economy; the bet was that, as unemployment came down and consumer confidence rose, public opinion would more or less take care of itself.“That strategy was built on the no-economic-stall option,” Mr. Podesta said. “In other words, the idea was that you didn’t have to get the unemployment rate to a certain number, but you had to get unemployment going in the right direction, and people would feel that, and it would be palpable.”The problem, as Mr. Podesta says, is that “we’re all still waiting for that.”And so, without the modest economic revival Mr. Obama and his aides expected, voters saw trillions of dollars being spent and wondered whether there was a coherent strategy for growth. Mr. Obama, whose skills as an explainer were so instrumental in winning the office, did little sustained explaining of the crisis outside Washington.The strategy had other implications for Mr. Obama’s image. As Mr. Podesta points out, part of the president’s significant appeal to voters — “a big part of the secret sauce of getting him elected” — was his promise to transcend perennial partisanship.A more national, outward-looking strategy for creating a “postpartisan” dynamic might have included White House partnerships with Republican governors or even with conservative foundations or industry groups. Because the president effectively boxed himself in to a Capitol-Hill-only strategy, though, he handed the Republican minorities in Congress the power to sabotage his goal.“Once you became a legislative president, which is arguably what you needed to do, you couldn’t deliver on the nonpartisanship promise,” Mr. Podesta said. “And it’s something people wanted.”It’s not hard to extend Mr. Podesta’s theory about the legislative box to other areas in which the administration has faltered. One of the real surprises of the Obama era, for instance, has been the president’s sharp break with the business community. Perhaps it shouldn’t be so surprising, though, when you consider that Mr. Obama’s focus on legislation has forced him to be responsive, above all else, to the shifting tides of populist sentiment in Congress.Think of it this way: if your singular goal is to pass bills, and Democratic lawmakers are in a frenzy this week over A.I.G.’s bonuses or Goldman Sachs’s investments, then you might feel forced to castigate big business, too.Much of Mr. Obama’s anticorporate rhetoric was probably calibrated more to lawmakers than to business leaders, but what the executives heard were declarations of war against American industry.Perhaps the most damaging consequence of the legislative box is that it left Mr. Obama, who still regards himself as an outsider and a reformer, looking like a Congressional insider — which is about the last thing voters, and independent voters in particular, wanted him to be.“At the end of the day, they set out to do a lot, and got a lot done,” Mr. Podesta said. “If the unemployment rate were at 8.5 percent and we were creating 250,000 or 300,000 jobs right now, it would feel a lot different.” But that hasn’t happened, and if Mr. Podesta is right, panicky voters wanted a president, rather than a legislator in chief, to make sure they understood why.'"

"'10-08-20,'0','They said St. Vincent’s had also been trying to force the clinic to conform to Catholic doctrine by prohibiting it from prescribing birth-control drugs or providing counseling on birth-control methods. St. Vincent’s, founded by nuns in 1849, was a Catholic hospital. But apart from leasing hospital property, the urgent-care center would be run independently of the former hospital, the officials said.Mark E. Toney, the chief restructuring officer at St. Vincent’s, did not return a call for comment Thursday.But Veronica Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said that any lease agreement would need the approval of the hospital’s creditors and the bankruptcy court. She added that because the property is linked to a Catholic organization, the clinic would have to “adhere to Catholic directives.”St. Vincent’s was the flagship hospital of St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, a nonprofit organization sponsored by the Sisters of Charity and the Brooklyn diocese.The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, whose district includes the hospital site and who was instrumental in obtaining state support for an urgent-care center, sent a letter to Dr. Richard Daines, the state health commissioner, on Thursday asking him to intervene in the talks.“We find it highly distressing that, at this point, the Urgent Care Center is nowhere near opening,” Ms. Quinn said in the letter, which was also signed by Representative Jerrold L. Nadler. Ms. Quinn repeated her position that the community’s first choice was to replace St. Vincent’s with another hospital and that the urgent-care center was a stopgap measure.A spokeswoman for Dr. Daines, Diane M. Mathis, said: “Christine Quinn doesn’t know what she’s talking about. The state health department has been in constant contact with all the stakeholders.” But she added, “Anything that has to do with the property of St. Vincent’s must be worked out through the bankruptcy court.”Terence Lynam, a spokesman for North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, said the dispute involved conditions of the lease, but declined to discuss the details. “We remain committed to opening and operating the urgent-care center,” he said. “We can’t get in there to start work until we have a finalized lease, and we’re hung up with them in negotiations on the lease.”Mr. Lynam said North Shore-Long Island would need about six to eight weeks to renovate the emergency room to house the urgent-care center. It would be designed to handle conditions somewhere between those treated in a doctor’s office and those treated in a hospital. Patients could stay for up to 24 hours.'"

"'10-08-20,'0','Moreover, Intel is paying plenty. The median takeover premium in the technology sector over the last decade was 40 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. And Intel investors appear unconvinced, wiping almost $4 billion off the company’s market capitalization on Thursday, though a down day for stocks generally didn’t help. They may worry that a big war chest — more than $18 billion in cash and tradable securities at the end of June — was just burning a hole in Intel’s pocket.The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan in Canada is willing to sell at the right price — and that’s higher than the $39 billion offered by BHP Billiton. A competitive auction is the Canadian company’s best bet to get the fullest price. But the fertilizer group could struggle to get one going.With less than $4 billion of debt, Potash has other options. BHP has lined up syndicated financing to back its bid. The Canadian company could borrow on its own and return cash to investors. But such plans have a mixed record at generating shareholder value.Alternatively, Potash owns about $7.5 billion in minority stakes in several listed overseas companies. If executives believe the market doesn’t fully recognize how bright the future is for its products, it could borrow to buy stakes in more SQM, a fertilizer company in Chile. This might make it that much harder for BHP to swallow its quarry. But the idea of accumulating noncontrolling stakes might not please Potash’s investors.The simplest defense is to convince the market it is worth more. Potash is the biggest and one of the lowest-cost producers in a market with bright prospects. Furthermore, its shares are trading far below their 2008 peak. They closed on Thursday more than 14 percent above BHP’s initial offer price of $130 apiece, suggesting investors believe the story.If it really wants to get top dollar, however, Potash needs a counter bid. There are few obvious candidates, especially given the price tag. Rio Tinto, for instance, is still digesting Alcan. Vale, partly owned by the Brazilian government, could find it difficult with elections looming. A consortium could be another option, but organizing one takes time and BHP is hoping to force a shareholder vote within a few months.Potential Chinese bidders such as Sinofert might be leery of jumping so heavily into a cross-border merger or acquisition — and any bid could create political concern in Canada. Then again, although BHP is promising to run Potash’s mines at full capacity if it buys the company, food and farming are intensely political areas. With a nod from officials at home, a strategic bidder from China or elsewhere just may join the fray.'"
"'10-08-20,'0','But the addictive treat has a downside, ruining mouths when chewed and soiling sidewalks when spat out.In many parts of Asia, the fresh areca nut is chewed, sometimes wrapped in betel leaf or with tobacco, a habit that has been linked to higher rates of oral cancer. Hunan residents prefer to eat just the preserved husk, which seems to deter the fruit’s carcinogenic effects, according to recent studies. But local dentists and doctors denounce the practice, saying it can cause other mouth diseases.Still, binglang is a symbol of pride to residents, business leaders and local officials, who wave off suggestions that the fruit is harmful.“Binglang has helped Xiangtan make a name for itself,” said Li Lihua, 60, a veteran chewer of 40 years who sells bags of binglang for 75 cents each. “It’s like chewing gum but stronger, plus it kills parasites.”Experts affiliated with the World Health Organization estimate that 80 percent of Xiangtan’s residents chew binglang. Many start around 10 years old, picking up the habit from parents who believe that it has powerful health benefits. According to traditional Chinese medicine, it aids digestion, removes plaque and expels worms.Standing outside a boisterous arcade, Pan Bozhe, 24, was gleefully chewing some “Big Brother” binglang during a visit home from Guangdong Province, where he works as an electronics salesman. “I really miss this stuff the rest of the year, since they don’t sell it in Shenzhen,” he said, his jaw working furiously. “So whenever I come back to Xiangtan I chew as much as I can.”Hunan’s love affair with binglang began more than 300 years ago, when, according to local lore, a magistrate promoted it as a cure for a plague that was sweeping the region. During China’s economic reforms of the early 1980s, Xiangtan began turning the pastime into profit, and these days processes more than 700 tons each year, according to the Hunan Binglang Association.The city fathers speak of binglang as if it were a panacea for all of Xiangtan’s ills, from curing tapeworm to solving unemployment.Just ask Li Xuejun 46, a binglang manufacturer who named his brand Enormous Blessing. His grandmother’s fondness for the desiccated fruit inspired him to break into the business in the mid-1990s, and he now sells $410,000 of binglang annually, employing 200 people. Sales have grown about 50 percent a year, he said, which he attributes to heavier advertising and more children taking up the habit of chewing binglang in mint, cinnamon and orange flavors.With a cigarette hanging from his lips and binglang shells crunching between his molars, Mr. Li lounged in the back room of a restaurant here and extolled the virtues of the plant that has showered the city with jobs and sport utility vehicles and has sent its children to top universities.Local medical experts have long been nudging the Xiangtan government to make binglang safer. Tang Jieqing, the vice director of the Xiangtan Stomatological Hospital, who has studied the area’s binglang habits for more than 10 years, believes that rates of mouth diseases like oral submucous fibrosis are higher in Xiangtan than elsewhere in China, and he wants the government to publicize binglang’s health risks.While the local government set a production standard in 2004, “to be honest, it hasn’t been very supportive in a practical way,” Dr. Tang said, citing the lack of package warnings or other consumer information.Noting the industry’s economic value, he added, “our government can be supportive of binglang, but one should never say that it’s very healthy.”'"
"'10-08-20,'0','Although he has little experience in intelligence work, Mr. Nabil has worked closely with Mr. Karzai for six years as the head of the guard for the presidential palace. He provides security when Mr. Karzai travels, and he is trusted by the president, Afghan government officials said. As for working with the United States-led coalition forces, Mr. Nabil said, “We are on the same page.”A civil engineer, he worked for the United Nations refugee agency for nine years, much of that time while the Taliban was in power, until 2004, when he joined Mr. Karzai in taking charge of a force of 100 American-trained close-protection officers at the presidential palace and expanding it over the past six years.He acknowledged that he took on that job with no experience and said that a professional security official told him that if he managed to keep the president alive for six months, he would have succeeded.Friends, former colleagues and members of the presidential protection service describe him as an outstanding manager with little ethnic or political bias.“He is by far the most capable Afghan I know,” said Nigel Pont, a fellow at Harvard who worked with Mr. Nabil in the 1990s managing a refugee camp for people who had fled the factional fighting in Kabul. “He is completely honest and is passionate about serving his fellow Afghans and setting Afghanistan on a better path,” Mr. Pont wrote in an e-mail.Critics, including some government officials, said he was inexperienced and weak and would not be able to stand up to Mr. Karzai and the powerful interests swirling around the palace. One of his first decisions was to appoint a man widely rumored to be corrupt, a relative of First Vice President Muhammad Qasim Fahim, to be deputy intelligence chief for Kabul. Asked about the appointment, Mr. Nabil said no one had told him of any suspicions of corruption with regard to the man.Mr. Nabil inherits one of the better performing institutions in Afghanistan with a broad mandate to ensure internal security, combat terrorism and fight organized crime, which includes intelligence gathering inside Afghanistan and abroad, and managing tens of thousands of agents.Yet it remains a strange hybrid, with a mixture of former Communists trained by the K.G.B. and mujahedeen who fought the Soviet Army and later the Taliban from the hills. The force is now further divided by the abrupt departure of Mr. Saleh and some 40 officials loyal to him.Within a week of starting his job, Mr. Nabil had to provide security for foreign ministers from more than 40 countries at a one-day conference in Kabul.“That was my immediate and biggest challenge, to prove to the Kabul people and the international community that I was able to do that,” he said. “But, one thing, I was able to grab the confidence of a good team which was existing already in the N.D.S. and convince them we can work together since we are working for Afghanistan and we are not working for one person.”He accompanied his men on a nightlong raid that he said thwarted a planned mortar attack on the conference, and then with the center of the city almost completely locked down the next day, the conference passed safely.Although Mr. Karzai has apparently lost faith in the American-led counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan, according to senior government officials, Mr. Nabil is among the ministers and senior officials, including his predecessor, who support the strategy and its emphasis on winning the support of the population by improving security and the government’s performance.He talks of his native Wardak Province, just southwest of Kabul, where he said 80 to 90 percent of the insurgents were criminals, including one commander who is a known thief. “I am in touch with elders and shuras, and the local community wants to get rid of this,” he said. A shura is a traditional council of elders.Even mullahs and principals of the big madrasas are fed up with the insurgents, he said. Yet the government is so weak that in some areas the police are hampered by a lack of ammunition and fuel. “These are areas we need to improve,” he said.Villages and towns are supportive of a new scheme for community-based policing to defend their residents and of the reconciliation plan to persuade Taliban foot soldiers to give up and join the government, he said.“They are optimistic about these programs and are ready to contribute,” he said. “They want to see progress. In the meantime, they want to see that we will not leave them alone.”An ethnic Pashtun, like Mr. Karzai and most of the Taliban insurgents fighting the government, he clearly believes that he will have a better chance at winning over the population than did his predecessor, Mr. Saleh, who was an ethnic Tajik from the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul and a fierce foe of the Taliban.Mr. Nabil said he planned changes to the intelligence service, not in its objectives but in how it dealt with the population to gain cooperation. “The change will be that everybody should feel comfortable dealing, or talking to or approaching the N.D.S.”While a few Taliban leaders will be irreconcilable, many of the lower-ranking fighters could be persuaded to come over to the government, he said. “They are foot soldiers,” he said. “I think they will reconcile; as long as we go deeper in the community we will be able to convince them.”The son of a farmer, he joined the jihad against the Soviet occupation as a teenager before leaving to finish his education in Pakistan. “I know my community,” he said. “I know what they are thinking about the government, and N.D.S. organization, and what are their wishes. That will also help me.”'"
"'10-08-20,'0','Most bereaved individuals do not develop major depression, although they may feel terrible sadness. Major depression — the clinical syndrome — is quite different from feeling sad or blue. It also involves marked, persistent changes in function like sleep, appetite and cognition, and sometimes suicidal thinking.Diagnosis in psychiatry, as in the rest of medicine, includes the possibility that treatment may be initiated at the time of diagnosis or after a period of watchful waiting to determine if treatment is indicated.The writers are all psychiatrists. Dr. Kendler is a member of the DSM-5 Mood Disorder Work Group. Dr. Kupfer is chairman of the DSM-5 Task Force. Dr. Bernstein is president of the American Psychiatric Association.As an adult and child psychiatrist who specializes in bereavement, I strongly agree with Dr. Allen Frances that we need to grieve, that in and of itself grief is not a pathological process and that grief differs from major depression.But I equally strongly disagree with his perspective that having a diagnosis for the grief condition would necessarily medicalize it. In some instances, medication is necessary for severe symptoms that cause continuing dysfunction and distress. But there is no foregone conclusion that a diagnosis inevitably leads to a pill — magic or otherwise.It is precisely because of my respect for the necessity of the grieving process that I can support its recognition in the diagnostic manual. The only way that many patients can afford therapy is with insurance — which covers only certain mental health diagnoses, and even then in very limited ways.Our society does not provide mourners with the emotional support and capacity to “bear witness” that they need. We run from any intimations of our mortality. Until such time that we are better able to tolerate the intensity of feelings created by a significant loss, we must do all we can to preserve the option of psychological support for those in mourning. Therapy provides a unique relationship in which these feelings can be tolerated, understood and worked through.The writer is a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at Weill-Cornell Medical Center and the author of “I Will Remember You: A Guidebook Through Grief for Teens.”Allen Frances is right to oppose listing grief as a psychiatric illness. Grief is the most vivid, piercing and transcendent of emotions. People grieve in their own unique ways. The problem is that we expect grief to follow the same throwaway, “get over it” ethic that drives too much of modern life.Many people expect a funeral or memorial for the deceased to bring “closure” for the grieving, when, in reality, preparations for such ceremonies only postpone mourning. After a few bereavement days, a griever is often expected to go back to work without missing a beat. After two weeks, the mere mention of the deceased or your loss may be considered rude or burdensome to others.Little wonder people are depressed.We agree with Allen Frances that “normal grief” two weeks after the death of a loved one shouldn’t be diagnosed as major depression or considered a “mental disorder.” Indeed, most recently bereaved individuals don’t meet full criteria for major depression, though intense grief may be hard to distinguish from depression.But should a recent death (or other loss) nullify the diagnosis of major depressive disorder when the bereaved meets all symptom and duration criteria for it? We think not. Most studies suggest that, given two people with identical symptoms of major depression, the recently bereaved person won’t differ significantly from the nonbereaved regarding illness duration, impairment, suicide risk or treatment response.Grief can be a terribly painful and prolonged experience. But vulnerable individuals may have a severe depressive episode triggered or worsened by the recent death of a loved one, rendering their grief even more disabling and persistent. The humane response is to recognize and treat both their grief and depression.The writers are both professors of psychiatry, Dr. Pies at Upstate Medical University, SUNY, and Tufts University, and Dr. Zisook at the University of California, San Diego.'"
"'10-08-20,'0','What soldier, anticipating his death in combat, wouldn’t want to be remembered as a fallen hero who gave his life for his comrades? What grieving family wouldn’t accept the official account, however fraudulent, of a son or daughter’s heroism, stifle their doubts, keep their mouths shut and be content to find some comfort in the ritual honors?That was probably the assumption of the military brass who concocted a bogus account of the combat death of Pat Tillman, a football star and a casualty of so-called friendly fire in Afghanistan in April 2004 at age 27. The official story initially had him saving the lives of fellow soldiers during a mountain ambush by the Taliban. It was a flag-waving, “Rambo”-worthy feel-good fantasy that played well on television.But as Amir Bar-Lev’s sorrowful, devastating documentary, “The Tillman Story,” reveals, not every soldier or every soldier’s family is willing to be so glorified. Tillman, who had the square-jawed face of a comic-book warrior, certainly looked the part, and some of the details of his life supported the image of him as a rampaging gung-ho patriot. He had quit the National Football League in the wake of 9/11 to join the Army Rangers, turning down a multimillion-dollar contract from the Arizona Cardinals. After his death he received a Silver Star for valor.But in other ways, Tillman didn’t fit the image. Thoughtful and private, he never made a public statement about his decision to enlist and asked that his privacy on the matter be respected. An avowed atheist, he studied the writings of Noam Chomsky and opposed the war in Iraq after serving a tour of duty there. Yet when the government and the N.F.L. secretly arranged for him to return to football without having to fulfill his commitment, he refused the deal, believing it was his duty to serve the three years for which he had signed up. His next stop was Afghanistan.Several weeks after Tillman was eulogized by President George W. Bush as a classic American war hero, the military announced that he had actually been killed by a stray bullet during the confusion known as “the fog of war.”'"
"'10-08-20,'0','“As soon as you understand something that was staring you in the face and leaving you clueless, the first thing you ask is, ‘Where else is this happening?’ ” Dr. Housman said.But, he added, in a way FSHD was the easy case — it is a disease that affects every single person who inherits the genetic defect. Other diseases are more subtle, affecting some people more than others, causing a range of symptoms. The trick, he said, is to be “astute enough to pick out the patterns that connect you to the DNA.”FSHD affects about 1 in 20,000 people, causing a progressive weakening of muscles in the upper arms, around the shoulder blades and in the face — people who have the disease cannot smile. It is a dominant genetic disease. If a parent has the gene mutation that causes it, each child has a 50 percent chance of getting it too. And anyone who inherits the gene is absolutely certain to get the disease.About two decades ago, geneticists zeroed in on the region of the genome that seemed to be the culprit: the tip of the longer arm of chromosome 4, which was made up of a long chain of repeated copies of a dead gene. The dead gene was also repeated on chromosome 10, but that area of repeats seemed innocuous, unrelated to the disease. Only chromosome 4 was a problem.“It was a repeated element,” said Dr. Kenneth Fischbeck, chief of the neurogenetics branch at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “An ancient gene stuck on the tip of chromosome 4. It was a dead gene; there was no evidence that it was expressed.”And the more they looked at that region of chromosome 4, the more puzzling it was. No one whose dead gene was repeated more than 10 times ever got FSHD. But only some people with fewer than 10 copies got the disease.A group of researchers in the and the had a meeting about five years ago to try to figure it out, and began collaborating. “We kept meeting here, year after year,” said Dr. Stephen J. Tapscott, a neurology professor at the .As they studied the repeated, but dead, gene, Dr. Tapscott and his colleagues realized that it was not completely inactive. It is always transcribed — copied by the cell as a first step to making a protein. But the transcriptions were faulty, disintegrating right away. They were missing a crucial section, called a poly (A) sequence, needed to stabilize them.When the dead gene had this sequence, it came back to life. “It’s an if and only if,” Dr. Housman said. “You have to have 10 copies or fewer. And you have to have poly (A). Either one is not enough.”But why would people be protected if they have more than 10 copies of the dead gene? Researchers say that those extra copies change the chromosome’s structure, shutting off the whole region so it cannot be used.Why the reactivated gene affects only muscles of the face, shoulders and arms remains a mystery. The only clue is that the gene is similar to ones that are important in development.In the meantime, says Dr. Housman, who was not involved in the research but is chairman of the scientific advisory board of the FSHD Society, an advocacy group led by patients, the work reveals a way to search for treatments.“It has made it clear what the target is,” he said. “Turning off that dead gene. I am certain you can hit it.”The bigger lesson, Dr. Collins said, is that diseases can arise in very complicated ways. Scientists used to think the genetic basis for medical disorders, like dominantly inherited diseases, would be straightforward. Only complex diseases, like , would have complex genetic origins.“Well, my gosh,” Dr. Collins said. “Here’s a simple disease with an incredibly elaborate mechanism.”“To come up with this sort of mechanism for a disease to arise — I don’t think we expected that,” Dr. Collins said.'"
"'10-08-20,'0','Analysts doubted that McAfee’s business would have much near-term impact on Intel’s bottom line.Intel’s fortunes are tied to PCs and the computer servers that go into data centers. As such, Intel, with revenue of $35.1 billion in 2009, goes through boom-and-bust cycles as demand waxes and wanes. McAfee, with revenue of $1.93 billion last year, sells a great deal of software on a subscription basis, which can smooth out financial results from quarter to quarter and year to year.“There are no immediate synergies that I can see,” said Stacy A. Rasgon, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “It is a strategic deal, and it is a pretty rich price for a strategic buy.”Intel will pay $48 a share in cash, a 60 percent premium over McAfee’s Wednesday closing stock price of $29.93. The deal hinges on standard regulatory approvals.Demand for McAfee’s core security products should rise as people look to protect their smartphones, cars and Web-ready products from Internet threats, said David G. DeWalt, the chief executive at McAfee. Consumer electronics products like phones and hand-held gadgets face fewer threats than PCs, although it is expected they will be subjected to the same torments from hackers as they gain access to the Internet.McAfee has 17.7 percent of the market for securing computing devices, trailing the market leader Symantec, which has 36.2 percent, according to the research firm IDC. In the last couple of years, McAfee has gained ground on Symantec by signing a large number of deals with PC makers and Internet service providers to offer its security software to consumers and workers.Intel already builds a number of security hooks into its chips. These tools can help block malicious software from disrupting a computer or give a technician the ability to fix a computer from a remote location. The purchase of McAfee would give Intel access to more security specialists and the ability to hardwire more of these types of tools into its chips.Still, analysts noted that Intel spent plenty to obtain these security skills. “Eventually the software features will get embedded in the hardware,” said Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst with Rodman & Renshaw. “So maybe this is an expensive way for Intel to acquire domain expertise.”With its share price stagnant for years, Intel has been hunting for growth outside of the PC and computer server markets. In particular, Intel has decided to go after the smartphone and consumer electronics segments, which are dominated by rival chip designs.Intel’s growth push has been met with resistance, largely because its chips remain more expensive and power-hungry than those of rivals.McAfee will operate as an Intel subsidiary, reporting to Renée J. James, the head of Intel’s software and services group.In an interview, Ms. James declined to provide details on how Intel products would gain an edge over the competition through the McAfee technology.She has led Intel’s transformation into a software powerhouse.Last year, Intel bought Wind River for $884 million, giving it a software maker that played in the consumer electronics and wireless markets. Earlier, Intel purchased Havok, a company that provided software tools to video game makers.Intel and Nokia also work together on the MeeGo operating system for smartphones and other consumer electronics devices, placing the companies in competition with Apple, Google and Microsoft.'"
"'10-08-20,'0','Financial, materials and industrial stocks all fell more than 2 percent.“Financials are kind of used as a bellwether,” Mr. Roberts said. He added that weak employment and manufacturing data raised questions about the prospects for a rebound in lending. “People are wondering what is going to be the upside if there is no recovery.”The market tumbled in afternoon trading after the Labor Department said that initial claims for unemployment insurance rose last week to a seasonally adjusted half a million people, the first time since November that they had reached that level.The jobless claims climbed by 12,000, to 500,000, from the previous week. Wall Street analysts had expected the seasonally adjusted claims to drop.Earlier this month, the Labor Department said that the nation lost 131,000 jobs in July, and that June was far weaker than previously indicated. While private employers added 71,000 jobs, those additions were dwarfed by the 143,000 census workers whose temporary jobs ended.The unemployment rate remained at 9.5 percent in July, mostly because of people giving up the search for work and no longer receiving unemployment benefits. Over all, the economy has lost more than eight million jobs during the recession.“The whole lack of improvement and further rise in claims coincides with the concerns about production and growth in the economy,” Steven C. Wieting, an economist for Citigroup, said.Also on Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s monthly index showed that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic states shrank this month. The index fell to minus 7.7 points in August — its lowest level since July 2009 — from 5.1 points last month.Manufacturing was an underlying theme of the jobless data and the Fed report, Mr. Roberts said, suggesting to investors that “maybe private enterprise really isn’t taking over, and the government stimulus is as good as it gets.”The reports were the latest to highlight the challenges to the manufacturing sector, which appears to have stopped rebuilding its inventories.“It is not a surge anymore,” said Daniel J. Meckstroth, the chief economist for Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. “We had a surge in the third and fourth quarters because there was an inventory swing going on.”Several states were hit particularly hard by the rise in initial weekly unemployment claims. California showed an increase of 4,393 claims because of layoffs in the service industry. Indiana showed a rise of 1,999 because automotive and manufacturing workers were let go. Texas, Illinois, Florida and Georgia were also stung by cuts in manufacturing jobs.Mr. Meckstroth said there were job declines in furniture, apparel, chemicals and electronics. But in other industries, employment rose 1.4 percent since the beginning of the year until mid-July, compared with a rise of less than 1 percent across the economy, he said.The disappointing economic reports matched other data that has shown weak consumer confidence. Some analysts expect second-quarter economic growth to be revised down to 1 to 1.5 percent, from an initial estimate of 2.4 percent.The computer maker Dell, considered a bellwether for consumer and corporate spending, said after the market closed Thursday that its net income improved 16 percent in the last quarter, but it saw weakening demand for personal computers. Dell shares closed down 15 cents, to $12.04.Bank shares declined despite the First Niagara Financial Group’s announcement that it had agreed to buy NewAlliance Bancshares of Connecticut for about $1.5 billion in stock and cash, the first bank deal to commence without government help in many months. First Niagara finished the day off 83 cents, at $11.95. NewAlliance rose $1.42, to $12.78.Also on Thursday, the chip maker Intel said it was acquiring McAfee, a maker of antivirus software, in a deal valued at $7.68 billion, a 60 percent premium over McAfee’s closing price on Wednesday.Shares of McAfee ended the day up $17.08, to $47.01, on Thursday. Intel was down 69 cents, to $18.90.Bond prices rose as yields dropped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.58 percent, from 2.63 percent Wednesday.“The uptick in jobless claims which was fairly severe and the amount of receiving in interest swaps ended most of the overnight sell-off in the bond market,” said Tom di Galoma, head of United States rates trading at Guggenheim Securities.The Conference Board said its index of leading economic figures rose 0.1 percent last month to 109.8. That was a reversal from a 0.3 percent drop in June, and a 0.5 percent increase in May.Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a gain of 0.2 percent.'"

"'10-08-21,'0','He ignited an explosive response in 1998 when he said in a radio interview that Hispanics were on the way to taking over all of California’s political institutions. He suggested that people who did not like it go back to Europe.In the face of criticism that Hispanics have lagged behind blacks in creating political and civil rights institutions, he created and led many. These included the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Hispanic National Bar Association, the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project and the National Coalition of Hispanic Organizations.He was president of the League of United Latin American Citizens and chairman of the National Rainbow Coalition, the leftist political organization that grew out of Mr. Jackson’s 1984 presidential campaign.Mario Guerra Obledo was born in San Antonio on April 9, 1932, and grew up in a tiny house on an alley off a dirt street. His father died when he was 5, and he and his 12 brothers and sisters had to hustle to find chores to help supplement welfare to pay the $5-a-month rent and other expenses.His mother hammered into him the importance of education, telling him that “teachers are second to God.” The pharmacist he started working for at 12 urged him to go to college. His four brothers were convicted of crimes like burglary, robbery and narcotics, but he himself was never jailed, he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1982.“I was involved in everything, I guess, that everyone else was,” he said. “I just never happened to get caught in a serious situation that would embitter me to the point where I would continue in that pattern.”Mr. Obledo entered the University of Texas at Austin in 1949, then interrupted his studies to enlist in the Navy in 1951. He specialized in radar technology and was on a ship during the Korean War. He returned to the university and graduated with a degree in pharmacy. He worked as a pharmacist while earning a law degree from St. Mary’s University in San Antonio.One day, another young lawyer, Pete Tijerina, spotted Mr. Obledo dancing with his wife at a dinner for the League of United Latin American Citizens. Mr. Tijerina was pondering how to start a legal organization to fight for the rights of Hispanics.“I need a guy like him,” Mr. Tijerina recalled thinking in an interview with The San Antonio Express-News in 2001.The two war men founded the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund with $2.2 million from the Ford Foundation and guidance from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.They had no trouble finding injustices. They filed a suit saying a utility discriminated against Hispanic job candidates by having a height requirement, and they won. They forced schools to desegregate, courts to reform jury selection, swimming pools to integrate and businesses to take down signs barring Mexicans from entering.“Discrimination was so widespread, I claimed that filing a lawsuit was like picking apples off a tree,” Mr. Obledo told The Express-News.He joined the Harvard Law School faculty as a teaching fellow for eight months in 1975. Then Governor Brown of California named him secretary of health and welfare. He held the post for seven years, and sharply increased the number of minorities working in the agency. After losing badly in his bid for California’s Democratic nomination for governor, he practiced law, consulted and kept a generally low profile.Mr. Obledo is survived by his wife, nine brothers and sisters and three children by his first wife, the former Mary Robles: two daughters, Sylvia Obledo and Sybil Obledo; a son, Mario Obledo Jr.; and four granddaughters.Saying he was alarmed at what he saw as rising anti-Hispanic sentiment in immigration and education, he re-emerged in the late 1990s to take on issues as diverse as the exclusion of a Latino float from a Fourth of July parade and cutbacks in bilingual education — not to mention that Taco Bell Chihuahua.Mr. Obledo’s arguments were far from simplistic. In 1987, he wrote a letter to The Los Angeles Times protesting proposals to raise excise taxes on gasoline, liquor and cigarettes. He said such taxes disproportionately harmed the poor, because their incomes were smaller and the taxes were the same for everyone.He accepted The Times’s editorial argument that such taxes would help limit consumption and that this was good. But he then zeroed in for the kill: “Is it our government’s intention to deny these everyday items only to the poor?”'"
"'10-08-21,'0','President Viktor F. Yanukovich said on Friday that he was taking “personal control” over the search for a missing investigative reporter, whose disappearance over a week ago has prompted colleagues and rights groups to raise concerns about the possibility of foul play. Mr. Yanukovich called on law enforcement agencies across Ukraine to do everything “possible and impossible” to find the journalist, Vasyl Klymentyev, the editor of a newspaper in the eastern city of Kharkiv, a statement on the president’s Web site said. Press freedom advocates have complained about media censorship since Mr. Yanukovich took office in February.'"
"'10-08-21,'0','The competition, sponsored by a private foundation that includes citizens, politicians and Park Service employees, spotlights several common remedies. Each design proposes placing a “lid” over Interstate 70, whereas today’s visitors must traverse 10 lanes of traffic to reach the Arch from downtown.The designs would also enhance the east side of the river — a derelict patch of overgrown levee whose defining feature is a grain elevator — by connecting it to the Arch grounds via a network of foot and bike trails. In one of the more fanciful visions, a gondola crosses the river, delivering visitors to an outdoor amphitheater that overlooks a floating stage. Other visions offer up a prairie forest or a beer garden that doubles as an ice rink in the winter. The designs are currently on view at the Arch, and a winner will be announced on Sept. 24.Many view redesigning the Arch grounds as a crucial step to revitalizing St. Louis, which, like many other Midwestern cities, has seen its fortunes decline as manufacturing jobs have moved overseas. The city has suffered major population losses — roughly 500,000 people over the half-century — and entire neighborhoods were razed in the middle of the last century to accommodate highways.In recent years, however, several neighborhoods have begun to show signs of renewed life. Downtown St. Louis is now home to thousands of lofts. It has a small entertainment district, and in the past year the downtown has added a sculpture park and its first new grocery store.Nevertheless, the Arch grounds present a sort of Gordian knot of urban design: Girdled by depressed highways and busy surface roads, the park is bounded to the east by the Mississippi, which is prone to flooding. While the Arch, at 630 feet high, may offer sweeping views of the surrounding city and farmland, there are no amenities or restaurants on the grounds and little to encourage repeat visits.To further complicate matters, the original design of the Arch grounds by Dan Kiley is a national historic landmark, meaning the teams are limited in how much they can alter the character of the park. “There’s a complexity that can’t be solved by a single silver bullet,” said the competition manager, Don Stastny. “There have been efforts in the past, but they’ve been very incremental. This is a much more global look at things.”Some observers seem less impressed. In a letter to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Ralph Tharp called connecting downtown to the Arch grounds “the most ‘no duh’ idea ever conjured up by us local hayseed professionals.” He added, “Missouri backwater designers and planners should be prideful that our counterparts in more sophisticated areas of the world agree with our findings from 20 years ago.”The design challenge may be rivaled by the difficulties in raising money. While Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, expressed confidence Friday that her Congressional colleagues would view her state’s project as a “priority,” some competition organizers were more skeptical.“I still have to sell this to the National Park Service, which is looking at projects from 400 parks around the country,” said Tom Bradley, superintendent for the Arch. “Let’s face facts: The whole line-item construction for the whole National Park Service is probably $100 million for next year. So we have to be realistic.”Walter Metcalfe Jr., an area lawyer and member of the foundation CityArchRiver 2015, said that large parts of the park and the highway system were antiquated and in dire need of federal money for repair.“A lot of costs are going to have to be incurred by the National Park Service on this park,” Mr. Metcalfe said, “whether they subscribe to a new design or whether they just bring it up do date.”'"
"'10-08-21,'0','Evan F. Kohlmann, who tracks militant Web sites at the security consulting firm Flashpoint Global Partners, said supporters of Al Qaeda have seized on the controversy “with glee.” On radical Web forums, he said, the dispute over the Islamic center, which would include space for worship, is lumped together with fringe developments like a Florida pastor’s call for making Sept. 11 “Burn a Koran Day.”“It’s seen as proof of what Awlaki and others have been saying, that the U.S. is hypocritical and that most Americans are enemies of Islam,” Mr. Kohlmann said. He called the anti-Islam statements spawned by the dispute “disturbing and sad” and said they were feeding anti-American sentiment that could provoke violence.While some critics of the Islamic center have carefully limited their objection to its proximity to the site of the Sept. 11 attacks, and have rejected any suggestion that they are anti-Muslim, the issue has tapped into a well of suspicion and hostility to Islam across the country.Many Republican politicians, including Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin, have said that the proposed location of the center showed insensitivity to the victims of 9/11.Others political leaders, including President Obama, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Gov. Christopher J. Christie of New Jersey, have defended the right of Muslims to build the center or warned against anti-Muslim hysteria.The dispute has tapped strong emotions in the wake of a series of terrorist plots and attacks over the last year aimed at American targets, several of them inspired or encouraged by Mr. Awlaki. The events included the killing of 13 people in November at Fort Hood, Tex., by an Army psychiatrist, Nidal Malik Hasan; the failed attack on a Detroit-bound airliner on Dec. 25 by a young Nigerian man; and the attempted bombing of Times Square in May by Faisal Shahzad, a financial analyst who had worked for a Connecticut cosmetics company.Mr. Awlaki, whose Web diatribes calling for attacks on the United States have turned up repeatedly in terrorism investigations, has sought to counter the notion that American tolerance extends to Muslims.In a March posting, Mr. Awlaki, who lived in the United States for nearly 20 years, predicted that America would become “a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps.”“Don’t be deceived by the promises of preserving your rights from a government that is right now killing your own brothers and sisters,” he wrote. “Today, with the war between Muslims and the West escalating, you cannot count on the message of solidarity you may get from a civic group or a political party, or the word of support you hear from a kind neighbor or a nice co-worker. The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens!”Dalia Mogahed of the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies said the outcry over the proposed center “plays into Awlaki’s arguments and Osama bin Laden’s arguments” by suggesting that Islam has no place in the United States.She said that extreme anti-Muslim views in the United States ironically mirror a central tenet of extreme Islamists: “That the world is divided into two camps, and they’re irreconcilable, and Muslims have to choose which side they’re on.”Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker and a potential 2012 presidential candidate, said in a Fox News interview that “Nazis don’t have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust museum in Washington,” a comment that drew criticism for appearing to equate those proposing the Islamic center with Nazis.Asked about the view that such remarks could fuel radicalism, Mr. Gingrich sent an e-mail response on Friday that did not directly address his critics but said that “Americans must learn to tell the truth about radical Islamists while being supportive of and inclusive of moderate Muslims who live in the modern world, respect women’s rights, reject medieval punishment and defend American laws and the American Constitution.” He added that he believed “it is possible to be a deeply religious Muslim and a patriotic American.”Muqtedar Khan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Delaware, said he was not sure the Islamic center dispute alone would radicalize anyone. But he said it was “demoralizing” for Muslims like him who defend the United States as an open and tolerant society.“For the first time, anti-Islamic rhetoric has gone mainstream,” he said. “What this really does is weaken the moderates and undermine their credibility.”'"
"'10-08-21,'0','But they are bringing with them a series of keen challenges, including heightened tensions with Lebanon over the boundaries of the gas fields, fears of rocket attacks, a citizens’ revolt over the location of processing plants, an ugly battle over government royalties, and concerns that Israel could blow its windfall and turn into a nation of single-resource slackers.“Everyone is dreaming about a golden calf,” lamented Brenda Shaffer, an energy policy specialist who teaches political science at the University of Haifa. “We should be thinking about reducing pollution, establishing energy security and reordering our priorities. Our coalition system leads to a very politicized allocation of money. Unfortunately, more money won’t mean it will be spent differently.”The costs and potential profits of the gas discoveries are a matter of speculation. The new fields are in theory worth tens of billions of dollars. But Israel uses more coal than gas for its electricity now, and shifting the balance toward gas will involve tough political fights with industry lobbies and trade unions.The tensions with Lebanon — Israel’s neighbor to the north with which it remains technically at war — stem from Lebanon’s hope that some of the gas falls in its waters as well the patina of mistrust that hovers over the relationship.Worried by Israel’s plans, the Lebanese Parliament this week passed a law to auction undersea energy exploration rights in 2012 and to draw its own maritime borders.“Lebanon fears that Israel, based on its history of occupying our lands and stealing our water, will drill in Lebanon’s waters and steal its natural resources,” Ali Hamdan, an aide to the Parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, said in a telephone interview. “Lebanon strongly warns Israel from drilling its natural gas. It will not tolerate violations of its sovereignty.”Israeli authorities say the fields lie within their own economic territory as defined by international maritime law. Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau said in June that if Lebanon tried to interfere with Israeli drilling, his country would not hesitate to use force.An American official involved in the issue said the Israel-Lebanon land border had not been fully drawn and until it was, the maritime border would remain in potential dispute. A mile one way or the other on the land border could make a big difference in drilling rights.But the tension with Lebanon is not limited to the border contours. There is also a deep concern here that the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah, which opposes Israel’s existence and gets money and weapons from Iran, could shoot missiles at a processing plant, causing enormous damage. Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006, and Hezbollah is thought to have tens of thousands of new missiles.Israel may therefore install antimissile systems like Iron Dome, still in development, on sea platforms and around any plants. That is one of the reasons that system’s development has been pursued so vigorously.Residents of the northern coast of Israel, after months of protests over environmental and security risks, have delayed the building of a plant. For now, gas taken from the new fields will be piped down to the southern city of Ashdod.For the past few years, Israel has bought gas piped from Egypt as well as Israeli gas from the seabed off Ashdod. The latter field is being mined in a joint venture by Texas-based Noble Energy and Delek Energy of Israel. That source is expected to run dry in 2012, which is when one of the large northern fields, Tamar, is expected to come on line. The field that was detected later, dubbed Leviathan, which still needs to be drill tested, is in the same area and, if confirmed, would begin to yield gas around 2015.If Israel could replace most of its coal-based electricity with gas in the coming years, that would lead to cleaner air and the potential for development of things like gas-powered public transportation and electric cars.One of the most emotional fights related to the gas find concerns royalties and taxes the government ought to be taking. Israel’s energy royalty laws date from 1952 and some economists here say they bring in a lower percentage of revenue than similar laws do in most other countries, including the United States and Canada. Others dispute this. A government appointed committee is considering recommending a tax increase on the drilling and distribution, a move the energy companies say would amount to an illegal, retroactive step.Opponents of a tax increase have mounted a campaign saying it would drive the price of gas so high that the electrical company would buy Egyptian over Israeli gas and companies like Noble would suffer and leave.The campaign is led by a group called The Land of Israel Forum, which has declined to identify the source of its money.Professor Shaffer of the University of Haifa said that the gas find, if handled right, could make a real difference for Israel’s economy. But the idea that it would alter the country’s international position or diplomatic standing may be overblown.“Qatar is the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas in the world and it has not turned into a major power,” Professor Shaffer noted. “Having oil and gas doesn’t solve your problems.”'"
"'10-08-21,'0','Last July, after ethnic bloodletting in the far western region of Xinjiang killed 197 people, the governor appeared on television to accuse Rebiya Kadeer, the exiled Uighur leader, of inciting the violence, much of which involved Uighur mobs bludgeoning Han Chinese migrants in Urumqi, the regional capital. Then he parceled out some of the blame to Mr. Tohti’s Web site, Uighurbiz.net, a lively forum for debate — and a platform for rumormongering, according to the government — before it was blocked by the censors.The next day, security agents from Beijing took him on what he said they called a “vacation” for three weeks, interrogating him for long periods and warning him to stop publicly criticizing the government’s policies and practices in Xinjiang. The agents later decamped to his living room, although Mr. Tohti declined to describe the experience for fear he might incur their wrath. “Sometimes they were nice to me, but other times they said, ‘We can crush you like an ant,’ ” he said.It is not clear why they have not crushed him yet. Since the unrest of last summer, the authorities have had little compunction about detaining scores of Uighurs whose whereabouts remain a mystery. In recent weeks, several have been given long prison terms, including three Web masters and a journalist who were convicted for endangering the Chinese state. The longest sentence, 15 years, was handed down to Gheyret Niyaz, a 51-year-old writer who worked for Mr. Tohti’s Web site. Prosecutors say Mr. Niyaz’ greatest crime was speaking to a magazine in Hong Kong.His fate has weighed heavily on Mr. Tohti and increased his already perilous levels of garrulousness. “They say I’m hyping up his case and that I have to stop talking to the media, but I just can’t help myself,” he said, adding another cigarette butt to an overflowing ashtray.As one of the few prominent Uighur intellectuals living in China, Mr. Tohti said he felt he had no choice but to speak out against the discrimination and economic inequality he says fuel Uighur resentment, some of which ends up directed at the Han migrants who have been encouraged to move west by the millions. According to the most recent census in 2000, the Han make up 40 percent of Xinjiang’s population, up from less than 5 percent when the Communist Party took power in 1949.Although the central government recently pledged to invest billions of dollars in Xinjiang, Mr. Tohti says no amount of money can assuage the widespread feeling that the culture and language of the region’s 10 million Uighurs are increasingly threatened by assimilation. It does not help that most government positions and jobs in Xinjiang’s booming oil and gas industries go to the Han.HE also has harsh words for China’s leaders, who he says pay lip service to the autonomy promised by Chinese law. “I am worried that many of my people might be driven to extremism,” he said.Such extremism may have been behind an explosion this week that killed seven people in Aksu, a predominantly Uighur city not far from Mr. Tohti’s hometown.Mr. Tohti knows his frank words have had unintended consequences for those closest to him. His first marriage ended in divorce after his wife, spooked by sirens and jolted by every knock at the door, returned to Xinjiang with their young son. Last year his second wife also fled Beijing, and later she gave birth to their second child.He admits that the stroke that nearly killed his mother recently may have been brought on by her anxiety over his safety. “She said she would have never allowed me to go to school if she knew I would turn out like this,” he said.He has more than a dozen relatives in Xinjiang who work in public security, including two brothers who have made repeated trips to Beijing in an effort to persuade Mr. Tohti to tone down his rhetoric, and perhaps ease the pressure from their own superiors.It is not entirely clear whether his prominence has so far saved him from a worse fate. Wang Lixiong, a well-known writer who studies Xinjiang, said that fame rarely saves high-profile dissidents.“It could just be that different powers and interests within the government are divided over what to do about him,” Mr. Wang said. “But at some point, a higher authority might decide to step in and do something.”BORN in Atush, an ancient outpost on the northern branch of the Silk Road, Mr. Tohti says he was a diligent, if slightly distracted, student. His father, educated at Beijing Normal University, died when Mr. Tohti was 2 under circumstances he still does not understand. “I’m afraid to ask my mother, because the subject is too painful for the both of us,” he said.In the sixth grade, he became acutely aware that the Uighurs and the Han in Atush lived differently. It was the summer of 1980, when a crowd of Uighur children tried to force their way into a movie theater reserved for Han. During a scuffle with Chinese soldiers, a Uighur boy was grievously injured and in the melee that followed, Mr. Tohti joined a rampaging mob that smashed every light bulb and window in sight.Why light bulbs and windows? “Because these are things the Han had; we lived in primitive dwellings,” he recalled. “I think that’s when many Uighurs opened their eyes and saw what was happening around them.”For now, he still has his teaching job at Minzu University of China, where his classes are a popular draw among Uighur students. Not surprisingly, his lectures tend to be fiery. They have also become popular keepsakes, recorded and surreptitiously passed among Uighurs around the country.Students are not the only ones interested in his talks. Not long ago he noticed a surveillance camera mounted in the ceiling of his classroom. Soon afterward, he realized that even when he changed rooms, the cameras followed him. “A coincidence perhaps,” he said with a grin.Mr. Tohti could probably leave the country and become a Uighur exile, but he refuses to entertain the thought. Only by staying in China, he said, can he help Mr. Niyaz and other jailed Uighurs. He also feels an obligation to his students, many of whom are still unemployed years after graduation. “As a teacher, I feel like I have failed them,” he said.Then his mood grew even darker.“If things here don’t change as quickly as I’d like, sooner or later I will be doomed,” he said. “Perhaps I will be sent to hell, but I don’t care because in some ways I am already there.”'"
"'10-08-21,'0','He could probably dine out for months on Mel Gibson stories. But the cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, who earned two of his five Oscar nominations for shooting “The Patriot” and “The Passion of the Christ” (one starring Mr. Gibson, the other directed by him), instead is spending his filmmaking downtime with the New York International Fringe Festival.The recipient this year of a lifetime achievement award from the American Society of Cinematographers, Mr. Deschanel, 65, has directed features, television, documentaries and commercials. But the one-person play “Burning in China” is his first job directing for the stage.“I don’t have enough things to terrify me, so I decided to get involved in this play,” he said in an interview at the TriBeCa Grand Hotel a few days before his Fringe bow. “But it’s more personal than that, because Gary Moore, who wrote it, is someone I’ve known since college at Johns Hopkins. He was editor of the newspaper, and then I was the editor the year after that.”The show, which has three remaining Fringe performances from Thursday through next Saturday at the Fourth Street Theater in the East Village, chronicles the experience of Mr. Moore, played by Jeff LeBeau, teaching Chinese students in Shanghai in 1988 and 1989 amid the rumblings of national unrest that led to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. The breakthrough in his struggle to open a dialogue with his buttoned-up students came with the New Year’s Eve staging of a bilingual rap opera, “The Great Emancipator Meets the Monkey King.”“The play goes deep into the desire for freedom and expression, which is both political and cultural,” Mr. Deschanel said. “The Chinese are brought up to believe that you should be silent in class. The teacher speaks, and you just listen and absorb what they say. It’s not the process that we’re used to in school, where you have a lot of interaction with your teachers.”“It’s a strange evolution of Gary going from these frustrating relationships with the students to finally bringing them out, putting on the play and introducing them to music,” he continued. “He gets to the point where they have this wonderful relationship, and then the classes are shut down by the uprisings.”'"
"'10-08-21,'0','Andy Roddick, the 2003 Open men’s champion, was surprised that Williams, the winner of 13 Grand Slam singles titles, withdrew more than a week before the tournament.“The U.S. Open is probably her favorite event, so if she’s this far out and is not going to play, it’s got to be something pretty serious,” Roddick said at a men’s tournament in Mason, Ohio.The absence of Williams, a fan favorite on and off the court in New York who is frequently scheduled to play in prime time, will open the tournament to a broader group of contenders.Among those whose chances of winning increased was Venus Williams, Serena’s older sister, who has not won a Grand Slam event other than Wimbledon since the 2001 United States Open. But she is ailing, too, having pulled out of tournaments in Mason and Montreal to treat a nagging knee injury.Injuries may be a recurring theme for the women. On Friday in Montreal, Clijsters hobbled through a third set with a hip injury and lost to Vera Zvonareva. She will have a magnetic resonance imaging test in New Jersey and expects to play at the Open.“We regret that Serena Williams is unable to play the U.S. Open and wish her a speedy recovery,” the tournament director, Jim Curley, said in a statement.The lasting image from last year may be Williams’s verbal assault of a line judge near the end of her taut match with Clijsters. Serving late in the match, Williams was called for a foot fault. Angered, she turned and stepped toward the female judge, held up a ball and, with profanity, said she would shove it down her throat.The episode cost Williams a code violation on what would have been match point, so the match ended without another ball put in play. Clijsters won, 6-4, 7-5, then beat Caroline Wozniacki in the final.In late November, Williams was fined a record $82,500 by the Grand Slam committee and warned that she would be suspended from the tournament if she had other major offenses at a Grand Slam event in 2010 or 2011. She eventually apologized for her “inappropriate outburst” on her Web site and Twitter page. There were no online pronouncements from Williams until late Friday.“I’m devastated to not be participating” in the Open, she wrote. “Grand slams are my life. My soul. ... I will miss it more than u can ever imagine.”'"
"'10-08-21,'0','Women choose a form of contraception for any number of reasons: reliability, convenience, familiarity. While the pill is the most frequent choice, it is not always the most appropriate. Pills are relatively inexpensive month-to-month, but a method with heftier upfront costs may be a better buy in the long run.“An unplanned pregnancy is emotionally and financially expensive,” said Dr. Steven J. Sondheimer, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania who directs its family planning program.Ms. Fowler, a technology security analyst at the University of Missouri, decided to try something more suited to her life and kinder to her pocketbook: a small, T-shaped intrauterine device, or I.U.D., that slowly releases the hormone progestin, which prevents pregnancy in part by altering the uterine lining. Ms. Fowler paid $100 in outpatient surgery charges for the insertion; her insurance covered the roughly $700 cost of the device.Even if she had had to pay the full cost herself, the I.U.D. — which prevents pregnancy for five years — would still be more cost-effective than birth control pills, which typically cost $15 to $50 a month. And of course there is no forgetting with an I.U.D.For women who realize the time has come to re-evaluate their birth control strategy, there are many methods to choose from: I.U.D.’s, hormonal implants, shots, the “patch” and the vaginal ring, to name a few. Here are some factors to consider.LONG-TERM OPTIONS If you have a hectic job or small children, or are caring for elderly parents, the pill may not be the best method for you, said Dr. Vanessa Cullins, vice president for medical affairs for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.The I.U.D. is the gold standard for the attention-challenged, Dr. Cullins said, as it remains effective for up to 12 years. On a dollar-for-dollar basis, it is also clearly the most cost-effective method, unless you plan to stop birth control altogether in the near future.Similar options include hormonal methods like the Ortho Evra Patch, which is replaced once a week; the NuvaRing vaginal ring, which remains in place for three weeks; the Depo-Provera shot, which contains pregnancy-preventing hormones effective for three months; and Implanon hormonal implants.Planned Parenthood offers an interactive tool on its Web site that helps women sort through the expanding array of contraceptive options.INSURANCE COVERAGE While most insurance plans include contraceptive services and supplies, they may not cover all possibilities.Twenty-seven states require health insurance plans that cover prescription drugs to cover the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The plans may not, however, cover every type of device or drug, experts caution. Some plans cover only generic birth control pills, for example, not brand-name pills.Since coverage varies widely, you will need to inquire about specific options you are considering. Your policy may cover the doctor’s visit, for instance, for a Depo-Provera shot or to insert Implanon hormonal implants and I.U.D.’s — but not the shot or the device itself.More than half of America’s employees work for companies with self-financed plans, which pay employees’ health claims directly. Those plans are not bound by the state coverage requirements. Small-business and individual policies also tend to provide less comprehensive contraceptive coverage, experts note.Whatever the type of plan, co-payments and co-insurance charges can be steep, sometimes discouraging women from picking the method that best suits them.High-deductible plans can pose a particular challenge. They may not cover any birth control costs at all until patients meet a deductible of $1,000 or more.Those out-of-pocket costs can be a serious barrier to women considering other options. A study of patients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California published in 2007 found that when co-payments totaling hundreds of dollars per patient were eliminated for longer-acting methods like I.U.D.’s and implants, their use increased sharply.The new health care law may help women faced with high out-of-pocket costs. The law requires new health plans to provide certain preventive benefits with no cost-sharing, and family-planning advocates are pushing for birth control to be included among them. Federal regulations are expected within a year.AN EXPERIENCED PROVIDER The options presented by your doctor may not include the best choices for you. Some physicians’ practices are not very familiar with longer-acting, more expensive methods like I.U.D.’s, implants and shots, or do not stock them.“If you’re not getting requests for I.U.D.’s, it can be expensive to keep it on the shelves,” said Adam Sonfield, a senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute. “For small practices, that can be a big deal.”If your doctor has limited experience with the range of options, visit a larger practice or a family-planning clinic, where they are more likely to offer the full range of F.D.A.-approved products.Family-planning clinics like Planned Parenthood are a good choice, too, particularly if you are unemployed or do not have insurance, as are state and county health departments and some university clinics, said Laura Hessburg, senior health policy adviser at the National Partnership for Women and Families. These facilities serve all comers, and fees are generally based on a sliding scale for limited-income women.TRIAL AND ERROR Many women like the pill and other hormonal methods for reasons unrelated to preventing pregnancy: to regulate their periods, for example, or to reduce heavy menstrual flow.While most women can use most F.D.A.-approved methods, experts say, it may take some trial and error to find a method that minimizes side effects.For Whitney Hauser, 45, from Plymouth, Minn., birth control pills set off migraines. Switching to an I.U.D. three years ago solved the problem.“I love it,” she said. “I don’t have to think about it anymore.”'"
"'10-08-21,'0','“Before this went up, we were told we couldn’t come up here, because it wasn’t stable enough for human weight,” said Meg Gibson, a longtime tenant, as she surveyed the building’s factorylike rooftop on a recent sunlit day.The rooftop, painted silver, was crisscrossed with snakelike metal coverings, protecting transmission cables. The rectangular cellphone antennas stood sentinel along the edges. Two raised metal platforms, resembling miniature oil rigs, filled a quarter of the rooftop, supporting the cabinetlike base stations that receive and send calls.The tenants did not mind much when the first base station, which belongs to T-Mobile, went up in 2006, but grew concerned when the second one, owned by AT&T, was installed last fall.Ms. Gibson said her roof had a “chronic problem” of disrepair, and alerted the city to her concerns. The Buildings Department issued a notice of violation to the landlord, Shahram Mobasser, for failing to maintain the buildings’ walls, and, in a report, noted four large cracks beneath the base station’s support beams, though a city engineer concluded that it was hard to determine the cause of the cracks.The Buildings Department approved the landlord’s application to erect the AT&T base station last summer, after determining, a spokeswoman said, that the plans complied with the building code. Sarita S. Marbella, the architect who signed off on the work last February, would not comment on the tenants’ complaints, citing a confidentiality clause with AT&T.The tenants are suing the landlord for allowing the stations to be installed. But industry experts said it was highly unlikely that the base stations were causing the structural harm that the tenants claim. Roger Entner, a wireless industry analyst with Nielsen, said the cellphone antennas were relatively light and the base stations not unduly heavy.“The base station only weighs a couple of hundred pounds — it’s like three fat men,” he said. “If that is cracking the stuff, the building has way bigger problems.”Steve Kazella, a managing partner of AirWave Management, a company in Chester, N.J., that consults for landlords negotiating with wireless carriers or their cell-site partners, said buildings probably faced a bigger threat from the weight of their air-conditioning units, and yet people tended not to complain about those.The number of cell transmission sites has grown rapidly in recent years. Last December, there were about 250,000 such hubs, up from 183,000 in December 2005, according to the CTIA-The Wireless Association, an industry trade group. The demand has created an opportunity for property owners, who can lease residential and commercial sites and even church rooftops to wireless companies, typically for $1,000 to $3,500 a month, Mr. Kazella said.It is unclear how much Mr. Mobasser, who owns 165 Pinehurst Avenue, earns from his roof’s base stations, or whether he plans to address the violation; he did not return phone calls seeking comment.Yet representatives from T-Mobile and AT&T said they were exacting in installing such equipment safely, with the approval of structural engineers and in accordance with building codes. Typically, they said, cellphone companies send crews to areas needing coverage, who in turn identify feasible sites and approach property owners with offers. By law, the ultimate responsibility of the building’s maintenance falls with the property owner, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department said.Ms. Gibson and a neighbor, Carol Dunn, said they measured radio emission levels in their apartments, and found them to easily exceed federal limits. They began worrying, too, that they were being bombarded by radio waves that they believed might cause cancer, though research on the subject has been inconclusive.But they avoided adding that claim to their lawsuit, because doing so would have made theirs a federal case: cell tower emissions are covered by the Federal Communications Commission. T-Mobile and AT&T, for their part, said their emissions complied with the F.C.C. guidelines, and cited government findings that such radio waves did not pose health threats.Mr. Kazella said the tensions between tenants and landlords like Mr. Mobasser would probably persist, given that wireless companies were scrambling to find more cell sites to accommodate the new generation of phones, like iPhones, used not just for talking but also for heavy data transmission.“If you get AT&T on your roof, you’re in iPhone heaven,” he said. “It can really improve your quality of life.”'"
"'10-08-22,'0','Juan Martín del Potro, the defending champion at the United States Open, withdrew from the tournament Saturday, saying he “cannot compete at the top level yet” after having surgery on his right wrist in May.He is the third men’s champion at the United States Open not to defend his title in the 42-year Open era. His announcement came a day after Serena Williams became the first No. 1 in the 35-year history of the women’s rankings to miss the Open. She is recovering from surgery for cuts on her right foot.The 6-foot-6 del Potro has not played on tour since the Australian Open in January because of an injury to his racket-swinging wrist. Del Potro, a 21-year-old Argentine, had surgery in May, then recently began training in hopes of playing at Flushing Meadows, where he won his first major title a year ago by upsetting Rafael Nadal in the semifinals and Roger Federer in the final.In a statement released by the ATP on Saturday, del Potro said he was “extremely sad” about pulling out of the Open, which starts Aug. 30.“But I have only started practicing in the last two weeks, and unfortunately, I cannot compete at the top level yet,” he said.'"

"'10-08-22,'0','So is the timing. After past recessions, ordinary investors have typically regained their enthusiasm for stocks, hoping to profit as the economy recovered. This time, even as corporate earnings have improved, Americans have become more guarded with their investments.“At this stage in the economic cycle, $10 to $20 billion would normally be flowing into domestic equity funds” rather than the billions that are flowing out, said Brian K. Reid, chief economist of the investment institute. He added, “This is very unusual.”The notion that stocks tend to be safe and profitable investments over time seems to have been dented in much the same way that a decline in home values and in job stability the last few years has altered Americans’ sense of financial security.It may take many years before it is clear whether this becomes a long-term shift in psychology. After technology and dot-com shares crashed in the early 2000s, for example, investors were quick to re-enter the stock market. Yet bigger economic calamities like the Great Depression affected people’s attitudes toward money for decades.For now, though, mixed economic data is presenting a picture of an economy that is recovering feebly from recession.“For a lot of ordinary people, the economic recovery does not feel real,” said Loren Fox, a senior analyst at Strategic Insight, a New York research and data firm. “People are not going to rush toward the stock market on a sustained basis until they feel more confident of employment growth and the sustainability of the economic recovery.”One investor who has restructured his portfolio is Gary Olsen, 51, from Dallas. Over the past four years, he has adjusted the proportion of his investments from 65 percent equities and 35 percent bonds so that the $1.1 million he has invested is now evenly balanced.He had worked as a portfolio liquidity manager for the local Federal Home Loan Bank and retired four years ago.“Like everyone, I lost” during the recent market declines, he said. “I needed to have a more conservative allocation.”To be sure, a lot of money is still flowing into the stock market from small investors, pension funds and other big institutional investors. But ordinary investors are reallocating their 401(k) retirement plans, according to Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm that tracks pension plans.Until two years ago, 70 percent of the money in 401(k) accounts it tracks was invested in stock funds; that proportion fell to 49 percent by the start of 2009 as people rebalanced their portfolios toward bond investments following the financial crisis in the fall of 2008. It is now back at 57 percent, but almost all of that can be attributed to the rising price of stocks in recent years. People are still staying with bonds.Another force at work is the aging of the baby-boomer generation. As they approach retirement, Americans are shifting some of their investments away from stocks to provide regular guaranteed income for the years when they are no longer working.And the flight from stocks may also be driven by households that are no longer able to tap into home equity for cash and may simply need the money to pay for ordinary expenses.On Friday, Fidelity Investments reported that a record number of people took so-called hardship withdrawals from their retirement accounts in the second quarter. These are early withdrawals intended to pay for needs like medical expenses.According to the Investment Company Institute, which surveys 4,000 households annually, the appetite for stock market risk among American investors of all ages has been declining steadily since it peaked around 2001, and the change is most pronounced in the under-35 age group.For a few months at the start of this year, things were looking up for stock market investing. Optimistic about growth, investors were again putting their money into stocks. In March and April, when the stock market rose 8 percent, $8.1 billion flowed into domestic stock mutual funds.But then came a grim reassessment of America’s economic prospects as unemployment remained stubbornly high and private sector job growth refused to take off.Investors’ nerves were also frayed by the “flash crash” on May 6, when the Dow Jones industrial index fell 600 points in a matter of minutes. The authorities still do not know why.Investors pulled $19.1 billion from domestic equity funds in May, the largest outflow since the height of the financial crisis in October 2008.Over all, investors pulled $151.4 billion out of stock market mutual funds in 2008. But at that time the market was tanking in shocking fashion. The surprise this time around is that Americans are withdrawing money even when share prices are rallying.The stock market rose 7 percent last month as corporate profits began rebounding, but even that increase was not enough to tempt ordinary investors. Instead, they withdrew $14.67 billion from domestic stock market mutual funds in July, according to the investment institute’s estimates, the third straight month of withdrawals.A big beneficiary has been bond funds, which offer regular fixed interest payments.As investors pulled billions out of stocks, they plowed $185.31 billion into bond mutual funds in the first seven months of this year, and total bond fund investments for the year are on track to approach the record set in 2009.Charles Biderman, chief executive of TrimTabs, a funds researcher, said it was no wonder people were putting their money in bonds given the dismal performance of equities over the past decade. The Dow Jones industrial average started the decade around 11,500 but closed on Friday at 10,213. “People have lost a lot of money over the last 10 years in the stock market, while there has been a bull market in bonds,” he said. “In the financial markets, there is one truism: flow follows performance.”Ross Williams, 59, a community consultant from Grand Rapids, Minn., began to take profits from his stock funds when the market started to recover last year and invested the money in short-term bonds, afraid that stocks would again drop.“We have a very volatile market, so we should be in bonds in case it goes down again,” he said. “If the market is moving up, I realized we should be taking this money and putting it into something more safe rather than leaving it at risk.”'"
"'10-08-22,'0','Behold Building 1, whose design is as artificial as the island underneath it. It is the twin of a former European airport terminal, recreated here to serve as the administrative center for the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. On Tuesday, San Francisco officials signed a transfer deal to finally pass ownership of Treasure Island from the Navy to the city.The construction of Treasure Island began in 1936 on top of a treacherous sandbar, where the water depth ranged from 2 to 26 feet. Ships avoided this navigational hazard that was derided as “waste territory.”The United States Army Corps of Engineers built the island in 18 1/2 months out of 20 million cubic yards of rock. Spanning 403 acres, it was the largest artificial island on earth.After the exposition, Building 1 was supposed to be part of San Francisco’s international airport, but the city swapped Treasure Island to the Navy in exchange for Mills Field in Millbrae.Identical to — although smaller than — Tempelhof airport in Berlin, Building 1 served as a less-expensive stand-in for the German structure in the film “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”During World War II, Treasure Island was the primary West Coast departure point for sailors.The amusement park at the 1939 exposition was called Gayway. Attractions were thrill rides, freak shows and Sally Rand’s Nude Ranch, which had topless cowgirls wearing only boots, hats, scarves and strategically placed pistol holders.'"
"'10-08-22,'0','BEIRUT, Lebanon — A Lebanese aid ship destined for Gaza delayed its departure on Saturday after Cyprus refused to allow the ship to sail through its waters or to use its ports, organizers and Lebanese officials said.The ship, the Mariam, was to have left the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli on Sunday bound for Cyprus, the first leg of the trip. Organizers said that they had been negotiating with Turkey and Greece for the use of ports and waters and that they could reach a deal by Monday.Cyprus’s refusal came after Israel said it would use force against the vessel. On May 31, Israeli commandos killed nine Turkish activists aboard a ship that was part of a Turkish aid flotilla that the commandos had boarded as it approached Gaza.Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gabriela Shalev, said in a letter to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon that the Mariam’s stated intention was “to violate the existing naval blockade of Gaza.”She warned, “Israel reserves its right under international law to use all necessary means to prevent these ships from violating the aforementioned naval blockade.”Lebanon had initially said it would defy Israel and let the aid ship sail. But on Saturday, Transportation Minister Ghazi Aridi said Beirut banned the boat from leaving its waters because Cyprus would not welcome it.'"
"'10-08-22,'0','Besides the Walt Disney Company his clients included SeaWorld, Knott’s Berry Farm, the Six Flags amusement park chain and many World’s Fairs.Mr. Price was a professional measurer. In thousands of studies, he calibrated factors like geography, demographics, weather and traffic patterns to help clients answer two vital questions: If we build it, will they come? and If they come, how many of them will there be?To analyze his data, Mr. Price devised a set of algorithms he called “roller-coaster math.” Among the things he would quantify, for instance, was the length of time patrons might stand in line to board an amusement park ride.“If people are waiting around too long, you’re not going to be profitable,” he told The Desert Sun of Palm Springs, Calif., in 2004. “But if they’re going through the park too fast, that’s also not good.”Mr. Price was best known for his work for Disney, for which he produced more than 150 feasibility, marketing and site-selection studies. His association with the company began in 1953, after Walt Disney and his brother Roy O. Disney consulted him about the best place to erect a family-oriented theme park, to be known as Disneyland.At the time, Mr. Price was on the staff of the Stanford Research Institute, a business consultancy. Weighing several Southern California locations, he determined that Anaheim, then a largely rural place of citrus groves, would be the most temperate, accessible and, above all, profitable.The Disney company acquired 160 acres there, and Disneyland opened in 1955.“Walt was a dreamer, but he had a very workmanlike curiosity about how things functioned, and whether what he was talking about would actually work,” Mr. Price said in the Desert Sun interview.At Walt Disney’s urging, Mr. Price founded his own consultancy, Economics Research Associates, in 1958. He sold the business in 1969; in 1978 he founded the Harrison Price Company, which he closed on his retirement in 2005.Harrison Alan Price, familiarly known as Buzz, was born on May 17, 1921, in Oregon City, Ore., and reared in Southern California. As a child, he later said, he was a “numbers geek,” the kind of boy who kept a careful tally of the number of times he played each phonograph record in his collection.Mr. Price received a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 1942. After Army service in World War II, he earned an M.B.A. from Stanford in 1951.Besides his son David, Mr. Price is survived by his wife, Anne Shaw Price, whom he married in 1944; another son, Bret; two daughters, Dana Price and Holly Shaw Ristuccia; a sister, Patricia Scott Mannarino; nine grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.He was the author of a business memoir, “Walt’s Revolution! By the Numbers” (Ripley Entertainment, 2004).Other projects on which Mr. Price consulted include the 1964 World’s Fair in New York and the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans. For Disney, he helped choose the location of Tokyo Disneyland, which opened in 1983 in Chiba, Japan.He also oversaw the creation of the California Institute of the Arts, a project of Walt Disney’s that Mr. Price helped shepherd into being after Mr. Disney’s death in 1966.In his long career, Mr. Price made one strategic decision that, it is safe to assume, has earned him the deep retrospective gratitude of Gotham.In the 1960s, wishing to build a theme park on the East Coast, Disney commissioned Mr. Price to find a suitable location. Among the sites he considered for the new park, to be called Walt Disney World, were Orlando, Fla., and New York City.'"
"'10-08-22,'0','Professor Moss is among a small group of economists, sociologists and legal scholars who are now trying to discover if income inequality contributes to financial crises. They have a new data point, of course, in the recent banking crisis, but there is only one parallel in the United States — the 1929 market crash.Income disparities before that crisis and before the recent one were the greatest in approximately the last 100 years. In 1928, the top 10 percent of earners received 49.29 percent of total income. In 2007, the top 10 percent earned a strikingly similar percentage: 49.74 percent. In 1928, the top 1 percent received 23.94 percent of income. In 2007, those earners received 23.5 percent. Mr. Moss and his colleagues want to know if huge gaps in income create perverse incentives that put the financial system at risk. If so, their findings could become an argument for tax and social policies aimed at closing the income gap and for greater regulation of Wall Street.This inquiry is one that some conservative economists are already dismissing.R. Glenn Hubbard, for instance, who was the top economic advisor to former President George W. Bush, said income inequality was not the culprit in the most recent crisis.“Cars go faster every year, and G.D.P. rises every year, but that doesn’t mean speed causes G.D.P.,” said Mr. Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School and co-author of the coming book “Seeds of Destruction: Why the Path to Economic Ruin Runs Through Washington, and How to Reclaim American Prosperity.”Even scholars who support the inquiry say they aren’t sure that researchers will be able to prove the connection. Richard B. Freeman, an economist at Harvard, is comparing about 125 financial crises around the globe that occurred over the last 30 years. He said inequality soared before many of these crises. But, Mr. Freeman added, the data from different nations is difficult to compare. And Professor Freeman says he has found some places, like the Scandinavian countries, where there were crises without much inequality, suggesting that other factors, like deregulation, may be the best explanations.For his part, Mr. Moss said that income inequality might have complicated links to financial crises. For instance, inequality, by putting too much power in the hands of Wall Street titans, enables them to promote policies that benefit them — like deregulation — that could put the system in jeopardy.Inequality may also push people at the bottom of the ladder toward choices that put the financial system at risk, he said. And low-income homeowners could have better afforded their mortgages if not for the earnings gap.Scholars who study inequality often focus on people at the bottom. But, Mr. Moss said, the incentives of people at the top also deserve more scrutiny.He pointed to the recent work of Margaret M. Blair, who teaches at Vanderbilt University Law School and is active with the Tobin Project, the nonprofit organization Mr. Moss founded a few years ago to study issues like economic inequality. She is researching whether financial workers promote bubbles and highly leveraged systems, even unconsciously. Ms. Blair said that because financial bubbles often lead to higher returns, financial workers have the potential to make more, and this pattern can influence their trading strategies and the policies they promote. Those decisions, in turn, drive even greater income inequality, she said.After the 1929 crash, the income gap narrowed dramatically and remained low for decades, because of the huge wealth lost by people at the top and the sweeping financial reforms introduced in the 1930s that reined in Wall Street.So far, the results are not as dramatic in the wake of the recent financial crisis. The income gap narrowed slightly in 2008, according to the most recent data available, but it remains unclear if it will continue shrinking.This time, after all, the system did not collapse as it did in 1929. The status quo on income inequality looks like it was essentially maintained. Mr. Moss said he supported the government intervention in 2008, though he noted, ""Financial elites made off rather well.""'"
"'10-08-22,'0','Denis R. McDonough, chief of staff of the , said the administration had no illusions.“Does anybody believe the violence is going to stop entirely and the opponents to stability and progress in Iraq are going to stand down? No,” he said. “But we do know that the Iraqi security forces are in a position to take that role on themselves increasingly.”The official transition from Operation Iraqi Freedom to Operation New Dawn is as much a change in labels as it is a change in mission. With violence far below its peak in 2006 and 2007, American forces have increasingly taken a back seat to the Iraqi security units they trained.But after seven years of a war started by President on the basis of false intelligence, the desire for finality, and perhaps closure, has focused attention on this moment and provoked a fresh discussion in Washington about what it all has meant.After hundreds of billions of dollars, more than 4,400 American military deaths and at least 100,000 Iraqi civilian deaths and perhaps many more, was it worth it? Did toppling a dictator and nursing a fledgling if flawed democracy make a difference? And did the salvage credibility by sticking it out and finally stabilizing Iraq even if not winning the clear-cut victory originally envisioned?“If we can’t have a victory parade, we at least ought to be able to make some definitive conclusions,” said Andrew J. Bacevich, a military specialist at who lost a son in Iraq and has written a new book, “Washington Rules: America’s Path to Permanent War. And it just doesn’t seem that we are going to do so. We want to just move on, sadly.”In part, that owes to the deteriorating situation in , where Mr. Obama is sending more troops, as well as the fragile economy at home, where millions of Americans are looking for work. And so while his opposition to the Iraq war animated his early candidacy, it seems almost a secondary issue these days.During a fund-raising speech in last week, for instance, Mr. Obama mentioned the Iraq transition only in passing. “We are keeping the promise I made when I began my campaign for the presidency: by the end of this month, we will have removed 100,000 troops from Iraq, and our combat mission will be over in Iraq,” he said, a line he later repeated at a fund-raiser in .As they mark the moment, Democrats generally make no mention of the troop buildup and strategy change ordered by Mr. Bush in 2007, which many credit with turning around the war and making it possible to end combat now. By the time Mr. Bush left office, he had sealed an agreement with Iraq to withdraw all American troops by the end of 2011. After taking office, Mr. Obama ordered an intermediary deadline of drawing down to 50,000 by the end of this month.Mr. Bush showed up unannounced at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport earlier this month to greet troops returning from Iraq. While no news media were invited, video posted on YouTube by troop supporters showed him in casual clothes shaking hands and posing for pictures with troops as they entered the terminal one by one.Mr. Bush has declined to discuss the mission change, but former advisers see it as a validation that after all the pain and the blood, Iraq may finally be in a better place, governed by a freer, more democratic system that could yet serve as a model in an otherwise largely authoritarian .“We can take a certain measure of satisfaction from the success in Iraq,” , the former Iraqi occupation administrator, said in an interview. “It’s not a complete success yet, obviously, but building democracy takes time.”He added that “a successful Arab-Muslim democracy basically puts the lie to the Islamic extremists” who maintain that democracy is anathema to Islam and advocate a harsh form of rule., who was Mr. Bush’s national security adviser, said the current transition was due to the surge ordered by the former president and opposed by Mr. Obama when he was a senator. But he said he was glad that Mr. Obama’s team “has gone through a transition” and that it seemed to be taking pride in accomplishments in Iraq. He said he hoped that the administration would see the task through.“If they do, they can rightly claim some measure of credit, and I would be the first to give them credit,” Mr. Hadley said. “But they need to stay focused and stay engaged.”For Mr. Obama, this moment is a reminder of the lesson his predecessor learned after declaring the end of major combat operations on an aircraft carrier in front of a banner in 2003. Iraq was a messy war with no tidy end. “There will be no surrender ceremony on the deck of a battleship,” Mr. Bush later concluded.Mr. Obama has come to the same realization, in almost the exact same words.“There will be no simple moment of surrender to mark the journey’s end,” he declared last spring.'"
"'10-08-22,'0','More than a dozen early major league catchers, most notably Walter Walker and Jake Knowdell, had precipitous emotional declines that began during or soon after their playing careers.With no awareness at the time of brain trauma’s effects, their symptoms were attributed to alcoholism, madness, morphine addiction or criminal tendencies. Substance abuse and bursts of anger, often unlawful, have recently been identified of signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, brain damage resulting from repeated blows to the head.Tommy Barlow, for instance, was treated with morphine after a concussion and soon was under arrest for acts that seemed “like a dream to him,” The New York Times reported in 1877. “Now he is a mere wreck and expects soon to be driven to suicide.”Marty Bergen was a teetotaler whose outward calm masked a deep-seated paranoia that in 1900 led him to murder his wife and two children, then to commit suicide.Harry Decker also seems to have been a nondrinker, yet his bizarre crimes prompted The Chicago Tribune to report in 1893: “Decker’s hallucination is that he owns the city of Chicago. He was in the habit of entering saloons and ordering wine for everybody present and then walking out with the belief that the place belonged to him and he could give away his own wares if he saw fit.”Such actions among alarmingly young active or retired professional catchers suggest that many of them had sustained concussion-related brain damage that gradually robbed them of the ability to function in society.Nor were catchers alone. In an 1897 game, Chicago Colts (now Cubs) first baseman Gentleman George Decker was struck in the head by a pitch and fainted several hours later. Manager Cap Anson pooh-poohed his request for more time to recover and returned him to action two days later. Another concussion apparently followed; three years later, Decker was institutionalized.His apparent recovery led to his release, but he soon threatened “instant death to everyone who goes near him,” The Los Angeles Herald reported. At a heartrending institutionalization hearing, Decker prattled merrily about getting “a million billion a year from the Mikado of Japan,” promised the judge “a bang-up auto” and confided his plans “to be married this afternoon,” according to The Los Angeles Times. Decker returned to the asylum and died in 1909.As for major league personnel being killed by a ball, even casual fans have been told about Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray Chapman in 1920. But few remember the more recent story of the umpire Cal Drummond.During a June 10, 1969, game in Baltimore, Drummond seemed unhurt after being struck on the mask by a foul tip. The incident and even the batter’s identity had been forgotten by game’s end, when Drummond lapsed into unconsciousness. Released after a week’s hospitalization, he began the slow path to recovery and resumed umpiring the next spring.But on the final day of a minor league rehabilitation stint, Drummond collapsed and died. An autopsy attributed his death to the effects of the foul tip, making him the only on-field participant since Chapman to have sustained a fatal injury during a major league game. As with so many athletes until recent medical revelations into brain injuries’ hidden toll, the delayed and mystifying course of the injury has left Drummond all but forgotten.'"
"'10-08-22,'0','TEHRAN — Thirty-six years after construction began under the shah, Iran finally opened its first nuclear power plant at a ceremony on Saturday.Attended by senior officials from Iran and Russia, which helped build the plant, the ceremony marked the beginning of the transfer of low-enriched uranium fuel rods from a storage site into the plant. Officials of both countries said that Saturday’s events signified the opening, not the startup, of the plant near Bushehr, in southern Iran.The plant itself is not controversial, because the Russians plan to provide fuel for it and to remove spent fuel that could be used to make weapons. But the opening was sure to upset United States diplomats, who had encouraged Russia to delay it as a way to add to economic sanctions imposed on Iran because of its refusal to cease enrichment of uranium at its other nuclear facilities. Although Iran denies that it is using its civilian nuclear program to mask a plan to build a bomb, many Western countries are dubious.The chief of Russia’s Rosatom state nuclear power company, Sergei Kiriyenko, speaking to members of the news media in an amphitheater of the Bushehr complex, took pains to emphasize, as Russians have for years, that the plant complied with the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency.“Not a single professional in the world has any questions about the chance that the Bushehr nuclear power plant could be used for nonpeaceful purposes,” he said. Shaking hands and smiling with his Iranian counterparts in television reports broadcast in Russia, Mr. Kiriyenko called Saturday “a special day for both Russian and Iranian specialists.”'"
"'10-08-22,'0','He sat down on a bench and lighted a Dominican cigar (which he calls a “square”) and said he liked it there, by the water; it reminded him of New Orleans, his hometown, where he spends much of the year. He also rents a “pad” in Washington Heights, where he stays on and off and where many of the residents are Hispanic. “It’s nice,” he said. “I relate to people up there that kind of hangs on the streets.”Does he speak Spanish? “No,” he said. “I don’t even speak English.”In a way, he’s not kidding. Talking with Dr. John is an adventure. And a treat. After all, this is the guy who is responsible for lyrics like “I walk on gilded splinters.”Still, it can be challenging to follow him. His voice hovers between a growl and a whisper, and made-up words burst from his lips. A message is a “massage.” A text becomes a “textile.” Louisiana’s governor, Bobby Jindal, is “Bobby Jingle Bells,” as in: “For a minute during the BP mess, I liked Bobby Jingle Bells. For a minute.” And now? “He’s the kind of politician who makes me nauseated.”He can also be vague. When asked how many children he had, he answered “A lot.” And how many grandchildren? “Enough.”His conversation meanders with seemingly no connective thread; eventually, certain themes emerge: Louisiana, offshore drilling, Hurricane Katrina, the joys of eating goats’ eyeballs (“When you get the hard part out, they’re delicious”) and drinking, which he never enjoyed. “I killed all my mother’s plants ‘cause I poured wine in there,” he said.And then there is Barack Obama, “The first person I voted for since John Kennedy who won,” he said. “For a lot of years I didn’t vote. After Nixon and Reagan I got disgusted with politics.”He still is. Indeed, on this topic he is quite articulate. “I’m sitting in Europe and I see Barack Obama on TV being nice to the British prime minister” after the BP oil spill. “I ain’t prejudiced against British people. I got friends who are British. But did we really win the Revolution?”“I don’t feel like I can trust anybody, anywhere,” he said. For that reason, he doesn’t read newspapers and doesn’t have an e-mail address or even a computer. But he does have a cellphone (Louis Armstrong’s music is one of his ringtones), which compensates for the lack of e-mail: “I can text on the phone, and even then I know it’s being monitored somewhere by someone.”He is outraged by the government’s response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and Hurricane Katrina. His 2008 album, “City That Care Forgot,” which is about New Orleans after the deluge, won the 2009 Grammy for best contemporary blues album. He is still collecting money for New Orleans charities. On his Web site, drjohn.org, he notes that “As a gesture of thankfulnessments to his fans and with no profitabilitary to hisself, Dr. John is offerin’ up some drawers in honoroficalness of NOLA, his hometown.”Does he have hope that things will improve? He shrugs. “One day you’re on top of the world, and the next day the world’s on top of you,” he said. “That’s life.”As for him right now? “I’m somewhere in the middle.”'"
"'10-08-22,'0','These are grim days for print journalists: we are the auto workers of the white-collar class, toiling in an industry in structural decline (see: sale of Newsweek for $1). But this summer’s best-seller list offers some relief for the world’s inky-fingered wretches. The hero of our collective imaginations is a middle-aged print reporter named Mikael Blomkvist, the Swedish muckraker who co-stars in Stieg Larsson ’s Millennium trilogy, which﻿ is dominating beaches and airport lounges this season.For business scribes, Blomkvist’s celebrity is especially satisfying. Business journalists are the high school nerds of the newsroom, lacking the dangerous glamour of the war correspondents, the proximity to fame of the sports and entertainment writers, and the alpha-dog swagger of the political press corps. Blomkvist offers the business press hipness by association. His investigations take him beyond the ascetic world of balance sheets and offshore bank accounts to showdowns with former K.G.B. sadists. Better yet, although he is the divorced father of an adult daughter, and a smoker who runs mostly to keep his paunch in check, he is catnip to women. If James Bond were reincarnated as a crusading Swedish feminist, he would be Mikael Blomkvist.There’s just one catch: Blomkvist despises the mainstream business press almost as much as he loathes the corrupt businessmen who are his chief targets. Blomkvist, who writes for an independent magazine he helped found, accuses establishment business journalists of getting too close to the magnates they cover. They have access, he complains, but they fail to do the “real” work of uncovering corporate malfeasance.Larsson, himself an investigative journalist, died in 2004, before the financial crisis. But if he were reviewing the books inspired by the meltdown, he would surely reiterate his protagonist’s dyspeptic critique of business reporting. The best writing on the crisis has been from the inside out, starting with Andrew Ross Sorkin’s “Too Big to Fail” — a vivid, nearly instantaneous account of Wall Street in 2008 that stands as that pivotal year’s first draft of history.Michael Lewis does something even smarter and more original in “The Big Short,” recounting the crash from the perspective of a small tribe of investors who had the insight and the audacity to foresee the crisis and profit from it. But while Lewis writes about iconoclastic out­siders, he profiles their lives and trades very much from the inside. “I’ve found it impossible to write a decent nonfiction narrative without unusually deep cooperation from my subjects,” Lewis explains in his acknowledgments, thanking his traders for allowing him “to enter their lives.”Lewis is “eternally grateful” to his subjects for their cooperation. Sorkin, a reporter and columnist for The New York Times, is “truly grateful” to his. One can imagine Blomkvist sputtering with rage, but you don’t have to be a fictional Scandinavian social democrat to wish that business journalism in the United States was more about afflicting the comfortable and less about cozying up to them. In the spring, the high priests of American journalism at the Columbia Journalism Review published a tough critique of Sorkin by Dean Starkman, who argued that “Too Big to Fail” was on one side — the wrong side — in the “mini-struggle” between “deal journalism and the work of accountability-oriented reporters.”That article rightly highlighted the important investigative work done by reporters with a “more confrontational approach,” like Gretchen Morgenson and Don Van Natta Jr., both of The Times, and Mark Pittman of Bloomberg News, who wrote a 2007 series predicting the collapse of the banking sector. But the bigger, more complicated truth about the financial crisis is that it wasn’t caused by evil businessmen. The overarching story is one of systemic failure, not individual wrongdoing. It wasn’t the Bernie Madoffs who plunged the world into recession. It was low capital requirements, weak limits on leverage, over-the-counter traded derivatives, soft rules on mortgage lending and global financial imbalances.If your attention wandered as you read that list of abstract terms, you are not alone. A growing body of cognitive research is demonstrating something schoolteachers and entertainers have known for a long time: Most of us respond better to personal stories than to impersonal numbers and ideas. That cognitive bias is so pronounced that Deborah Small, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School, has found that charitable giving actually goes down if too many statistics are included in individual tales of need (and if we get only statistics and don’t learn any personal stories, giving is even lower). Forget “just the facts, ma’am.” Actually, forget the facts altogether.For readers, that same bias means we are drawn to stories about people, not systems. When it comes to the financial crisis, we want heroes and villains and what-he-had-for-breakfast narratives; we are less enthralled by analytical accounts of the global financial system and the cycle of boom and bust. The Columbia Journalism Review — and Blomkvist — juxtapose the approaches of “access” and “investigative” journalists. But the real divide may be between storytellers and system analysts. (This is one of many reasons that anyone interested in the financial crisis and its causes should venture farther down the best-seller list and dip into “This Time Is Different,” a lucid and unapologetically dense study of eight centuries of financial crises by the economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff.)This dichotomy goes beyond writers and newspaper front pages to our legislatures and even the campaign trail. Financial reform legislation didn’t become sexy until the Securities and Exchange Commission unveiled its case against Goldman Sachs. The “fabulous Fab,” as Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman trader who bet against subprime mortgages, called himself, and his colorful e-mails were a story right out of Small’s research. It packed such a viscerally powerful punch that almost no one, apart from the great vampire squid’s P.R. team, bothered to note that because of the firm’s fine culture of risk management, Goldman was probably less culpable in the 2008 crisis than any other investment bank.Fabulous Fab’s shenanigans (and great name!) not only helped pass the financial reform bill, they cost Goldman $550 million, the biggest settlement ever paid to the S.E.C. Score one for the storytellers. But that is likely to be a temporary triumph, and not only because Goldman now prohibits its employees from using vulgar language in e-mails, presumably to ensure that the next documents the bank is forced to disgorge aren’t quite so vivid.We are living in the age of number-crunchers, not narrators. On Wall Street, in Silicon Valley, in Bangalore and in Shanghai, the new technologies and the capital flows that are reshaping our world are dominated by the people who master data dumps. This split — more than geography, more than gender, more than what your parents did for a living — may be the real class divide of our time.Even Larsson, who created Blomkvist at least partly in his own image, knew this. That’s why the more eye-catching partner in his crime-busting duo is the quasi-autistic number-cruncher extraordinaire Lisbeth Salander. Female readers may be dubious of the 20-something Salander’s not-totally-requited passion for Blomkvist, but what really rings false in their relationship is the idea that Blomkvist would be Salander’s boss, and not vice versa. There have been reports that Larsson once told a friend that the fourth novel in the series, left unfinished at the time of his death, would follow the pair to a remote island town in Canada’s Northwest Territories. But a more plausible plot would involve Salander’s move to Palo Alto and the start-up of her global data mining and security firm.'"
"'10-08-22,'0','AT 3:30 in the morning on July 23, 1962, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir gathered at the airport here for a flight to a military base in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Preparations for a now nearly forgotten salvo of the cold war, called Operation Telstar, were under way.It was time to sing.The 360-member choir, the lyrical voice of Mormonism since pioneer days, was on a mission with multiple levels, historians and surviving singers say. They were to be the featured musical anchor later that day for the first international satellite television program — a blast of American culture and technological prowess aimed at Europe, using a wobbly, 170-pound satellite that had been launched into orbit that month.Small stories and large ones were interwoven — in the off-camera dreams and fears of the singers and organizers and in the on-camera references to the Kremlin and the arms race. A brash, ambitious television station manager from Rapid City, S.D., named William F. Turner, who happened to know some Mormons — and some Kennedys in the White House — played a part. Darleen Merrihew, then a 32-year-old alto, was three months pregnant with her fourth child.And Owen and Helen Clark were preparing for the first-ever performance, scheduled that night back in Salt Lake City, of the Clark Family Singers. The family group, featuring their son Elliott — then 10 years old, now a soloist for the choir — was on the program at the tabernacle itself, the building from which the choir, generations earlier, had drawn its name.Meanwhile, tensions between the United States and the old Soviet Union were about to boil over. In Cuba, the Russians were deploying missiles that summer aimed at the United States, a turn of events that, when discovered in October, would bring the world to the brink of nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crisis.But for the choir members, the responsibilities and significance felt even more immense. Through the conservative years of the 1950s, the church had become closer to mainstream American life than probably any period in history, before or since. Now they were riding that wave to a new high, with the choir singing not just for the faith but for the nation itself.The story of their journey — included in the DVD portion of a new release commemorating the 100th anniversary of the choir’s first recordings — offers a bracingly different take on early 1960s culture than the one millions of Americans watch each week on the television advertising drama “Mad Men.” Glamorous debauchery and cynicism may have underpinned the marketing of floor wax and cigarettes, but earnest yearning and anxiety were twitchingly, poignantly alive then, too.“We knew we were singing the message of America to the world,” said Vernie Swenson, 90, who was in the choir and on the platform that day with his wife, Shirley, 87. “It was an honor beyond anything we’d ever imagined.”At the foot of Mount Rushmore, with the sculptured heads of presidents in the backdrop, on Telstar’s 123rd orbit since its launch, just after noon Mountain Time, the conjunction of technology, geopolitics and religious striving reached its apogee. The entire broadcast lasted about 20 minutes. Of that, the choir filled only about three.But within the church at least, a chord was struck, deep and resonant and lasting.“The choir seemed to call up strange echoes among the cliffs — rich songs of progress, of vast migrations to better lands, of explorers, overtones from the marching pioneers,” said an article in the church newsletter three months later. But in that spotlight moment, “there were undertones of evil too,” the article continued. “To all the free world and beyond, this feeling that the past was looking down upon us was intensified.”In telling his part of the story, Mr. Turner, 81, now retired and living in Naples, Fla., still sounded like the fast-talking 33-year-old television executive he was that summer. He worked for a tiny-market, middle-of-nowhere station — 12,000 working television sets in signal range in the still-wild and empty Dakotas — but he had an idea and was determined to chase it. The broadcast and its planning had become a major news event.'"
"'10-08-22,'0','The day I became a fact-checker at The New Yorker, I received one set of red pencils and one set of No. 2 pencils. [FC: There used to be a training period before the pencils.] [[VH: O.K. for “the day I became a fact-checker” to designate end of training period?]]The red pencils were for underlining passages on page proofs of articles that might contain checkable facts. It was not always obvious what to underline. Sometimes a phrase would contain hidden facts, as in “Jane’s youngest son.” You’d have to check maternity and birth order, but you’d also have to confirm that Jane had at least three sons for one to be considered “youngest.” [FC: Wouldn’t the magazine have used her surname?] [[VH: Make it “Doe’s youngest son.”]]The No. 2’s came next. With them you would draw strike marks through words — and sometimes individual letters — that were confirmed with the help of reference books from the magazine’s library, including Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary, the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and Burke’s Peerage. [FC: Actual title is Burke’s Peerage and Gentry.] Not infrequently, these imposing-looking books were as wacko as anything now on Wikipedia, as many of them made “facts” of off-the-wall data that hardly seemed to be proper objects of empirical study. (The Social Register, which gave the pedigrees of socialites, comes to mind.)Fact-checkers also consulted periodicals. The department subscribed to virtually everything and kept newspapers archived on microfilm. Cautionary tales circulated about errors that originated in The New York Times or The Washington Post, only to be replicated and memorialized forever by lazy magazine fact-checkers relying on single news stories. Proper protocol was to consult microfilm of the paper but then to check the next few days’ papers, also on microfilm, on the chance that a correction had been published. This was labor intensive, especially when there seemed to be bigger conceptual fish to fry in complex articles about, say, the O. J. Simpson defense.In checking long, reported articles, checkers sometimes made dozens of phone calls a week — to bartenders about a restaurant’s ambience, to E.M.T.’s about how stretchers are handled or to anti-abortion activists about the dimensions of ultrasound images on their placards. Not infrequently, checkers were in the diplomacy business, and the best checkers were known for their bedside manners with sources, reporters and editors. Good checkers did not play gotcha, did not gossip about which reporters were error-prone and stayed true to the goals of journalism — to be newsworthy and interesting — as well as to our sub-sublibrarian dedication to factuality.'"

"'10-08-23,'0','“People shouldn’t look at a home as a way to make money because it won’t,” Mr. Baker said.If the long term is grim, the short term is grimmer. Housing experts are bracing themselves for Tuesday, when the sales figures for July will be released. The data is expected to show a drop of as much as 20 percent from last year.The supply of homes sitting on the market might rise to as much as 12 months, about twice the level of a healthy market. That would push down prices as all those sellers compete to secure a buyer, adding to a slide that has already chopped off as much as 30 percent in home values.Set against this dismal present and a bleak future, buying a home is a willful act of optimism. That explains why Adam and Allison Lyons are waiting to close on a $417,500 house in Deerfield, Ill.“We’re trying not to think too far ahead,” said Ms. Lyons, 35, an information technology manager.The couple’s first venture into real estate came in 2003 when they bought a condo in a 17-unit building under construction in . By the time they moved in two years later, it was already worth $50,000 more than they had paid. “We were thinking, great!” said Mr. Lyons, 34.That quick appreciation started them on the same track as their parents, who watched the value of their houses ascend for decades. The real estate crash interrupted that pleasant dream. The couple cannot sell their condo. Unwillingly, they are becoming landlords.“I don’t think we’re ever going to see the prosperity our parents did, but I don’t think it’s all doom and gloom either,” said Mr. Lyons, a manager at “At some point, you just have to say what the heck and go for it.”Other buyers have grand and even grander expectations.In an annual survey conducted by the economists and Karl E. Case, hundreds of new owners in four communities — Alameda County near , , Orange County south of , and — once again said they believed prices would rise about 10 percent a year for the next decade.With minor swings in sentiment, the latest results reflect what new buyers always seem to feel. At the boom’s peak in 2005, they said prices would go up. When the market was sliding in 2008, they still said prices would go up.“People think it’s a law of nature,” said Mr. Shiller, who teaches at Yale.For the first half of the 20th century, he said, expectations followed the opposite path. Houses were seen the way cars are now: as a consumer durable that the buyer eventually used up.The notion of housing as an investment first began to blossom after World War II, when the nesting urges of returning soldiers created a construction boom. Demand was stoked as their bumper crop of children grew up and bought places of their own. The inflation of the 1970s, which increased the value of hard assets, and liberal policies both helped make housing a good bet. So did the long decline in rates from the early 1980s.Despite all these tailwinds, prices rose modestly for much of the period. Real home prices increased 1.1 percent a year after inflation, according to Mr. Shiller’s research.By the late 1990s, however, the rate was 4 percent a year. Happy homeowners were taking about $100 billion a year out of their houses, which paid for a lot of good times.“The experience we had from the late 1970s to the late 1990s was an aberration,” said Barry Ritholtz of the equity research firm Fusion IQ. “People shouldn’t be holding their breath waiting for it to happen again.”Not everyone views the notion of real appreciation in real estate as a lost cause.Bob Walters, chief economist of the online mortgage firm Quicken, acknowledges that the recent collapse will create a “mind ” just as did. But he argues that housing remains unique.“You have to live somewhere,” he said. “In three or four years, people will resume a normal course, and home values will continue to increase.”All homes are different, and some neighborhoods and regions will rebound more quickly. On the other hand, areas where there was intense overbuilding, like , will be extremely slow to show any sign of renewal.“It’s entirely likely that markets like Arizona will not recover even in the 15- to 20-year time frame,” said Mr. Humphries of Zillow. “The demand doesn’t exist.”Owners in those foreclosure-plagued areas consider themselves lucky if they are still solvent. But that does not prevent the occasional regret that a life-changing sum of money was so briefly within their grasp.Robert Austin, a lawyer, paid $200,000 for his home in 2000. Five years later, his neighbors listed a similar home for $500,000.Freedom beckoned. “I thought, when my daughter gets out of school, I can sell the house and buy a boat and sail around the world,” said Mr. Austin, 56.His home is now worth about what he paid for it. As for that cruise, “it may be a while,” Mr. Austin said. Showing the hopefulness that is apparently innate to homeowners, he added: “But I won’t rule it out forever.”'"

His octopus reach in the business world appealed to the man who hired him at U.S.C., but Haden looks at his diversified résumé with a jaundiced eye.“I think I could have been a better lawyer if I had just practiced law,” he said. “I could have been a better broadcaster if I had just stuck to broadcasting, a better businessman if I had devoted all of my focus to that.”He added: “I’ve never been the best at anything. It would have been fun to figure out one career to focus my energies and see if I could have been the best at something.”Haden is devoting himself to a single job now. It is as if his life has come full circle, as he is back at the place where he once wrote on a student questionnaire that his future plans were “university teaching.”His family and friends say they have not seen Haden this energized, this excited, in a long time.“He has a new spring to his step,” said Kelly Paulus, the second of Haden’s four grown children with Cindy, his wife of 34 years. “I haven’t seen him this happy in a while.”Haden recently had two surgical procedures for an irregular heartbeat. Every few days, he said, his heart started beating so hard he thought his chest was going to explode. Once, his heart rate dropped so precipitously he fainted.“Since I took the job, I’ve only had one brief arrhythmia,” he said, adding, “I feel great.”Haden’s third week on the job was much like the previous two. His schedule was so crammed with appointments, mostly with student-athletes, that his office on the second floor of Heritage Hall resembled a doctor’s waiting room.Haden’s goal, he said, is to nudge student-athletes outside their comfort zones so they can take advantage of “what’s percolating around every corner of a great research university like U.S.C.”He wants them to have a broader college experience than he had.“I’m embarrassed I can’t speak a second language fluently,” Haden said. “I should have taken advantage more of this international population here. I wish I would have done some research in one of the labs here. I wish I would have tried out for a play. Isn’t that the point of the college experience, getting outside your comfort zone? So I’m definitely going to encourage it.”Max Nikias served on the university’s board of trustees with Haden before becoming the university’s president this month. He wanted Haden as his athletic director and refused to take Haden’s initial “no” for an answer.“I was looking for someone that not only understood the athletic side but someone who also had a lot of experience in the boardroom, in the business world, in the media world,” Nikias said. “The more I was thinking about Pat, it was obvious he brings all the qualities that are impossible to find in one person. That’s why I wasn’t giving up.”Nikias found an unlikely ally in Cindy Haden, who urged her husband to reconsider. Haden recalled her saying, “You’re at a time in your life where it’s a great opportunity, a new challenge, and you’d have some fun with it.”After Haden accepted the job in July, Nikias had a bouquet of flowers delivered to Haden’s wife with a thank-you note. Since then, Nikias said, his office has been deluged by letters, e-mails and phone calls from people praising the hire.At the Jefferson Boulevard entrance to the campus, the guard at the gatehouse broke into a smile upon hearing Haden’s name. The guard, Eric Johnson, stepped out from his kiosk and explained that in his early 20s, he worked for a messenger service. One day he completed a downtown delivery to Haden, who stopped to converse with him for a few minutes.With the exception of his time at Oxford, Haden has spent his entire adult life as the guy everybody knows as soon as he walks into the room. His friends say Haden’s gift is that he leaves knowing everybody else’s stories.“He has such compassion and humility,” said J. K. McKay, who caught Haden’s passes at Bishop Amat High in La Puente, Calif., east of Los Angeles, and at U.S.C., where they were coached by McKay’s father, John.“Pat and I have been friends since we were 14 years old,” he said, “and this sounds hokey, but I don’t think we’ve ever had an argument.”Haden persuaded McKay to leave his job as a lawyer to become an associate in charge of the football program. McKay is the liaison between Haden and Lane Kiffin, the brash new football coach he inherited.Haden has fired one coach, Chad Kreuter, who was 111-117 in four seasons with the baseball team. When Haden’s hiring was announced, Khosroshahin said he was worried he would be the first coach to be let go.As a youth coach, Khosroshahin explained, he once refused to allow Haden’s son, Ryan, to play in a big match in a distant city because he arrived without his soccer cleats. Khosroshahin recalled Haden expressing displeasure at his son’s benching.“I get that he was just a 10-year-old kid, but at some point, you have to learn the lessons,” Khosroshahin said. “I’m a disciplinarian, and my attitude was, How can I count on you in the heat of the moment to do your job when you weren’t focused enough to bring your most important piece of equipment?”The reasoning may have rankled Haden, the parent, but it resonates with him in his new role, where his message is individual accountability.Haden and McKay were on the sideline Friday for the soccer team’s opener. As time ran out on U.S.C.’s 1-0 loss to San Diego, McKay turned to Haden and said, “Fire the A.D.”Haden laughed, then sought out individual players. He wanted to remind them there were brighter days ahead.'"
"'10-08-23,'0','Nevertheless, Mr. Lazio is pushing ahead with the strategy, even breaking what has been, until now, something of an unwritten rule of politics in New York: never to use images of Sept. 11 in campaign advertisements.Last week, Mr. Lazio released a Web advertisement critical of the mosque featuring rescue workers on Sept. 11 and a television commercial in which he appears before photos of a still-smoldering World Trade Center, questioning where the money for the planned Muslim center will come from, and declaring that Mr. Cuomo, who has defended the rights of the project’s organizers, “is very, very wrong.”In an interview, Mr. Lazio defended his focus on the Muslim center, saying that for many New Yorkers, the memory of Sept. 11 remained raw, and that, for them, proposing a 13-story Muslim center blocks from ground zero was insensitive and even offensive.“A lot of us have moved ahead since 2001, but for other people the memories are very vivid and very real,” he said. “And there is an incredible emotional connection to the people who had this experience: husbands, wives, children, parents, victims, all of whom were victims.”“When they approach me,” he said, “I do feel that I have a responsibility here to raise this issue effectively and get some answers.”Unions representing the city’s firefighters and police officers immediately demanded that Mr. Lazio pull his most recent ad, calling it an affront. Ed Mullins, the head of the city’s police sergeants’ union, called the ads “as irresponsible as they are reprehensible.”Muslim groups, for their part, have vigorously objected to Mr. Lazio’s characterizations of the imam behind the center, Feisal Abdul Rauf, whom he calls a “terrorist sympathizer.”Ghazi Y. Khankan, the former director of the New York Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that Mr. Lazio “should be ashamed of himself for doing these dirty tactics.”“My God,” he added. “How low can you go?”Some political analysts and consultants say Mr. Lazio’s critique of the planned project is designed in significant part to ward off an unexpectedly spirited challenger in Carl Paladino, a wealthy upstate conservative who has spoken out against the project in even blunter language than Mr. Lazio.In his own commercial, Mr. Paladino vowed that, if elected, he would use the government’s power of eminent domain to force the center’s developers to find a different location.Yet like any controversy that burns with emotion — fanned by cable television, news media and talk radio — it could flame out, losing the interest of voters who are fretting over pocketbook concerns.“I don’t think it’s a ticket to Albany in November,” said Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which has surveyed New York voters on the topic.But for Mr. Lazio, who is woefully underfinanced compared with Mr. Cuomo — he has some $600,000 to Mr. Cuomo’s $23 million — it is a way to distinguish himself on a divisive issue.“It’s a double-edged sword here,” said Michael Long, the chairman of the state’s Conservative Party, which has sponsored some of Mr. Lazio’s most controversial commercials on the Muslim center. “There will be people who will be more adamantly against him because of it. But there are a whole host of people who did not know about Rick Lazio who now do, and think favorably of him.”On Sunday, as a guest on “Meet The Press,” Mr. Lazio hammered the project’s spiritual leader, Mr. Abdul Rauf. “There are millions of peace-loving good Muslims in America,” he said. “This imam, Rauf, is not one of them.”Mr. Lazio’s criticism of the project has also included direct shots at Mr. Cuomo, who, he says, has failed to investigate the financing behind the planned $100 million center, which is to house a mosque, a restaurant, a pool and other features. “I don’t know why he is not more curious about where the money is coming from,” Mr. Lazio said on the program. “He is the state’s chief law enforcement officer.”Mr. Cuomo would not comment for this article, but aides said that, because the developers had raised so little money, there was nothing to investigate: the most recent government filings show the organization has about $18,000. The aides added that if Mr. Lazio was serious about uncovering terrorism-related financing, he would make similar requests to the New York Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.This is not the first time that Mr. Lazio has thrust Islam into a political campaign. In his 2000 bid for the United States Senate, Mr. Lazio attacked his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for raising money from a Muslim group, some of whose members had defended the radical Islamic group Hamas.Mrs. Clinton eventually returned the donations. But in the waning days of the campaign, Mr. Lazio’s supporters in the State Republican Party made a telephone calls to voters that linked Mrs. Clinton’s donors to the terrorism attack on an American warship in Yemen, angering many voters, who considered the tactic over the top.Mr. Lazio said there was no connection between his campaigns in 2000 and in 2010. And he dismissed the claim that he had exploited post-Sept. 11 anxieties about Islam and terrorism. “Two-thirds of New Yorkers don’t think we should move forward with it,” he said of the proposed center. “Two-thirds of New Yorkers are not religious bigots. They are people who overwhelmingly believe in religious freedom and pluralism and diversity.”But Muslim leaders question Mr. Lazio’s sincerity: Several wondered why, if he had questions about the center’s financing, or the religious leader who is to oversee it, he had not spoken with either the developer or the imam. At the final Landmarks Preservation Commission hearing on the project, its developer, Sharif el-Gamal, tried to introduce himself to Mr. Lazio.He said he was rebuffed. “He just looked at me and walked by,” Mr. Gamal recalled.Mr. Lazio said no slight was intended. “I have never met the man,” he said.'"
"'10-08-23,'0','Jeffrey Donovan, a Nanex developer, first noticed the apparent anomalies. “Something is not right,” he said as he reviewed the charts.Mr. Donovan, a man with a runaway chuckle who works alone out of the company’s office in Santa Barbara, Calif., poses a theory that a small group of high-frequency traders was trying to introduce delays into the nation’s fractured stock-market trading system to profit at the expense of others. Clogging exchanges or otherwise disrupting markets to gain an advantage may be illegal.Mr. Donovan indulges Wall Street’s increasing fascination with the charts by christening more of them each day, with names like Continental Crust, Broken Highway and Twilight.There is also the Bandsaw, a zigzag pattern of prices that appear and then abruptly vanish. There is the Knife, a sharp, narrowing price sequence. There is the Crystal Triangle, the Bar Code, the Mountain Range, each one stranger than the last.The truth of what happened on May 6 could be hiding somewhere in those mysterious configurations. Or it may lie somewhere else entirely. But 15 weeks later, the authorities are still looking for it. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission plan to issue a final report on their findings in September.A preliminary report in May blamed a confluence of factors, including worries over rising sovereign debt and a lack of marketwide circuit breakers, but the new report is expected to go further.For now, this much is known: The markets were already down and on edge that morning as Europe’s debt crisis seemed to be spiraling out of control.As markets fell, a mutual fund manager in Kansas made a big sale of stock futures. The rout, some say, was worsened by a lack of coordination among the dozens of exchanges that make up the modern-day stock market. As the New York Stock Exchange slowed trading, rival exchanges that were more automated allowed the selling to continue.“It’s just madness to say we don’t know what caused it. We do,” said Steve Wunsch, a market structure consultant. “The crash was an inevitable consequence of creating multiple market centers.”That is one explanation. Others have pointed to the high-frequency traders, who use powerful computers to transmit millions of orders at lightning speed. Some of these traders, who now dominate the stock market, appear to have fled the market as prices went haywire.Then their computer programs might have dragged down exchange-traded funds, popular investment vehicles that fell sharply during the crash, said Thomas Peterffy, chief executive of Interactive Brokers.But if Nanex’s theory is to be believed, computer algorithms might have been at work as well, knowingly or unknowingly wreaking havoc and creating data crop circles.“There is a credible allegation that there is seriously abusive practices going on,” said James J. Angel, a financial market analyst specialist at Georgetown University, “to the extent that somebody is firing in a very high frequency of orders for no good economic reason, basically because they are trying to slow everybody else down.”At a Washington hearing on the flash crash last week, Kevin Cronin, director of global equity trading at Invesco, a big fund manager, warned about “improper or manipulative activity” in the stock market.Traders at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto said they had also identified a “data deluge” a few minutes before the crash. They said people in the markets were poring over Nanex’s colorful charts.“Whether they are intentional or not, the regulators should be looking into it closely,” said Doug Clark, managing director of BMO Capital Markets.In an Aug. 5 letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Senator Edward E. Kaufman, Democrat of Delaware, warned about a “micro-arms race that is being waged in our public marketplace by high-frequency traders and others.” He said that the traders were moving so fast that regulators could not keep up.The idea that shadowy computer masterminds were trying to disrupt the nation’s stock trading struck many people as ridiculous. Wall Street experts generally characterize it as a conspiracy theory with little basis in fact.But some of the patterns suggested that traders might have been testing their high-speed computers, perhaps to see how rivals would react.Or it may just be that the computers produced so much data so quickly that exchanges simply could not cope with the onslaught.“We live in a day when things are measured in milliseconds,” said Sang Lee of the Aite Group, a financial services consulting company. “It is meant to be a level playing field, but if you have better technology you will have the edge.”Back in Chicago, Mr. Hunsader of Nanex is still not sure what his crop circles mean. But that does not stop him from admiring them.“The patterns are quite beautiful,” he said. “We can’t see any economic reasons for what they are doing.”'"
"'10-08-23,'0','A van Gogh painting valued by some experts at $50 million was stolen from a Cairo museum on Saturday, Egypt’s minister of culture announced. Egyptian law enforcement officials blamed lax security at the Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil Museum for the incident, saying that none of its alarms and only a few of its surveillance cameras were working when the painting (above, known as “Poppy Flowers” and “Vase and Flowers”), a depiction of a vase filled with yellow poppies, was sliced from its frame and taken. The culture minister, Farouk Hosni, announced shortly after the disappearance of the painting was made public that it had been recovered at the Cairo airport and that two Italians had been arrested in connection with theft. But Mr. Hosni said later that he had been given bad information and that the search continued. Egypt’s top prosecutor, Abdel Meguid Mahmoud, told the BBC that the museum’s security system was nothing more than a “facade.” He said museum officials had been looking for spare parts to mend the system but “hadn’t managed to find them.”'"
"'10-08-23,'0','For almost three decades beginning in 1936, many African-American travelers relied on a booklet to help them decide where they could comfortably eat, sleep, buy gas, find a tailor or beauty parlor, shop on a honeymoon to Niagara Falls, or go out at night. In 1949, when the guide was 80 pages, there were five recommended hotels in Atlanta. In Cheyenne, Wyo., the Barbeque Inn was the place to stay.A Harlem postal employee and civic leader named Victor H. Green conceived the guide in response to one too many accounts of humiliation or violence where discrimination continued to hold strong. These were facts of life not only in the Jim Crow South, but in all parts of the country, where black travelers never knew where they would be welcome. Over time its full title — “The Negro Motorist Green Book: An International Travel Guide” — became abbreviated, simply, as the “Green Book.” Those who needed to know about it knew about it. To much of the rest of America it was invisible, and by 1964, when the last edition was published, it slipped through the cracks into history.Until he met a friend’s elderly father-in-law at a funeral a few years ago, the Atlanta writer Calvin Alexander Ramsey had never heard of the guide. But he knew firsthand the reason it existed. During his family trips between Roxboro, N.C., and Baltimore, “we packed a big lunch so my parents didn’t have to worry about having to stop somewhere that might not serve us,” recalled Mr. Ramsey, who is now 60.He is among the writers, artists, academics and curators returning a spotlight to the guide and its author, emblematic as it was of a period when black Americans — especially professionals, salesmen, entertainers and athletes — were increasingly on the move for work, play and family visits.In addition to hotels, the guide often pointed them to “tourist homes,” privates residences made available by their African-American owners. Mr. Ramsey has written a play, “The Green Book,” about just such a home, in Jefferson City, Mo., where a black military officer and his wife and a Jewish Holocaust survivor all spend the night just before W. E. B. DuBois is scheduled to deliver a speech in town. The play will inaugurate a staged-reading series on Sept. 15 at the restored Lincoln Theater in Washington, itself once a fixture of that city’s “black Broadway” on U Street.Julian Bond, the civil rights leader who is now a faculty member at American University, will take on a cameo role. Mr. Bond recalled that his parents — his father, a college professor, became the first black president of Lincoln University, in southern Pennsylvania — used the book. “It was a guidebook that told you not where the best places were to eat,” he said, “but where there was any place.”'"

"'10-08-24,'0','R. Edward Hendrick, a physicist who has studied breast imaging for almost 30 years, said he was motivated to quantify the radiation exposure from nuclear breast imaging technologies in a published paper because of similar concerns.“I would go to the international breast meeting and the big radiology meetings, and nobody had a clue what the doses and risks were,” Dr. Hendrick said. “They’re treating all the tests as if they have the same radiation dose and risk as mammography, and the truth is they have a much, much higher risk. The point of the paper was to say that not all the breast imaging procedures have comparable risks and doses.”Dr. Hendrick, a clinical professor of radiology at the University Colorado-Denver School of Medicine in Aurora, Colo., is a consultant to G.E. Healthcare regarding digital breast tomosynthesis, another breast imaging technique, and is on the medical advisory boards of Koning and Bracco, which make other imaging technologies.The nuclear technologies breast-specific gamma imaging (B.S.G.I.) and positron emission mammography (P.E.M.) are meant to be used as complements or adjuncts to mammography and ultrasound, once there is concern about a cancerous lesion, and not for routine screening. These technologies are also more useful in women who have very dense breast tissue, when mammography often does not provide clear images.But a single breast-specific gamma imaging or positron emission mammography exam exposes patients to a risk of radiation-induced cancer that is comparable to the risk from an entire lifetime of yearly mammograms starting at 40, according to Dr. Hendrick’s study.While digital mammography has an average lifetime risk of inducing 1.3 fatal breast cancers per 100,000 women aged 40 at exposure, a single B.S.G.I. exam was estimated to involve a lifetime risk 20 to 30 times greater in women aged 40, and the lifetime risk of a single P.E.M. was 23 times greater.Moreover, mammography only increases a woman’s risk for breast cancer while B.S.G.I. and P.E.M. increase the risk of cancer in other organs, such as the intestines, kidneys, bladder, gallbladder, uterus, ovaries and colon, the study said.There is also a concern that use of the imaging technologies will become more widespread and casual. “B.S.G.I. and P.E.M. are great tools for problem solving, if you have a patient with an abnormal mammogram and you’re not really sure,” said Dr. Rhodes. “The problem is these tests are now being considered and even being used in some cases as screening tests, and this is not appropriate.”“I’m not saying ‘Don’t do the test,’ I’m just saying ‘Don’t prescribe these tests willy-nilly like you would an ultrasound exam,’ ” Dr. Hendrick said.In another paper in the same issue of Radiology, William R. Hendee, a distinguished professor of radiology, radiation oncology, biophysics and bioethics at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, called on radiologists to spearhead a campaign to reduce overuse of imaging technologies that expose patients to radiation unnecessarily and drive up health costs in the processSuggested proposals for curbing excessive use of imaging include developing national evidence-based appropriateness criteria for imaging, educating referring physicians and the public, curbing the physician practice of self-referral and finding ways to reduce duplicate exams.Companies that make the two nuclear-based breast imaging exams did not argue with the assessment of radiation exposure, but said the comparison with mammography — which exposes patients to very low levels of radiation, equivalent to about two months of natural background radiation — was inappropriate because the tests are used differently.“The comparison to mammography is a bit like comparing apples to oranges,” said Doug Kieper, vice president of science and technology for Dilon Technologies Inc., which developed the B.S.G.I. technology. “This is not being used as a screening procedure for the general asymptomatic population who have no indication of disease.” He added that studies were already under way to see if the same results could be obtained using lower doses of radiation.Guillaume Bailliard, vice president for marketing for Naviscan, which makes the P.E.M. scanner, said it should never be used as a tool for routine screening. “It is true that P.E.M. provides a higher dose than mammography,” he said, “but physicians balance the risk-to-benefit when making decisions.”'"
"'10-08-24,'0','On Monday, some of that anger returned, as the commission debated a proposal to impose a two-term limit.Politicians and civic advocates denounced a decision by the commission earlier this month to protect incumbents from any changes to the term-limits law.Under the proposal, sitting city officials would be given a chance at a third term even if voters approved a two-term limit. In addition, City Council members would be barred from making changes to term-limits laws that would affect them.Henry J. Stern, a former city parks commissioner, said any changes to the law should go into effect immediately.“An essential injustice is being done,” Mr. Stern said during public comments at the meeting, which was held at Baruch College. “You are wronging the people of New York.”The effort by several commission members to reverse course and deny a third term to incumbents failed.The effort had gained momentum in recent days, after Mr. Bloomberg publicly disagreed with the commission and said only officials in office in 2008 should be allowed to run for a third term.But John H. Banks, a member of the commission, said changing course would undermine the group’s independence. He said denying a third term would create inequalities in the Council and discriminate against those with less experience.“That would have a profound impact on people of color,” Mr. Banks said at the meeting.Several members also expressed concern that denying some city officials a third term, while granting it to others, would prompt legal challenges.The chairman of the commission, Matthew Goldstein, a mathematician who leads the City University of New York, compared the debate over term limits to “an infinite series that doesn’t have a convergence.” He delivered an impassioned speech arguing that the commission should avoid the perception that it had been bullied.“If we are manipulated into a solution, we’ve really lost our integrity,” Mr. Goldstein said.The group ultimately voted unanimously to support protecting incumbents from changes to the law, meaning it would not be fully put in effect until 2021.The commission was also criticized on Monday for consolidating its proposals into two ballot questions that totaled more than 300 words. Critics said the format would confuse voters and discourage participation.“In a decently working democracy, many of the current likely proposals should not be shoehorned into one question,” Gene Russianoff, a spokesman for the New York Public Interest Research Group, wrote in an e-mail.But at the meeting on Monday, Mr. Goldstein said lumping questions together was necessary to accommodate the city’s new electronic voting machines.Dick Dadey, executive director of Citizens Union, an influential government watchdog, called the issue an “unacceptable flaw in our new voting system.”In any case, Mr. Dadey said, voters would probably set aside the intricacies of term limits and decide based on their opinion of Mr. Bloomberg’s effort two years ago.“It’s going to be a very emotionally charged vote,” Mr. Dadey said. “They will be voting more in response to what was done in 2008 than on the actual substance of the question of term limits.”Voters supported a two-term limit in 1993 and 1996, and many political analysts expect them to do the same this year, given the lingering anger over the overturning of the law in 2008.Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir who has previously helped finance efforts in support of two-term limits, said through a spokesman Monday that he would review the exact wording of the ballot questions before deciding whether to lead a campaign in support of a two-term limit.The Working Families Party, the union-backed group that has often supported longer terms for elected officials, suggested Monday that it might campaign against the two-term limit this fall.“You want your legislators to be somewhat seasoned,” said Dan Levitan, a spokesman for the party. “The voters have to decide the rules of the game.”'"
"'10-08-24,'0','“What a Wonderful World” (1967), with words and music by Mr. Weiss and Bob Thiele, came to renewed attention after Armstrong’s recording of it was featured on the soundtrack of the 1987 film “Good Morning, Vietnam.” The Armstrong version has since become a contemporary standard.Mr. Weiss’s other standards include “Lullaby of Birdland” (1952), the vocal version of George Shearing’s jazz standard, and many songs with his frequent collaborator Bennie Benjamin, among them “Surrender” (1946), recorded by Perry Como; “Confess” (1948), recorded by Patti Page; and “Wheel of Fortune” (1952), recorded by Kay Starr.He collaborated on several Broadway musicals, the best known of which is “Mr. Wonderful” (1956), starring Sammy Davis Jr., for which Mr. Weiss contributed original music and lyrics with Jerry Bock and Larry Holofcener.His other Broadway credits include “First Impressions” (1959), an adaptation of Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” starring Polly Bergen, Hermione Gingold and Farley Granger, for which Mr. Weiss wrote music and lyrics with Robert Goldman and Glenn Paxton; and “Maggie Flynn” (1968), starring Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, with book, music and lyrics by Mr. Weiss, Mr. Peretti and Mr. Creatore.Mr. Weiss was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984. As president of the Songwriters Guild of America from 1982 to 2000, he spoke widely about copyright issues and testified before government bodies.George David Weiss was born in Manhattan on April 9, 1921. He wanted to be a musician. His mother wanted him to be a lawyer. The ensuing emotional battle, he later said, drove him to consult a doctor.As Mr. Weiss recounted in a 1995 interview with The Miami Herald, the prescription was simple. The doctor asked: “Mrs. Weiss, what would you rather have? A live bum of a musician or a dead lawyer?”Mr. Weiss, who played the violin, piano, saxophone and clarinet, earned a bachelor’s degree in music theory from the Juilliard School and afterward served as a military bandleader in World War II before beginning his songwriting career.Mr. Weiss’s first marriage, to Bea Foster, ended in divorce, as did his second, to Rosalyn Marks. In addition to his wife, the former Claire Nicholson, whom he married in 1976, he is survived by a sister, Harriet Harbus; two sons, Barry and Jeffrey, and a daughter, Peggy Self, from his first marriage; a son, Robert, from his second marriage; and eight grandchildren.In an interview with The Santa Fe New Mexican in 1995, Mr. Weiss described the making of one of his early hits, “Oh! What It Seemed to Be” (1946), written with Mr. Benjamin and Frankie Carle.After finding a publisher for the song, the writers went in search of a singer. They called on Frank Sinatra, and a nervous young Mr. Weiss played it through for him.“Before I had finished it Sinatra was on the phone calling the record company and telling them he just heard a great song and wanted to record it,” Mr. Weiss recalled. “You can imagine what happened to me — I froze at the piano. I just kept playing. See, the publisher had told me that no matter what happens, I should keep playing to make sure the tune got into their heads.”He continued: “So everyone sat down and discussed horses and women and gossip for a half hour or so, and I’m still playing that song at the piano.

"'10-08-24,'0','The question now is whether Mr. McCain’s sharp shift to the right during the campaign — the onetime maverick declared at one point that he no longer wanted anything to do with that label — will ultimately come back to haunt him and perhaps tarnish his legacy as a pragmatist willing to reach across the aisle.“I can’t get into the senator’s mind,” said Bruce Merrill, a longtime Arizona pollster and political analyst, who worked for Mr. McCain’s 1982 House campaign. “I don’t know if he’s become more conservative or if it’s just good politics. Nobody knows for sure — except the senator.”One key to Mr. McCain’s rebound was how he neutralized Mr. Hayworth’s, and Arizona’s, big issue — immigration. The senator endorsed Arizona’s immigration crackdown, known as 1070. He changed his mind on the necessity of the border fence, insisting that it was effective and declaring gruffly in one ad: “Complete the danged fence.” He also backpedaled fiercely on whether there ought to be a path to citizenship for those who entered the country against the rules, which in the past he has endorsed.Battling until the end, both candidates appeared Monday on a Tucson radio station. Mr. Hayworth urged voters to “shock the world” by voting him in while Mr. McCain sought to burnish his conservative credentials by likening himself to Ronald Reagan.Many of Mr. Hayworth’s wounds were self-inflicted. Portraying himself as a Washington outsider, Mr. Hayworth was hurt by campaign contributions he received from Jack Abramoff, the lobbyist sent to federal prison for fraud. And the McCain campaign uncovered an old infomercial of Mr. Hayworth offering advice on how taxpayers could finagle more money out of the federal government. The McCain campaign ran snippets and questioned Mr. Hayworth’s character. “Huckster?” the ad asked.“The best day of the campaign was the day that Hayworth announced,” said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the Cook Political Report. “It was all downhill from there.”Or as Chip Scutari, a Republican campaign consultant, put it: “The McCain-Hayworth battle royale never made it past the opening bell.”Although Mr. Hayworth won the support of some segment of the Tea Party movement, many conservative activists stayed neutral or sided with Mr. McCain, who campaigned vigorously through both traditional methods and social media.“Spent the day in Prescott Valley and Prescott. Now on my way to buy pie at the Rock Springs Cafe,” he told followers on Twitter over the weekend, tracking his movements through the state. So connected is Mr. McCain that he was recently named by university researchers as having the highest “Digital IQ” in the Senate. He currently has more than 1.7 million Twitter followers and more than 650,000 Facebook fans.Mr. Hayworth tried mightily to portray the senator as out of touch and politically malleable, points the Democrats were likely to drive home in the fall. “John McCain will do whatever it takes to keep his job,” Rodney Glassman, former vice mayor of Tucson, a leading Democratic contender, said Monday in gearing up for the general election.With Republicans and independents making up a bulk of the voters in the state, Democrats need something unexpected to unfold in order to win, like what happened in 1976.In that election, two Republican Senate candidates hammered each other so hard during the primary that the Republican Party was divided and a little-known Democrat, Dennis DeConcini, managed to eke out a victory.Reached on vacation in California, Mr. DeConcini, 73, who served 21 years in the Senate, made clear first that he was no fan of Mr. McCain. “We’re not the least bit friendly,” he said.Then he went on to analyze the candidate. “It’s not that I was above changing my positions, but McCain has made it an art form,” he said. “He was a maverick, but I guess he’s not anymore. One thing he is is vulnerable. He can’t change that.”'"
"'10-08-24,'0','After a tour here of the Andersons Inc., a diversified grain, rail and retail company that is a mainstay in northwestern Ohio, Mr. Portman dismissed suggestions that his time in the Bush White House and his image as a trusted adviser to the former president would be a significant liability or that voters would even be concerned about the past.“What the people in this plant want to know is what you are going to do for me going forward,” Mr. Portman said. “That is all they care about, and frankly that’s what voters care about.”“The world has moved on,” he added. “Maybe the Democrats haven’t.”Democrats are certainly not ready to move on in Mr. Portman’s case. They say they intend to make his record in the Bush administration a central element of the political argument against him.“Rob Portman is the No. 1 George Bush look-alike in the country,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and a Fisher supporter, said in an interview. “I just can’t believe the voters are going to choose the candidate who more than anybody else in the whole country represents what got us into this situation.”And though Mr. Fisher does not now have the financial resources to go toe-to-toe, Democrats say they expect organized labor and the Ohio Democratic Party to help fill the gap as they push for Mr. Fisher as part of an aggressive coordinated effort in a closely divided state where Democrats are also seeking re-election for Gov. Ted Strickland and to hold on to a number of contested House seats.With Ohio losing jobs overseas, Mr. Fisher said, Mr. Portman’s support of free-trade policies merits special scrutiny.“While you may have some other Senate candidates who supported George Bush’s policies, there is only one who was actually the architect of those policies,” Mr. Fisher said. “There is factory after factory that is closed directly as a result of Congressman Portman’s trade policies.”Mr. Portman is one of two Republican Senate candidates whom Democrats are trying to turn into pin-ups to remind voters of what happened when Republicans were in control of the White House and Congress. The other is Representative Roy Blunt, the former No. 2 House Republican, who is mounting a strong election bid in Missouri.Illustrating the Democratic investment in revisiting the Bush years, a new cable television advertisement paid for by the Democratic National Committee includes a clip of George W. Bush and asks voters if they want to “go back to the same Republican policies that got us into this mess.”Some analysts have questioned whether the anti-Bush theme is persuasive, and Mr. Portman said the Bush section of his résumé was rarely raised by Ohioans while he was out campaigning. He sees voters as more focused on the escalating deficit and the days ahead.Sent to Congress in a special election in 1993, Mr. Portman quickly became a young Republican star on budget and tax issues and was well-liked on both sides of the aisle because of his affability and willingness to work with the opposition. Considering that he started out as an associate counsel in the White House of the elder President Bush, Mr. Portman was a natural fit with the younger Mr. Bush, and even served as a stand-in for Al Gore during presidential debate preparations in 2000.He left Congress in 2005 to become the trade representative for the Bush White House. One year later, he took over as director of the Office of Management and Budget before returning to Ohio in 2007.He readily concedes that Republicans let spending get away from them, though he defends his own record, saying he pushed for more disclosure of earmarks, helped cut the deficit while at the budget office and persuaded the president to threaten to veto swollen spending bills.“After 9/11, people took their eye off spending,” Mr. Portman said. “Democrats got their social spending, and Republicans were more focused on national security and homeland security.”He makes no apologies for his support of free trade, saying Ohio companies and farmers need overseas markets.“That is the whole point of our proposals on trade: increasing exports and increasing enforcement so you have a level playing field so you can export more,” he said. “It is critical to Ohio’s economy.”Though Mr. Portman is running well, Democrats say they still see a solid chance for victory. They say the fact that polls still show the race as competitive despite Mr. Portman’s money advantage and the overall favorable political atmosphere for Republicans is evidence that his ties to the Bush administration are hurting him.“He is doing his best to run away from his own biography,” said Mr. Fisher, who accused Mr. Portman and other veteran Republicans of trying to gloss over their culpability in getting the nation off course.“They are denying they were at the scene of the crime,” Mr. Fisher said. “I don’t think it will work.”'"
"'10-08-24,'0','In its single biggest repayment of bailout loans so far, the American International Group said Monday that it was paying back more than $3.9 billion in taxpayer aid with proceeds from a recent debt sale.The insurer’s aircraft leasing company, the International Lease Finance Corporation, completed the sale of $4.4 billion in debt. A.I.G. will use more than $3.9 billion of the proceeds to repay the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, trimming the balance on its credit line with the Fed to about $15 billion. Adding interest, the total is about $21 billion.The emergency credit line was part of a $182 billion federal bailout package that A.I.G. received during the financial crisis to avoid collapse. A.I.G., which is based in New York, has been selling assets to pay back the aid.As of June 30, excluding the new payment, A.I.G. said its outstanding balance owed to the government stood at about $101 billion. The total includes debt as well as preferred shares of stock in A.I.G. held by the Treasury Department.A.I.G. said it would book a pretax charge of about $650 million against its earnings as a result of the repayment.'"
"'10-08-24,'0','No. Favre can pull this off because a training camp lasting several weeks is not essential. After not practicing with the Vikings until last Wednesday, he played one four-play series Sunday night, completing a pass and being sacked, in a 15-10 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.Manning did show up for camp. In the Giants’ first preseason game, against the Jets, he took a blind-side shot and needed 12 stitches to close a three-inch gash on his forehead, causing him to miss several days of practice. All because of a meaningless game.We talk a lot in sports about going for the glory. Where’s the glory in that?Football at the N.F.L. level is an injury game: if you play, you will be injured. The first regular-season game is little more than two weeks away, and there has already been a rash of season-shortening and season-ending injuries. Some injuries were sustained in practice, some in the so-called games.Who wants this? More to the point, who needs it?There was a time in professional football when the general manager and head coach never saw their players until it was time to report to camp. In those days, players held full-time jobs in the off-season and used training camp to get in shape. Now, most players train year-round and are in shape when they report.All N.F.L. teams hold minicamps, organized team activities (practices, sort of) and other off-season programs. But there is growing sentiment among some executives that teams may be overdoing it.“I don’t know if the body has enough time to recuperate because you’re seeing so many soft-tissue injuries,” Jerry Reese, the Giants’ general manager, said. “There’s more opportunity for injury because there’s so much more time on the field. Then you have training camp and you go double during training camp. And you see all across the league there are a bunch of injuries.”No one is advocating an end to training camp. Preparing for the violent nature of the game mandates camp. But why waste the N.F.L.’s most eye-catching element — its violence — in training camps and on meaningless preseason games?“You have to get calloused a little bit, because if you go out there and just start hitting people, it’s going to be even more injuries,” Reese said. “You have to have some kind of training camp to prepare your body to go through a 16-game season.“It’s a balancing act; I’m not sure how well we’re balancing it right now.”N.F.L. owners will meet on Wednesday in Atlanta to discuss, among other things, a proposal to expand the regular-season schedule to 18 games and eliminate two of the four preseason games.How can the N.F.L. wring its hands about player safety and health, then turn around and extend the regular season by two games? If owners add two games, they should compensate players by prorating their per-game salary over 18 games. Simple as that.Additionally, season-ticket holders should no longer be required to buy tickets for preseason games. Preseason games are a sham and everyone knows it. In a recent interview on Sirius NFL Radio, Commissioner Roger Goodell said: “I have heard very clearly from fans — they do not want the preseason games. They’re not seeing the players they want. They’re not seeing the kind of quality that they expect from the N.F.L. And they are meaningless games.”The proposal for a longer regular season will produce — or should produce — a significant public collision between the N.F.L. and the players association. In the preseason, veterans play sparingly. By effectively turning two preseason games into regular-season games, the veterans will have to work what amounts to two additional full-time shifts.As a condition of two added games, players must receive extra compensation and teams must have extra personnel. The preseason should be substantially shortened. Rookies and young players need training camp to play their way onto the team, but for veteran players, camp is just one more hazard.Giants linebacker Keith Bulluck said it did not make sense for players to beat one another up in camp “and then when we have to go play a team, we don’t have the player that we need.”Bulluck recalled that in his rookie season, in 2000, most teams held two-a-day practices with lots of contact. “It was physical, very physical, when I came in,” he said.Over the years, many teams have evolved toward more classroom work.“Last year in Tennessee, I don’t think we had any two-a-days,” Bulluck said. “We have morning meetings all day, then we go out and practice in the afternoon.”Referring to Giants camp, he added: “Not too many two-a-days here, either. I guess the coaches are beginning to understand that it’s more about the season. Beating the guys up in August doesn’t help in September, October, November and December.”This much is certain: training camp is an idea that has outlived its usefulness.'"
"'10-08-24,'0','An adult bighorn sheep can weigh well over 200 pounds. Just the horns of a large ram can weigh 30 pounds. So lambs need a great deal of nourishment to grow, and nursing can be draining on a mother, often leaving her weak.If she is going to survive, she needs to recover, and that is a problem for the next year’s lamb, according to a new study to be published in The American Naturalist.If a mother raises a healthy lamb one year, she is more likely to neglect her newborn the following year, instead focusing her efforts on regaining her own energy.Male lambs, in particular, require a lot of nourishment and the effects are exacerbated.“A lamb that is born after a brother has even less chance to survive,” said Marco Festa-Bianchet, an ecologist at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada, and one of the study’s authors.Lambs born after a male lamb have about 10 percent less chance of surviving their first year than those born after a female.Dr. Festa-Bianchet and his colleagues observed 146 bighorn sheep and 442 lambs over 35 years and five generations in Alberta.They evaluated the effort put in by mothers by measuring the weight gain or loss in the young lambs.In years when the weather was poor, mothers were even more likely to neglect their lambs.'"
"'10-08-24,'0','Until now, the oldest known fossils of animals were of a snail called Kimberella that lived 555 million years ago in Australia and Russia.Now, scientists believe they can push that date back tens of millions of years.Spongelike creatures may have existed 635 million years ago or earlier, during the Cryogenian period, according to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience.The researchers discovered multiple fossils in glacial deposits in South Australia that appeared to be slices of the same organism. Working in conjunction with a Brooklyn-based design studio, they were able to reconstruct the organism digitally.“We think it was about the size of a thumb,” said Adam Maloof, a geoscientist at Princeton and the study’s lead author. “And it just had a series of holes where it sucked sea water in, which helped keep it at the same temperature and pull in nutrients.”He and his colleagues suspect that the sponges had a hard shell, but do not yet have sufficient evidence to show this.'"
"'10-08-24,'0','A new study has found a surprising link between beer drinking in women and psoriasis, the autoimmune disease characterized by itchy, scaly skin.The researchers reported that women who had five or more full-calorie beers a week (but not those who drank light beer or other liquor) were at almost twice the risk for psoriasis.Beer is usually made from barley, and the starch used to ferment it contains glutens, which have been linked to psoriasis, said the study’s lead author, Dr. Abrar A. Qureshi, an assistant professor of dermatology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.The scientists tracked 82,869 psoriasis-free participants in the Nurses’ Health Study from 1991 until 2005. The women, who were 27 to 44 at the beginning of the study, provided information about their alcohol consumption every few years. By the end of the study, 1,150 of the nurses had developed psoriasis. The regular beer drinkers were 1.76 times as likely to have it as the others, independent of other risk factors like smoking, physical activity and weight, according to the study, published Aug. 16 in Archives of Dermatology.Though the study does not definitively prove that beer drinking leads to psoriasis, Dr. Qureshi said, the researchers did set it up to look for possible causes. “In terms of temporal sequence,” he continued, “the beer intake preceded the onset of psoriasis.”'"
"'10-08-24,'0','Arguments that a bridge was vital for San Francisco’s development as a modern metropolis and the demands of commuters from Marin County and beyond would prevail in the end, however, and the bridge would help fuel the Bay Area’s exponential growth in the decades to come.As it turns out, the years of wrangling over the bridge’s construction would lead to a design triumph. Mr. Starr describes the original plan of the Chicago entrepreneur Joseph Strauss as “an undistinguished example of industrial design” — an “upside-down rat trap,” in one opponent’s words. The revised blueprint, devised by a team of noted engineers and architects, would result in that rare thing: a triumph of design by committee.The self-promoting Strauss would get credit for the Golden Gate, but Mr. van der Zee wrote in his book that it was Charles Alton Ellis, a University of Illinois professor and design engineer with enormous mathematical prowess, who was really the presiding genius behind the bridge. In this volume, Mr. Starr acknowledges that “Strauss turned the design of the suspension system, which is to say, the very essence of the Bridge” over to Ellis, who together with the civil engineer Leon Moisseiff, would grapple with the daunting challenge of designing a super long suspension bridge, subject to the intense tidal actions of the strait below, as well as high winds, fog and possibly earthquakes.Crucial contributions, Mr. Starr says, were made by other consultants as well. Othmar Hermann Ammann (the chief designer of the George Washington Bridge) helped with the assembling of the bridge’s various components. John Eberson, a leading architect of movie theaters, developed the Art Deco vocabulary for the towers. And Irving Morrow, a local architect and skilled illustrator, refined those ideas further, accentuating, in Mr. Starr’s words, “the stepped-back segments rising vertically on all sides” of the twin towers.The actual process of building the bridge, which began in January 1933 and ended in the spring of 1937, would be herculean. Mr. Starr writes that “the construction of the anchorages involved the removal of 3.25 million cubic feet of earth and pouring of concrete into frameworks twelve stories high, the equivalent of building two skyscrapers”; and that each of the bridge’s two transverse cables was 36 3/8 inches in diameter and under “63 million pounds of pull or tension from its own weight.”Workers were perched 500 to 600 feet above the water and faced cold winds blowing in from the ocean. “In the summer,” Mr. Starr writes, “fog banks compounded the cold and obscured vision, which was a frightening thing, given the fact that at all times the Bridge site was an orchestration of dangerous objects in constant movement: steel being swung into place; tools and construction material being accidentally dropped; superheated rivets being heated aloft on precariously perched forges, then funneled through tubes to riveters working in near darkness inside the steel cells, or, if outside, tossed from forge to riveter through the air and caught with handheld funnels.”As for the bridge’s famous color, international orange, it was not an obvious choice. Mr. Starr reports that Ammann favored gray (as used for the George Washington Bridge), and others wanted black. While the Navy “preferred a yellow and black striping to facilitate visibility for ships entering or leaving the Gate through low-lying fog,” the Army Air Corps wanted a red-and-white color scheme more visible from the air. The reddish-orange paint was primer, used to protect the bridge against the elements, and it gradually went from being a default choice to the color of choice.In an over-the-top burst of purple prose, Mr. Starr observes that international orange not only “unified the Bridge into one compelling statement,” but also summoned memories of “the gold of the Gold Rush that had created the Bay Area, and the gold of the Golden Horn of the Bosporus first suggested by John Frémont when he named the site in 1846 and by metaphor evoked a color-drenched city of towers, domes, and stepped-back structures rising like Constantinople from blue waters along green hillsides, their red-tiled roofs touching a sun-flooded azure sea.”'"
"'10-08-24,'0','“If I were Major League Baseball, I’d be much more concerned if the Yankees’ numbers were released,” said Vince Gennaro, the author of “Diamond Dollars: The Economics of Winning in Baseball” and a consultant to several M.L.B. teams. “It would present a dramatic disparity and you’d begin to wonder how you can retain an economic structure that allows teams to earn such disparate amounts of money.”Had the statements provided only what the Rays, the Marlins and the Pirates received in revenue sharing, the leaks might be traced to someone disgruntled with the system of the higher-revenue clubs providing financial aid to those with lower revenue. But the leaked reports showed three teams that received money (the Marlins, the Rays and the Pirates) and two teams that paid into the pool (the Angels and the Mariners).“There is a group of people ticked off that revenue-sharing money isn’t being used to put a product out on the field, but in the owners’ pockets and that would be parties related to the players,” said Marc Ganis, a sports industry consultant. “But I don’t think the union has access to the audited financials.”The documents offer various glimpses into the generally rosy financial state of five teams, regardless of their records.¶The Pirates earned $29.4 million in 2007 and 2008 — taking $69.3 million in revenue sharing at the same time. Although the Pirates have the lowest team payroll in baseball, they have chosen to use revenue sharing for player development, and they spent $44.3 million in 2007 and 2008. “Even when we’re winning, we will be a revenue-sharing recipient,” Frank Coonelly, the Pirates’ president, told the A.P.¶The Marlins received nearly $92 million in revenue sharing in 2008 and 2009, the years detailed in the statements posted on Deadspin.com, while producing net income of $33 million in those years. The importance of the revenue-sharing money is underscored by the team’s gate receipts in 2008 ($20.9 million) and 2009 ($21.5 million). The franchise was paid only $16.7 million in local media revenue last year, compared with the $45.9 million the Angels were paid that year and the $64.3 million that the Mariners received in 2008.Samson said the Marlins’ decision to maintain a modest payroll and trade a star like Miguel Cabrera after the 2007 season was to save money to help finance its $645 million, retractable-roof ballpark, which is to open in 2012. The team must pay about one-quarter of the cost, with Miami and Miami-Dade County providing the rest. “We could have had Cabrera, but no ballpark,” he said. “That’s what I tell fans.”Earlier this year, the Marlins agreed to let baseball and the players’ union monitor their finances for three years to make sure that that they are spending the proceeds from revenue sharing on player development and salaries. The agreement forestalled a potential grievance by the union.¶The Rays received $74 million in revenue sharing in 2007 and 2008, and total net income in those years of a little more than $15 million. The effect of the Rays’ playing in the 2008 World Series is evident in the $17.7 million in postseason receipts it collected, increasing total revenue that season to $160.1 million.¶The Angels paid $31 million into the revenue-sharing pool in 2008 and 2009; the Mariners paid a little more than $24 million in 2007 and 2008. The Angels had combined earnings of $17.8 million in the two years covered in the reports; the Mariners lost $4.5 million in 2008 after showing a $17.9 million profit in 2007.The leaked documents were no more than a disappointment to Samson. They back the team’s case for its much-delayed ballpark. The information, he said, “basically confirms what we’ve said about how we’ve operated the team, with an eye toward one thing: that baseball would be secure in South Florida.”'"

"'10-08-25,'1','Judge Benjamin Kaplan, who as an Army officer helped craft the indictment of the Nazi war criminals who were tried at Nuremberg, and who later became a Harvard law professor and served nine years on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, died Aug. 18 at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 99.The cause was pneumonia, his son, Jim, said.In April 1945, President Harry S. Truman asked Justice Robert H. Jackson of the Supreme Court to be the chief prosecutor for the United States for the proposed trials of Nazi war criminals. The next month, Lt. Col. Kaplan, a Columbia Law School graduate who was working in procurement at the Pentagon, joined Justice Jackson’s staff at the request of the assistant secretary of war.That summer, Justice Jackson was in London, negotiating and writing the London Agreement, which was signed in August by France, Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States and delineated the procedures for the trial of war criminals by an international military tribunal. Colonel Kaplan remained in Washington, where, along with Col. Telford Taylor, he supervised a legal staff that was gathering and analyzing vast quantities of evidence, researching the means used by the Nazis to gain control of Germany and developing legal theories for the case.He later joined Justice Jackson in London and that September was a central figure in the drafting of the American contribution to the indictment, which dealt with proving that there had been a common plan or conspiracy to commit “crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.”Colonel Kaplan was present when the indictment was filed with the International Military Tribunal, and he worked on trial preparation until his Army discharge, shortly after the trials began on Nov. 20, 1945. The next year the Army awarded him the Bronze Star for his work.'"
"'10-08-25,'1','In opening arguments on Tuesday in the trial of four men accused of trying to blow up Bronx synagogues and shoot down military planes in May 2009, there seemed to be little disagreement that the defendants were offered something for joining the plot.The only question — the central question — was what.A prosecutor, Adam Hickey, said the men were offered opportunities to commit terrorism, and took them. The man he called the leader of the plot, James Cromitie, “spewed forth hatred and a thirst for violence” in recorded conversations with a government informant, Mr. Hickey said.“He was not vague; he was not subtle,” Mr. Hickey said. “He said he wanted to do something to America.”But defense lawyers argued that their clients were a desperate, unsophisticated bunch with criminal records and dim job prospects who were illegally entrapped. They were offered money, the lawyers said, by a polished government informant who drove late model cars, paid for their meals and travel and promised more money when the job was done.The trial, in federal district court in Manhattan, will be filled with competing portraits of the defendants. Mr. Hickey spoke of their careful planning, while their own lawyers — resorting to slights at times, or outright ridicule — drew a picture of four hapless men who struggled just to get through a day.'"
"'10-08-25,'1','A new report on retail prices of brand-name drugs shows the 217 products most used by older Americans increased by an average of 8.3 percent during 2009, the largest increase in years, even as inflation was negative.Over the last five years, according to the report to be released on Wednesday by the senior lobby AARP, the retail prices for the most popular brand-name drugs increased 41.5 percent, while the consumer price index rose 13.3 percent. An AARP official called for measures to hold down drug prices.Drug industry officials challenged the finding, however, saying select brand-name prices did not reflect the reality of more people using low-price generic drugs. Generics now account for about 75 percent of all dispensed prescriptions in the United States, according to IMS Health, a research firm.The industry pointed to a broader survey of drug prices showing they rose by 3.4 percent during 2009. The survey, conducted by the government for its official Consumer Price Index, includes generic as well as brand-name drug prices, Jonathan Church, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said on Tuesday.John A. Vernon, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, praised the AARP for changing its methods to count retail prices instead of wholesale prices. But Professor Vernon, who had consulted for drug companies and challenged the AARP wholesale price report at a Congressional hearing last year, said its new report was still flawed.“It can easily be shown that branded prices are higher here than they are in other countries, but we have the lowest and the most competitively priced generic drugs in the world, and the generic share is going up rapidly,” he said. “Just focusing on brands I think is unfair.”'"
"'10-08-25,'1','Bobby Bowden said he did not want to retire as Florida State’s coach after last season, ending his career after 44 seasons as a head coach. “Fired might be a little too strong,” he said. “Pushed out ain’t bad.

The commission accused the French government of “stigmatizing Roma migrants” and holding them “collectively responsible for criminal offenses.” On Sunday, Pope Benedict XVI urged French pilgrims “to accept human diversity” and French Cardinal André Vingt-Trois was promised a meeting with the interior minister to discuss the France’s Roma policy, which the government defends as strategy to fight crime and illegal immigration.

At most, chickens will be guaranteed room to spread their wings. They will still lack the freedom to engage in natural behaviors like foraging and nesting. Most will never know sunlight, breezes, plants or soil.At our farm sanctuary, we see how much chickens rescued from factory farms delight in these experiences.

"'10-08-25,'1','Mangold, 26, said he never set out to become the highest-paid center, but his deal surpassed the guaranteed $20 million that St. Louis gave Jason Brown last off-season. Not that Mangold, who has started every game since the Jets selected him in the first round in 2006, took issue with his raise. He called it “fantastic” and “overwhelming” and said he had yet to “wrap my head around it.”Kris Jenkins, the defensive tackle who grapples with Mangold every day in practice, said Mangold had earned the extension. When Jenkins arrived in 2008, he found Mangold “a little bit nervous and jittery,” with a personality Jenkins compared to that of the actor Seth Rogen and the unruly long hair that reminded Jenkins of a Viking.At their first practice, Jenkins said, he told Mangold that he possessed an endless supply of talent, potential waiting to be seized. Now, Jenkins reserves his highest praise for Mangold.“Nick has transformed so much,” Jenkins said. “Honestly, Nick is the best technical center I’ve ever played against.”Mangold said the Jets approached him “out of the blue” about two weeks ago. Before he reported to training camp, Mangold thought negotiations would not resume until after this season. At least until Woody Johnson, the Jets’ owner, and General Manager Mike Tannenbaum came to him and said they wanted to finish the deal.Mangold’s signing meant that the Jets have taken care of two of their so-called Core Four before the season started. Offensive tackle D’Brickashaw Ferguson also received an extension. Linebacker David Harris has not and probably will not until after the season. Indications are that Revis could be next. After being absent for 24 days, he owes nearly $400,000 in fines.Mangold declined to guess if coming to training camp had helped him. “You’re going to have to ask them,” he said. “I don’t know. I don’t know if that was in their thought process.”MCNABB WON’T PLAY VS.

"'10-08-25,'1','The new campaign, like its predecessor, is being created by the Los Angeles office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.Switching to a discussion of innovation is intended to convey a leadership position for the Nissan brand, said Rob Schwartz, chief creative officer at TBWA/Chat/Day Los Angeles, who joined Mr. Brancheau for the interview.The goal is not to play up “innovation for innovation’s sake,” Mr. Schwartz said, but rather to concentrate on what he called “human-centric innovation,” as conveyed through displays of new products like the Leaf and the highlighting of features found on Nissan products.In introducing a brand image campaign, Nissan North America joins a lengthening list of major marketers that includes AT&T and Procter & Gamble.The trend signals that advertisers focused mostly on short-term sales during the worst of the economic downturn are beginning to raise their sights to the point where they want to also try burnishing brand images.“We’re moving ahead,” Mr. Brancheau said, despite the recent signs that the economic recovery is sputtering. “Economically, we do think there is light at the end of the tunnel.”Another purpose of the campaign is to “drive a stake in the ground,” he added, to show consumers how committed Nissan is to improving its products.In the next two years, Nissan North America will “turn over 80 percent of our portfolio,” Mr. Brancheau said, as “many of our core models” like the Quest minivan are replaced with new versions.“This is a window in time that’s certainly important in terms of our growth,” he added. “We don’t anticipate backing off at all.”Nissan is having a good 2010 to date, with sales in the United States through July totaling 522,669, up 24.6 percent, from 419,591 in the first seven months of 2009.“Shift,” which was introduced in 2002, will remain for now in ads in the United States, but it will be played down as “Innovation for all” is played up. The “Shift” theme will continue as the brand theme in the rest of the world, Mr. Brancheau said.“We’ll monitor how well ‘Innovation’ is working and evaluate whether to keep ‘Shift,’ ” he added.The lighter touch that Nissan and TBWA/Chiat/Day hope to add to the brand image is typified by a moment in one commercial in which Mr. Downey suggests that Nissans might someday be equipped with force fields.And in a spot for the Leaf, a polar bear is shown leaving its native habitat as the ice melts and traveling through unfamiliar landscapes until arriving in a suburban driveway. It at first seems as if the commercial will be a plaintive paean for environmental conservation.But the spot takes a wry turn as the bear goes up to the owner of the Leaf and gives him a fervent, well, bear hug, to thank him for buying the car.The intent is to offer “a little twist, perhaps a wink,” Mr. Brancheau said, to offer some relief from the serious tack that so many car ads take.The sound at the end of each Nissan spot is reminiscent of the so-called aural branding that Intel does in its commercials.“We’re calling it the sound of innovation,” Mr. Schwartz said, adding that each commercial is to begin and end with a brief flash of light — and yes, he called it the “flash of innovation.”The sound and lights are to help the spots stand out amid the sea of auto advertisements.The hope is that the arrival of Mr. Downey, who replaces a voice-over announcer named Dave Hoffman, will instill “a very confident tone” in Nissan’s brand communications, Mr. Brancheau said, “whether people recognize the voice or not.”The “Innovation for all” theme echoes one that briefly appeared in recent ads for Chevrolet, “Excellence for all.” The Chevy theme was discontinued when a new vice president for marketing, Joel Ewanick, joined the Chevrolet parent, General Motors.“It’s a different idea,” Mr. Brancheau said of the focus on innovation, adding that even if Chevrolet had kept its theme, “I’m not sure we would have wavered” in making the change in brand themes.Nissan North America will increase ad spending drastically this year compared with last year, Mr. Brancheau said, but declined to be specific.Nissan North America spent $449.1 million last year to advertise in major media, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, down 43.9 percent from the $800.2 million spent in 2008.For the first five months of 2010, Kantar Media reported, Nissan North America ad spending totaled $249.1 million, up 23.4 percent, from the $201.8 million spent in the first five months of 2009.'"
"'10-08-25,'1','An e-book battle between Random House and the Wylie Agency appears to have ended.After a monthlong standoff, Random House said on Tuesday that it now held the rights to publish e-book editions of 13 classic books that the literary agent Andrew Wylie had defiantly begun publishing last month under his own digital venture, Odyssey Editions.Random House also said it would immediately resume doing new business with the Wylie Agency. Since July 22, the publisher has refused to acquire new books from the Wylie Agency and its more than 700 clients.“We are pleased to announce that the Wylie Agency and Random House have resolved our differences over the disputed Random House titles which have been included in the Odyssey Editions e-book publishing program,” said a joint statement signed by Markus Dohle, the chairman and chief executive of Random House, and Mr. Wylie. It added: “We both are glad to be able to put this matter behind us.”The dispute erupted in July, when Mr. Wylie announced that he was starting Odyssey Editions, which would release e-books exclusively through Amazon’s Kindle store.Book contracts that were signed before e-books existed typically do not make clear who owns the rights to publish the digital editions, so many authors and agents say they are free to sell them to whomever they wish. Some publishers are currently negotiating to capture e-book rights to older books and amending their old contracts, but publishers and agents tend to disagree on a fair royalty rate for authors.'"

"'10-08-25,'1','WHEN Stumptown Coffee Roasters opens its coffee bar in Red Hook, Brooklyn, early next month, it will be missing something that people have come to expect of such establishments: espresso.There will be only coffee brewed by the cup. The selection, depending on the season, could be staggering. You will be able to drink from the full range of beans roasted there, as many as 35 selections, including rare crops like the Mario Carnival from Hacienda La Esmeralda.“We’re going all-brew because that’s how most people make coffee,” said Duane Sorenson, the owner of Stumptown.“At our coffee bar in Red Hook we’re putting the focus on the bag of coffee and showing our customers how to brew that coffee correctly,” he added.They will sell all the gear they have for making coffee, and will use six different methods: the classic French press, and Chemex and Melitta filters, along with the newly fashionable AeroPress and Hario V60 filter, and the Clever Coffee Dripper.The 900-square-foot space shares a warehouse with the roaster, which opened last year, and still feels raw.

"'10-08-25,'1','Mr. Geckeler has encountered coffee bars as varied as Barismo, in Arlington, Mass.; Broadway Café in , ; and and Tea in the neighborhood of . The place that best sums up the philosophy for him is the counter in the back of Flora Grubb Gardens, a store in .“It’s really lovely,” Mr. Geckeler said. “You have a couple of bar stools and the baristas are right there, so the conversation just naturally happens.”The conversation seems to happen over shorter drinks like espresso and coffee brewed by the cup. A four-ounce cortado is a pleasant drink at a bar stool. A 20-ounce latte demands a chair.A major inspiration for the new coffee bars is , where an espresso is often treated as a quick refueling stop.“I spent a semester in Rome when I was in college, and coffee there is: you come in, you pay, you get it, you drink it, you slam it and you’re out the door,” said Matthew Schnepf, an architect, who meets Brian Crooks, a designer, once a week or so at the narrow bar inside Stumptown Coffee Roasters at the in . “It’s not such a precious event.”“It feels less suburban and more urban,” Mr. Crooks said. Indeed, the Ace Hotel Stumptown gets so much traffic that it has become one of the busiest coffee stores in the city.Earlier this summer, the Bluebird Coffee Shop in the East Village replaced half its tables and most of the chairs with two counters and a few stools.“A coffee shop should be a place to meet your friends and hold conversations and cultivate ideas instead of — I’m going to get in trouble for saying this, so I have to be careful — instead of sticking your head in a laptop,” said Mark Connell (who owns Bluebird with his wife, Jessica), before adding that computers are always welcome at the few remaining LP-size tables.But the new order has its discontents. A reviewer on who liked the coffee at Bluebird gave it a poor rating because she didn’t have room for her homework. And the restaurant blog Eater nominated its window counter for the “Worst Outdoor Seating in New York” feature because it is “so small it can’t even hold an .”Despite these complaints, the design of many new coffee bars betrays a great deal of thought. The richly grained black-walnut counters of Caffetteria, a coffee bar that opened in SoHo in June, were milled from a single tree in upstate New York. The owners, Bryan Waites and Aaron Nice, outfitted the spare and elegant room with state-of-the-art equipment — including a rare pair of slow drippers from — that will beguile certain caffeine aficionados far more than a comfortable chair would.“Tables create a feeling of territorialism,” Mr. Waites said. “There’s nothing wrong with it, it’s just not what we’re shooting to offer.”Coffee shops weren’t always workplaces. The first essentially sold beans and gear when it opened in in 1971. Seating was on a single pew. As the company grew, “the stores went from mercantile in nature to what we call coffeehouses,” said Arthur Rubinfeld, president for global development of Starbucks. “We were reacting to the customers’ changing habits.”The spread of coffeehouses coincided with the rise of the portable office, as growing numbers of people conducted their working lives with a laptop and wireless signal. By the early 1990s, Starbucks locations were averaging 1,600 square feet and offering a range of pastries, sandwiches and other food.Some coffee-bar owners say their tiny spaces and lower rents allow them to concentrate on what they do best. When Stumptown Coffee Roasters opens its second New York coffee bar next month, in Red Hook, Brooklyn, baristas there will be focused on brewed coffee to the exclusion of almost everything else, including espresso (see accompanying article). They would not have time — or space — to master six kinds of brewing gear, plus iced coffee, if they had to grill panini, too.“If you’re a proprietor and you’re paying those rents, you need to augment your coffee with other products,” said Kevin Cuddeback, the owner of Gimme! Coffee. “Just try to be as good with sandwiches and soups as you are with espresso.” The third location of Gimme! Coffee will open in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, this fall, with only counters and bar stools.Some proprietors are hedging their bets. When Starbucks overhauled its location on Spring Street in SoHo in April, it installed a wooden counter and a coffee bar with a few stools, in addition to the expected tables and chairs.Kate Sebbah, a fashion stylist who was enjoying a leisurely latte at a table inside Ground Support in SoHo last week, said she never drinks at the counter. “I don’t find it relaxing,” she said. “With my job I go from place to place to place. This is a time to sit down, relax, compose my thoughts.”According to Steven Sadoff, the owner, that is typical. “Espresso drinkers will go to the bar,” Mr. Sadoff said. “Pretty much everybody else sits.” Mr. Sadoff said he doesn’t mind when customers park in his establishment with a laptop. Except, that is, when he’s asked to provide tech support for the Wi-Fi.'"

Without any match play, Williams, 30, will have to rely on a career’s worth of experience and a closet full of new dress designs to propel her.“I had a tough summer with some bad luck with my leg,” she said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday afternoon. “I am still training,” she said, adding, “I am ready for the Open, thank God.”Williams, who won the Open in 2000 and 2001, has not won a Grand Slam tournament since Wimbledon in 2008.She is the No. 3-seeded player in the Open draw (and the only woman from the United States to be among the 32 seeded players), behind Kim Clijsters and Caroline Wozniacki.Williams will be the family’s only representative at the Open this year. Her younger sister, Serena, the No. 1 player on the WTA Tour, pulled out of the tournament last week, citing her recovery from right foot surgery.Less than a week after winning Wimbledon, Serena sliced her right foot on a piece of broken glass at a restaurant in Munich. Venus did not want to elaborate on her sister’s injury and said she did not witness it.“It’s a big disappointment for her, after her playing so well and winning the year before — it’s just bad luck,” Venus Williams said. “I know she’ll support me all the way through and I know there will be another Open for her.”Venus Williams pulled out of last week’s Rogers Cup in Montreal because of lingering pain. She admitted that in preparation for the United States Open, “it would have been ideal to play at least one event.” She added, “I am just trying to play points in practice and really rely on my experience.”At 2 p.m. on Thursday, Williams will share that experience with a live Internet audience, as she conducts a tennis clinic on Randall’s Island in New York for Polo Ralph Lauren.Even if Williams seems uncertain just how ready her mind and knee will be, at least her outfits are ready to wear.Williams caused a stir at the French Open for her flouncy black-lace, red-trimmed dress with skin-colored undershorts, but she was unable to make it past the Round of 16.As for her United States Open design? “It’s very New York,” she said. “Just like my dress at the French Open was very French.“It’s a little bit louder, a little bit more in your face, it’s — however you want to put it — a little more sexy.” LIZ ROBBINS'"
"'10-08-25,'1','What Mr. Morgenthau has never said in his public statements describing his relationships with Mr. Rangel and Mr. Isenberg is that he was an investor in Mr. Isenberg’s oil drilling company at the time he arranged and attended two meetings between the two men, meaning his finances stood to be affected by the fate of the tax break.The New York Times first asked Mr. Morgenthau about his holdings in early 2009, shortly after Mr. Rangel’s contacts with Mr. Isenberg became public. Mr. Morgenthau would not say how much stock he owned in the company, Nabors Industries. He would not, in fact, confirm that he held stock in the company.But Mr. Morgenthau’s financial disclosure forms filed at the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board indicate that he owned stock in Nabors during 2006 and 2007, when the meetings between Mr. Rangel and Mr. Isenberg took place. The dollar amount of his stake in the company had been redacted, at Mr. Morgenthau’s request, as had many of the particulars of his other financial holdings. It is not possible, then, to determine the value of his holdings in the company at the time, or when he may have bought or sold stock.Mr. Morgenthau said in 2009 that he had no idea that the company was asking Mr. Rangel or the Ways and Means Committee, of which Mr. Rangel became chairman in January 2007, to help save its tax shelter at the time of the meetings. He added that he never discussed Nabors’s tax issue with either the congressman or Mr. Isenberg.Later in 2009, after The Times had obtained a heavily redacted version of Mr. Morgenthau’s financial disclosure forms, Mr. Morgenthau said that he did not know if the value of his holdings in Nabors might have been affected by Mr. Rangel’s decision to help preserve the tax shelter in 2007 — an action that saved the company $650 million, according to a recent study.Of his decision to introduce the two men, Mr. Morgenthau said, “I was just trying to support a worthy cause.” He cited what he called City College’s commitment to diversity and its efforts to offer an education of high quality to minority students and low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. Mr. Morgenthau was interviewed by the ethics committee about his role in setting up the meetings between Mr. Rangel and Mr. Isenberg, but would not say whether his ownership of Nabors stock was discussed.Mr. Rangel’s work to raise money for City College’s Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service is one of several issues the House ethics committee is examining in its inquiry into his fund-raising and personal finances. The investigative subcommittee charged Mr. Rangel with 13 violations of Congressional ethics rules, on issues including accepting a rent-stabilized apartment from a Manhattan developer, failure to report $500,000 in assets on his financial disclosure forms and failure to pay taxes on rental income from a Dominican villa.Mr. Morgenthau, who has known both Mr. Isenberg and Mr. Rangel for decades, set up two meetings to talk about a donation and hosted the first at the Manhattan district attorney’s office in September 2006.After Mr. Isenberg donated $100,000 in December 2006, the three men met for a follow-up discussion about the contribution, this time at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. That meeting took place on Feb. 12, 2007, the day the bill that affected the tax loophole was up before Mr. Rangel’s committee.In interviews in late 2008, Mr. Morgenthau, Mr. Rangel and Mr. Isenberg all gave similar accounts of the two meetings, and said that they did not discuss the tax shelter either in the district attorney’s office or at the Carlyle. (Mr. Isenberg has since given a different version of events: When questioned about the matter at a June 2, 2009, shareholders meeting, he said he did not meet with Mr. Morgenthau and Mr. Rangel at the Carlyle on Feb. 12, 2007.)After the discussion with Mr. Morgenthau at the Carlyle ended on Feb. 12, 2007, Mr. Rangel walked across the hotel lobby and met with Mr. Isenberg and Kenneth J. Kies, a Nabors lobbyist. Mr. Kies said that he asked Mr. Rangel about the tax shelter during that conversation and that the congressman assured him that he would oppose efforts to close the loophole.Mr. Isenberg insisted there was “absolutely no quid pro quo” linking his donation to City College with Representative Rangel’s support for the tax shelter. Mr. Rangel said that he opposed efforts to close the loophole because he considered it an unfair retroactive tax increase, and that Mr. Isenberg’s donation to City College did not factor into his decision.In releasing the findings of its two-year investigation last month, the ethics committee charged that Mr. Rangel had violated its code by asking Mr. Isenberg for donations at a time when he had business before the Ways and Means Committee.“Reasonable persons could construe contributions to the Rangel Center by persons with interests before the Ways and Means Committee as influencing the performance of Respondent’s governmental duties,” the investigative subcommittee concluded.A public hearing on the charges before the ethics committee is expected to begin in September.Mr. Rangel will be permitted to call defense witnesses at the hearing, so it is possible that Mr. Morgenthau could be called to testify on his behalf.Since Mr. Rangel was charged in late July and Mr. Morgenthau spoke out in his defense, The Times has tried to interview both men about the stock ownership, and each has declined.Mr. Morgenthau, 91, who retired in January after 35 years as Manhattan district attorney, has declined to release an unredacted copy of his disclosure form, or to allow reporters to review investment account statements regarding his stock holdings in Nabors. He said that if specifics about his finances were made public, his family might be put at risk from one of the thousands of criminals he had put behind bars during his lengthy career as a prosecutor.The Conflicts of Interest Board does not require elected officials to report whether they bought or sold any assets during the calendar year. But Mr. Morgenthau said in 2009 that he had not sold any of his stock in the company since 2004 — years before he arranged the meeting between Mr. Rangel and Nabors.He also provided a signed affidavit from his accountant, Samuel J. August, asserting that Mr. Morgenthau had not bought, sold or received dividends from his Nabors Industries stock in 2006, 2007 or 2008.Mr. Morgenthau said in an interview that he bought stock in the company shortly after its bankruptcy 20 years ago and became friends with Mr. Isenberg.The two men have had extensive discussions about tax issues in the past, Mr. Morgenthau said, particularly in 2002, when he argued against Nabors’s plans to seek the lucrative tax shelter by establishing an office in Bermuda. The company went ahead with the offshore move in 2004, however, and Mr. Morgenthau said he was so disappointed by the decision that he sold half of his Nabors holdings.“I did not know then, and do not know now, whether Mr. Isenberg was seeking Congressman Rangel’s support for a so-called tax loophole,” Mr. Morgenthau said in an e-mail last year.Mr. Rangel said through a spokesman that he was unaware of Mr. Morgenthau’s financial interest in Nabors at the time of the meetings, but did not believe it posed a conflict of interest.In an interview after the ethics charges were released, the congressman said that the fact that his dealings with Nabors had been arranged by Mr. Morgenthau, who was at the time one of the nation’s most experienced and esteemed prosecutors, helped substantiate Mr. Rangel’s public assertions that he did nothing improper.“One of the biggest allegations was a result of my friendship with Robert Morgenthau,” Mr. Rangel said in an interview with The New York Daily News after charges were released. “Mother Teresa wasn’t involved, but I don’t know what the heck it takes for people to say, well, let me take a look, another look, at the answers he gave publicly.”'"
"'10-08-25,'1','NEW DELHI, India (AP) — India on Tuesday refused permission to a London-based company to mine bauxite for its alumina refinery in the country’s east, citing violations of environmental and human rights laws.The company, Vedanta Resources, set up an alumina refinery in Orissa state in 2008 hoping it would be allowed to extract three million metric tons of bauxite annually from mines in the Niyamgiri Hills. It has been getting bauxite from neighboring Chhattisgarh state.But the environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, said a panel appointed by his ministry had found violations by Vedanta of laws dealing with environmental protection, forest conservation and the rights of indigenous people in the region.“There is no emotion, no politics in this decision. I have taken a decision in a purely legal approach,” Mr. Ramesh said.Vedanta and its local partner, the state-owned Orissa Mining Corporation, had applied for environmental clearances for mining in Orissa state from the federal and state governments, but Vedanta drew increasing criticism from rights groups. Bauxite is used for producing alumina, a material used to make aluminum.Amnesty International said this year that the planned mine in the Niyamgiri Hills threatened the existence of the Dongria Kondh — an 8,000-member tribe of indigenous people who consider the surrounding mineral-rich hills sacred.'"
"'10-08-25,'1','But by spending freely and by acting as if he might lose, the senator managed to turn things around. Mr. McCain tapped into money left over from his failed presidential effort, spending more than $20 million (compared with about $3 million for Mr. Hayworth) making his visage and his harsh attacks on Mr. Hayworth omnipresent on Arizona’s airwaves. Mr. McCain’s spending was among the highest ever for a Senate primary in Arizona and, depending on turnout, could translate into more than $75 a vote, political analysts said.The question now is whether Mr. McCain’s sharp shift to the right during the campaign — the onetime maverick declared at one point that he no longer wanted anything to do with that label — will ultimately come back to haunt him and perhaps tarnish his legacy as a pragmatist willing to reach across the aisle.“I can’t get into the senator’s mind,” said Bruce Merrill, a longtime Arizona pollster and political analyst, who worked for Mr. McCain’s 1982 House campaign. “I don’t know if he’s become more conservative or if it’s just good politics. Nobody knows for sure — except the senator.”One key to Mr. McCain’s rebound was how he neutralized Mr. Hayworth’s, and Arizona’s, big issue — immigration. The senator endorsed Arizona’s immigration crackdown, known as 1070. He changed his mind on the necessity of the border fence, insisting that it was effective and declaring gruffly in one ad: “Complete the danged fence.” He also backpedaled fiercely on whether there ought to be a path to citizenship for those who entered the country against the rules, which in the past he has endorsed.Battling until the end, both candidates appeared Monday on a Tucson radio station. Mr. Hayworth urged voters to “shock the world” by voting him in while Mr. McCain sought to burnish his conservative credentials by likening himself to Ronald Reagan.Many of Mr. Hayworth’s wounds were self-inflicted. Portraying himself as a Washington outsider, Mr. Hayworth was hurt by campaign contributions he received from Jack Abramoff, the lobbyist sent to federal prison for fraud. And the McCain campaign uncovered an old infomercial of Mr. Hayworth offering advice on how taxpayers could finagle more money out of the federal government. The McCain campaign ran snippets and questioned Mr. Hayworth’s character. “Huckster?” the ad asked.“The best day of the campaign was the day that Hayworth announced,” said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the Cook Political Report. “It was all downhill from there.”Or as Chip Scutari, a Republican campaign consultant, put it: “The McCain-Hayworth battle royale never made it past the opening bell.”Although Mr. Hayworth won the support of some segment of the Tea Party movement, many conservative activists stayed neutral or sided with Mr. McCain, who campaigned vigorously through both traditional methods and social media.“Spent the day in Prescott Valley and Prescott. Now on my way to buy pie at the Rock Springs Cafe,” he told followers on Twitter over the weekend, tracking his movements through the state. So connected is Mr. McCain that he was recently named by university researchers as having the highest “Digital IQ” in the Senate. He currently has more than 1.7 million Twitter followers and more than 650,000 Facebook fans.Mr. Hayworth tried mightily to portray the senator as out of touch and politically malleable, points the Democrats were likely to drive home in the fall. “John McCain will do whatever it takes to keep his job,” Rodney Glassman, former vice mayor of Tucson, a leading Democratic contender, said Monday in gearing up for the general election.With Republicans and independents making up a bulk of the voters in the state, Democrats need something unexpected to unfold in order to win, like what happened in 1976.In that election, two Republican Senate candidates hammered each other so hard during the primary that the Republican Party was divided and a little-known Democrat, Dennis DeConcini, managed to eke out a victory.Reached on vacation in California, Mr. DeConcini, 73, who served 21 years in the Senate, made clear first that he was no fan of Mr. McCain. “We’re not the least bit friendly,” he said.Then he went on to analyze the candidate. “It’s not that I was above changing my positions, but McCain has made it an art form,” he said. “He was a maverick, but I guess he’s not anymore. One thing he is is vulnerable. He can’t change that.”'"

"'10-08-26,'1','Satoshi Kon, a Japanese filmmaker and comic-book artist whose dazzling visual compositions and humane, emotionally resonant stories won him a devoted following in animation circles and beyond, died in Tokyo on Tuesday. He was 46.The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to the Tokyo Shimbun news service and statements issued by Mr. Kon’s wife, Kyoko, and by Madhouse Studios, where Mr. Kon directed films.While Mr. Kon’s film work incorporated many familiar anime elements — pixielike female characters, sensitive robots, futuristic cityscapes and an anxious fascination with the creative and destructive power of technology — it was also informed by literary, artistic and cinematic traditions far beyond contemporary Japanese popular culture.Mr. Kon’s second feature, “Millennium Actress,” paid homage to masters of Japanese live-action film like Yasujiro Ozu and Akira Kurosawa, blending naturalism and fantasy to tell the story of a fictitious movie star in the years before and after the Second World War. His next film, “Tokyo Godfathers,” was loosely based on a 1948 John Ford western, Three Godfathers, and took viewers on a vivid tour of modern Tokyo’s back alleys and poor neighborhoods.“He was part of a line of great Japanese humanist directors and writers,” said Susan J. Napier, a professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University and the author of several books on anime. In a telephone interview Wednesday, she linked Mr. Kon with Kurosawa, the great animator Hayao Miyazaki (“Spirited Away,” “Princess Mononoke”) and the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Kenzaburo Oe.'"

"'10-08-26,'1','“Heading into the off-season, it’s a lot more stable than it’s been in years past,” Pelfrey said. “Some years in the past, they needed to go out and get two or three guys. That’s definitely not necessary now. If they go out and add somebody, it may put us at the top, especially the way we’ve been going now.”The Mets added Dickey last winter, to little fanfare, and shipped him off to minor league camp early in spring training. He has emerged as a keeper, commanding a knuckleball that has proved much more predictable, for a lot less money, than the repertory of the starter he replaced, Oliver Perez. Dickey will not be eligible for free agency after this season and remains under the Mets’ control.So do Santana, Pelfrey and Niese — and, alas, Perez — which means the Mets have one spot to fill. (Pat Misch took a turn Wednesday.) Typically, the free-agent class this winter will offer few options.Cliff Lee is the headliner, and though the Texas Rangers’ new ownership has said it can afford to re-sign him, the Yankees want him badly and usually get their man. Other pending free agents include Ted Lilly, Jake Westbrook, Jeremy Bonderman, Jorge De La Rosa, Vicente Padilla, Javier Vazquez and possibly Jon Garland, who has a mutual contract option.Maybe one of those pitchers could round out the rotation and, as Pelfrey said, make an area of strength deeper. But teams tend to overpay for free-agent starters, rewarding them for their work elsewhere and getting stuck with a career fade-out. The Mets perfected this in the last decade, with Kevin Appier (who was traded for the even-worse Mo Vaughn) and Pedro Martinez.The Mets never expected much from Dickey, who has been so good that when he lost a lead on a three-run homer Tuesday, it was startling. But Dickey, a veteran of five organizations, is convinced more bargains are out there.“The problem is guys in my position don’t get extended opportunities,” he said. “So if you don’t do something those first two or three starts, it’s back to that label you’ve had your whole career, even though it may not be justified.“Even though I was capable of doing what I’m doing now, if I had just happened to have two bad starts at the beginning, I wouldn’t have gotten another opportunity. That’s how it works. There are those guys in the minor leagues now who can do it. It’s just doing your due diligence and your character evaluations and the things that are intangible with those kids, and giving them a chance.”Mets General Manager Omar Minaya was wise to resist free agents like Ben Sheets and Jason Marquis last winter. Then again, the Padres’ one-year, $5.3 million investment in Garland has been sound. Just one savvy addition like that — and good health — would give the Mets a complete and reasonably priced rotation, making it easier to rework the rest of the roster.“Our pitching’s been a lot better than our record’s shown, without question,” Pelfrey said. “I think there’s still little pieces here and there they can go out and acquire in the off-season to maybe put us in the elite around the league. It all depends on what they want to do.”'"
"'10-08-26,'1','In court on Wednesday, an F.B.I. special agent placed a bulging canvas bag on the witness stand and unzipped it, slowly revealing the components of what appeared to be a terrifying bomb. One pocket contained what looked like a timer. Wires ran into long, thin packets stored in a middle compartment: the explosives. And from the last compartment, the agent pulled out a plastic packet filled with 500 ball bearings.Those components were all fake, and the packets of “explosive” were inert. But prosecutors maintain that four men from Newburgh, N.Y., who are on trial for placing bombs just like it outside two synagogues in the Riverdale section of the Bronx last year, thought that the bombs were real. The authorities also say the men planned to use Stinger missiles to shoot down military planes at Stewart International Airport in Newburgh.The four men — James Cromitie, Laguerre Payen, David Williams IV and Onta Williams — could face life in prison on charges including conspiracy and attempting to use weapons of mass destruction and antiaircraft missiles. On the second day of their trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Wednesday, prosecutors showed jurors frightening weapons in a dramatic display of what they said was the plot’s violent potential.At one point, the special agent, Robert Fuller, hoisted a missile launcher — also unarmed — onto his shoulder to show how it worked.A defense lawyer tried to blunt the impact of the prosecution’s demonstration. Mark B. Gombiner, who represents Onta Williams, got Agent Fuller to admit that the defendants had not obtained the missiles on their own and that an informant had driven them to scout prospective targets. The bomb was designed by federal agents, and not one of the defendants. He asked Agent Fuller about the ball bearings.'"
"'10-08-26,'1','MOSCOW (Reuters) — A Russian court on Wednesday sent a leading human rights activist and Kremlin critic to jail for three days for taking part in an unsanctioned protest demonstration in Moscow on Sunday, one of the organizers of the protest said.The court sentenced Lev Ponomaryov, 68, for disobeying a police order for protesters to disperse, said one of the protest’s organizers, Olga Shorina. Russian state news agencies also reported the sentence.Mr. Ponomaryov was detained with an opposition leader, Boris Nemtsov, and about 20 other people when they tried to march down a main Moscow avenue without permission. The protest was part of a series of demonstrations to assert what the opposition says is its constitutional right to demonstrate without permission from the authorities. The rallies are routinely broken up by the police.The same court ruled Tuesday that there was not enough evidence to jail Mr. Nemtsov, who was accused of the same crime.“It’s a crazy decision,” Mr. Nemtsov said in a telephone interview. “There is no reason why they let me go and jailed Ponomaryov. The only explanation is that the judge was pressured by the authorities.”'"
"'10-08-26,'1','That ambiguity could have broad consequences for the future of trading on Wall Street.Given the size of the banks, these recent losses were relatively small. But they highlight how banks will continue to be able to make bets where their own money is at risk — a practice that has yielded huge profits on Wall Street in recent years.Though these trades were made on behalf of clients, they subjected the banks to the kind of risk that Congress sought to curtail when it devised the Volcker Rule, which banned banks from speculating with their own money. That practice is known as proprietary trading.Even before the new rules were passed, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan began dismantling their stand-alone “prop desks” and shifting those traders into client-related businesses. Goldman is considering changes that could turn some of its star proprietary traders into asset managers who rely on capital from outside investors.But for all the talk of shutting down trading desks and reassigning employees to prepare for the Volcker Rule, proprietary-style trading will probably survive, if under a different name.This year, for example, several large insurance companies approached Goldman Sachs, looking to bet that the markets would not stay quiet. Goldman gladly took the other side of the trades, but when the markets turned choppy in May, the firm was caught short and quickly lost $250 million.Goldman, through a spokesman, declined to comment on its losses on that investment. But in a conference call with analysts last month, the bank’s chief financial officer, David Viniar, explained: “We didn’t hedge it fast enough. Things spiked really dramatically, really fast.”Months before that trade, though, Goldman Sachs’s research department named a bet against volatility as one its top 10 trading strategies for 2010. Goldman followed its own advice and put its own money in play by failing to adequately hedge the trade with the client who wanted to bet on volatility, which would have given Goldman a neutral position. In this way, a client-oriented trade can effectively become a proprietary bet.To be sure, in some cases it is necessary for a bank to take a financial risk in order to execute trades quickly and preserve market liquidity.What is more, it can be difficult even for Wall Streeters to draw the line between holding securities as inventory for clients and owning them with a view toward where the market is going.Goldman Sachs, for example, derived about $37.3 billion from trading activities in 2009, according to a Citigroup research report. Perhaps $1.5 billion, or about 4 percent of that revenue, came from dedicated proprietary trading desks. Were other Goldman traders essentially making proprietary bets in the process of serving clients? Likely, analysts and traders say — though it is very hard to tell.“Goldman tends to have businesses that have a customer focus with a proprietary overlay,” said one hedge fund manager and Goldman alumnus who insisted on anonymity. “That overlay can effectively allow them to make directional bets by using the customer flow to get them there.”But Goldman is hardly unique when it comes to walking the fine line between serving clients and taking positions.Late last year, with clients eager to bet that coal prices would rise, JPMorgan took the other side of the trade and amassed contracts on hundreds of millions of dollars on coal — enough to dominate the European market.Initially the trade went JPMorgan’s way and yielded profits, but in April the Morgan traders were caught off guard when European coal futures abruptly started rising. In fact, the wrong-sided bets erased all of the previous gains, and by the middle of June, it had turned into one of the commodities unit’s biggest losses — nearly $130 million.JPMorgan would not disclose the names of the clients and would not comment for this article. But in an internal conference call, Blythe Masters, who oversees the commodities unit, said that the bank made an error in judgment taking a risk on its own behalf.“We made a bit of a rookie error,” she said, according to parts of a recording first published by Bloomberg News. “We got overexposed in the market and made ourselves vulnerable to a squeeze.”Over the years, banks have shifted from being intermediaries who match buyer and seller to middlemen who put their own capital at risk.When a trade request comes in from a customer, traders have the option of handing it off to a second party that wants to take the other side.But if a second investor cannot be found, or if the trading desk has a market outlook that aligns with the bet, the trader can take the opposing position using the bank’s own account. The bank can then either hold on to that risk or hedge the investment so that its position is effectively neutral.In the case of Goldman’s bet on volatility, the investment soured before the bank could sell it or reduce the risk.'"
"'10-08-26,'1','examined the more than 500 applications for name changes in June at the Civil Court in New York, which has a greater foreign-born population than any other city in the . Only a half dozen or so of those applications appeared to be obviously intended to Anglicize or abbreviate the surnames that immigrants or their families arrived with from Latin America or . (A few Russians and Eastern Europeans did, but about as many embraced their family’s original surnames as adopted new ones.)The vast majority of people with clearly ethnic surnames who applied to change them did so as a result of marriage (belatedly adopting a spouse’s surname or creating a new hyphenated one) or childbirth (because they were legally identified when they were born only as a male or female child or were adopting a parent’s name).Iyata Ishimabet Maini Valdene Archibald of changed her name to Ishimabet Makini Valdene Bryce. Guo Wi Chan of Forest Hills, , changed his to Ryan Guowei Chan. And after Jing Qiu Wu, the Flushing, Queens, mother of 5-year-old Star Jing Garcia, divorced, she renamed her daughter Star Rain Wu, dropping her husband’s surname.Several dropped Mohammed as a first name, adopting Najmul or Hayat instead. And one older couple changed their last name from Islam to Khan, but they said they were conforming to other younger family members rather than reacting to discrimination.Sociologists say the United States is simply a more multicultural country today (think the Kardashian sisters or , for instance, who decades ago might have been encouraged to Anglicize their names), and they add that blending in by changing a name is not as effective for Asians and Latin Americans who, arguably, may be more easily identified by physical characteristics than some Europeans were in the 19th century and early 20th century.Also, at least in certain circumstances, affirmative action and similar programs have transformed ethnic identity into a potential asset.“If you are talking about 1910, the social forces on conformity were much stronger,” said Marian Smith, senior historian of the United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, “whereas now an immigrant arrives with all these legal and identity documents, a driver’s license in their pocket, a passport, with one name on it. To change this is a big deal.”Douglas S. Massey, a sociologist, suggested that newcomers from overseas and their children no longer felt pressure to change their surnames beginning “during the 1970s and 1980s, as became more a part of American life and the civil rights movement legitimated in-group pride as something to be cultivated.”You can apply to the State Supreme Court to change your name (for $210) or to Civil Court (for $65) as long as you swear that you are not wanted for a crime and are not doing so to defraud anyone. Immigrants can simply check a box on their applications for naturalization. (The government said that in 2005 fewer than one in six did so, and for every possible reason.)A century or so ago, some names were simplified by shipping agents as immigrants boarded ships in . Others were transliterated, but rarely changed, by immigration officials at Ellis Island. Many newcomers changed their names legally, from Sapusnick to Phillips (“difficulty in pronouncing name, interferes with their business,” according to a legal notice), Laskowsky to Lake (“former name not American”) and from Katchka to Kalin (Katchka means duck in Yiddish and a particular Mr. Katchka was “subjected to ridicule and annoyance because of this”).Most requests appear to have been granted routinely, although as recently as 1967, a Civil Court judge in Brooklyn refused to change Samuel Weinberg’s family name to Lansing “for future business reasons, such that my sons shall not bear any possible stigma.” The judge’s name was Jacob Weinberg.During World War I, another Brooklyn judge refused the application of a Weitz to become a Weeks.“There is no good reason why persons of German extraction should be permitted to conceal the fact by adopting through the aid of the court names of American or English origin,” the judge ruled. “It may involve some moral courage to bear German surnames or patronymics in these days, but the discomfort can best be borne by a display of genuine loyalty to this country.”Nancy Foner, a sociology professor at of the , said: “Jews and Italians changed their surnames in the past so that people wouldn’t identify them as Jews or Italians, the famous cases of course being movie stars. But if you look, phenotypically, nonwhite — East Asian, for example, or black — changing your last name is not going to make a difference. Betty Joan Perske became , and most people didn’t know she was Jewish; whatever name she used, was black.”Lisa Chang, whose parents came from Korea in 1976, had assumed she would marry a Korean man, but decided to retain her maiden name when she wed a Caucasian instead.“I felt like I would lose a part of myself and my Korean heritage and like I was cheating on my family’s name,” said Ms. Chang, 28, a troubleshooter for online advertising sites. “No one actually told me I had to change my last name, but I did feel some pressure from my future in-laws.”Marija Sajkas, 40, a health care advocate who moved from Yugoslavia seven years ago, is adopting her Bosnian husband’s surname, Tomic — partly because it is easier to pronounce. “I am fortunate,” she said, “to have a great husband who also has a pronounceable surname.”Even these days, finding precisely the right adoptive name — one syllable or not — can be a problem. Not long ago, David M. Glauberman, a Manhattan public relations executive, grew tired of having to spell his name every time he left a telephone message. Instead, he legally changed his name to Grant. The first time he left a message, a secretary asked: “Is that Grand with a ‘d’ or Grant with a ‘t’?”'"
"'10-08-26,'1','First step: You have to be realistic about just how much you’ll save by going vintage. For instance, on a recent afternoon at an outpost of Ina, the designer consignment chain in Manhattan, a luxurious black full skirt by Thakoon was $150. That’s hardly inexpensive, though it is considerably less than a new Thakoon skirt, which is typically around $400.On the Web, a search for “1950” on Etsy.com turns up many vintage varieties with pleats and high waists, in an array of colors and playful patterns, for about $30 each. On eBay.com, you can snap up vintage skirts for even less — around $20 — while 1950s party dresses go for about $50.You can also snag the real deal at ShrimptonCouture.com, which is searchable by decade and offers some of the most elaborate 1950s styles around. Here, voluminous sundresses and vintage frocks embellished with satin, chiffon, taffeta and rhinestones — several with built-in tulle underskirts — cost about $175 to $325.If you’re not in the mood to scour the Web or the city’s thrift stores but still want to try on the season’s retro-inspired fashions, you’re in luck. Major chain stores are filling their aisles with the kinds of ladylike skirts donned by June Cleaver and Brigitte Bardot alike.At Macy’s, a Jones New York Signature gray stretch circle skirt is $79. Zara, the fast-fashion chain from Spain, is offering several styles, including a swingy black skirt for $79.90 that embodies the trend. At J. C. Penney, similar skirts cost about $25 to $40.A $59.95 Edme & Esyllte cotton skirt with a green geometric pattern at Anthropologie is, as the retailer describes it, “a twist on the 1950s circle skirt.” The chain’s “feathered perch skirt” — a navy circle skirt with a few feathers artfully arranged at the waist — is $148. The “1952 skirt,” $138, is shorter and splashed with autumnal colors.Other trends this season are more timeless, like the raft of fur stoles, jackets and vests hitting stores. Several designers incorporated fur into their fall collections. Yet perhaps none embraced it on their runways as much as Chanel did, where fur-entombed models called to mind the abominable snowman.The good news for those who prefer not to wear the real thing is that fake furs are just as hot. Luxury department stores are selling faux fur vests for upward of $300, but fast-fashion versions are much less costly — and already disappearing from store racks.Zara has enough fake fur to build a new mascot for every Major League team in the nation. A faux red fox long hooded shell that hits about mid-thigh is $79.90. A black faux fur vest is $89.90. A cappuccino-colored short sleeve vest and a bushy bright-white, long-haired coat are $99.90 each.If just a hint of fur will sate you, there are chunky knit sweaters with fur detailing in neutral hues like cream, gray and brown for $39.90. And a faux fur leopard-print stole is $59.90.For those seeking coats, Topshop has leopard faux fur in gray for $200 and fawn for $190. A cropped version with a shawl collar is $170. A peach above-the-knee car coat with three-quarter-length sleeves (the sort that screams film noir) is $190.At Macy’s, an INC International Concepts long-haired black faux fur vest is $89. A short Jack faux fur vest with a subtle gray chevron pattern is $65. Should you and your teenage daughter care to wear matching pelts, the store’s Material Girl Collection includes a black faux fur vest for $34.Rachel Zoe, the celebrity stylist and reality television show staple, is selling a $79.80 faux fur vest in “chinchilla,” “black fox,” “red fox” and “silver,” on QVC and QVC.com. Her V-neck vest with a faux fur front is $62. A faux fur toggle coat with a wing collar is $118.20, and a faux fur pull-through scarf is $29.Also on the Web, Boston Proper has a long-haired faux fur ivory “glamour vest,” as the retailer describes it, for $119.Still, if you have your heart set on acquiring, say, a ’70s-style lamé bodysuit, check out Ricky’s NYC or American Apparel, where shiny high-waist leggings are $49, a small price to pay for a psychedelic experience.'"
"'10-08-26,'1','The path to training a naughty dog how to behave in the garden may start with just that: a path. Ian Dunbar, a dog trainer and an author, and an avid gardener, has created a busy highway system through his backyard in Berkeley, Calif.“They’re not allowed in garden sections,” Dr. Dunbar said of his dogs, a French bulldog, an American bulldog and a Rottweiler-coonhound cross. When a dog stays on the trail, Dr. Dunbar explained, he offers praise. “And whenever he puts a paw off the path, I say: ‘Back on the path! Back on the path!’ ” (If only we all had someone to remind us so insistently when we stray off course.)To be clear, it’s impossible to train a dog in garden protocol if you yourself are planted on the couch watching “Pit Boss” on Animal Planet. Dogs “don’t have a sense of right and wrong,” said James Serpell, author of “In the Company of Animals.” “They can’t generalize. If you and I know that we shouldn’t steal fruit from the neighbor’s tree, we can apply that to another tree. But the dog can’t do that.”In a less profound sense, Dr. Dunbar has found that “an exhausted dog is a well-behaved dog.” And so he has created a make-work program in the form of a digging pit. Buried at the bottom? Breakfast.Dr. Dunbar moistens his dogs’ food, stuffs it into a hollow rubber chew toy and freezes it overnight for freshness. The next morning, he hides the meal in the pit.'"

Bertie “really wanted to be on the other side where all the plants were.”Bertie is not alone in his appetite for destruction. If gardening is a battle — against drought, bug, weed, blight — the dog is a kind of bumbling fifth column, a saboteur who likes to roll on the grass and have his tummy rubbed.Ask gardeners to describe their dogs, and you will not often hear the profile of a loyal lieutenant. You will hear instead about uprooted flowers, shrubs and vegetables. And a trail of urine burns — on turf and tree — that would put Sherman’s march to shame. The dog plunders low-hanging fruit and leaves pathogenic poop behind. And then, not infrequently, manages to poison itself by wolfing down something toxic.Dogs and gardens. Gardens and dogs. For compassionate owners everywhere, the two are great and often incompatible loves — like travel and children, or cliff-diving and single-malt Scotch.Wild dogs “don’t have that much interaction with plants,” said James Serpell, a professor of animal welfare at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. For reasons that are not fully understood, he said, they will occasionally nibble grass, a habit that really ought to cross over as a fad diet on the Web site Goop.“Dogs look at things in the garden, and they have two questions: can I chew it or can I pee on it?” said Ian Dunbar, an animal behaviorist and veterinarian in Berkeley, Calif. “That really is the depth of their philosophy. And they’re happy with that.”Linda Kocher, 48, is something less than happy with the damage her two dogs, Carl and Bud, have inflicted on her garden in Olivette, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis. Both dogs came from the Humane Society, and their breeding is indeterminate. Carl seems to be part greyhound, and he’s a bolter.“Bud is a dachshund-Yorkie mix,” Ms. Kocher said. “We call him a dorkie.”It is Bud that has taken up the steady task of murdering the boxwoods. Ms. Kocher planted a few of the evergreen shrubs last year, with the notion that their foliage would brighten the yard in winter.Yet, under a steady stream of Bud’s attention (to use a polite term), the leaves have browned and wilted.“They’re doing what dogs like to do,” Ms. Kocher said. “You can’t get angry with them. You just have to kind of work around them.”The nitrogen in dog urine would seem to be a helpful fertilizer. In fact, the concentration of ammonium is often toxic to plants. “If you get one of these trees that every dog has to pee on, they can actually burn the bark,” said Nina Bassuk, program leader of the Urban Horticulture Institute at Cornell University.Exactly how many dogs does it take to kill a tree? “That’s something that hasn’t been studied,” Dr. Bassuk said. “And I’m not going to do it.”WHEN Anne Heller moved to a house in Santa Barbara, Calif., three years ago, she discovered a small orchard in the yard. The rolling landscape around her family’s 1926 Spanish colonial was home to 12 avocado trees, 3 orange trees, a persimmon, a loquat, a plum, a peach and an apricot.Her favorite tree might be a “yellow lime” that throws off fruit like beads at a Mardi Gras parade. “I call it the Giving Tree,” said Ms. Heller, 52, who uses the harvest for margaritas.Unbeknown to Ms. Heller, her 12-year-old chocolate Lab, Moose, had his own favorite tree. One clue was the large, stony pits that started turning up in the dog’s feces. Another clue: he could be found standing upright, on his hind legs, plucking fruit off the lower branches.Moose was addicted to loquats, a small, super-sweet Chinese import that is a distant cousin to an apple.Ms. Heller indulges this bit of thievery, as Moose is nearly deaf these days. Or pretending to be nearly deaf. “I guess I’m a pushover,” she said. “I was stricter with my children.”Given the size of her property — almost three acres — Ms. Heller is often less than dutiful about picking up dog poop. Moose generally wanders to the corner of a distant field. But Pebbles, Ms. Heller’s adopted Australian shepherd, “likes to poop right in the garden,” she said. “In my mind, it’s just fertilizer.”Fertilizer that might contain the Toxocara canis parasite, according to Sharon Patton, a veterinary parasitologist and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine. (“Worms, bugs, blood and guts are my specialty,” Dr. Patton said.) Toxocara nematodes, or roundworms, live in the intestines of dogs, particularly puppies. And the eggs pass via dog feces.These eggs can remain in the soil for years. Or, occasionally, the eggs hatch into larvae inside a human host who has mistakenly ingested them, say, from the strawberry patch.Toxocara larvae are restless houseguests. They like to migrate into human tissue, where they can cause aches and fevers. Another holiday destination: the retina.“In people, we refer to it as ocular larval migrans,” Dr. Patton said. In rare cases, it can lead to blindness.Last fall, Pebbles came down with giardiasis, a disease caused by giardia, a one-celled parasite that infects the gastrointestinal tract. Ms. Heller suspects her dog picked it up by drinking from a stream during one of their long walks through the Santa Ynez Mountains, north of town.Then, in January, Ms. Heller herself contracted the disease, which is marked by nausea, fatigue and digestive grief. “It took a month to kind of feel better,” she said.The kinds of giardia that infect dogs are often different from the ones that plague humans, Dr. Patton said. “But occasionally we do think there is some crossover,” she said.For the record, Dr. Patton does not recommend leaving dog feces anywhere in the garden.OSCAR WILD is a good boy. He does his business where he’s told: the side yard of an old stone carriage house in Ridgefield, Conn., by the border of Westchester County. In the daytime, he likes to lounge outside on the thick-cushioned patio chairs. At night, he sleeps in the bed of Julie Cencebaugh, a 44-year-old painter, who once owned a gallery in Chelsea.By breeding, the dog is a 4-year-old Brussels griffon. By temperament, “Oscar is part chicken,” Ms. Cencebaugh said.Oscar keeps close track of developments in Ms. Cencebaugh’s garden. The plantings are formal and English close to the house. Native varieties spill out toward a 350-acre state park that borders the two-and-a-half-acre property.“You can’t slip a new plant in without him realizing,” Ms. Cencebaugh said. “He’ll sniff the flowers, but he doesn’t do any damage.”Oscar’s restraint is a boon not just to Ms. Cencebaugh’s garden, but also to his own well-being. The ASPCA maintains an alphabetical compendium of 393 plants that can be harmful when ingested by dogs. It includes apples (the seeds and leaves contain cyanide), baby’s breath (gyposinen), chamomile (bisabolol, chamazulene, anthemic acid, tannic acid) and deadly nightshade (which shouldn’t be a surprise). If something green is growing in the yard, it’s probably on the list.Given all these ready hazards, it seems flukish that Oscar got into trouble by eating cocoa mulch. With company coming, Ms. Cencebaugh had spread four bags of the fragrant shells on her garden paths.The smell appealed to Oscar. What did not agree were the stimulants — caffeine and theobromine — that he consumed with the mulch.“He was like Ricochet Rabbit,” Ms. Cencebaugh said, “bouncing off the wall.” First, she called poison control. Then she shut him in the bathroom for his own protection. “The next day he was fine,” Ms. Cencebaugh said.Outside, the mulch disappeared for good. But Oscar Wild never knew it was gone. Oscar was back inside, on the softest part of the bed, where a dog naturally belongs.'"

"'10-08-26,'1','Every Wednesday at 11 a.m. Eastern Time at bridgebase.com, two experts play for an hour, partnering juniors from around the world.I took part on Aug. 18, when the diagramed deal arose.I was in six spades after Bobby Levin (East) opened three clubs. My American partner’s four no-trump was Roman Key Card Blackwood, over which I showed the spade queen and either two aces or one ace and the spade king.West, a junior from Turkey, led the club ace: five, ten, seven. He then shifted to the heart five. How would you have continued?Over my jump to four spades, North should have passed because I could have had a weaker hand, leaving six spades hopeless. Of course then there would have been no column.West’s heart shift was strange. He knew he had a safe trump lead. (It seemed unlikely that he had a spade void.) Had he read Levin’s club ten as a suit-preference signal?After some thought I decided it was wrong to play East for a singleton or doubleton heart queen. If West had switched to a trump or played another club, I would have taken the heart finesse. So I played dummy’s heart deuce and took the trick with my ten.'"
"'10-08-26,'1','Just down the street from the hot dogs of Gray’s Papaya, on a row of down-market Greenwich Village shops selling used CDs and a certain kind of glass pipe, 52 West Eighth Street is easy to miss. But a small sign marks hallowed musical ground: Electric Lady Studios.Founded by Jimi Hendrix in 1970, it was an oddity for its time. Instead of following the usual studio model — a big, impersonal box tended by buttoned-down staff engineers — it was a psychedelic lair, with curved walls, groovy multicolored lights and sci-fi erotica murals to aid the creative flow. Hendrix died less than a month after its opening party on Aug. 26, 1970, but he left libraries of tape from his sessions there, and the list of greats who have worked at the studio includes the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder and Led Zeppelin.Something else about Electric Lady has turned out to be unusual: It has lasted. As a group of engineers and producers noted in a 40th-anniversary celebration on Tuesday, most other big-name studios in New York — the Hit Factory, the Record Plant, Sony Music Studios — have shut down in recent years, victims of the recording industry woes or simply of real estate pressure, but Electric Lady has defied the odds by staying alive, and staying top-tier.Eddie Kramer, Hendrix’s favored engineer and a force in the studio’s creation, has a simple explanation for its longevity.“In a word: vibe,” he said, sitting in a small lounge by the control booth for one of Electric Lady’s three recording rooms. “We wanted to create an environment where Jimi could feel really happy, and feel that he could create anything.”“It was this womblike, beautiful place,” he added, “where he could feel totally relaxed and create the music he wanted.”The South African-born Mr. Kramer, whose slicked-back hair, trim goatee and punctilious manner give no indication of his résumé — working with Led Zeppelin, Kiss, the Rolling Stones and plenty more rock giants — was celebrating Electric Lady on Tuesday at a panel discussion organized by the Audio Engineering Society. Like Electric Lady itself, the meeting was an example of megafame hiding in plain sight, with men who have recorded some of the most famous and celebrated albums of the last 40 years yet are unknown to the public.Seated with Mr. Kramer in Studio A, Electric Lady’s subterranean main room — which still has its original rounded walls and spiral ceiling — were Tony Platt, who mixed AC/DC’s “Back in Black” there in 1980; John Storyk, the architect and acoustician who designed the studio; and Robert Margouleff and Malcolm Cecil, the synthesizer wizards whom Stevie Wonder recruited in the early 1970s. Among the 80 or so audio professionals there, these famous-to-a-few figures overshadowed two panelists with much broader name recognition: Lenny Kaye, guitarist of the Patti Smith Group, and Janie Hendrix, Jimi’s stepsister.With sentimentality and a precision appropriate for lifelong engineers, they told studio war stories (Jimi’s amp was there, against the wall; Stevie’s drums went right there); made the audience oooh and aaah with slideshow photos of old mixing consoles; and tried to pinpoint what it was about the place that gives it that all-important vibe. The spirit of the studio’s founder was cited more than once, along with the mix of high-tech equipment and mellow atmosphere.“All the studios you see today come from being a friendly place to make art,” Mr. Margouleff said, holding back tears. “That was really what came out of this studio.”For many artists Electric Lady has become a home away from home. The door to the upstairs bathroom has a small hole in it, just big enough to run a cable in there for when Keith Richards wants to cut his guitar parts in the most private kind of privacy. For Jimmy Page the personal imprimaturs of Hendrix and Mr. Kramer made all the difference when Led Zeppelin mixed parts of “Houses of the Holy” there in 1972.“Eddie Kramer was a damn fine engineer,” Mr. Page said in a telephone interview this week. “If he was going to be working on a studio that had Hendrix’s name, he was going to make sure it was a good place with good acoustics so that musicians wanted to play in that room.”Yet in the world of recording studios, where time is money and inspiration needs to flow for take after take, even intangibles like vibe have a specific function, and the design approach of Electric Lady has become commonplace today.Mr. Storyk explained that in addition to the mood lighting, Hendrix called for visionary changes in studio design, like control rooms large enough for artists and engineers to work together closely. Those plans, along with complications like the high water table under the building, made for a protracted and expensive construction.The studio’s original filing with the Buildings Department estimated its cost $125,000, but it ended up costing about $1 million, said Mr. Storyk, who got the Electric Lady job at 22 and has gone on to design numerous studios and performance spaces around the world.“For the first time an artist was building a studio,” Mr. Storyk said. “This was happening in a few pockets all over the world, but none more famous than here with Jimi.”Electric Lady’s artist-friendly innovations — along with the Hendrix mystique — have helped it survive in an era when large, all-purpose recording studios are giving way to smaller rooms with narrower focus. Echoing the Electric Lady model, many new studios, like Jay-Z’s Roc the Mic on West 27th Street in Manhattan (designed by Mr. Storyk) are tailored to the needs of a particular client.Yet Electric Lady also had its lean years. As with most studios, it suffered as advances in technology allowed anyone to make cheap and reasonably high-quality recordings at home. By the early 2000s it had lost its sheen and nearly closed, but after a renovation and a change in management it is thriving again.Lee Foster, the 32-year-old studio manager, said that when he took over five years ago, he began going through his record collection and inviting Electric Lady alumni to come back. Before long its rates were back up, and the three rooms were always booked. Recent sessions have included Eric Clapton, Coldplay, Rihanna, the Strokes and Sheryl Crow.To make room for the Audio Engineering Society’s meeting, Mr. Foster said, the studio ended sessions early. But on Wednesday it was back to work, with Studio B booked by Kanye West.Mr. Kramer is in Studio A this week. He’s mixing a new Jimi Hendrix album, he said, and he looked excited.'"
"'10-08-26,'1','The courses vary widely, but they typically seek to leave students with some blend of two things: an entrepreneurial mind-set and a tool kit.In a start-up or inside a big company, the entrepreneurial approach emphasizes the pursuit of opportunities with small teams and few dollars, quickly and flexibly. The mentality, experts say, is that of the insurgent “attacker” rather than the established “defender.” Look first to customer needs — solving some problem and getting paid for it — to build a business.“And keep the F-word in mind — focus,” advised William K. Aulet, managing director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Entrepreneurship Center. “The No. 1 reason new businesses fail is lack of focus.”One course the M.I.T. center offers is an intensive, one-week entrepreneurship development program that costs more than $8,000 (companies and governments often pay some or all of the costs for their managers).“You see that the essence of the entrepreneurial spirit isn’t so much about money as it is about passion,” said Tetsuya O’Hara, 47, who took the M.I.T. course last December. “It’s a perspective that goes beyond business, forcing you to think about what matters most to you.”Mr. O’Hara, director of advanced research and development at Patagonia, the outdoor clothing maker, said he had applied the program’s thinking in his job, which involves working with outside companies to explore new technologies and business concepts. Before the entrepreneurship program, he had a list of almost 200 projects he might pursue. Today, he has winnowed that list to two priority projects. “I already got a lot of return from the course,” he said.Another participant, J. Patrick Bewley, vice president of global marketing strategy at Acxiom, a consumer data marketer, said one insight he took from the program was the importance of assembling strong teams of people with open minds, willing to experiment, learn rapidly and constantly refine ideas to improve them. “You have to build that culture of resilience within your group,” said Mr. Bewley, 34.Both opportunity and necessity are motivations for starting new businesses. A report in May, based on data from the Census Bureau, found that new businesses were formed in 2009 at the highest level in 14 years, despite the weak economy. At the least, challenging economic times can prompt people to rethink their options.That is what happened to Saudia Davis, a former movie publicist, who worked promoting independent films like “My Big Fat Greek Wedding.” She lost her job in 2007, when her employer cut her department. “I could find a new job or gamble and put everything on the table to start my own business,” recalled Ms. Davis, 32.She chose to take the entrepreneurial plunge. Her grandmother had been a house cleaner, and Ms. Davis had long thought that house cleaning could be made more healthy and environmentally friendly for the clients and the cleaners. Her company, Greenhouse Eco-Cleaning, in Brooklyn, was founded to pursue that vision of cleaner cleaning. It uses no toxic cleaning agents like ammonia or formaldehyde, and checks the allergies of clients and their pets to avoid using materials that might aggravate those conditions.Ms. Davis had never started a business before, and her work experience in movie promotion and her education, as an English and Africana studies major at Bowdoin College, were scant preparation. She found a business-building course called FastTrac, offered by a nonprofit economic development organization in New York, the Industrial and Technology Assistance Corporation. She took the 12-week course of evening sessions in 2008, with a development grant paying for half the $1,000 tuition.The course work, Ms. Davis recalled, covered business functions like accounting, operations and marketing. “But it also gave me an understanding of what it takes and how all the slices of the pie that go into making a business come together,” Mr. Davis said.Today, her company employs 12 people and has 600 household and office clients. Initial plans to manufacture green cleaning products have been postponed — too capital-intensive and distracting, Ms. Davis said. One lesson learned, she adds, is that the entrepreneurial journey is all-consuming. “The closest thing I have to vacation is sleep,” she said.The FastTrac coursework is developed by the Kauffman Foundation, a philanthropy with $2 billion in assets, dedicated to entrepreneurship research and education. The FastTrac courses are offered in 37 states, by local development organizations, chambers of commerce and other groups. The courses range in cost from $700 to $1,500 depending on the course, teaching venue and the audience, though grants and scholarships are often available.Kaplan, the private education company, announced in July that it would begin offering some FastTrac courses online, for $882 a course. And the Kauffman Foundation earlier this month overhauled its free Web site, www.entrepreneurship.org, with resources for aspiring and practicing entrepreneurs.The entrepreneurial mindset, says Bo Fishback, the Kauffman Foundation’s vice president of entrepreneurship, is a personal asset that can be applied to any field. “It’s a mentality that sees every problem out there not as a setback but as an opportunity to fix,” he said. “Some people will start businesses, but others will take that mindset with them into corporations and government.”It worked out that way for Carrie Coker Britt. After three years working for an Atlanta law firm as a recruiter and administrator, Ms. Britt decided against going to law school.Instead, Ms. Britt attended Georgia Tech’s business school, and joined a program that puts doctoral science students, law school and business school students in teams to work on start-up projects. The goal of the program is to teach people from different disciplines to work together to accelerate the entrepreneurial process in high-tech start-ups. One team project she worked on won a competition at Georgia Tech and a $10,000 prize.Today Ms. Britt, 32, works as a software sales representative for I.B.M., covering thousands of accounts in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi. Her job, she says, requires quickly researching industries and figuring out how I.B.M. technology can help individual businesses. “It’s very entrepreneurial, fast-paced, and you’re constantly looking for new and better ways to be successful,” Ms. Britt said.And, she adds, there is another benefit to having gone through the entrepreneurial program, Ti:ger, for Technological Innovation: Generating Economic Results. “It was critical to getting the job I have now,” Ms. Britt said. “It differentiated me from other candidates.”'"

"'10-08-26,'1','Walt Disney Studios has withdrawn from a group that hands out trophies for animation achievement. For years Disney has privately groused about the Annie Awards, presented by the Hollywood chapter of the International Animated Film Society. Disney has complained that the guild allows anyone to buy a membership (in contrast to most awards-bestowing organizations) and that Disney’s rival DreamWorks Animation has too much power because it gives its employees free guild membership. Variety, which reported the split, noted that Disney’s Pixar entries had won 6 of the last 10 top Annie prizes. But Disney started to agitate more aggressively for changes in 2009 after DreamWorks Animation’s “Kung Fu Panda” won a raft of Annies, and Pixar’s “Wall-E” won nothing. “Wall-E” went on to win the Oscar for animation that year. “We believe there is an issue with the way the Annies are judged, and have been seeking a mutually agreeable solution with the board,” Ed Catmull, president of Disney Animation and Pixar Animation, said in a statement. “Although some initial steps have been taken, the board informed us that no further changes would be made to address our concerns.” Antran Manoogian, the guild’s president, told Variety, “The Annies are about honoring the best in animation, and we will continue to do so.”'"
"'10-08-26,'1','This net is a complex set of state-backed structures, including the European Financial Stability Facility, set up in Luxembourg inresponse to the Greek budget crisis this year, which could provide up to €440 billion, or $506 billion, in support.For investors, these official mechanisms do not seem to have removed the risk of holding bonds in the affected countries, partly because of high price volatility and partly because there is uncertainty about how long the backing will be in place.The German government wants the Luxembourg fund to lend only at punitive rates, partly because Berlin is worried that Germany’s own top-flight debt rating might be compromised, while troubled borrowers like Ireland and Spain want to avoid at all costs the stigma of borrowing from their neighbors, Mr. Marsh added.Underlying this is a skepticism about whether politicians, notably in Paris and Berlin, have the will to enact the changes to the structure of the euro zone — either by moving toward fiscal harmonization or a multispeed project — that would be needed to avoid a repetition of this year’s political and economic crisis.As a result, many investors are only willing to re-enter the market for these assets gingerly, and the rates they require to hold the bonds of the affected countries have climbed back, in some cases close to the highs seen in May.For example, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Irish bond peaked at 5.865 percent in May before falling. It has since drifted back up and was at 5.478 percent Wednesday.Meanwhile, some investors fear that a number of countries, having pledged deep spending cuts and revenue-raising steps, may struggle to fulfill their promises, facing pressure from frustrated voters and angry unions.""Austerity is key and it’s probably only in the third or fourth quarter that you will be able to start assessing how the programs are going,"" said Theo Phanos, co-founder of Trafalgar Asset Managers in London. ""Beyond that, it probably won’t be until 2011 when you have an idea of how far governments are able to maintain reasonable growth alongside austerity.""In particular, there are worries over the tricky political and social battle in Madrid to implement the spending and pension cuts presented in the spring by the Socialist government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, who lacks a parliamentary majority. Discussions about changing the pension system are continuing between the government and companies on one side and the unions, which have called a general strike for the end of September. Demonstrations against pension changes in France are also planned next month.Reports last week that quoted the Spanish finance minister, Elena Salgado, as saying that Spain would spend at least €500 million more than initially planned on infrastructure next year brought concerns about how fast that country would be able to lower its deficit.Antonio Garcia Pascual, an analyst at Barclays Capital in London, said that Madrid needed additional fiscal consolidation measures to reach its goal of reducing the budget deficit to 6 percent of gross domestic product for 2011 and 3 percent in 2013. The government’s growth projections of 1.3 percent in 2011, 2.5 percent in 2012 and 2.7 percent in 2013 are far too optimistic, he said.The government ""would need to complement the current austerity measures with further cuts in current government spending and investment, as well as with a further increase in VAT rates and excises,"" he wrote in a research note.And as Spain restructures its troubled savings banks, many of these lenders remain reliant on the E.C.B. for financing. More broadly, recent data showed that the E.C.B. bought €338 million in euro-zone government bonds during one week of August, a relatively small amount but well above the €10 million bought during the previous week.There has also been a string of negative reports from Ireland, where the bill for recapitalizing its tattered banking sector keeps rising, weakening the government’s fiscal flexibility. On Wednesday, Standard & Poor’s cut Ireland’s sovereign rating by a notch to AA-, still a high investment grade, from AA, with a negative outlook. The agency, worried by the protracted and expensive bailout of the banks, raised its estimate of the total cost of the rescue to ¤90 billion, equivalent to 58 percent of G.D.P., from ¤80 billion last year.The recent announcement of new capital injection into Anglo Irish Bank suggests that Ireland’s net government debt will rise toward 113 percent of G.D.P. in 2012, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said.Analysts are wondering what Ireland is going to do about a government guarantee on the debt of its six biggest financial institutions — one that expires Sept. 28.There are also doubts about Lisbon’s ability to push through rigorous spending cuts. The budget deficit in the first six months of the year was ¤500 million higher than a year earlier. The jump largely reflected increased social security spending, caused by higher unemployment, which offset higher weighed down better receipts from value-added and corporate taxes.""Even though figures are likely to improve in the months ahead: the target announced in May, i.e. reducing the deficit to a ratio of 7.3 percent is still a long way off,"" said a report from the Commerzbank economists Ralph Solveen and Jörg Krämer. ""While reaching the target remains possible, it has become more difficult.""Data on receipts from Italy, Greece and Spain have been more positive.""Italy and Spain look like they are ahead in their austerity plans but will that mean they under-deliver in 2011?"" asked David Schnautz, an interest rate strategist in London for Commerzbank.He said the recent trend in bond yields — low in the core of Europe, high on the periphery — was partly a ""flight to quality"" into German bunds. But the decline in German yields had ""caught many investors off guard"" as the negative Irish reports were filtering out and as unexpectedly robust second-quarter growth numbers from Germany raised the likelihood of a two-speed recovery in the euro area.He added, ""And natural buyers will tend to hold back and see if yields go a bit higher. It is, of course, not in the interest of issuers.""'"
"'10-08-26,'1','HOUSTON — Even after dozens of witnesses, a hundred hours of testimony and three months of investigation, a chairman of a federal panel exploring the Deepwater Horizon disaster admitted Wednesday that he still lacked a simple fact: Who was the top authority on the oil rig when it exploded?The finger-pointing among various witnesses and lawyers has become so routine at the government hearings that the chairman, Capt. Hung Nguyen of the Coast Guard, said he viewed the rig as a “three-legged stool” — wobbly and without anyone taking responsibility.“Somebody’s got to be in charge here,” Mr. Nguyen said. “I just don’t have a clear picture in my mind of who it is here.”The panel of Coast Guard and Interior Department representatives is trying to determine the causes of the explosion that led to the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. But the hearings have been dominated by disagreements among lawyers for the companies involved: BP, which owned the well and leased the rig; Transocean, the rig’s owner; and Halliburton, which poured cement around the well.Looming over the hearings are pending civil trials and a Department of Justice criminal investigation that are likely to involve the same witnesses and rely on facts that emerge from their testimony.'"
"'10-08-26,'1','LONDON — A body found stuffed into a large sports bag in a bathtub at an apartment here was identified Wednesday in British news reports as that of a missing intelligence officer, prompting much speculation about his identity and the details behind his death.A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that officers found the body on Monday afternoon after investigating reports that the man, identified in news reports as Gareth Williams, 31, had not been seen for some time.The bag was in a bathroom in the top floor of the man’s apartment, in London’s well-appointed Pimlico neighborhood, less than a mile from the imposing headquarters of Britain’s foreign intelligence service, MI6.The police spokesman said an autopsy was being conducted and detectives were “following up several lines of inquiries,” but he declined to provide additional details.A spokesman for Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which oversees the intelligence agency, would not discuss the reports that the man had worked for British intelligence.British news reports said that the man had been stabbed repeatedly and may have been dead for two weeks before he was found.The police continued to search the apartment and cordoned off the street, home to two former leaders of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard and Leon Brittan. Neighbors told reporters that the windows to the top floor flat were always shut, and the curtains drawn.'"
"'10-08-26,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved changes that make it easier for shareholders to nominate directors of public companies.The 3-2 vote allows groups that own at least 3 percent of a company’s stock to put their nominees for board seats on the annual proxy ballot sent to shareholders. The financial overhaul law enacted last month gave the S.E.C. the authority to make the change.Under the current system, investors must appeal to shareholders at their own expense if they seek new directors on a company’s board or a bylaw change.The new policy was long sought by investor advocates. But business groups, including the United States Chamber of Commerce, opposed it. The board’s two Republican commissioners — Kathleen L. Casey and Troy A. Paredes — voted no.The change comes at a time when many investors are angry about risks corporations are taking for short-term profit gains and extravagant compensation packages for executives. Getting candidates on the board gives supporters a better shot at influencing company policy. The policy change will be in place in time for next spring’s corporate elections season.The S.E.C.’s chairman, Mary L. Schapiro, has said the vote was one of the most contentious ever taken by the agency. The change is “a matter of fairness and accountability,” she said.But one commissioner, Ms. Casey, called it “so fundamentally and fatally flawed that it will have great difficulty surviving judicial scrutiny.” The new rules favor big institutional shareholders over individuals, she said.'"
"'10-08-26,'1','The founders, college friends Carol Lim and Humberto Leon, cultivated their retail superpowers by thinking about fashion in a kind of syndicalist, collective way, and collaborating with a blend of established fashion institutions like Levi’s and Pendleton, lesser-known rising-star designers like Alexandre Herchcovitch, influential style leaders like Chloë Sevigny, and outfits somewhere in the middle of all that, like the British mega-trend outlet Topshop, and The Row, the line created by the eerily fashion-slavish Olsen twins.The resulting retail experiment fills a necessary niche.

Men’s shoes, like Rachel Comey’s rather brilliant mash-ups of classic men’s oxfords with incongruous red rubber soles ($350), are placed on shelves next to a section of crucial DVDs, including heartbreakingly stylish wonders from the Criterion Collection like Michelangelo Antonioni’s “L’Avventura” and Louis Malle’s “Elevator to the Gallows.”In the center of the room, there is a large display case full of French rock star sunglasses, Comme des Garçons platonically ideal zipper wallets, those Repetto ballet flats so beloved by some ladies, Doc Martens platform lace-up boots ($150, sadly not in my size) and a collection of OC’s fairly killer platform collaborations with the footwear aristocrat Robert Clergerie, in velvets and patent leathers.Since the store is small, the speed of inventory turnover is somewhat dizzying; that day, there was a fresh batch of stupefyingly comfortable loungewear items by Alexander Wang and Tsumori Chisato — super-soft, generously long cotton things more or less evocative of total collapse in a hammock woven of baby hair and opium (Tsumori Chisato big cocoon sweatshirt, $385).I know what you’ll think, and you’re right: an $89 T-shirt is a crime against humanity, and people who buy them ought to be pelted to death with $18 stainless-steel water bottles.But I kept coming back to rub my fingers on it. It was so soft, it was making my brain flood with dopamine, like a security blanket.You can’t compare the prices of perfect T-shirts and ordinary T-shirts. An $89 T-shirt that you love beyond reason is easily worth five sensible shirts in the $18 range that will never make you feel a transgressive shiver as you slide them over your person. There are superior design merits to consider: narcotic softness, ideal weight, the not-too-close hug of the torso, the not-too-low scoop of the V-neck, the optimum charcoal dye job (deep and inky with an extra shot of blue). It’s not a T-shirt; it’s a zone I’ll always feel passionately kissed in. A postcard from a higher intelligence; a valentine from a super-sexy future.Whenever I got a new pair of shoes as a kid, I would stage them right next to my bed so they would be the first thing I saw when I woke up — because a world where you get to be the person rocking those shoes is the right world. This time, I did myself one better: I unwrapped my brand-new $89 T-shirt from its adorable bandanna-print tissue paper, and decided to sleep in it.A new room sometimes opens up within a familiar room, already thought to have been looted of all future discoveries.Ha, I said, showing my new fist to the twinkling night, while closing the blinds. Behold, ye suffering fashionisti. Behold, ye sensibly fleeced. I sleep to conquer. I am my own anarcho-luxurist syndicate. I am the Golden Mean.SOAPENING Opening Ceremony’s forward-thinking model is a way out of the consumer tar pit of luxury-conglomerate brand worship. It’s personal, low tech and modern, in all the best old-fashioned ways.DOPENING The staff is an open-minded, fun-loving bunch. I spent 10 minutes trying to persuade Tyler Mahowald to buy the same T-shirt he had just sold me — a kinky retail role-reversal I’ve never tried before.UTOPENING OC and its community of collaborators deliver good, constantly refreshed trends that aren’t too temporal: an Acne shearling jacket ($1,799) will age nicely and look edgy for another 20 years.'"

"'10-08-27,'0','Leaving cancer patients with merely a hope and a prayer that their access to lifesaving cures will not be in jeopardy is too dangerous a gamble.Unfortunately, this wishful thinking is the only assurance offered in the American Medical Isotopes Production Act, which arbitrarily bans the importation of cancer medicine without guaranteeing that new methods are in place to meet patient demand.While domestic production of cancer medicine is preferable, there are currently no facilities in the United States that make the cancer cures upon which millions depend.In fact, government and industry experts my office has spoken with say that even if production facilities currently announced are constructed, this ban could still leave millions of cancer patients deprived of their medicine. The Times dismisses this concern, stating that “the bill allows 7 to 13 years before exports would be cut off, which seems ample time to build domestic capacity.”For cancer patients whose lives depend on these cures, this type of guesswork is far short of a guarantee.The common-sense way forward is to amend the current legislation and remove the ban on cancer medicine importation — or wait until construction of new cancer medicine production facilities is under way before instituting the ban.'"
"'10-08-27,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — Apple severed ties with a small Silicon Valley design firm that for nearly a decade had helped with the development of some of its products, after the firm showcased its own prototype tablet computer.Eric Bauswell, a founder and chief executive of the engineering design company SurfaceInk, confirmed on Thursday that his company and Apple had “gone separate directions.”Mr. Bauswell declined to give details of its relationship with Apple, citing client confidentiality agreements. But he said that his company was let go because of “Apple’s growing awareness of our turnkey capabilities,” referring to SurfaceInk’s business of designing products for its clients. “I think they view our capabilities as an opportunity for competitors, “ he said.The incident underscores the growing pressure that Apple is facing in the market for tablet computers. While the iPad currently dominates that market, many rival products are expected to be released soon.SurfaceInk, a company founded in 1999, has done engineering design work in the past for clients — and Apple competitors — like Palm and Hewlett-Packard. The company, which has about 50 employees, also has a so-called turnkey business, which creates products and licenses them to other companies.It was that latest part of SurfaceInk’s business, which the company began about five years ago, that apparently unsettled Apple. While SurfaceInk had gotten clients mostly through word of mouth, in June it publicized a prototype 12.1-inch tablet during an electronics trade show.'"
"'10-08-27,'0','Worried that an investigation was going cold, a special agent in charge of a case in which four people were later accused of plotting to blow up synagogues in the Bronx appeared to suggest that the F.B.I. needed a backup plan: gun charges against the suspected leader, according to e-mail read on Thursday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.Federal agents had spent more than six months tracking the man, James Cromitie, on a tip from an informant, who had told them Mr. Cromitie wanted to harm the United States.The special agent, Robert Fuller, had repeatedly instructed the informant to encourage Mr. Cromitie to buy an illegal gun, according to court testimony, and the e-mail suggested why, a defense lawyer said. In it, Agent Fuller wrote of his desire to have a criminal charge on Mr. Cromitie “in our back pocket if things went south.”That message was read aloud in court but was quickly stricken from the record by the judge after prosecutors objected. Still, defense lawyers seized on that e-mail and other correspondence to further their assertion that Mr. Cromitie and the three other defendants were dupes, lured into a plot by a zealous informant who offered them food, money and a car for their participation. Prosecutors have said the four men were eager participants who seized an opportunity to commit a terrorist attack.Mr. Cromitie’s lawyer, Vincent L. Briccetti, focused on the government’s doubts about the strength of the case in the lead-up to the arrest of the four men in May 2009.'"
"'10-08-27,'0','A Russian court on Thursday ordered prosecutors to reopen an investigation into the murder of Czar Nicholas II and his family, despite the fact that the Bolsheviks believed to have shot them in 1918 are long dead. The Russian prosecutor general’s main investigative unit this year said it had formally closed a criminal investigation into the killing of Nicholas because too much time had elapsed since the crime and because those responsible had died. But Moscow’s Basmanny Court ordered the case reopened, saying that a Supreme Court ruling blaming the state for the killings made the deaths of the actual gunmen irrelevant, a lawyer for the czar’s descendants and local news agencies said. Nicholas, his wife and five children were killed by a revolutionary firing squad in 1918. The Romanov dynasty ruled Russia for 300 years until the abdication of Nicholas in 1917, which was followed by the Bolshevik Revolution, civil war and 70 years of Communist rule.'"

"'10-08-27,'0','From the heaving mass of carnage in Neil Marshall’s galumphing, atavistic gorefest, “Centurion,” a cautionary message struggles to escape. Beware of overreaching, ye imperialists. The indigenous people of whatever region you presume to conquer know the territory a thousand times better than you do and will eventually prevail.Your fancy armies stocked with exhausted, undernourished soldiers who aren’t prepared for the harsh climate and terrain are for naught. Unlike your soldiers, who were dispatched from a distant capital in another land, the natives have every reason to fight to the death; this is their territory. All you’re doing is following orders from vainglorious leaders thousands of miles away who will abandon you unless you bring them good news.Sound familiar? The empire isn’t British or American, but Roman. The year is 117 A.D., and the battles take place in the woods of northern Britain (now Scotland) where Roman soldiers are fighting the tribes known as the Picts. Every primitive war toy is wielded, from battle axe to spear to blades of all sizes; even a pack of wolves is dispatched. The Romans speak in cultivated English accents, the Picts in (subtitled) Scot Gaelic.The Roman mission is to destroy the Picts and eliminate their leader. But when the Ninth Legion, commanded by General Titus Virilus (Dominic West), is ambushed and Virilus captured, Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), whose legion has also been decimated, struggles with his rainbow coalition of remaining warriors to reach the safety of the Roman frontier.The Romans’ most fearsome antagonist, Etain (Olga Kurylenko), is a scowling, mute she-devil with a blue-painted face and a gruesome back story. She has the instincts of an Indian tracker and wields her weapons with unerring mastery. If Mr. Fassbender is too refined to play a bloodthirsty warrior, Mr. West is every centimeter a carnivorous military beast. The movie throws in a possible love interest for Quintus in flaxen-haired Arianne (Imogen Poots), an exiled Pict woman who lives alone in the woods.For all its analogies to Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, or wherever, the underlying thrust of “Centurion” is its celebration of bloodlust, its assertion that the primal instinct of humanity, or least the male half of the species, is to make war. In the blood-soaked battle scenes set in pristine woods, often at night, armored hulks clash, tangle, grunt, and roar in orgiastic combat. Heads are severed and attached to poles, muscled torsos slashed and speared. The real message: Life’s ultimate pleasure lies in extreme fighting — to the death.'"
"'10-08-27,'0','Quite a lot happens in “Change of Plans,” Danièle Thompson’s crowded comedy about a Paris dinner party and its aftermath. There are (in no particular order) near- and actual divorces, last-minute reconciliations, a terrible accident and a miraculous cure, a secret marriage and a surprise pregnancy. Mostly, there is marital infidelity, which seems to come as naturally to the middle-aged, middle-class French couples who populate the film as shopping for goat cheese or going for a medical checkup.“Loyalty is for France,” one of them remarks. “Not for marriage.” “Change of Plans” goes further, suggesting that marital disloyalty may itself be a form of patriotism, or at least that making a humorous spectacle of colliding adulteries is a proud part of the French literary and cinematic patrimony. In any case, the character’s insouciance — expressed after she has cheated on her husband but before he has cheated on her — captures the spirit of this diverting, hectic entertainment, which refuses to take anything too seriously, staking out a middle ground between melodrama and farce.Ms. Thompson, whose previous films as a director include “La Bûche” and “Avenue Montaigne” (both written, like “Change of Plans,” in collaboration with her son, Christopher), is playful but rarely frivolous when it comes to the emotions of her characters. And though she sometimes gives them reason for tears, deep anguish is no more a part of her palette than madcap hilarity.“Change of Plans,” in other words, is a civilized affair in every sense, and its good-natured decorum is both a limitation and a source of charm. Taking place on consecutive summer solstices during a multicultural music festival, the movie gathers 11 somewhat less multicultural but nonetheless generally appealing people and throws them into a roiling bouillabaisse of domestic and romantic complication. They meet at the apartment of M L (Karin Viard) and Piotr (Dany Boon), who want to christen their newly renovated kitchen with appropriate festivities.M L has been sleeping with the kitchen’s designer, Jean-Louis (Laurent Stocker), and Piotr has been struggling with depression and unemployment, but these troubles hardly distinguish them from their guests. Mélanie (Marina Foïs), a gynecologist, has been carrying on an affair with a jockey, and she plans to leave her husband, Alain, a saintly cancer specialist played by Patrick Bruel.'"
"'10-08-27,'0','TOKYO — After just three months in office, Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan faces a challenge from a scandal-tainted power broker within his own party in a leadership race that could hamper the government’s response to a debilitating economic slowdown.The power broker, Ichiro Ozawa, 68, said Thursday that he planned to run against Mr. Kan for the presidency of the Democratic Party on Sept. 14, a position that would ensure his appointment as prime minister. Mr. Ozawa, who is credited with the Democrats’ rise to power last year, has been increasingly critical of Mr. Kan since the party lost ground in elections last month.Mr. Ozawa’s challenge could bring upheaval to the Democrats just as Japan’s recovery from a painful recession shows signs of sputtering. Growth slowed to just 0.1 percent in the most recent quarter, and the strength of the yen has threatened to erode earnings at Japan’s exporters because it makes their products more expensive abroad and therefore less competitive.“Although I am unworthy, I have decided to run in the leadership election,” Mr. Ozawa said.In a thinly veiled censure of Mr. Ozawa’s old-school politics, Mr. Kan said Thursday, “We must first break down Japan’s political structure, then construct a new one together.”A divisive figure, Mr. Ozawa could also bring more political uncertainty to a country that has had five prime ministers in three years.The Democrats ousted the Liberal Democratic Party last August after a string of unpopular prime ministers finally compelled voters to reject the L.D.P., a party that had governed Japan for most of the past half-century. Yukio Hatoyama of the Democrats took office as prime minister in September, only to resign nine months later over a broken campaign promise to move a United States Marine base from Okinawa.His successor, Mr. Kan, first appeared to be winning back popular support for the party, but he has seen his ratings nosedive after suggesting that Japan may raise its consumption tax to tackle its mounting public debt.'"
"'10-08-27,'0','In the latest Johnson & Johnson case, DePuy said in a statement that it was recalling two products: the ASR XL Acetabular System, a hip socket used in traditional hip replacement, and the ASR Hip Resurfacing System, a partial hip replacement that involves placing a metal cap on the ball of the femur, a method intended to preserve more bone. The traditional implant has been available worldwide, and the resurfacing implant was approved for use in countries outside the United States.About 93,000 of these devices have been implanted worldwide, said Lorie Gawreluk, a DePuy spokeswoman. The New York Times reported in March that for more than two years, the F.D.A. had been receiving complaints that the devices failed early in some patients, requiring expensive and painful operations to put in new hip replacements. Since the start of 2008, the F.D.A. has received about 400 complaints involving patients in the United States who received the devices, an agency spokeswoman said Thursday.DePuy said that the majority of hip replacements using the ASR devices had been successful. But the company advised patients who had had hip replacements with the recalled products to visit their surgeons for an evaluation and annual monitoring. The company said it would pay reasonable and customary medical costs associated with the recalled products, including new hip replacement operations.DePuy had sales last year of about $5.4 billion, according to a Johnson & Johnson earnings report.The high early failure rate of the ASR implants was reported this year in severalarticles in The New York Times. These devices have come under scrutiny over the last few years because they are part of a category of implants called metal-on-metal bearings, which can generate debris from wear, causing inflammation and tissue damage in certain patients.In March, the British agency that regulates medical devices issued an advisory on metal debris generated by hip implants. A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said the agency was planning to meet soon with professional medical groups to discuss the British advisory.Late last year, DePuy said it was phasing out the implants because of slowing sales. In March, the company warned doctors that the implants might have a high failure rate in some patients.In one New York Times article, some orthopedic experts expressed dismay that DePuy had not halted sales of the devices earlier. About 12 to 13 percent of patients needed a second hip replacement within five years of receiving an ASR implant, the statement from DePuy said, citing new unpublished data from a national registry in Britain. Previously reported follow-up data, including internal company information and clinical trials, had reported lower rates of second hip replacement comparable to similar devices by other companies, the statement said.But many medical centers in the United States that specialize in joint replacement surgery had already noticed a higher failure rate with the DePuy hip implants, said Dr. Joshua J. Jacobs, the chairman of orthopedic surgery at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.“Most major medical centers have seen issues with this device,” Dr. Jacobs said. “This does not come as a surprise.”Dr. Jacobs added that the DePuy recall pointed to the importance of having a national registry for joint implants that can serve as an early warning system for product problems. Britain, Australia and some other countries have such national registries, he said, but the reporting system currently used by the F.D.A. does not necessarily capture every device failure.David Floyd, president of DePuy, said in a statement that the recall would be a concern for patients and their family members and for surgeons.“We are committed to assisting patients and health care providers by providing information through multiple channels and paying for the costs of doctor visits, tests and procedures associated with the recall,” he said.Johnson & Johnson comprises more than 250 different operating companies in 60 countries. But the recent recalls and F.D.A. warning letters to several units at Johnson & Johnson raise questions about whether there may be companywide problems, industry analysts said.“No. 1, is there a systemic issue at J.& J.?” said Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank. “No. 2, is this” hip implant recall “reflective of that systemic issue? And, No. 3, is there more to come?”Mr. Wise added that F.D.A. warnings and J.& J. recalls had come at a time of increased vigilance about product safety by the agency and health care companies. He said that he believed the various problems at J&J were separate and not part of a systemic issue.Dr. Trombetta, the pharmaceutical marketing professor, compared Johnson & Johnson to Toyota, another multinational firm whose reputation has suffered this year during a series of recalls. The recalls may be tarnishing Johnson & Johnson’s apple-pie image, Dr. Trombetta said, but he predicted that the company would eventually recover public trust as Toyota largely had.Shares of Johnson & Johnson closed at $57.80 on Thursday, down 18 cents.'"

"'10-08-28,'0','CHICAGO — Waiting in Joe Girardi’s office Friday was a copy of The Chicago Sun-Times, which on its back page featured a silhouette of a man wearing a Cubs hat. Beneath a list of nine qualities the next Cubs manager must have, it read, “There’s only one man for the job.” On Page 56, there was a large photograph of Girardi. He did not get that far.With the Cubs foundering and Lou Piniella retired, the main puzzle on the north side of town is deducing the team’s next manager. And because of his Illinois roots, Northwestern pedigree and two stints with the Cubs — and an expiring contract with the Yankees — Girardi may appeal to Cubs ownership. To appease the New York news media, Girardi addressed the situation, stressing that he was happy with the Yankees.“I don’t want to take away what we’re trying to do in here,” Girardi said. “I don’t want the players or the organization to think that I’m not focused on what we’re doing here.”Girardi grew up in Peoria, about 150 miles southwest of Chicago, but has family in the area, including his 79-year-old father, Jerry, who he said was in the end stages of Alzheimer’s disease. They spent part of the Yankees’ day off Thursday together.'"
"'10-08-28,'0','Agricultural experts say they’re not worried about the recent jump in wheat prices, caused largely by the drought in Russia and the ban on Russian wheat exports. The Department of Agriculture is predicting that world wheat production will reach the same level this year — 645 million metric tons — that helped bring prices down from their astonishing $13.50 a bushel peak in February 2008. At present, prices for December wheat are about $6.95 a bushel, down over 50 cents from a month ago, but up nearly 55 percent since early June.We don’t find the experts consoling. One reason prices have been less volatile is that big grain buyers, like cereal companies, have learned to hedge their buying. And to say that this episode of market volatility is not as bad as the one two years ago — which led to food riots in many parts of the world — is not encouraging.We’re not supposed to attribute a couple of bad harvests, or the floods in Pakistan, to a changing climate. But this volatility in grain prices was not caused by farmers’ decisions or failures of government policy. It was caused by drought and flood. If this looks like a pattern — or simply a glimpse of things to come — it is worrying.Canada’s wheat harvest may be off by 36 percent this year, because of too much rain. Australia is unlikely to fill the Russian export gap because it is in the midst of extreme drought. Wheat and corn stockpiles could drop to their lowest since 2008, despite a very good wheat and corn year in the United States. The uncertainty of the grain markets leaves American farmers unsure whether to plant more wheat or not.The number of humans on this planet forces us to contemplate the limits of the global grain harvest, and to do so while extreme weather imposes its harsh constraints. Then there are new strains of crop disease, like the rust called Ug99, which has blighted African crops.The fundamental hope is to somehow mitigate or forestall climate change. The experts may be right: the rains may fall — or stop falling — and wheat production may normalize. But the next worrying harvest could be around the corner.'"

"'10-08-28,'0','British newspapers reported Friday that Prime Minister David Cameron narrowly avoided a Taliban attempt to shoot down the Chinook helicopter that was carrying him to a front-line British base in Helmand Province on his first visit to Afghanistan as prime minister in June. The accounts, quoting military officials, said the helicopter carrying Mr. Cameron and Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Britain’s top military officer, had been airborne for five minutes heading from a joint British and American military base in the Helmand desert to a remote front-line base for British troops in the town of Shahzad on June 10 when Taliban radio messages about the planned attack were intercepted by a coalition eavesdropping unit.

"'10-08-28,'0','Rolls-Royce, based in Britain, acknowledged that the engine had suffered an “uncontained failure,” in which a limited amount of debris spewed into the test facility. But Rolls-Royce said it could fix the problems, and it maintained that the failure was “unrelated” to its ability to make engines available for Boeing’s flight tests.But a Boeing spokesman, Jim Proulx, said that the plane maker had been counting on using that engine in a Dreamliner making test flights this fall.Boeing executives said the need for changes to the engine, which must eventually be certified by federal regulators, added to the concerns about the testing delays. “We would not have issued our statement about the delay if there had not been the engine issue,” Mr. Proulx said.Boeing, which will continue with other test flights, will push back delivery of the first aircraft to its maiden customer, All Nippon Airways of Japan.Boeing said this month that workmanship problems with other suppliers might push delivery of the plane a few weeks into 2011. Its statement on Friday said that the engine issue had prompted it to extend the delivery time.Several analysts said they were puzzled by how little the companies revealed about the problem.Rolls-Royce and General Electric are both building engines for the Dreamliner. Scott Hamilton, the president of the Leeham Company in Issaquah, Wash., said: “You would think there would be another Rolls-Royce engine or two or three they could use. Why is this one so critical?”Rolls-Royce said it was working closely with Boeing to expedite its engine deliveries. And on the FlightGlobal Web site, Jon Ostrower suggested that Boeing might be planning to substitute an enhanced version of the Rolls-Royce engine for its basic model in the planes built for All Nippon Airways.Both Heidi Wood, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, and Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said they doubted the first planes would be delivered before next spring.“Experience shows that programs that ‘swim funny’ do so for much longer than most, especially the bulls, ever expect and can be a grind all the way to the finish,” Ms. Wood wrote in a research note.Of the nearly 850 Dreamliners on order, more than 200 are scheduled to be equipped with the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine, Boeing said. (Rolls-Royce is a separate company from the carmaker of the same name.) Most airlines have waited patiently for the plane, which is seen as crucial to Boeing’s future. But Boeing could lose some sales and pay additional penalties for further delays.The latest 787 delay comes just as the airline industry is recovering from the downturn and airlines, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, have begun to place orders for new aircraft.But Boeing still has a substantial lead over Airbus in shifting to the lightweight carbon-composite fuselage. Airbus’s first similar plane, the A350, is not expected to be ready before 2013.All Nippon Airways said Friday that the delay, the sixth since it ordered 50 of the planes in 2004, was “regrettable.” A spokeswoman for the airline, Megumi Tezuka, said it was trying to find out whether the delay on the initial plane would push back its other Dreamliner deliveries.'"
"'10-08-28,'0','It urged France “specifically to avoid collective repatriation” and instead to seek permanent solutions for the welfare of the Roma, ensuring that they had “access to education, health services, housing and other temporary infrastructure.”France has said it has already expelled more than 8,500 Roma this year. More were put on planes this week as the committee finalized its report.“Our concern is that a government should not lump an entire group together and deal with them collectively but act on the basis of individuals,” said Pierre-Richard Prosper, a former United States ambassador for war crimes issues and the group’s rapporteur. Mr. Prosper said France had not been singled out for criticism among the 11 countries whose reports were published on Friday.“The timing was especially bad for France because the report is coming out as the Roma events are in the news,” he said in an interview. “But the Roma question is a moment in time. The bigger issue in France is the growing racist and xenophobic tone in political discourse and the fact that earlier immigrants do not feel fully accepted and do not get equal chances in French society.”The committee of experts is an independent group that monitors compliance with a 1965 convention on the elimination of racial discrimination. The convention’s 173 signatories are subject to a review every four years, typically consisting of reports from both governments and human rights and other independent groups. After public debate, the committee issues its recommendations or critiques.Denmark was also rebuked over its treatment of Roma on Friday and was told it should collect data on the numbers and the legal status of Roma, give them access to shelters and public facilities, and protect them from racial profiling and hate crimes.The panel said nothing about Denmark’s recent deportation of Roma. Italy, Germany and others have been criticized in earlier statements.Groups of traveling Roma have become an issue in much of Western Europe, all the more since 2007 when Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union and travelers from those countries no longer needed visas to crisscross much of the Continent.France has been deporting Roma for several years, including 10,000 last year. A survey in the newspaper Le Figaro published on Friday said that two-thirds of respondents supported the dismantling of camps and the deportation of Roma, linking their presence in the country to crime and insecurity.In response to criticism from the United Nations group, France said Friday that it was “scrupulously” respecting European law and its international obligations in its drive to expel the Roma.In its report on Iran on Friday, the committee on racial discrimination urged the government in Tehran to “continue its efforts to empower women and promote their rights.” Iran should also seek to end discrimination against local minorities, including Bahai, Arab, Azeri, Balochi and Kurdish groups, which, the report said, are largely excluded from public life and are scarcely mentioned in the national census and in public policies.The committee also criticized Australia, saying that it should increase efforts to amend its Constitution to include the recognition of aboriginal groups as “First Nations Peoples.” It said that these groups needed more money for legal aid, adequate land titles and more help to preserve indigenous languages.Members of the committee include representatives from Algeria, Brazil, Britain, France, China, Burkina Faso, Ireland, Tanzania, Togo, Turkey, Guatemala, Russia, Niger, Pakistan, India and the United States.'"

It was a tough night for the series points leader, Will Power, who was running at the front when he abruptly went to pit road for an extra fuel stop with five laps left. He came in 16th while Franchitti, who decided not to change tires on his last stop, raced to victory.

"'10-08-29,'0','“Credit is incredibly difficult to come by, so we focus our efforts a lot more on sustainability than expansion and growth,” Mr. Hinsley said in an e-mail.Especially in Cook County, he said, there are few opportunities for businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. “In the rare event that one does exist, they’d typically have a narrow focus,” said Mr. Hinsley, who was injured in combat in Iraq.In 2007, Illinois was home to 80,719 businesses in which veterans owned at least 51 percent of the company, according to the Office of Veterans Business Development. Another 38,459 businesses were owned half by veterans.In 2008, 86,153 service-disabled veterans lived in Illinois, 23,977 of them in Cook County. There were 85 Cook County businesses owned by service-disabled veterans registered last week with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.Mr. Moreno is not a veteran, but he said his father had been in the Army and his brother in the Marines. “I figured it was the right thing to do for our veterans looking to go into business,” Mr. Moreno said. “They put their lives on the line. They are entitled to some special treatment.”To qualify under the proposed legislation, at least 51 percent of a business would have to be owned by one or more service-disabled veterans who manage and run the daily operations. The veterans would not have had to be injured in combat, but the disability must have been incurred or aggravated during active service. In some cases, a spouse or caregiver could manage the daily business, according to the legislation.Harold D. Shepard, 62, a Vietnam veteran from Oak Park who is president of ABC Data Entry Inc. in the West Loop, was skeptical that the county would follow through on any promises to aid the veteran-owned businesses.“There is always lip service,” said Mr. Shepard, who served in the Army from 1968 to 1970 and said he had suffered from post-traumatic stress and exposure to Agent Orange, a toxic chemical used in the Vietnam War. “I’ll reserve judgment on that. I’ve lived in Chicago a long time — we don’t have enough money, clout.”He said more local work would make his business easier to manage because he would not have to travel as much as he does now to do business.A Web site, veteranownedbusiness.com, has a national registry that lists businesses in Illinois owned by service-disabled veterans. A longer list is available at a registry from the Department of Veteran Affairs at vip.vetbiz.gov.Clay Graham, 45, an Iraq war veteran and owner of the Chicago construction company Opcon Inc., said he hoped the registries would draw people to his business, which he started in September. While in the Navy, Mr. Graham renovated schools and assessed work on hospital and water treatment plants in Iraq, where he injured his knee.But Bob Collins, 61, a Vietnam veteran and owner of Collins Consulting in Schaumburg, said he had been so displeased in past dealings with local public agencies’ contracts that he would not take a county contract.In 2005, Mr. Collins said, the Chicago Transit Authority sent him a letter saying that his back problems from service in the Marines did not qualify him for certification as a disadvantaged business owner.“I wouldn’t bid on any of their work even if they said they would do it,” Mr. Collins said of the county, although it is separate from the transit authority. “No interest in wasting my time trying to bid on something I don’t believe would ever occur.”'"
"'10-08-29,'0','Local news media have dubbed these groups the Net far right, because they are loosely organized via the Internet, and gather together only for demonstrations. At other times, they are a virtual community that maintains its own Web sites to announce the times and places of protests, swap information and post video recordings of their demonstrations.While these groups remain a small if noisy fringe element here, they have won growing attention as an alarming side effect of Japan’s long economic and political decline. Most of their members appear to be young men, many of whom hold the low-paying part-time or contract jobs that have proliferated in Japan in recent years.Though some here compare these groups to neo-Nazis, sociologists say that they are different because they lack an aggressive ideology of racial supremacy, and have so far been careful to draw the line at violence. There have been no reports of injuries, or violence beyond pushing and shouting. Rather, the Net right’s main purpose seems to be venting frustration, both about Japan’s diminished stature and in their own personal economic difficulties.“These are men who feel disenfranchised in their own society,” said Kensuke Suzuki, a sociology professor at Kwansei Gakuin University. “They are looking for someone to blame, and foreigners are the most obvious target.”They are also different from Japan’s existing ultranationalist groups, which are a common sight even today in Tokyo, wearing paramilitary uniforms and riding around in ominous black trucks with loudspeakers that blare martial music.This traditional far right, which has roots going back to at least the 1930s rise of militarism in Japan, is now a tacitly accepted part of the conservative political establishment here. Sociologists describe them as serving as a sort of unofficial mechanism for enforcing conformity in postwar Japan, singling out Japanese who were seen as straying too far to the left, or other groups that anger them, such as embassies of countries with whom Japan has territorial disputes.Members of these old-line rightist groups have been quick to distance themselves from the Net right, which they dismiss as amateurish rabble-rousers.“These new groups are not patriots but attention-seekers,” said Kunio Suzuki, a senior adviser of the Issuikai, a well-known far-right group with 100 members and a fleet of sound trucks.But in a sign of changing times here, Mr. Suzuki also admitted that the Net right has grown at a time when traditional ultranationalist groups like his own have been shrinking. Mr. Suzuki said the number of old-style rightists has fallen to about 12,000, one-tenth the size of their 1960s’ peak.No such estimates exist for the size of the new Net right. However, the largest group appears to be the cumbersomely named Citizens Group That Will Not Forgive Special Privileges for Koreans in Japan, known here by its Japanese abbreviation, the Zaitokukai, which has some 9,000 members.The Zaitokukai gained notoriety last year when it staged noisy protests at the home and junior high school of a 14-year-old Philippine girl, demanding her deportation after her parents were sent home for overstaying their visas. More recently, the Zaitokukai picketed theaters showing “The Cove,” an American documentary about dolphin hunting here that rightists branded as anti-Japanese.In interviews, members of the Zaitokukai and other groups blamed foreigners, particularly Koreans and Chinese, for Japan’s growing crime and unemployment, and also for what they called their nation’s lack of respect on the world stage. Many seemed to embrace conspiracy theories taken from the Internet that China or the United States were plotting to undermine Japan.“Japan has a shrinking pie,” said Masaru Ota, 37, a medical equipment salesman who headed the local chapter of the Zaitokukai in Omiya, a Tokyo suburb. “Should we be sharing it with foreigners at a time when Japanese are suffering?”While the Zaitokukai has grown rapidly since it was started three and a half years ago with just 25 members, it is still largely run by its founder and president, a 38-year-old tax accountant who goes by the assumed name of Makoto Sakurai. Mr. Sakurai leads the group from his tiny office in Tokyo’s Akihabara electronics district, where he taps out announcements and other postings on his personal computer.Mr. Sakurai says the group is not racist, and rejected the comparison with neo-Nazis. Instead, he said he had modeled his group after another overseas political movement, the Tea Party in the United States. He said he had studied videos of Tea Party protests, and shared with the Tea Party an angry sense that his nation had gone in the wrong direction because it had fallen into the hands of leftist politicians, liberal media as well as foreigners.“They have made Japan powerless to stand up to China and Korea,” said Mr. Sakurai, who refused to give his real name.Mr. Sakurai admitted that the group’s tactics had shocked many Japanese, but said they needed to win attention. He also defended the protests at the Korean school in Kyoto as justified to oppose the school’s use of a nearby public park, which he said rightfully belonged to Japanese children.Teachers and parents at the school called that a flimsy excuse to vent what amounted to racist rage. They said the protests had left them and their children fearful.“If Japan doesn’t do something to stop this hate language,” said Park Chung-ha, 43, who heads the school’s mothers association, “where will it lead to next?”'"
"'10-08-29,'0','Love grabbed 10 rebounds and scored 7 points in 13 minutes on Saturday after finding his groove in the final exhibition against Greece, when he had 10 points and 12 rebounds in 11 minutes.Team USA’s next two games are the toughest they will face in pool play, with Slovenia and Brazil boasting bruising frontcourts. Love’s rugged post play will probably be needed.“Kevin has been outstanding,” Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “Rebounds per minutes, he’s off the charts.”He added, “We have a lot of confidence in Kevin.”Love has fought through a broken hand and two losing seasons in Minnesota, and it has been easy to overlook his rare skills. He has flypaper hands, a soft shooting touch and is the Tom Brady of N.B.A. outlet passers. Ben Howland, who coached Love at U.C.L.A., calls him the Big Fundamental.“The international game demands more skill, the ability to pass and play zones, to catch the ball in the high post and be able to make the passes he’s capable of making,” Howland said in a telephone interview. “I don’t know that there’s a better big-man passer out there.”Howland said it was worth remembering that Love can stand on the baseline and hit the opposite rim with a two-handed chest pass 7 of 10 times.And although the N.B.A. and Minnesota’s triangle offense have not been the ideal showcases for his outlet passing, his United States teammates are clearly enjoying it.“Just like the old days,” said Russell Westbrook, a teammate of Love’s at U.C.L.A.Guard Derrick Rose added: “His outlet passes are perfect. All you have to do is run, and it’s right there. He’s probably the best outlet passer in our game right now.”During Love’s year at U.C.L.A., Howland said, the coaches watched him in practice and shook their heads at his fundamentally sound game.“We can’t take any credit,” Howland said. “He showed up that way.”One of Krzyzewski’s skills in organizing a team like this is getting players to buy into roles. Love’s is obvious; he relishes swinging his elbows, picking apart zones and taking a charge, which he was doing against Lithuania when he banged his head on the floor.“I’m that hustle guy, that workhorse guy who can get rebounds and putbacks and the occasional 3,” he said. “But other than that, I’ll set picks and get people open and play team ball.”As for Love’s acting career, he said he had not seen the “Entourage” cameo yet, but he said he got rave reviews from his friends. He hinted that it might not be his final dip into acting, but declined to elaborate.Love’s much more comfortable talking about his role on the court, as he seems destined to appear in big scenes over the next few weeks.“Now is the time that counts,” Love said, “and I’m looking forward to contributing the rest of the way.”'"
"'10-08-29,'0','Ms. Ali embodies the conundrum. Her cousin was arrested this summer by the security services during one of their regular sweeps through Kurdish villages, but she refuses to talk about what happened.“Some ideas you can’t touch,” she said. “I don’t want to go outside of my case. I am working on disabilities.”It is a quandary faced by activists across the Middle East. In the narrow alleyways of civic life permitted by authoritarian governments in the region, opportunities exist as long as certain limits are observed. While foreign aid groups often cheer the explosive growth of organizations that help women, children or the environment, there are questions about whether the groups can change the political order.As the world watches Syria emerge from years of international isolation, Syrians are watching the government play its strengthened hand at home.“We are seeing changes,” said Bassam Haddad, director of the Middle East studies program at George Mason University. “The number of associations that are emerging is increasing. The number of concerns that are allowed to become public is also increasing. The whole process is blessed by the government. It has good intentions but built-in structural limitations.”Professor Haddad said that in the 1990s, during a similar embrace of civil society groups, activists knew the changes were cosmetic but assumed that the very existence of new groups might hasten change. Few people have those illusions today, he said.“I think the first thing that Syrians need to see is an end to arbitrary rulings that put away people based on their viewpoints,” he said. “That is something that stifles any kind of public debate about the important issues.”Many rights advocates go further, dismissing the talk of civil society by the government as window-dressing while it continues to arrest Islamists, Kurds and other political opponents, along with the lawyers who represent them.Civil society figures who cross the line, like Muhannad al-Hassani, can end up in jail. Mr. Hassani, a lawyer who used to monitor the trials of dissidents in the Supreme State Security Court, was disbarred for life last year, and in June was sentenced to three years in prison on charges that included “weakening national sentiment.”Mrs. Assad’s efforts put a softer face on her husband’s policies and, within limits, appear to be doing some good. An organization she directs, the Syria Trust for Development, finances groups that work with women, rural residents, children and entrepreneurs. Its Web site says the trust is “at the forefront of the emerging N.G.O. sector in Syria, at a time when the country is actively pursuing a substantial agenda for change.”The new groups might represent progress, but they also fill a need, as Syria copes with growing numbers of impoverished citizens. “The cultural reliance on the government for everything is not attuned to modern society,” said Imad Moustapha, Syria’s ambassador to Washington.For her part, Ms. Ali has seized on the opening to find ways to integrate people with disabilities into society, and to help them become independent in a country that makes that nearly impossible. To spend time with her this month as she traveled around the country was to understand the depth of that challenge. Nearly everyone she met had to ask for help, to reach a second floor, to get more time to take an exam or just to be taken seriously.Dependent on a wheelchair since contracting polio as a child, Ms. Ali began her journey as a rights activist when a college administrator laughed her out of his office when she asked him to repair an elevator.He did not fix the elevator. She moved on to other battles.One day this month in the Kurdish village where Ms. Ali was born, she visited a 27-year-old blind woman, Zahra Sheikhi, whose parents kept her and her sister, who is also blind, at home for all of their childhood, out of shame, Ms. Ali said.With Ms. Ali’s help, Ms. Sheikhi has learned to play a lutelike instrument called the tanbour, occasionally performs in public and is hoping to move away from home. “My family is always around,” she said. “They don’t allow me to live.”In Aleppo, where Ms. Ali lives with her parents, she visited Saghatel Basil, 33, a university student who lost his sight because of diabetes a few years ago. Mr. Basil said that Syria had recently installed traffic signals for blind people but that many of them did not work.His disability had prompted Mr. Basil to try his hand at local government. “I am trying to improve the idea of citizenship,” he said. “It is still weak. Maybe because I’m blind, I have a big hope that things will change.”A conference in Damascus this month, attended by Ms. Ali and the first lady, reflected another type of opening blessed by the government, the spate of recent visits by international groups.An American nonprofit group, the Open Hands Initiative, brought young Syrians and Americans with disabilities together for what the group’s founder, Jay Snyder, said was an attempt at person-to-person diplomacy. Mr. Snyder said that his group’s trip to Syria was approved quickly and that no one from the government restricted what they could discuss.“Part of the challenge we face in Syria,” Mrs. Assad said at the gathering, “is how do you take incredible people and incredible ideas and make them an incredible reality?”A young man in a wheelchair, Abdulrahman Hussein, 20, offered an answer. “We should be doing something in our own countries,” he said. “We should not be sitting in a corner.”'"
"'10-08-29,'0','“Our expectations are that the game will be a sellout,” said Mitch Gershman, the Redskins’ chief operating officer, who said that “creating a year-round relationship” with the team’s season-ticket and suite holders was the primary impetus behind its hunger for college football business. FedEx Field will host a second college game on Nov. 20 when Penn State visits its Big Ten rival Indiana, which has been promised a cool $3 million to deprive its student and community fan base of one Saturday game and tailgate.“What you’re seeing on both ends is how much the sports industry has been impacted by the economic slowdown,” said Marc Ganis, who runs a Chicago-based sports consulting firm. “From the pro side, this is an industry that has far less liquidity, falling selling prices and more debt across the board, especially for the teams that have built new stadiums.”Hence the need to fill buildings that most days of the year resemble scaled-down models of the Grand Canyon. Among other off-campus games this fall, Notre Dame will play Navy at New Meadowlands Stadium on Oct. 23 and Army at Yankee Stadium on Nov. 20; Louisiana State and North Carolina kick off their season Sept. 4 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta; and Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Tex., will feature Oregon State and Texas Christian on Sept. 4 and Arkansas and Texas A&M on Oct. 9.“People are going to pay for the games depending on how successful the games are in terms of attendance and television ratings,” said Larry Scott, who has been aggressively trying to upgrade the Pac-10 Conference’s national identity since becoming commissioner in 2009. “But from the college end, what you’re seeing is an increasing sophistication in the way athletic directors and schools are thinking about their brands and their recruiting.”As an example, Scott said that playing in Cowboys Stadium allowed Oregon State of the Pac-10 to give two key players, Jacquizz and James Rodgers, the opportunity to play in their home state and simultaneously market the university in football-rich Texas.At the same time, Scott agreed that however lucrative the so-called neutral-site game might become, there is a potential downside to the college game doing too much business with the pros that is both financial and ethical.“I’ve got a little hedge in that the concept is still being developed,” he said. “The schools have to be mindful of their community fan and small-business base that is hungry for home games. I think that obligation is likely to keep this in check.”Or perhaps not, said Ganis, acknowledging a recent N.C.A.A. report that just 14 of the 120 Football Bowl Subdivision universities made money from campus athletics in the 2009 fiscal year, down from 25 the year before.“The schools have got tremendous financial pressures to make money from the revenue-producing sports,” he said. “The football costs are exorbitant — coaching salaries, facility upgrades, higher tuition for scholarship players. So I think this is a trend that will increase.”The games, he said, are likely to have a distinct look.“With the Penn State-Indiana game, notice they’re not taking a game from Happy Valley, only from a place where they’d get a smaller crowd and less money,” Ganis said. “It’s likely to be a home game from a weaker team in a major conference, giving that team a better chance to compete.”Or from a smaller conference power looking to enhance its polling power in big-market territory.“We would prefer home and home with the good teams, and we’ve tried, but they won’t come here,” Boise State’s Bleymaier said. So the Broncos and their adventurous fans — they have sold 7,000 tickets — will come east to face the Hokies and their horde, grateful that at least the playing surface at FedEx Field promises to be level.'"

"'10-08-29,'0','That work has won the Fierlingers a Peabody Award (“Still Life With Animated Dogs,” 2001), and Mr. Fierlinger earned an Oscar nomination for best animated short in 1980 for “It’s So Nice to Have a Wolf Around the House.” Anyone who’s grown up watching “Teeny Little Super Guy” segments on “Sesame Street” has been watching a Fierlinger creation.Ms. Fierlinger, 55, who has a fine-arts background, adapted her skills to colorizing her husband’s sketches. “I paint with layers, just as I would with traditional animation,” she said. “I make my own brushes and mix my own colors, just as if it were a paper background. But I do it all on the computer.”Unlike studio cartoons, which often involve computer-generated imagery, the Fierlingers’ work is hands-on, sort of. What’s eliminated is wasted motion: the shuffling of paper, the sharpening of pencils, the setting up of shots. That it still took them three years to make “My Dog Tulip” almost seems surprising. It certainly gave Mr. Plummer pause.“He said, ‘I was told it’s going to take you three years to do this,’ ” Mr. Fierlinger, 74, recalled, “and I said, ‘Yes, at least.’ He said, ‘I’m going to be dead by then, I’ll never get to see it.’ I told him: ‘I’m roughly about your age, so if you think you’re going to be dead, then so am I, and it will never get done. You won’t miss anything.’ When we met again last year in Toronto, we agreed the time had gone so fast.”The heart of “My Dog Tulip” is Mr. Ackerley’s story of his late-middle-age relationship with an Alsatian named Tulip. Bittersweet, heartfelt and rendered in an eccentric, expressive style, the movie seems poised to draw dog-loving moviegoers like beagles to bacon. (New Yorker Films, the distributor, is doing grass-roots promotion to dog walkers, vets, pet food stores and bookstores; New York Review of Books Classics is reissuing the Ackerley book.)But Mr. Fierlinger’s story could be a movie too — and was, actually, in his animated autobiographical 1995 film “Drawn From Memory.” The child of Czech diplomats, he was born in Japan, relocated to the United States as a youngster and then shipped to Czechoslovakia, where his uncle, Zdenek Fierlinger, became the country’s first postwar prime minister, while his father worked in the top echelons of the Soviet puppet government. A boarding-school classmate of Vaclev Havel’s and a member (at least geneaologically) of the ruling elite, Mr. Fierlinger fled to America shortly after his father’s death in 1967.The Fierlingers use French software called TVPaint; the director Nina Paley, whose “Sita Sings the Blues” was a breakthrough in personalized computer animation, uses the more popular Flash.“There are many ways to use Flash,” she said, “the most common being with ‘motion tweens’: creating a virtual puppet, and having Flash automatically move the pieces from place to place. That’s commonly called ‘cutout style.’ But you can also use Flash to draw every single frame from scratch if you want. I used a combination in ‘Sita’: mostly cutout style, but also some straight-ahead-style hand-drawing straight into the program.” She also “did some paintings on paper, which I scanned in.”Not so at Chez Fierlinger, where the forward-thinking animators are cutting themselves loose not just from graphite and cameras but also from traditional avenues of financing and distribution: a children’s film they wanted to make — and are in fact making — centers on Joshua Slocum, the first man to sail around the world solo. It was turned down for financing by the public-television production arm ITVS.“We thought we could do whatever we wanted,” said Mr. Fierlinger, who is returning to his teaching job at the University of Pennsylvania this term. “Everything we’ve done for PBS has been a success. But they said, ‘We can’t see why children would want to watch this for an hour.’ ”So they’re doing it in installments, like a graphic novel, and selling it online. “We realize we could do this all on the Internet, for the iPad or similar devices,” Mr. Fierlinger said. “We don’t need a distributor. We don’t even need actors. And the technology is developing so fast that by the time we’re done, there are things we’ll be using that people aren’t even talking about now.”'"
"'10-08-29,'0','It has been three decades since Business Week proclaimed “The Death of Equities” on its cover. That 1979 obituary for the stock market, published when the Dow Jones industrial average languished at a mere 875, became a symbol of an age of doubt. So shattered were ordinary Americans by gas lines, recessions and double-digit inflation that they resorted to pulling cash out of equity mutual funds — for eight straight years.Investors in the ’70s were stunned by an alarming rise in volatility. The comfortable, ordered system of international exchange, in place since the Bretton Woods accord at the end of World War II, had come apart, leading to violent fluctuations in currency values. Grain shortages sent food prices soaring, and memorably, OPEC put the squeeze on oil. The cumulative effect was a loss of faith in money itself. (Doomsayers urged redeploying assets into metals, oils — anything other than paper.) Inflation, a virulent form of instability, terrified investors, who duly stayed on the sidelines.It may seem strange to be drawing parallels to the ’70s now — prices are so stable that the fear is of deflation. Yet there is no mistaking the ’70s-ish gloom that has overtaken Wall Street. The trauma of the financial crisis has yet to be dispelled. It is not just Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns that have disappeared but an ethos of confidence in long-term investing.Though stocks remain well above 2009 lows, investors are withdrawing money from U.S. equity funds for the third straight year. Dispiritingly, investors are shunning attractively priced stocks in favor of bonds (both government and corporate) on which the returns are anemic.The current crisis was inspired by financial shocks rather than commodity disruptions. But the result is a familiar malaise. The international monetary system, hobbled by imbalances and deficits, seems broken. Another echo is the sense that the sheer number of economic problems precludes a solution to any one of them. In 1979, an investment analyst was heard to despair, “The future is clouded by many ugly questions.” Today analysts despair over high unemployment, failing mortgages, government deficits, impotent political responses, a weakening economy and a similar litany abroad. In another echo, Chicken Little has staged a comeback. In the early ’80s, an energy consultant forecast — in this magazine — a “high probability” of an oil shock in which “the basic legitimacy of our political system might be called into question.” Today’s version is hyping the possibility of a stock-market crash. Albert Edwards, an investment strategist for the French bank Société Générale, has said he expects a “bloody, deep recession” that produces a stock-market collapse of at least 60 percent. He recently drew a crowd of 600.Of course, any such forecast could prove right. But it is generally more lucrative to sell prophecies of doom than to act on them. What the herd tends to overlook is that stocks are not — except perhaps in the very short term — a bet on the odds of an apocalypse, nor are investors in securities rewarded for their prowess as macroeconomists. The real challenge of investing is so prosaic it is often forgot. Stocks are simply a claim on future corporate earnings: if you can buy those claims at a discount, you should do well.'"
"'10-08-29,'0','THE mention of Japanese whiskey was once most likely to recall Bill Murray’s Suntory Time ad campaign in “Lost in Translation.” But over the last decade, the drink’s reputation has experienced a meteoric rise. Any lingering doubts were put to rest in 2008 when Nikka’s Yoichi Single Malt 1987 and Suntory’s Hibiki 30 Years Old won the World’s Best Single Malt and World’s Best Blended categories, respectively, at the prestigious World Whiskey Awards. Since then, Japanese offerings have continued to earn accolades annually, often with prices to match.Yet while one might assume Tokyo to be rife with specialist bars offering domestic drams, the whiskey enthusiast still has to look hard to find such spots. An exception is Shot Bar Zoetrope (third floor, Gaia Building No. 4, 7-10-14 Nishi Shinjuku; 81-3-3363-0162; homepage2.nifty.com/zoetrope), perhaps the only bar within Tokyo’s 23 wards dedicated to exploring the output of Japan’s distilleries.Opened in 2006 by Atushi Horigami, a cinephile who screens silent movies on the back wall, Zoetrope offers a bewildering array of local libations, many of which are particular to this cozy space. A good place to start is with a taste of Yoichi Single Malt 1988 (3,000 yen, or about $36 at 84 yen to the dollar) — the recommended replacement for the award-winning (and sold-out) 1987 bottling.Perhaps more exclusive (and available) is a snifter of Ichiro’s Malt Shot Bar Zoetrope 3rd Anniversary Single Malt (1,300 yen). Bottled in limited quantity (263 bottles) by the independent producer Ichiro’s Malt, it has a softer soul than the Yoichi ’88, a warmth that rolls up the tongue before disappearing into the ether.In the basement of Nikka Whiskey’s headquarters in the fashionable Aoyama neighborhood is the unassuming Nikka Blender’s Bar (5-4-31 Minami Aoyama, Minato; 81-3-3498-3338). The bar offers only Nikka whiskeys, but visitors are encouraged to try their hand at creating a blend based on a combination of five single malts and one grain whiskey. This blending set (3,000 yen) includes six small glasses on a wooden tray, each with paired descriptions like “sherry and sweet,” “peaty and salty” and “woody and mellow.” Should one find his personal creation lacking finesse, the bar also offers house blends based on the six options at hand.Located in Ginza, Hibiya Bar Whiskey-S (Kaneko Building, 3-3-9 Ginza, Chuo-ku; 81-3-5159 8008) serves whiskeys selected exclusively from Suntory’s distilleries. Hibiya also affords an opportunity to invent one’s own blend, but here the process feels like more of a science experiment, complete with small test tubes and titration devices (1,800 yen). Limited bottlings are also available month to month — for example Hakushu Single Malt, aged in sherry casks (1,096 yen per glass).'"

"'10-08-30,'0','This Op-Ed was originally published on September 19, 1993The final foundation for the monumental Mideast peace agreement was laid last month in Oslo, when Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel shook hands with Ahmed Suleiman Khoury, a high official of the Palestine Liberation Organization. As the two men discussed a ""Gaza-Jericho"" peace plan, the ghost of Mr. Peres's mentor, David Ben-Gurion, was surely present, the familiar leathery lion's face aglow.In 1933, the future founder of Israel shook hands in Jerusalem with another Palestinian leader, Musa Alami, a relative of Haj Amin el-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who was terrorizing the Jewish community. They also sat down to discuss peace.Ben-Gurion dreamed of a special kind of peace -- one that would realize the vision of ""universal messianic redemption."" God, he could not forget, told Moses that the Hebrews must become ""am segulah,"" a unique nation of truth, justice and compassion. An exemplary Jewish state would synthesize the ethical teachings of the prophets and the discoveries of modern science, and this synthesis would be passed on to all peoples. Israel would thus become, as Isaiah prophesied, a ""light unto the nations.""This vision reinforced Ben-Gurion's determination to end the decades-old bloody struggle for Palestine. Over tea, the Zionist leader made a novel proposal to Alami. When the British mandate ended, a Jewish state would be formed and would join a regional Arab federation. It was an idea that is being revived today, in modified form, with the Palestinians talking of confederation with Jordan, and Israel likely to be linked economically with such an entity in a kind of Benelux arrangement.""This came as a bombshell to the Mufti,"" Ben-Gurion later said. ""He had not imagined that there were Jews who sincerely wished an understanding and an agreement with the Arabs."" The Mufti heard the plan with great interest, and apparently approved of it.The Zionist leader was stunned and elated. He still had to win the support of the Syrian leaders, however, and they disdainfully rejected the idea. Ben-Gurion was bitterly disappointed, but he could never have imagined that the failure of this last-stage peace move would assure 60 more years of bloodshed.In 1948, when the British pulled out of Palestine, Ben-Gurion established a state and became its first Prime Minister, but there would be no peace. Yet he never abandoned his dream. In 1970, three years before he died, he wrote to his secret lifelong sweetheart, Rachel Beit-Halachmi:""There is hope, dear Rachel, that peace is approaching, not quickly, but slowly, slowly, and . . . it appears to me that by the end of this century, the prophecy of Isaiah will be fulfilled.""Thanks in great measure to his disciple, Foreign Minister Peres, Ben-Gurion may prove to be as prophetic as Isaiah.'"

Azarenka, 21, possesses a backhand that rivals Williams’s, and last month, she won the Open series event at Stanford, Calif., by beating Maria Sharapova in an awesome display of power tennis. Look for Azarenka to attack her opponents’ second serves and dictate play whenever possible. She has the weapons and the mentality to go deep into the second week.A qualifier at Wimbledon, Kanepi upset the French Open finalist Samantha Stosur in the first round and had a match point against Petra Kvitova before losing in the quarterfinals. With a huge serve and heavy ground strokes, Kanepi, 25, can beat anyone if she can dictate points early. The 31st seed at the Open, Kanepi could face fourth-seeded Jelena Jankovic in the third round. The two met in the second round at Roland Garros, and Jankovic won in three close sets. On the faster surface at Flushing Meadows, Kanepi’s attack could overwhelm Jankovic.Vandeweghe, 18, has long been acclaimed as a future great in American tennis, but her ball-striking ability has not translated into many wins. A few months ago, she began working with Tom Gullickson, and she has climbed 200 spots in the rankings. Vandeweghe has huge shoulder turn and hip rotation on her serve, which makes it hard to read, and Gullickson has taught her to hit her spots on the serve and to play patterns off the first ball. She has become much better at coming forward and finishing points. She plays similar to Lindsay Davenport at this age.'"
"'10-08-30,'0','Every year or two, Fish, 28, will make a sensational run, then fall back to the tennis equivalent of the peloton. The rap against Fish was that he lacked the work ethic to reach the top. But after knee surgery last September, he embarked on a diet and conditioning program that made him stronger, faster and more agile. Seeded 19th, Fish can play serve and volley, can change pace, has height and spin on his ground strokes, and can defend to extend points. Add in his superb serve, and Fish is a real threat, a fit player with weapons, surging confidence and a crowd-pleasing persona.Nalbandian returned to the tour after hip surgery and relatively quickly earned the 31st seed. His comeback was accelerated by his surprising title in Washington this month. Ranked outside the top 100 at the time, Nalbandian marched through the draw, defeating another player mounting a comeback, Marcos Baghdatis. At his best, Nalbandian is capable of sublime play, with impressive wins over Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in his career, and a Wimbledon runner-up finish in 2002. At 28, Nalbandian seems to be playing with a renewed sense of urgency.Querrey, seeded 20th, looks loose, relaxed and ready for the rigors of a grueling Grand Slam. Under the expert guidance of the coach David Nainken (who is also behind Mardy Fish’s resurgence), Querrey has climbed the ATP rankings, to No. 22. His results this year have been solid, with titles won on clay, grass and hardcourts. He beat Andy Murray in the final in Los Angeles last month. Querrey, 22, has built his ranking and tour reputation slowly, and he may be ready to make a statement at this year’s Open.'"
"'10-08-30,'0','He started like a house on fire, the first player to score in his first four league matches for the club, but then came injuries and doubts about whether a tall, gangly but extraordinarily dexterous big man fit in with Barcelona’s sharp and paced rhythm.This summer, Barcelona purchased the Spanish striker David Villa, and it knew he would fit in because Villa is one of seven players on Spain’s World Cup-winning side who now play for the club.After failing to repatriate an eighth Spaniard, Cesc Fàbregas of Arsenal, Barcelona pried the Argentine midfielder Javier Mascherano away from Liverpool. Mascherano, known as El Jefecito — the Little Chief — for the way he organizes and protects the midfield, is another nomad. And like Ibrahimovic a year ago, he says he has found his El Dorado at Barcelona.His final act as a Liverpool employee was effectively to go on strike last week, when he refused to play in a game against Manchester City. He was under contract, but he withheld his labor.Contracts in soccer these days are nothing more than negotiating ploys. When Roy Hodgson, Liverpool’s new manager, rebuked Mascherano as being selfish, he conveniently overlooked that he had also been under contract when he quit Fulham to join Liverpool a few weeks ago.Within hours of losing Mascherano, Liverpool reinvested some of the $25 million it got for him. The Portuguese player Raúl Meireles agreed to a four-year contract, saying, “I am Meireles and not Mascherano, and that will be clear to the fans.”The fans have no choice. They are mostly born to their team, and the only way their loyalty changes is when a new player arrives, promising to wear the team’s shirt with pride.In the modern game, the players and their persuasive agents can often, but not always, make a fortune by moving around.Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes have managed perfectly well to become multimillionaires without ever leaving their boyhood club, Manchester United.They are exceptions in an era which has reversed the power structure in the sport.There was a time when players were tied to a maximum salary and prevented from moving from the team that first registered them — unless that team decided to get rid of them.Now we have, in Ibrahimovic, a wanderer who has played it both ways. The move last summer was his choice; this summer, he had no choice.Ibrahimovic told the Catalan news media last week that when Real Madrid acquired one of his former coaches, José Mourinho, the club hired one of the best coaches in the world.“Mourinho is an expert at taking teams to the top,” he said. “But we are the best team in the world.”The next day, the “we” was no longer inclusive.Once more, his transfer is highly irregular. Barcelona arranged a deal with A.C. Milan in which the Italian team will take Ibrahimovic on loan for one year, with an option to buy him after that.A.C. Milan shares San Siro stadium with its bitter rival Inter Milan, whose fans deified Ibrahimovic until last season. He sees no problem with changing sides.“Inter won everything without me,” he said. “With me, we did well, we won something. Now I’m a Milan player.”As to the sweet sorrow of his departure from Barcelona, he said, “It’s the end Guardiola wanted,” referring to the Barcelona coach, Pep Guardiola.“Guardiola is the philosopher who has shattered my dream to play with Barcelona,” Ibrahimovic said. “Speak to him, he’s the one who has a problem. In football, everything can change in 24 hours.”'"

"'10-08-30,'0','TOKYO — Japan’s central bank announced new measures to combat a faltering economy and rising yen on Monday, but held off from bolder steps, while the government said it would unveil a fresh stimulus plan.Separately, Prime Minister Naoto Kan suggested that the government would outline a new stimulus plan later in the day to shore up the country’s economy. Analysts expected the scale of any new spending to be modest, constrained by already colossal levels of Japan’s public debt.Anticipation of the moves sent Japan’s Nikkei index rising more than 3 percent, but after the monetary easing was announced, stocks started surrendering some of those gains, with the index up less than 2 percent by midday.The global economic crisis led export-reliant Japan to its worst recession in decades, and the country’s recovery since then has looked increasingly shaky. Figures released this month showed that Japan’s economy grew just 0.1 percent in the April-June quarter.A jump in the value of the yen to 15-year highs has hampered the country’s exporters, who are responsible for much of Japan’s economic growth, by making their products less competitive.'"

"'10-08-30,'0','Intel was near a deal late on Sunday to acquire the wireless chip unit of Infineon Technologies, whose products are used in the Apple iPhone and other smartphones, for more than $1 billion, people involved in the negotiations said.The effort is the second major takeover Intel has pursued this month; it announced a deal to acquire McAfee for $7.68 billion two weeks ago.The deal could be announced as soon as Monday, people involved in the negotiations said, though they cautioned that it was possible that the talks could be delayed or collapse entirely. These people were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the talks. Intel and Infineon officials could not be immediately reached for comment.For Intel, the deal would give it a powerful foothold in the market for smartphone chips, a segment of the business that is experiencing double-digit annual growth. Infineon’s wireless chip unit reported $1.2 billion in revenue last year. Its sales in the third quarter jumped 38 percent.Intel’s own efforts to build a wireless chip business through its Atom processors have faltered, analysts say. Intel has deals with LG and Nokia to provide wireless chips. Intel’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, has been seeking ways to get into this market and diversify the company beyond PC chips.Infineon, based in Neubiberg, Germany, said this month that it was seeking “a potential transaction” for the wireless chip unit.Intel has also faced antitrust scrutiny in its primary chip business.

"'10-08-30,'0','Dangers do not directly increase with greater depth, according to experts like Mr. Chow. But they do rise as exploration and production rigs become more complex and more remote.Perdido, for example, is more than a 20-hour supply boat journey from shore — far enough out that a major fire could burn out of control before assistance arrived. Hurricanes regularly batter the region with giant waves and winds exceeding 100 miles an hour. Underwater, both powerful currents and mudslides play havoc with delicate equipment and the pipelines that bring oil and gas back to shore.The water temperature, which hovers at just above freezing at depths below 3,000 feet, can harden natural gas into crystallike structures called hydrates that can clog pipelines and other equipment. And because the wells are deeper than human divers can go, oil companies must rely on remote-controlled submarines to maintain their equipment or perform repairs.Oil industry officials, while acknowledging the risks, say safety concerns are overblown.Chris Smith, a senior manager at Royal Dutch Shell in charge of running Perdido’s production, said that projects like Perdido were engineered with multiple safety barriers and redundant systems.“We’ve proven over the years, and the decades, that if the reserves justify it, we will find a way to do it,” Mr. Smith said. “The trick is how to do it safely.”Perdido, which means “lost” in Spanish, is at the cutting edge. The deepest offshore platform in the world, it is intended to pump oil from 35 wells over the next two decades.Like dozens of other deepwater facilities that have sprung up in the gulf in recent years with names like Blind Faith, Mad Dog and Atlantis, Perdido uses the latest technology to tap offshore oil fields that were previously inaccessible.In contrast to the Deepwater Horizon, a floating rig that was focused on drilling new wells, the Perdido platform is a vast hub that can drill and pump oil from wells across 30 miles of ocean floor. Below it is a subsea cityscape of pumps, pipes, valves, manifolds, wellheads and blowout preventers — all painted a bright yellow so as to be visible to the floodlights of the remote-controlled submarines that maintain it.Shell, in reducing the weight of the platform, which can produce up to 130,000 barrels of oil a day, is among the first companies to use a new technique: instead of pumping the drilled liquid to the platform and separating the oil, gas and water there, as is typically done, engineers installed new separation equipment directly on the sea floor. While that improves efficiency, the equipment is also more difficult to monitor and fix than if it were on the platform.Thomas M. Leschine, a marine expert at the University of Washington, Seattle, said oil companies and regulators have become complacent about the growing risks of offshore drilling because accidents are so rare.“It’s clearly in the interest of the industry to believe their activities are safe,” said Mr. Leschine, who testified before Congress about safety issues in June.Engineering innovations during the 1990s, like better seismic imaging technology, greatly pushed the boundaries of deepwater production — traditionally defined as deeper than 1,000 feet of water.More than 20 percent of all bids in the gulf last year were for leases in water deeper than 6,500 feet. The deepest well in production in the gulf — Perdido’s Tobago well — lies in 9,600 feet of water. Meanwhile, new ships that can drill in 12,000 feet of water have recently arrived in the gulf.Problems are more common than the industry likes to admit.For example, BP’s Thunder Horse platform, the company’s flagship project in the gulf, ran into one unexpected engineering problem after another before it even began production in 2008. Examples included a backward valve that nearly flooded the facility and faulty welding on subsea equipment that left pipes with dangerous cracks. Repairs delayed the project by three years.Hurricanes are a constant menace. Hundreds of offshore platforms and pipelines were destroyed by hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005, shutting down the gulf’s entire oil and gas production for weeks. A Shell platform called Mars was badly damaged when its drilling rig tumbled over in Hurricane Katrina, shattering equipment, living quarters and the steel pipes that girdle all facilities. The two pipelines that take Mars’s oil and natural gas to shore were also badly damaged.“The industry has entered a new domain of vastly increased complexity and increased risks,” said Robert Bea, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who compared the drive into ever-deeper waters to deep space exploration, both in its rewards and its risks. “Going to the moon is hazardous. Going to Mars is even more hazardous.”Since the 1980s, the industry’s drive offshore has been encouraged by presidents and lawmakers of both parties who were seeking to expand domestic sources of energy and reap royalties from oil leases.After the BP accident, the Obama administration imposed a six-month ban on deepwater drilling, and it is now considering how to allow operations to resume while improving safety.The administration is also reorganizing the agency that oversees deepwater drilling, which was renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. The agency’s new director, Michael R. Bromwich, is currently hosting forums with energy experts to examine “the different challenges” of offshore drilling, said a spokesman, Nicholas Pardi.But after years of lax oversight, critics say regulators must take a much closer look at the industry’s activities offshore. For instance, they say, the government must increase the number of platform inspections and carefully vet emergency response plans.“There was an overreliance on the industry’s representation that they could drill ultra-deep and ultra-safe,” said Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment. “The era of assuming an accident couldn’t happen is over.”Oil companies insist that offshore drilling is often safer than land-based drilling because the investments involved are far larger and the safety procedures far more rigorous. They say that they have drilled more than 4,000 wells in the gulf’s deep waters, including 700 in waters deeper than 5,000 feet. Before the BP accident, just 1,800 barrels of oil were spilled in blowouts from 1979 to 2009, according to the Interior Department.Company executives have repeatedly cautioned against government overreaction to the BP spill, which they say resulted from a doomsday situation unlikely to repeat itself.“The industry approach is that we always focus on prevention,” said Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil.However, during Congressional hearings in June, the industry’s titans acknowledged their inability to contain a deepwater spill and vowed to create a new response system.Under a $1 billion initiative announced in July, four oil majors — Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Shell — said they would design and build equipment that could be used to contain and cap well blowouts at depths of up to 10,000 feet. However, they say the new devices will not be tested and ready for 18 months, and the plan is not likely to work in places outside the gulf, like Alaska, where conditions differ.Some experts worry that everyone is focusing too much on the causes of the recent crisis, not the next one. After the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, the industry concentrated on preventing another tanker spill. That plan was essentially useless in the BP accident.“This is symptomatic of fighting the last war,” said Mr. Chow. “The industry is going to have to examine all of the offshore risks. There is a lot of catching up to do.”'"
"'10-08-30,'0','President Obama said on Sunday that he was not worried that increasing and significant numbers of Americans believe he is Muslim.“I can’t spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead,” Mr. Obama said in an interview with Brian Williams on “NBC Nightly News.” “The facts are the facts. And so it’s not something that I spend all my time worrying about. And I don’t think the American people want me to spend all my time worrying about it.”Mr. Obama, who is Christian, said that as a candidate, and now as president, he has repeatedly dealt with persistent rumors about his religion and with doubts about whether he was born in the United States. A recent poll showed that nearly a fifth of the respondents believed he was Muslim.The poll, conducted by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center and its affiliated Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, found that 18 percent of the people surveyed thought Mr. Obama was Muslim, according to a report by The Associated Press.A similar poll in March 2009 found that 11 percent of those surveyed thought the president was Muslim. The portion of the 3,003 people surveyed in the most recent poll who correctly said Mr. Obama was Christian was 34 percent, down from 48 percent last March, The A.P. reported.Mr. Obama attributed the spread of the rumors about his religion and birthplace to “a network of misinformation that in a new media era can get churned out there constantly.”“We dealt with it when we were first running for the presidency,” he said. “There were those who said I couldn’t win as U.S. senator because I had a funny name and people would be too unfamiliar with it.'"
"'10-08-30,'0','The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission was set up after the Jan. 12 earthquake as a joint Haitian-international effort to effectively channel billions of dollars of donated reconstruction aid.Like everything else about the recovery effort, the commission, led by Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and former President Bill Clinton, has been too slow off the mark. But we were encouraged by its second meeting in Port-au-Prince this month, where it announced dozens of new projects with clear benchmarks and the commitment of more than $1 billion to complete them.The commission finally has its executive director, a Haitian, Gabriel Verret, a former economic adviser to President René Préval. About 30 crucial staff positions are still unfilled, a troubling sign. Without a full, permanent staff, the commission will surely have a harder time showing results and pressing donors to meet pledges.The goals outlined at the meeting include clearing a million cubic meters of rubble in Port-au-Prince and building enough short-term hurricane shelters for 400,000 to 500,000 people — both by November. The longer-term plans include a two-year, $4.3 billion reinvention of Haiti’s public school system, a $200 million program for agricultural development, and a $15 million, 320-bed teaching hospital in Mirebalais, in central Haiti.The hospital is a project of Partners in Health, an exemplary nongovernmental organization whose founder, Paul Farmer, has spoken forcefully about the need to break bad old habits of international aid, which in half a century has never reached the goal of creating a functioning country run by Haitians for Haitians. At a Capitol Hill hearing in July, he noted that only 3 percent of earthquake aid had gone to the Haitian government.The low figure is understandable, since the government was weak to begin with and devastated by the quake. Dr. Farmer’s larger point is valid. Rebuilding Haiti requires building a functioning, responsive Haitian state. A hospital that teaches a new generation of Haitian doctors and nurses, meeting an aching need for medical care while spurring the home-grown economy, is a fine example of how to do that.Commission members and supporters insist that by the standards of international bureaucracies, they are moving quickly and efficiently. Perhaps. But Haiti’s urgent and unmet needs are staggering.'"
"'10-08-30,'0','The revolution was a long time coming. Jimmy Van Alen, who founded the International Tennis Hall of Fame, loathed 16-14 or 24-22 sets and strived for years to speed up matches. He persuaded lesser tournaments to try table tennis scoring in the 1950s, then experimented with rudimentary tie breakers in the 1960s.In 1970, the United States Open agreed to use his latest variation, created with the referee Mike Blanchard and the historian Frank Phelps: a tie breaker in which the first player to 5 points won, with a maximum of nine points played. That arrangement was later deemed unworkable, and in 1975 the Open started using the current first-to-7 (but win-by-two) tie breaker.Jay Snyder, who is the United States Open tournament director and was an umpire in 1970, said the tennis establishment was timid about introducing it.Many players were horrified. “The Australian players asked me to give a petition to U.S. Open tournament director Bill Talbert,” the tennis journalist Bud Collins said. “Talbert laughed and said: ‘Of course they’ll be nervous, but the fans will love it. Did you ever know a player who bought a ticket?’ ”Snyder called the introduction of the tie breaker a cultural shock. He recalled that the new system was so revolutionary that at the United States Pro Indoor Tournament in Philadelphia, where two matches were played side by side, if one went to a tie breaker, the other would halt play while everyone focused on the tie breaker.In the early days, fans, players and umpires were often uncertain about the rules. During the 1976 United States Open final between Jimmy Connors and Bjorn Borg, shortly after the switch to win-by-two tie breakers, the players forgot to switch sides at 9-9, said Steve Tignor, the executive editor of Tennis Magazine and Tennis.com. “A ball boy had to remind the umpire,” he said.That Connors-Borg confrontation demonstrated the system’s appeal. That Open was on clay, Borg’s favorite surface, and he and Connors split the first two sets. In the third-set tie breaker, Borg earned four set points, but Connors never relented and won, 11-9.“That burst Borg’s bubble — he said it was why he lost the fourth set,” Tignor said. He called the showdown “18-16 before there was an 18-16,” a reference to tennis’s most celebrated tie breaker — the fourth set of the 1980 Wimbledon final, when Borg and John McEnroe battled for 34 points. McEnroe won the tie breaker but lost the match.“The tie breaker brought more than just the actual playing of tennis,” Connors said. “You had to figure something else out. And one shot could cost you a lot or one shot could win you a lot.”Snyder credited the tie breaker, which came near the birth of the Open era, with playing an important role in helping the sport grow.Austin, who became the first player to win the Open in a final-set tie breaker when she defeated Martina Navratilova, 1-6, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (1), in 1981, agreed.“The twists and turns, when players can both have set points, makes for better stories,” she said.While the other Grand Slam tournaments gradually followed the United States Open’s lead and adopted tie breakers, the United States Open is the only one that allows tie breakers in the final set. That difference was highlighted this year at Wimbledon, where John Isner won a 70-68 marathon fifth set against Nicolas Mahut.Connors said that elongated, even draining fifth sets might happen more today because of the size of the players and their overpowering serves. “If that became the norm, they might have to do something different,” he said.'"
"'10-08-30,'0','Linebacker Calvin Pace, who led the Jets with eight sacks last season, will miss at least the regular-season opener against the Baltimore Ravens on Sept. 13 with a broken right foot.Pace injured his foot Friday against Washington. On a conference call Sunday, he said he would have surgery Monday in Charlotte, N.C. Pace is expected to miss four to six weeks, but he and the Jets will know more after the surgery is completed.“I definitely will miss the first game,” Pace said. “That’s safe to say. Beyond that, I don’t really have an idea.”The Jets ranked first in the N.F.L. in defense last season. Pace missed the first four games after the league suspended him for violating its policy on performance-enhancing substances.This year, Coach Rex Ryan has insisted that the defensive domination would continue. That said, the Jets have numerous moving pieces. Their All-Pro cornerback, Darrelle Revis, has held out throughout training camp in a contract dispute. Pace is hurt. They also added cornerback Antonio Cromartie, safety Brodney Pool and the pass-rush specialist Jason Taylor this off-season, and drafted cornerback Kyle Wilson in the first round.

"'10-08-30,'0','The observation by one of the academics quoted in your article that evaluating originality and intellectual significance can be done only by those who are expert in a field argues that credentialed experts are nurturers of originality. The history of the arts and sciences shows otherwise.Half a millennium ago “learned” people in Rome did everything they could to stifle the paradigm-shifting originality of Galileo and Copernicus. Eighteenth-century literary “experts,” including Alexander Pope, “revised and corrected” Shakespeare’s plays to purge them of impurities. Upon hearing about innovations in quantum physics in the 1920s, Einstein reportedly exclaimed that he would “rather be a cobbler” than consider these ideas.The innovations in peer review this article describes ought to be embraced because they take into account how blind faith in expertise has let the so-called experts’ exclusionary fears of originality slow the progress of learning.The writer is a professor of English and American studies at Muhlenberg College.As if the academic arena were not watered down enough, professors are now seeking to use the Internet to dilute the collegiate system even more.Peer-reviewed journals garner the awe and respect that they do because of the talent, hard work and research it takes to get published. To open up the review process to a broad range of panelists via the Internet would tarnish the honor one receives from being in such a publication.Sloppiness and fraud are certainly occasional problems of the traditional peer review system. In the last two years, I notified a journal editor that an early online publication was identical to an article the author had published elsewhere, and I published an article showing that a conclusion in a peer-reviewed paper was completely specious. The reviewers had not caught either of these problems.But I hope that editors moving to open review have put in a little time writing for Wikipedia and are aware of the possible damaging effect of highly motivated, unsupervised reviewers with time on their hands.I would suggest two alternatives to the present proposal. The first is early-online publication with a pause for responses before “real” publication. The second is a policy requiring that online reviewers identify themselves in some reliable way, with protections against the “sock puppets” (people who create false online identities) who create such trouble for Wikipedia.The writer is professor emerita of psychology at Richard Stockton College.As an author, reviewer and technology enthusiast, I was intrigued by the challenges and possibilities of changing the way manuscripts are reviewed. But it is important to remember that the review process is more than just evaluation. It often offers the authors feedback from reviewers that is very helpful in improving the original writing.Thus, it would be important to consider the qualifications of Web-based reviewers, potential misuses of the open process, and issues of integrity and collegiality in critiquing articles.The writer is a professor at the Adelphi University School of Social Work.I wonder if the shifting of “up or down” judgment of one’s academic work from a few peers to a wider variety of opinions on the Web may also be the case in the contemporary theater, where a few reviewers in print no longer determine the future of a play or a musical.A.

"'10-08-30,'0','Nova’s emergence has coincided with an investigation by Major League Baseball into whether he and Wilkin de la Rosa, a Class AA left-hander, had injected each other with shots of vitamin B12. The inquiry was started after an agent who had worked with Nova or de la Rosa tipped off M.L.B. in the last two weeks, according to people in baseball familiar with the situation.High-ranking officials within baseball were not even aware of the investigation until a report surfaced in Saturday’s editions of The New York Post. It is unclear whether this violates M.L.B.’s performance-enhancing drug program, but the department of investigations wants to confirm that Nova and de la Rosa were injecting B12 and not a banned substance.Shots of B12 are popular among Latin players — Nova and de la Rosa hail from the Dominican Republic — who often believe that the shots give them energy. In recent years, baseball officials have tried to educate players about the dangers of B12 shots, telling them that B12 alone provides little benefit and that the shots are often contaminated with performance-enhancing drugs. Nova declined to comment about the investigation for a second straight day Sunday, but there was plenty else for him to discuss.The Yankees were impressed with Nova’s composure Monday in Toronto, where he escaped bases-loaded, no-out trouble in the first inning. As that game wore on, the depth and break on his curveball improved, and on Sunday, Girardi said: “I thought he just picked up right away from the first inning on. He had that curveball. It made a difference.”He used it to strike out the No. 2 hitter, Omar Vizquel, in the first, and Mark Teahen leading off the third, and continued to mix it in with a fastball that regularly reached 96 and 97 miles per hour. Nova did not allow a runner to reach second base until two outs in the fifth, when Gordon Beckham doubled off the left-field fence and scored on a single by Juan Pierre. But Nova pitched out of that jam, then watched unfazed as his bullpen assured a split of a trip that started out 1-3.Cervelli mentioned Nova’s poise, and the confidence he showed in pitching aggressively in a hitter-friendly ballpark. Asked where his calmness comes from, Nova shrugged.“I mean, I was pitching pretty good at Triple-A,” Nova said. “Like I said, it’s the same baseball.”Only now, he is pitching pretty good in the majors, and that is where he will stay.Everything went well in a 35-pitch bullpen session for Andy Pettitte, who increased the intensity toward the end without any discomfort in his groin muscle. With another bullpen session scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, Pettitte said the earliest he could return would be in two weeks. Pettitte, who has scaled back his running to reduce the risk of aggravating his injury, is concerned about his stamina. But Joe Girardi said the paucity of minor league games remaining made it more likely that Pettitte would build up his volume at the major league level. ... Mark Teixeira was held out of Sunday’s game because of continued pain in what he called a bone bruise in his right thumb. He said he hoped to play on Monday against Oakland.'"
"'10-08-30,'0','The distinction may matter more today than it once did. China surpassed to become the world’s second-largest economy this year, and its state-directed development model is enormously appealing to poor countries. Even in the West, many admire China’s ability to build a first-world infrastructure and transform its cities into showpieces.Once eager to learn from the , China’s leaders during the financial crisis have reaffirmed their faith in their own more statist approach to economic management, in which private capitalism plays only a supporting role.“The socialist system’s advantages,” Prime Minister said in a March address, “enable us to make decisions efficiently, organize effectively and concentrate resources to accomplish large undertakings.”The issue of state versus private control is a slippery one in China. After decades of economic reform, many big state-owned companies face real competition and are expected to operate profitably. The biggest private companies often get their financing from state , coordinate their investments with the government and seat their chief executives on government advisory panels.Chinese leaders also no longer publicly emphasize sharp ideological distinctions about ownership. But they never relaxed state control over some sectors considered strategically vital, including finance, defense, energy, telecommunications, railways and ports.Mr. Wen and President are also seen as less attuned to the interests of foreign investors and China’s own private sector than the earlier generation of leaders who pioneered economic reforms. They prefer to enhance the clout and economic reach of state-backed companies at the top of the pecking order.“China’s always had a major industrial policy. But for a space of a few years, it looked like China was turning away from an active and interventionist industrial policy in favor of a more hands-off approach,” Victor Shih, a political scientist, said in a recent telephone interview.Mr. Shih, among others, now believes that the 1980s reforms that unleashed China’s private sector and the 1990s reforms that dismantled great sections of the state-run sector are being partly undone.“The problem is that the reforms of the first 20 years, from 1978 to the end of the ’90s, actually did not touch on the power of the government,” said Yao Yang, a Peking University professor who heads the China Center for Economic Research. “So after the other reforms were finished, you actually find the government is expanding, because there is no check and balance on its power.”There are no comprehensive statistics to catalog the government’s influence over the economy. So the shift is partly inferred from coarse measures like the share of financing in the economy provided by state banks, which rose sharply during the financial crisis, or the list of the 100 largest publicly listed Chinese companies, all but one of which are majority state owned.The statistic showing an uptick in the share of industrial production attributable to the state sector is regarded by some analysts as a blip rather than the start of a trend. The ’s senior economist in , Louis Kuijs, said the state sector’s unusually rapid growth will most likely moderate with the ending of the government’s stimulus spending.“As the growth process normalizes again, the traditional trend toward a declining SOE share will take over again,” he wrote in an e-mail message, using the shorthand for state-owned enterprise. “I don’t think that the senior leaders had a strategy of reversing this trend.”But others argue that officials had always intended to create a vibrant state sector that would tower above the private sector in important industries, even as they sold off or shut down money-losing state enterprises that drained capital from the government budget and banking system.Recent alarm over the expanding role of the state, said Arthur Kroeber of Dragonomics, an economic forecasting firm based in Beijing, is mostly “perception catching up with reality.”In some ways, the differences in this debate are small. Everyone agrees that China runs a bifurcated economy: at one level, a robust and competitive private sector dominates industries like factory-assembled exports, clothing and food. And at higher levels like finance, communications, transportation, mining and metals — the so-called commanding heights — the central government claims majority ownership and a measure of management control.Yet the two camps’ view of China’s future are markedly different. Those who see little evidence of an expanding state sector generally believe that China has a decade or more of robust growth awaiting it before its economy matures. Theirs is a Goldilocks view of state intervention — not too much or too little, but just enough to push a developing economy toward prosperity.The skeptics have a darker view: they believe distortions and waste, in no small part due to government meddling, have resulted in gross misallocation of capital and will end up pushing growth rates down well before 2020. What drives their pessimism, the skeptics say, is that China, like Japan a generation ago, has too much confidence in a top-down economic strategy that defies conventional Western theory.The skeptics also point to what they say is the growing political and financial influence of China’s state-owned giants — 129 huge conglomerates that answer directly to the central government, and thousands of smaller ones run by the provinces and cities.While no public breakdown exists, most experts say the vast bulk of the 4 trillion renminbi ($588 billion) that China pumped out for new highways, railroads and other big projects went to state-owned companies. Some of the largest companies used the flood of money to strengthen their dominance in their current markets or to enter new ones.In the last year or so, many of the 129 central government companies have moved forcefully into China’s real-estate industry, with hundreds of billions of dollars in construction projects and land deals. State-owned steel giants have cut deals to buy out more profitable and often more efficient private competitors. A host of government conglomerates have snapped up coal mining companies in Shanxi Province.“In 2009, there was a huge expansion of the government role in the corporate sector,” Huang Yasheng, a leading analyst of China-style capitalism at the , said in a telephone interview. “They’re producing yogurt. They’re into real estate. Some of the upstream state-owned enterprises are now expanding downstream, organizing themselves as vertical units. They’re just operating on a much larger scale.”At the local level, governments set up 8,000 state-owned investment companies in 2009 alone to channel government dollars into business and industrial ventures, Mr. Huang said. One example suffices: a private Chinese automaker, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, made worldwide headlines in March when it agreed to buy Sweden’s Volvo marque from Ford. Much of the $1.5 billion purchase price came not from Geely’s relatively modest profits, but from local governments in northeast China and the area.Geely reciprocated this month, announcing that it will build its Volvo headquarters and an assembly plant in a Shanghai industrial district.The reasons for the state’s push for greater involvement in business vary. State control of energy supplies is crucial to China’s growth, and the Shanxi coal takeovers will increase production, guarantee fuel to some state-owned utilities and give Beijing new power to control coal prices. State mining companies also argue that they have a superior safety record to their accident-prone private competitors.But in other areas the state looks more mercenary.Take telecommunications. Upon joining the , China committed itself to opening its communications market to foreign joint ventures for local and international phone service, e-mail, paging and other businesses. But after eight years, no licenses have been granted — largely, the United States says, because capital requirements, regulatory hurdles and other barriers have made such ventures impractical. Today, basic telecommunications in China are booming, and are virtually 100 percent state-controlled.Take the passenger airline industry. Six years ago, the central government invited private investors to enter the business. By 2006, eight private carriers had sprung up to challenge the three state-controlled majors, Air China, China Southern and China Eastern.The state airlines immediately began a price war. The state-owned monopoly that provided jet fuel refused to service private carriers on the same generous terms given the big three. China’s only computerized reservation system — currently one-third owned by the three state airlines — refused to book flights for private competitors. And when mismanagement and the 2008 economic crisis drove the three majors into financial straits, the central government bought stock to bail them out: about $1 billion for China Eastern; $430 million for China Southern; $220 million for Air China.One private passenger carrier that remains is Airlines, a tenacious startup run by a founder so frugal that he shares a 100-square-foot office with his chief executive and takes the subway to business meetings.That founder, Wang Zhenghua, survived in part by building his own computer reservation system. He canceled a planned interview. But in Chinese news reports, he was caustic about the state subsidies given his competitors. “Now with the injection of 10 billion yuan” for China Eastern and China Southern, “everything is in chaos,” he told Biz Review, a Chinese magazine.China’s private entrepreneurs have a catchphrase for such maneuvers: “guo jin, min tui,” or “the state advances, the private sector retreats.”State-owned enterprises in China have taken the best of the economy for themselves, “leaving the private sector drinking the soup while the state enterprises are eating the meat,” Cai Hua, the vice director of a chamber-of-commerce-style organization in Zhejiang Province, said in an interview.Mr. Cai says he believes that China needs government-run industries to compete globally and manage the country’s domestic development. But locally, he said, their advantages — being first in line for financing by state banks, first in line for state bailouts when they get in trouble, first in line for the stimulus gusher — have created a “profound inequality” with private competitors.Some analysts argue that the state-owned conglomerates, built with state money and favors into global competitors, have now become political power centers in their own right, able to fend off even Beijing’s efforts to rein them in.Of the 129 major state enterprises, more than half the chairmen and chairwomen and more than one-third of the chief executive officers were appointed by the central organization department of the Communist Party. A score or more serve on the party’s Central Committee, which elects the ruling Politburo. They control not just the lifeblood of China’s economy, but a corporate patronage system that dispenses top-paying executive jobs to relatives of the party’s leading lights.China’s leaders have sought occasionally in the past year to curb speculative excesses by state-controlled businesses in real estate, lending and other areas. In May the State Council, a top-level policy body sometimes likened to the cabinet in the United States, issued orders to give private companies a better shot at government contracts — for roads and bridges, finance and even military work — that now go almost exclusively to state-owned companies. Virtually the same rules were issued five years ago, to little effect.Yet it is hard to argue with success, other economists say, and China’s success speaks well of its top-down strategy. Asian powerhouses like and Japan built their modern economies with strong state help. Many economists agree that shrewd state management can be better than market forces in getting a developing nation on its feet.Experts on both sides of the debate have but two questions. One is how much longer state control of vast areas of the economy will generate that growth.The other is whether, should that strategy stop working, China will be able to change it.'"
"'10-08-30,'0','The permanent amphitheater in Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem is a void right now. It’s being rebuilt, band shell and seating. So the Harlem part of the two-day Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, on Saturday afternoon, was moved to a rented stage on a lawn at the northeast corner of the park, next to the farmer’s market, which was still open when the first band started. Later on, a boisterous African drum circle took shape not 100 feet from the stage while McCoy Tyner, though unhappy with the piano’s tuning, boistered back through a solo set.The free festival has corporate sponsorship but soul prestige; for a City Parks Foundation gig, it books competitively. In the Harlem lineup was Revive Da Live, the changeable collective of young musicians combining jazz and hip-hop; the tenor saxophonist J. D. Allen’s trio; the pianist Jason Moran with his trio, Bandwagon; and Mr. Tyner, one of jazz’s bishops since his time with John Coltrane’s quartet in the early 1960s. (Part 2 of the festival took place Sunday at Tompkins Square Park in the East Village.)It was a really, really good scene, despite the direct sun pouring down on the audience and the stage. This is where some of the best dreams and desires for jazz in America, neither commercial nor bohemian, come out in a burst: jazz is a cause to defend, a collective memory, a spiritual thing, a Harlem thing. Politicians knew enough to be there: Representative Charles B. Rangel, State Senator Bill Perkins. So did lots of musicians, checking out their friends. Older men and women with hats and picnic baskets, returnees every year, all looking as if they owned their patch of park, asking who brought the corkscrew and what’s the name of that song. A festival operative standing in front of the stage, hollering praise during the music like a running commentary.Mr. Tyner, now 71, wasn’t doing that much with the idea of a solo-piano concert; if there had been a band behind him, it might have sounded much the same. Still making his left-hand chords boom like kettle drums, he played some of his own songs, Coltrane’s “Mr. P.C.,” and a rubato “I Should Care,” weighed down with ornament. He kept his foot on the sustain pedal for almost the entire 40 minutes; nearly the only exceptions came when he stole away from the song to splash the keyboard abstractly. It was a strange set, monolithic but distracted. He ended by apologizing for the weather’s impact on the piano, as yet another politician escorted him offstage: his younger brother, Jarvis Tyner, executive vice chairman of the Communist Party USA.Revive Da Live, an octet with a rapper and D.J., Raydar Ellis, brought arrangements of Parker tunes and solos. The modern frames were cool sometimes, but it was individual performances, especially from Marc Cary on electric piano and Marcus Strickland on tenor saxophone, that put it over. And Jason Moran’s Bandwagon played a loose and typically meta-historical set that went heavy on sound samples and recontextualized quotations. The band played hard over recordings of Eddie Jefferson’s vocalese version of “Body and Soul” and Billie Holiday’s “Big Stuff.”'"
"'10-08-30,'0','SEOUL — Prime Minister-designate Kim Tae-ho of South Korea resigned on Sunday amid allegations that he lied about his connections with a businessman convicted of bribery.Two other allies of President Lee Myung-bak, who were appointed as culture minister and minister of knowledge economy in a government reshuffle on Aug. 8, also stepped down on Sunday. During their parliamentary confirmation hearings earlier this month, opposition lawmakers assailed them with allegations of unethical behavior.The three nominees’ resignations cast doubt on President Lee’s ability to vet the background of his political allies.

"'10-08-31,'1','Cablevision deftly joined a Kansas-based cooperative of cable operators apparently to become party to its longstanding Tennis Channel contract. The cooperative’s deal ends next year.Comcast is the second object of Solomon’s disappointment. Comcast carries the Tennis Channel through an existing contract almost entirely on its digital sports tier. Solomon says that such treatment, compared with Comcast’s broad digital carriage of its own sports networks, the Golf Channel and Versus, is discriminatory. He is waiting for the Federal Communications Commission to rule on a complaint that his network filed in January.Solomon has a similar argument to make about Cablevision. He says that the broad carriage Cablevision affords MSG Varsity, its year-old local high school network, on its local cable systems — while the Tennis Channel stays on a sports tier — is a case of favoring a property it owns over one it does not.But even as he evangelizes about the vast improvement in the quality of his channel, Solomon appears to be a victim of bad deals signed by his predecessors. Still, it is reasonable to ask: if Comcast owned the Tennis Channel, would it make it broadly available on its systems or make customers pay extra for it on a sports tier?Finally, there is Time Warner Cable, which also keeps the Tennis Channel on a digital sports tier.It is clearly favoring some fans over others by offering a free preview of the channel to its subscribers in Los Angeles but not to those in New York, the United States Open’s backyard. The Tennis Channel’s universe of subscribers more than doubles to 55 million during the free previews it offers during Grand Slam tournaments.Maureen Huff, a Time Warner spokeswoman, refused to discuss the company’s geographic rationale other than to say that individual systems decide whether to carry a preview. She suggested that “customers who want to see Tennis Channel coverage can subscribe to our sports tier.” For $3.95.The Tennis Channel’s obstacles to being carried more extensively feed the notion that tennis fans do not get the same respect TV gives to other sports. NBC’s record of tape-delay antics at the French Open and Wimbledon should make any sensate person question the network’s commitment to tennis.Viewers do not usually care much about the details of squabbles between cable operators and networks until they are denied what they want to see. When Comcast or Cablevision says it is abiding by contracts that let it carry the Tennis Channel as it pleases, fans feel the programs they want are being held hostage.Undoubtedly, rabid football fans feel that way about being unable to watch the NFL Network.The pairing of ESPN2 and the Tennis Channel as the cable partners of the Open (replacing the USA Network after 2008) raised expectations of even more tennis being available to watch. And the more that is offered, the more fans crave. They want instant gratification, and they have a right to expect it.Just ask Olympic fans upset by events tape-delayed to protect NBC’s prime-time broadcasts. Online Olympic streaming by NBC provides a vast new video outlet for fans, but it also created a new platform for anti-NBC venting when it delayed most of its streams during the Winter Games in Vancouver to help its prime-time ratings.So it is not surprising when people ask, “Why can’t I watch the Tennis Channel?” or “Why won’t Time Warner carry the NFL Network?”'"
"'10-08-31,'1','In 1949, Dr. Bigeleisen published a follow-up paper that described the effects of isotopes in speeding up or slowing down chemical reactions. Chemists now take advantage of this phenomenon by replacing atoms in molecules they are studying with heavier or lighter isotopes. From the changes in reaction rates, they can better understand the reaction process and identify the intermediate configurations the chemicals take on before the reaction is completed.“It all goes back to Jake’s stuff,” said Nathan Lewis, a professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology. “It’s textbook things that are used all the time now.”Jacob Bigeleisen was born in Paterson, N.J., on May 2, 1919. When he graduated from high school in 1935, at the peak of the Great Depression, his father wanted him to learn a trade. His mother insisted that he go to college.A friend of his suggested that he study chemistry.“His brother-in-law owned a small dye house,” Dr. Bigeleisen recalled in a talk in 1989. “Paterson was a textile town, and there were dye houses there. He told me that each dye house had a chemist and thus there might be some opportunities.”He attended University College of New York University in the Bronx, graduating in 1939. “I found that there was a whole world that I never knew about, the excitement of doing research and discovering new knowledge,” Dr. Bigeleisen said in his 1989 talk. “I never did look for a job in a dye house.”He obtained a master’s degree at Washington State University in 1941 and finished his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1943, and then went to Columbia to work on the chemical separation of uranium.After the end of World War II, he held research positions at Ohio State University and the University of Chicago before joining Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island in 1948.He moved to the chemistry department at the University of Rochester in 1968 and to the State University at Stony Brook in 1978.Dr. Bigeleisen was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.In addition to his son Ira, Dr. Bigeleisen is survived by his wife of 65 years, Grace; two other sons, David, of San Francisco, and Paul, of Rochester; a sister, Shirley Gans of West Palm Beach, Fla.; and six grandchildren.Isotopes were not the only field that caught Dr. Bigeleisen’s interest. When Brookhaven built a chemistry building in the 1960s, Dr. Bigeleisen, as chairman of the building committee, worked with the architect on designing an efficient laboratory, including the seating arrangement in the auditorium.'"
"'10-08-31,'1',', which is based in , has curtailed its relationships with some producers of palm oil, which is often linked to deforestation in developing countries. The Dutch lender Rabobank has applied a nine-point checklist of conditions for would-be oil and gas borrowers that includes commitments to improve environmental performance and protect water quality.In some cases, the changing policies represent an attempt to burnish green credentials in areas where the banks had little interest, and there is no indication that companies engaged in the objectionable practices cannot find financing elsewhere.Still, banking analysts and others suggest that heated debate over , water quality and other environmental considerations is forcing lenders to take a much harder — and often uncomfortable — look at where they extend , and to whom.“It’s one thing if your potential borrower is dumping cyanide in a river,” said Karina Litvack, the head of governance and sustainable with F& Investments, an investment management firm based in London. “But if they’re dumping carbon dioxide into the air, which is not exactly illegal — what do you do? Banks are in kind of a quandary, because they are competing for business, and if they get holier-than-thou and start to play policeman, they risk allowing other banks to take that business.”Environmental risk has been on the radar for lenders since the 1980s and early 1990s, when courts began forcing some measure of responsibility on banks for the polluting factories, sites and other environmental problems that had, to one degree or another, been facilitated by their financing.Congress passed a law in 1996 that limited the exposure of lenders on this front, but since then, most major banks have developed environmental risk management divisions as part of their commercial banking due diligence efforts.Now, the rise of murkier issues like global warming, along with increasing scrutiny by environmental groups of banks’ investments in many other industries — like oil and gas development, nuclear power, coal-fired electricity generation, , fuel pipeline construction, dam building, forestry and even certain types of agriculture — are nudging lenders into new territory.“We’re taking a much closer look at a much broader variety of issues, not all of which are captured under state and local laws,” said Stephanie Rico, a spokeswoman for the environmental affairs group at Wells Fargo.Ms. Litvack, of F&C Investments, pointed to large protests last week by many climate activists outside the in . At least a dozen protesters have been arrested in demonstrations against the bank’s financing of oil sands development in .The , meanwhile, responding to intense pressure from environmental advocates denouncing the bank’s financing of oil sands projects, hosted 18 international banks in in February for “a day of learning” on the “regulatory, social and environmental issues” surrounding the oil sands.Globally, banks and environmental advocates are seeking to make things easier by developing best practices and other voluntary standards. , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley helped initiate the Carbon Principles, which aim to standardize the assessment of “carbon risks in the financing of electric power projects” in the . Several international financial institutions — including HSBC, Munich Re and others — have formed the Climate Principles, which aim to encourage the management of climate change “across the full range of financial products and services,” according to the compact’s Web site.In the United States, mountaintop removal mining has become both increasingly common and contentious, as coal companies vie to feed the nation’s appetite for inexpensive electricity. An expeditious and disruptive form of surface mining, it involves blasting off the tops of mountains and dumping the debris in valleys and streams below.A report published in May by the and the Rainforest Action Network estimated that nine banks were the primary lenders for companies engaged in mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia, and that they had provided nearly $4 billion in loans and bond underwriting to those companies — chiefly , Patriot Coal, and — since 2008.The Rainforest Action Network, which has headed a campaign to highlight financial institutions with connections to the mining, said this month that the policy shifts were chipping away at the financing.Citing Bloomberg data, for example, the group noted that Bank of America — listed as recently as 2008 as one of the “syndication agents” on a $175 million revolving line of credit to Massey Energy — has eliminated that and all other connections to the company. The group also pointed to JPMorgan, which had previously underwritten $180 million in debt securities to Massey, but no longer has any financial ties to that company. In May, the bank said it would be subjecting all future engagements with companies involved in mountaintop removal mining to “enhanced review.”Some environmental groups have criticized that and other policies as providing too much wiggle room — and whether any of it has any real impact is an open question. Mining industry representatives say such policies often fail to consider laws already in place requiring coal companies to limit their environmental impact, and to restore former mine sites when they are finished.Carol Raulston, a spokeswoman for the National Mining Association, an industry group, said that most of the policies in question position the banks to phase out lending over time — and only to companies that primarily engage in mountaintop removal mining. “Companies are still getting financing for their projects,” she said.Roger S. Hendriksen, the vice president for investor relations for Massey Energy, suggested that environmentalists were overstating things, and that his company was having no trouble securing financing.“While some banks no longer provide financing for companies conducting surface mining, there are many who will,” Mr. Hendriksen said. “We have and will continue to replace their services with alternate bank providers with little difficulty.”But Rebecca Tarbotton, the executive director of the Rainforest Action Network, said in a published statement that the banks’ moves nonetheless send “a clear signal that these companies have a high risk profile and that other banks should beware.”“Bottom line,” she added, “as access to capital becomes more constrained it will be harder for mining companies to finance the blowing up of America’s mountains.”'"
"'10-08-31,'1','The backup quarterback Jim Sorgi will probably miss the Giants’ preseason finale against the New England Patriots, and that could put his job in jeopardy.Sorgi’s injured right shoulder has improved only slightly over the past two weeks, and he says he has no idea when he will return to practice.“I don’t want to speculate on how long it’s going to be,” Sorgi said. “I’m trying to take it one day at a time, and I’m happy the team has been this patient with me. Hopefully, they can be a little bit more patient and wait until I get better.”Sorgi tore a muscle in his shoulder two weeks ago against the Jets. The injury prevents him from throwing, a major concern because the Giants need to reach the 53-man roster limit by Saturday.Sorgi was signed in the offseason to back up Eli Manning. He spent the previous six seasons in Indianapolis backing up Manning’s brother, Peyton.'"
"'10-08-31,'1','Obama administration officials have argued that Mr. Awlaki, now believed to be an operative of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen branch of the terrorist network, has essentially joined the enemy in a time of war. The government does not need a court’s permission to kill an enemy soldier, the officials say.But some legal experts and human rights activists have noted that the law requires the government to get a court warrant to eavesdrop on Mr. Awlaki or other American citizens. An order to kill him should require at least the same degree of review, the activists say, to meet the Fifth Amendment’s requirement of “due process” before depriving an American of life or liberty.“The United States cannot simply execute people, including its own citizens, anywhere in the world based on its own say-so,” said Vince Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights.The lawsuit acknowledges that singling out someone for killing can be lawful “as a last resort to protect against concrete, specific and imminent threats of death or serious physical injury.” But terrorism suspects designated secretly by the government and left on the target list for months or years do not qualify as such an urgent threat, the lawsuit says.A Justice Department spokesman, Matthew A. Miller, would not comment on the lawsuit. But he noted that Congress authorized the use of force against Al Qaeda after the 2001 terrorist attacks and that international law recognized a right of self-defense.Anwar al-Awlaki was born in 1971 in New Mexico, where his father was a graduate student, and moved with his family to Yemen at the age of 7. He returned to the United States to attend Colorado State University and later served as an imam in three American mosques before moving to London and back to Yemen in 2004.His publicly expressed views have grown steadily more militant, and his prolific writings and recordings have been cited as an important influence on suspects in more than a dozen terrorism cases in the United States, Canada and Britain.The Obama administration has pursued terrorism suspects using missiles fired from drones in Pakistan and from ships and jets in Yemen. Such strikes have killed hundreds of people, but the effort to capture or kill Mr. Awlaki has drawn particular attention because of his citizenship and prominence as a cleric.In July, the Treasury Department designated Mr. Awlaki as a terrorist, meaning that providing him legal or other services could be a crime. The A.C.L.U. and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed suit earlier this month challenging the Treasury regulations, but the department issued a license to the two groups permitting them to take legal action on Mr. Awlaki’s behalf. The lawsuit challenging the Treasury regulations is still pending.William C. Banks, an expert on national security law at Syracuse University, said the lawsuit filed Monday faced numerous, probably insurmountable, legal obstacles. He said Nasser al-Awlaki might have difficulty showing that he had been injured by the actions taken against his son or overcoming the secrecy that protected counterterrorism programs.Even if the elder Mr. Awlaki does have legal standing to sue, the government can cite the Congressional authorization of 2001 to justify its actions, Mr. Banks said. “The arguments in this lawsuit are creative,” he said, “but I think it’s unlikely to succeed.”'"
"'10-08-31,'1','The 3M Company agreed to buy Cogent, a manufacturer of fingerprint identification systems for governments and companies, for $943 million to expand its security services products.The offer is for $10.50 a share, 3M said Monday in a statement, or 18 percent more than Cogent’s closing price on Friday. The price includes about $513 million in acquired cash.Cogent makes fingerprint and palm print identification systems that allow customers to electronically capture print images, encode prints into files and compare a set of fingerprints and palm prints to a database containing potentially millions of prints.With Cogent, 3M is tapping into the $4 billion global biometric market that it said was projected to grow more than 20 percent annually. 3M, a maker of IDs and laminates to protect against tampering, will add Cogent, which had $130 million in revenue last year, to its security systems division.“It does fit their long-term strategy of enhancing their product lines by looking at emerging growth areas, security being one of those,” said Jeff Windau, an analyst in St. Louis with Edward Jones.Shares of Cogent rose $2.18, or 24 percent, to close at $11.09 on Monday. 3M, the maker of Post-it Notes and Scotch tape, fell $1.35, to $79.65.3M, based in St. Paul, said the acquisition would reduce earnings by 9 to 10 cents a share in the year after the transaction. Excluding items like the anticipated integration expenses, the deal will add as much as 2 cents a share over the same period, 3M said.'"
"'10-08-31,'1','“Let me in, and I might go higher.” That, in a nutshell, is the message Chris Viehbacher, the chief executive of Sanofi-Aventis, is sending the management of the biotech company Genzyme in making public his $18.5 billion offer to buy it.The all-cash structure is intended to show that Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceutical group, is serious. But the low-ball $69-a-share offer has not moved Genzyme’s board, and Mr. Viehbacher must hope that changes because, for now, his threat of a hostile bid looks hollow.One of Sanofi’s problems is that the price is hardly going to bowl over Genzyme’s shareholders. Despite amounting to about a 30 percent premium over the price of the stock before takeover rumors started flying more than a month ago, Sanofi’s offer values Genzyme at about four times sales. Biotech companies usually go for five or six times.Sanofi’s other challenge is that without cooperation from Genzyme, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., its shareholders will know that any sweetening of an offer under current terms would have to be limited. To warrant a robust increase in price, the Paris-based group would need to have a good look at its target’s books and operations to help assess the extent of the industrial problems that have caused Genzyme to operate under the close monitoring of the Food and Drug Administration.So while Mr. Viehbacher’s move may look like a step toward hostility, Sanofi would do better to avoid taking that road. Rather, it may be betting that in lifting the veil on its offer, some Genzyme shareholders will press the board to talk in the hope that a significantly higher price would be forthcoming for a friendly deal.'"

BBC News reported that at least 8,000 people were evacuated from the museum on Saturday afternoon during what was described as a “gas incident.” A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police of London told The Daily Telegraph that visitors had “reported a funny smell on the premises and had mild irritation to the throat and eyes.” A museum spokeswoman told the BBC that firefighters had come to the scene and searched the building but “could not find anything.” A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade told the BBC that the museum had been checked for four hours but that nothing had been detected. He added, “People may well have smelled something, but it dispersed before we got there.” No injuries were reported, and the museum reopened on Sunday.'"
"'10-08-31,'1','Less than two weeks after saying it would buy McAfee, Intel announced Monday that it would acquire the wireless business of the German chip maker Infineon for about $1.4 billion in cash.Paul S. Otellini, the head of Intel, said that more and more devices were connecting to the Internet and that wireless connectivity was a sector where the company saw “growth potential.”The Infineon unit makes chips used in laptops, netbooks and smartphones, including the Apple iPhone, and will strengthen Intel’s lineup of 3G, 4G, Wimax and Wi-Fi cards.Intel expects the deal to close in the first quarter of next year, pending regulatory approvals.Bernd Laux, a research analyst with Cheuvreux in Frankfurt, said the price tag was “fair,” and called the deal “smart and well-timed,” but predicted “the equity market will give Infineon only very brief credit for the disposal.”Shares of Infineon fell 20 cents to close at 4.45 euros ($5.63) in trading in Frankfurt. Shares of Intel fell 41 cents, or 2.23 percent, to close at $17.96.The deal would give Intel a powerful foothold in the market for smartphone chips, a segment of the business that is experiencing strong growth. Smartphone sales worldwide in the second quarter of 2010 rose 50.5 percent from the same period in 2009, according to the research firm Gartner.'"
"'10-08-31,'1','The world’s victory over smallpox has had an unfortunate consequence: monkeypox cases are surging in tropical Africa.The disease is related to smallpox, though usually less serious, although in rare cases, it too can kill, blind or scar victims. Also, it is much less likely to jump between people, though new evidence from Africa suggests human-to-human transmission is more common than was previously thought.In a study published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, the Kinshasa School of Public Health and elsewhere, who surveyed nine rural Congo health districts, concluded that monkeypox was 20 times as common there as it was 30 years ago, when smallpox vaccination was discontinued.The typical victim was a boy aged 10 to 14; boys in villages hunt monkeys and rodents, many of which can carry the pox.Smallpox vaccine is 80 percent effective at preventing monkeypox, so in the 1970s, health authorities debated continuing to use it in some jungle areas. But the vaccine has its own risks, so they did not.In 2003, more than 90 Americans caught monkeypox from pet prairie dogs, who got it from Gambian pouched rats imported by a pet store. No one died, but the government banned imports of African rodents.'"
"'10-08-31,'1','But Oudin, unseeded again this year, hardly looked like a demoralized 18-year-old against Savchuk, even if the catchword on her sneakers is now “Courage” instead of last year’s “Believe,” a choice that might make it seem as if she were bracing to absorb a blow rather than relive a joy ride.“Not that I’m like sick of believe or anything — and people tell me that all the time — but I wanted something different,” she said. “I think courage was really, really good for this year, especially because of how well I did last year. I think that you need to have courage in order to believe in yourself.”She certainly gathered strength and precision on Monday, struggling to strike the ball cleanly and throw herself into her shots in the early going before reeling off nine straight games to win, 6-3, 6-0. In the second set, she won the first 16 points and ended up losing only 2 in the set.“The main thing I’m trying to get her to do is to play for herself and not for what other people think or say,” her coach, Brian de Villiers, said. “I still don’t like her reading the press or blogs or any of that. People can be brutal out there.”The hurdles will become higher in a hurry, however, beginning with her second-round match against Alona Bondarenko, the 29th seed. But Monday’s victory was a reassuring start in a reassuring place, which is hardly the way every stop on the tour has felt in 2010.“It’s like you hear them say stuff,” she said of the crowds. “And it’s not like, ‘All right, like, come on; you’re so close, like, you can do it.’ It’s more like, ‘Melanie! Come on. What are you doing?’ I hear that, like, kind of a lot. It’s just really different from like last year when everyone was so pumped for me.”The only woman who generated more enthusiasm at last year’s Open was Kim Clijsters, and with Oudin safely in the tunnel after her victory, in strolled Clijsters, last year’s champion and inspiration to multitasking mothers worldwide. Clijsters’s match, against the 104th-ranked Greta Arn of Hungary, turned into a mirror image of Oudin’s as she started strong and then developed rhythm issues. But she still prevailed, 6-0, 7-5, in her return to Ashe after rallying from a 0-4 deficit in the second set.With Williams out after having surgery for cuts on her foot — which Clijsters confirmed that she saw during their exhibition match in Belgium in July — there will be no rematch in New York.“I saw the injury,” Clijsters said. “It’s not something that she’s making up or that it’s a small cut or anything.”Clijsters has had foot problems of her own this year, withdrawing from the French Open because of an injury. She lost in a hurry to Nadia Petrova in the third round at the Australian Open and was beaten by Vera Zvonareva in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. This represents her last chance to do something transcendent in a Grand Slam event, and Clijsters is well aware that such opportunities are precious considering that she is already expressing interest in having a second child.“I’ve never been more disappointed after a loss than that match against Zvonareva,” she said. “So of course in my situation, now because I don’t play that full schedule, I really want to do well in those bigger tournaments.”Those with a chance to still do well after this sun-drenched Monday include Andy Roddick, who made quick work of Stéphane Robert to win, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, and Gaël Monfils, who beat the American qualifier Robert Kendrick in five sets. Robin Soderling also needed five sets — and almost four hours — to defeat a qualifier, Andreas Haider-Maurer.The French Open champion Francesca Schiavone, the French Open finalist Samantha Stosur and Victoria Azarenka advanced, unlike Dinara Safina, who in another flashback to last year lost in the same place — Louis Armstrong Stadium — where she was beaten in the third round by Petra Kvitova in 2009.That was a major upset, with Safina ranked No. 1. But after a year of back issues and other problems, the tall and often overwrought Safina arrived here unseeded. And though the quality of the exchanges was often high, it was no upset that Daniela Hantuchova won, 6-3, 6-4.'"
